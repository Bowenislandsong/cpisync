You might as well expect to find a decayed cheese without mites,or an old house without rats, as an antique and dilapidated town withoutan authentic population of goblins. Now, although this class ofinhabitants are in nowise amenable to the police authorities, yet, astheir demeanor directly affects the comforts of her Majesty's subjects, Icannot but regard it as a grave omission that the public have hithertobeen left without any statistical returns of their numbers, activity,etc., etc. And I am persuaded that a Commission to inquire into andreport upon the numerical strength, habits, haunts, etc., etc., ofsupernatural agents resident in Ireland, would be a great deal moreinnocent and entertaining than half the Commissions for which the countrypays, and at least as instructive. This I say, more from a sense of duty,and to deliver my mind of a grave truth, than with any hope of seeing thesuggestion adopted. But, I am sure, my readers will deplore with me thatthe comprehensive powers of belief, and apparently illimitable leisure,possessed by parliamentary commissions of inquiry, should never have beenapplied to the subject I have named, and that the collection of thatspecies of information should be confided to the gratuitous and desultorylabours of individuals, who, like myself, have other occupations toattend to. This, however, by the way.Among the village outposts of Dublin, Chapelizod once held aconsiderable, if not a foremost rank. Without mentioning its connexionwith the history of the great Kilmainham Preceptory of the Knights of St.John, it will be enough to remind the reader of its ancient andcelebrated Castle, not one vestige of which now remains, and of the factthat it was for, we believe, some centuries, the summer residence of theViceroys of Ireland. The circumstance of its being up, we believe, to theperiod at which that corps was disbanded, the headquarters of the RoyalIrish Artillery, gave it also a consequence of an humbler, but not lesssubstantial kind. With these advantages in its favour, it is notwonderful that the town exhibited at one time an air of substantial andsemi-aristocratic prosperity unknown to Irish villages in modern times.A broad street, with a well-paved footpath, and houses as lofty as wereat that time to be found in the fashionable streets of Dublin; a goodlystone-fronted barrack; an ancient church, vaulted beneath, and with atower clothed from its summit to its base with the richest ivy; an humbleRoman Catholic chapel; a steep bridge spanning the Liffey, and a greatold mill at the near end of it, were the principal features of the town.These, or at least most of them, remain still, but the greater part in avery changed and forlorn condition. Some of them indeed are superseded,though not obliterated by modern erections, such as the bridge, thechapel, and the church in part; the rest forsaken by the order whooriginally raised them, and delivered up to poverty, and in some cases toabsolute decay.The village lies in the lap of the rich and wooded valley of the Liffey,and is overlooked by the high grounds of the beautiful Phoenix Park onthe one side, and by the ridge of the Palmerstown hills on the other. Itssituation, therefore, is eminently picturesque; and factory-fronts andchimneys notwithstanding, it has, I think, even in its decay, a sort ofmelancholy picturesqueness of its own. Be that as it may, I mean torelate two or three stories of that sort which may be read with very goodeffect by a blazing fire on a shrewd winter's night, and are all directlyconnected with the altered and somewhat melancholy little town I havenamed. The first I shall relate concernsThe Village BullyAbout thirty years ago there lived in the town of Chapelizod anill-conditioned fellow of herculean strength, well known throughout theneighbourhood by the title of Bully Larkin. In addition to his remarkablephysical superiority, this fellow had acquired a degree of skill as apugilist which alone would have made him formidable. As it was, he wasthe autocrat of the village, and carried not the sceptre in vain.Conscious of his superiority, and perfectly secure of impunity, he lordedit over his fellows in a spirit of cowardly and brutal insolence, whichmade him hated even more profoundly than he was feared.Upon more than one occasion he had deliberately forced quarrels upon menwhom he had singled out for the exhibition of his savage prowess; and inevery encounter his over-matched antagonist had received an amount of"punishment" which edified and appalled the spectators, and in someinstances left ineffaceable scars and lasting injuries after it.Bully Larkin's pluck had never been fairly tried. For, owing to hisprodigious superiority in weight, strength, and skill, his victories hadalways been certain and easy; and in proportion to the facility withwhich he uniformly smashed an antagonist, his pugnacity and insolencewere inflamed. He thus became an odious nuisance in the neighbourhood,and the terror of every mother who had a son, and of every wife who had ahusband who possessed a spirit to resent insult, or the smallestconfidence in his own pugilistic capabilities.Now it happened that there was a young fellow named Ned Moran--betterknown by the soubriquet of "Long Ned," from his slender, lathyproportions--at that time living in the town. He was, in truth, a merelad, nineteen years of age, and fully twelve years younger than thestalwart bully. This, however, as the reader will see, secured for him noexemption from the dastardly provocations of the ill-conditionedpugilist. Long Ned, in an evil hour, had thrown eyes of affection upon acertain buxom damsel, who, notwithstanding Bully Larkin's amorousrivalry, inclined to reciprocate them.I need not say how easily the spark of jealousy, once kindled, is blowninto a flame, and how naturally, in a coarse and ungoverned nature, itexplodes in acts of violence and outrage."The bully" watched his opportunity, and contrived to provoke Ned Moran,while drinking in a public-house with a party of friends, into analtercation, in the course of which he failed not to put such insultsupon his rival as manhood could not tolerate. Long Ned, though a simple,good-natured sort of fellow, was by no means deficient in spirit, andretorted in a tone of defiance which edified the more timid, and gave hisopponent the opportunity he secretly coveted.Bully Larkin challenged the heroic youth, whose pretty face he hadprivately consigned to the mangling and bloody discipline he was himselfso capable of administering. The quarrel, which he had himself contrivedto get up, to a certain degree covered the ill blood and malignantpremeditation which inspired his proceedings, and Long Ned, being full ofgenerous ire and whiskey punch, accepted the gauge of battle on theinstant. The whole party, accompanied by a mob of idle men and boys, andin short by all who could snatch a moment from the calls of business,proceeded in slow procession through the old gate into the Phoenix Park,and mounting the hill overlooking the town, selected near its summit alevel spot on which to decide the quarrel.The combatants stripped, and a child might have seen in the contrastpresented by the slight, lank form and limbs of the lad, and the muscularand massive build of his veteran antagonist, how desperate was the chanceof poor Ned Moran."Seconds" and "bottle-holders"--selected of course for their love of thegame--were appointed, and "the fight" commenced.I will not shock my readers with a description of the cool-bloodedbutchery that followed. The result of the combat was what anybody mighthave predicted. At the eleventh round, poor Ned refused to "give in"; thebrawny pugilist, unhurt, in good wind, and pale with concentrated and asyet unslaked revenge, had the gratification of seeing his opponent seatedupon his second's knee, unable to hold up his head, his left armdisabled; his face a bloody, swollen, and shapeless mass; his breastscarred and bloody, and his whole body panting and quivering with rageand exhaustion."Give in, Ned, my boy," cried more than one of the bystanders."Never, never," shrieked he, with a voice hoarse and choking.Time being "up," his second placed him on his feet again. Blinded withhis own blood, panting and staggering, he presented but a helpless markfor the blows of his stalwart opponent. It was plain that a touch wouldhave been sufficient to throw him to the earth. But Larkin had no notionof letting him off so easily. He closed with him without striking a blow(the effect of which, prematurely dealt, would have been to bring him atonce to the ground, and so put an end to the combat), and getting hisbattered and almost senseless head under his arm, fast in that peculiar"fix" known to the fancy pleasantly by the name of "chancery," he heldhim firmly, while with monotonous and brutal strokes he beat his fist, asit seemed, almost into his face. A cry of "shame" broke from the crowd,for it was plain that the beaten man was now insensible, and supportedonly by the herculean arm of the bully. The round and the fight ended byhis hurling him upon the ground, falling upon him at the same time withhis knee upon his chest.The bully rose, wiping the perspiration from his white face with hisblood-stained hands, but Ned lay stretched and motionless upon the grass.It was impossible to get him upon his legs for another round. So he wascarried down, just as he was, to the pond which then lay close to the oldPark gate, and his head and body were washed beside it. Contrary to thebelief of all he was not dead. He was carried home, and after some monthsto a certain extent recovered. But he never held up his head again, andbefore the year was over he had died of consumption. Nobody could doubthow the disease had been induced, but there was no actual proof toconnect the cause and effect, and the ruffian Larkin escaped thevengeance of the law. A strange retribution, however, awaited him.After the death of Long Ned, he became less quarrelsome than before, butmore sullen and reserved. Some said "he took it to heart," and others,that his conscience was not at ease about it. Be this as it may, however,his health did not suffer by reason of his presumed agitations, nor washis worldly prosperity marred by the blasting curses with which poorMoran's enraged mother pursued him; on the contrary he had rather risenin the world, and obtained regular and well-remunerated employment fromthe Chief Secretary's gardener, at the other side of the Park. He stilllived in Chapelizod, whither, on the close of his day's work, he used toreturn across the Fifteen Acres.It was about three years after the catastrophe we have mentioned, andlate in the autumn, when, one night, contrary to his habit, he did notappear at the house where he lodged, neither had he been seen anywhere,during the evening, in the village. His hours of return had been so veryregular, that his absence excited considerable surprise, though, ofcourse, no actual alarm; and, at the usual hour, the house was closed forthe night, and the absent lodger consigned to the mercy of the elements,and the care of his presiding star. Early in the morning, however, he wasfound lying in a state of utter helplessness upon the slope immediatelyoverlooking the Chapelizod gate. He had been smitten with a paralyticstroke: his right side was dead; and it was many weeks before he hadrecovered his speech sufficiently to make himself at all understood.He then made the following relation:--He had been detained, it appeared,later than usual, and darkness had closed before he commenced hishomeward walk across the Park. It was a moonlit night, but masses ofragged clouds were slowly drifting across the heavens. He had notencountered a human figure, and no sounds but the softened rush of thewind sweeping through bushes and hollows met his ear. These wild andmonotonous sounds, and the utter solitude which surrounded him, did not,however, excite any of those uneasy sensations which are ascribed tosuperstition, although he said he did feel depressed, or, in his ownphraseology, "lonesome." Just as he crossed the brow of the hill whichshelters the town of Chapelizod, the moon shone out for some momentswith unclouded lustre, and his eye, which happened to wander by theshadowy enclosures which lay at the foot of the slope, was arrested bythe sight of a human figure climbing, with all the haste of one pursued,over the churchyard wall, and running up the steep ascent directlytowards him. Stories of "resurrectionists" crossed his recollection, ashe observed this suspicious-looking figure. But he began, momentarily,to be aware with a sort of fearful instinct which he could not explain,that the running figure was directing his steps, with a sinisterpurpose, towards himself.The form was that of a man with a loose coat about him, which, as he ran,he disengaged, and as well as Larkin could see, for the moon was againwading in clouds, threw from him. The figure thus advanced until withinsome two score yards of him, it arrested its speed, and approached with aloose, swaggering gait. The moon again shone out bright and clear, and,gracious God! what was the spectacle before him? He saw as distinctly asif he had been presented there in the flesh, Ned Moran, himself, strippednaked from the waist upward, as if for pugilistic combat, and drawingtowards him in silence. Larkin would have shouted, prayed, cursed, fledacross the Park, but he was absolutely powerless; the apparition stoppedwithin a few steps, and leered on him with a ghastly mimicry of thedefiant stare with which pugilists strive to cow one another beforecombat. For a time, which he could not so much as conjecture, he was heldin the fascination of that unearthly gaze, and at last the thing,whatever it was, on a sudden swaggered close up to him with extendedpalms. With an impulse of horror, Larkin put out his hand to keep thefigure off, and their palms touched--at least, so he believed--for athrill of unspeakable agony, running through his arm, pervaded his entireframe, and he fell senseless to the earth.Though Larkin lived for many years after, his punishment was terrible. Hewas incurably maimed; and being unable to work, he was forced, forexistence, to beg alms of those who had once feared and flattered him. Hesuffered, too, increasingly, under his own horrible interpretation of thepreternatural encounter which was the beginning of all his miseries. Itwas vain to endeavour to shake his faith in the reality of theapparition, and equally vain, as some compassionately did, to try topersuade him that the greeting with which his vision closed was intended,while inflicting a temporary trial, to signify a compensatingreconciliation."No, no," he used to say, "all won't do. I know the meaning of it wellenough; it is a challenge to meet him in the other world--in Hell, whereI am going--that's what it means, and nothing else."And so, miserable and refusing comfort, he lived on for some years, andthen died, and was buried in the same narrow churchyard which containsthe remains of his victim.I need hardly say, how absolute was the faith of the honest inhabitants,at the time when I heard the story, in the reality of the preternaturalsummons which, through the portals of terror, sickness, and misery, hadsummoned Bully Larkin to his long, last home, and that, too, upon thevery ground on which he had signalised the guiltiest triumph of hisviolent and vindictive career.I recollect another story of the preternatural sort, which made no smallsensation, some five-and-thirty years ago, among the good gossips of thetown; and, with your leave, courteous reader, I shall relate it.The Sexton's AdventureThose who remember Chapelizod a quarter of a century ago, or more, maypossibly recollect the parish sexton. Bob Martin was held much in awe bytruant boys who sauntered into the churchyard on Sundays, to read thetombstones, or play leap frog over them, or climb the ivy in search ofbats or sparrows' nests, or peep into the mysterious aperture under theeastern window, which opened a dim perspective of descending stepslosing themselves among profounder darkness, where lidless coffins gapedhorribly among tattered velvet, bones, and dust, which time andmortality had strewn there. Of such horribly curious, and otherwiseenterprising juveniles, Bob was, of course, the special scourge andterror. But terrible as was the official aspect of the sexton, andrepugnant as his lank form, clothed in rusty, sable vesture, his small,frosty visage, suspicious grey eyes, and rusty, brown scratch-wig, mightappear to all notions of genial frailty; it was yet true, that BobMartin's severe morality sometimes nodded, and that Bacchus did notalways solicit him in vain.Bob had a curious mind, a memory well stored with "merry tales," andtales of terror. His profession familiarized him with graves and goblins,and his tastes with weddings, wassail, and sly frolics of all sorts. Andas his personal recollections ran back nearly three score years into theperspective of the village history, his fund of local anecdote wascopious, accurate, and edifying.As his ecclesiastical revenues were by no means considerable, he was notunfrequently obliged, for the indulgence of his tastes, to arts whichwere, at the best, undignified.He frequently invited himself when his entertainers had forgotten to doso; he dropped in accidentally upon small drinking parties of hisacquaintance in public houses, and entertained them with stories, queeror terrible, from his inexhaustible reservoir, never scrupling to acceptan acknowledgment in the shape of hot whiskey-punch, or whatever elsewas going.There was at that time a certain atrabilious publican, called PhilipSlaney, established in a shop nearly opposite the old turnpike. This manwas not, when left to himself, immoderately given to drinking; but beingnaturally of a saturnine complexion, and his spirits constantly requiringa fillip, he acquired a prodigious liking for Bob Martin's company. Thesexton's society, in fact, gradually became the solace of his existence,and he seemed to lose his constitutional melancholy in the fascination ofhis sly jokes and marvellous stories.This intimacy did not redound to the prosperity or reputation of theconvivial allies. Bob Martin drank a good deal more punch than was goodfor his health, or consistent with the character of an ecclesiasticalfunctionary. Philip Slaney, too, was drawn into similar indulgences, forit was hard to resist the genial seductions of his gifted companion; andas he was obliged to pay for both, his purse was believed to havesuffered even more than his head and liver.Be this as it may, Bob Martin had the credit of having made a drunkard of"black Phil Slaney"--for by this cognomen was he distinguished; and PhilSlaney had also the reputation of having made the sexton, if possible, a"bigger bliggard" than ever. Under these circumstances, the accounts ofthe concern opposite the turnpike became somewhat entangled; and it cameto pass one drowsy summer morning, the weather being at once sultry andcloudy, that Phil Slaney went into a small back parlour, where he kepthis books, and which commanded, through its dirty window-panes, a fullview of a dead wall, and having bolted the door, he took a loaded pistol,and clapping the muzzle in his mouth, blew the upper part of his skullthrough the ceiling.This horrid catastrophe shocked Bob Martin extremely; and partly on thisaccount, and partly because having been, on several late occasions, foundat night in a state of abstraction, bordering on insensibility, upon thehigh road, he had been threatened with dismissal; and, as some said,partly also because of the difficulty of finding anybody to "treat" himas poor Phil Slaney used to do, he for a time forswore alcohol in all itscombinations, and became an eminent example of temperance and sobriety.Bob observed his good resolutions, greatly to the comfort of his wife,and the edification of the neighbourhood, with tolerable punctuality. Hewas seldom tipsy, and never drunk, and was greeted by the better part ofsociety with all the honours of the prodigal son.Now it happened, about a year after the grisly event we have mentioned,that the curate having received, by the post, due notice of a funeral tobe consummated in the churchyard of Chapelizod, with certain instructionsrespecting the site of the grave, despatched a summons for Bob Martin,with a view to communicate to that functionary these official details.It was a lowering autumn night: piles of lurid thunder-clouds, slowlyrising from the earth, had loaded the sky with a solemn and boding canopyof storm. The growl of the distant thunder was heard afar off upon thedull, still air, and all nature seemed, as it were, hushed and coweringunder the oppressive influence of the approaching tempest.It was past nine o'clock when Bob, putting on his official coat of seedyblack, prepared to attend his professional superior."Bobby, darlin'," said his wife, before she delivered the hat she held inher hand to his keeping, "sure you won't, Bobby, darlin'--you won't--youknow what.""I _don't_ know what," he retorted, smartly, grasping at his hat."You won't be throwing up the little finger, Bobby, acushla?" she said,evading his grasp."Arrah, why would I, woman? there, give me my hat, will you?""But won't you promise me, Bobby darlin'--won't you, alanna?""Ay, ay, to be sure I will--why not?--there, give me my hat, andlet me go.""Ay, but you're not promisin', Bobby, mavourneen; you're not promisin'all the time.""Well, divil carry me if I drink a drop till I come back again," said thesexton, angrily; "will that do you? And _now_ will you give me my hat?""Here it is, darlin'," she said, "and God send you safe back."And with this parting blessing she closed the door upon his retreatingfigure, for it was now quite dark, and resumed her knitting till hisreturn, very much relieved; for she thought he had of late been oftenertipsy than was consistent with his thorough reformation, and feared theallurements of the half dozen "publics" which he had at that time to passon his way to the other end of the town.They were still open, and exhaled a delicious reek of whiskey, as Bobglided wistfully by them; but he stuck his hands in his pockets andlooked the other way, whistling resolutely, and filling his mind with theimage of the curate and anticipations of his coming fee. Thus he steeredhis morality safely through these rocks of offence, and reached thecurate's lodging in safety.He had, however, an unexpected sick call to attend, and was not at home,so that Bob Martin had to sit in the hall and amuse himself with thedevil's tattoo until his return. This, unfortunately, was very longdelayed, and it must have been fully twelve o'clock when Bob Martin setout upon his homeward way. By this time the storm had gathered to apitchy darkness, the bellowing thunder was heard among the rocks andhollows of the Dublin mountains, and the pale, blue lightning shone uponthe staring fronts of the houses.By this time, too, every door was closed; but as Bob trudged homeward,his eye mechanically sought the public-house which had once belonged toPhil Slaney. A faint light was making its way through the shutters andthe glass panes over the doorway, which made a sort of dull, foggy haloabout the front of the house.As Bob's eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity by this time, thelight in question was quite sufficient to enable him to see a man in asort of loose riding-coat seated upon a bench which, at that time, wasfixed under the window of the house. He wore his hat very much over hiseyes, and was smoking a long pipe. The outline of a glass and a quartbottle were also dimly traceable beside him; and a large horse saddled,but faintly discernible, was patiently awaiting his master's leisure.There was something odd, no doubt, in the appearance of a travellerrefreshing himself at such an hour in the open street; but the sextonaccounted for it easily by supposing that, on the closing of the housefor the night, he had taken what remained of his refection to the placewhere he was now discussing it al fresco.At another time Bob might have saluted the stranger as he passed with afriendly "good night"; but, somehow, he was out of humour and in nogenial mood, and was about passing without any courtesy of the sort,when the stranger, without taking the pipe from his mouth, raised thebottle, and with it beckoned him familiarly, while, with a sort of lurchof the head and shoulders, and at the same time shifting his seat to theend of the bench, he pantomimically invited him to share his seat andhis cheer. There was a divine fragrance of whiskey about the spot, andBob half relented; but he remembered his promise just as he began towaver, and said:"No, I thank you, sir, I can't stop to-night."The stranger beckoned with vehement welcome, and pointed to the vacantspace on the seat beside him."I thank you for your polite offer," said Bob, "but it's what I'm toolate as it is, and haven't time to spare, so I wish you a good night."The traveller jingled the glass against the neck of the bottle, as if tointimate that he might at least swallow a dram without losing time. Bobwas mentally quite of the same opinion; but, though his mouth watered, heremembered his promise, and shaking his head with incorruptibleresolution, walked on.The stranger, pipe in mouth, rose from his bench, the bottle in one hand,and the glass in the other, and followed at the sexton's heels, his duskyhorse keeping close in his wake.There was something suspicious and unaccountable in this importunity.Bob quickened his pace, but the stranger followed close. The sexton beganto feel queer, and turned about. His pursuer was behind, and stillinviting him with impatient gestures to taste his liquor."I told you before," said Bob, who was both angry and frightened, "that Iwould not taste it, and that's enough. I don't want to have anything tosay to you or your bottle; and in God's name," he added, more vehemently,observing that he was approaching still closer, "fall back and don't betormenting me this way."These words, as it seemed, incensed the stranger, for he shook the bottlewith violent menace at Bob Martin; but, notwithstanding this gesture ofdefiance, he suffered the distance between them to increase. Bob,however, beheld him dogging him still in the distance, for his pipe sheda wonderful red glow, which duskily illuminated his entire figure likethe lurid atmosphere of a meteor."I wish the devil had his own, my boy," muttered the excited sexton, "andI know well enough where you'd be."The next time he looked over his shoulder, to his dismay he observed theimportunate stranger as close as ever upon his track."Confound you," cried the man of skulls and shovels, almost besidehimself with rage and horror, "what is it you want of me?"The stranger appeared more confident, and kept wagging his head andextending both glass and bottle toward him as he drew near, and BobMartin heard the horse snorting as it followed in the dark."Keep it to yourself, whatever it is, for there is neither grace norluck about you," cried Bob Martin, freezing with terror; "leave mealone, will you."And he fumbled in vain among the seething confusion of his ideas for aprayer or an exorcism. He quickened his pace almost to a run; he was nowclose to his own door, under the impending bank by the river side."Let me in, let me in, for God's sake; Molly, open the door," he cried,as he ran to the threshold, and leant his back against the plank. Hispursuer confronted him upon the road; the pipe was no longer in hismouth, but the dusky red glow still lingered round him. He uttered someinarticulate cavernous sounds, which were wolfish and indescribable,while he seemed employed in pouring out a glass from the bottle.The sexton kicked with all his force against the door, and cried at thesame time with a despairing voice."In the name of God Almighty, once for all, leave me alone."His pursuer furiously flung the contents of the bottle at Bob Martin;but instead of fluid it issued out in a stream of flame, which expandedand whirled round them, and for a moment they were both enveloped in afaint blaze; at the same instant a sudden gust whisked off thestranger's hat, and the sexton beheld that his skull was roofless. Foran instant he beheld the gaping aperture, black and shattered, and thenhe fell senseless into his own doorway, which his affrighted wife hadjust unbarred.I need hardly give my reader the key to this most intelligible andauthentic narrative. The traveller was acknowledged by all to have beenthe spectre of the suicide, called up by the Evil One to tempt theconvivial sexton into a violation of his promise, sealed, as it was, byan imprecation. Had he succeeded, no doubt the dusky steed, which Bob hadseen saddled in attendance, was destined to have carried back a doubleburden to the place from whence he came.As an attestation of the reality of this visitation, the old thorn treewhich overhung the doorway was found in the morning to have been blastedwith the infernal fires which had issued from the bottle, just as if athunder-bolt had scorched it.The moral of the above tale is upon the surface, apparent, and, so tospeak, _self-acting_--a circumstance which happily obviates thenecessity of our discussing it together. Taking our leave, therefore, ofhonest Bob Martin, who now sleeps soundly in the same solemn dormitorywhere, in his day, he made so many beds for others, I come to a legendof the Royal Irish Artillery, whose headquarters were for so long a timein the town of Chapelizod. I don't mean to say that I cannot tell agreat many more stories, equally authentic and marvellous, touching thisold town; but as I may possibly have to perform a like office for otherlocalities, and as Anthony Poplar is known, like Atropos, to carry ashears, wherewith to snip across all "yarns" which exceed reasonablebounds, I consider it, on the whole, safer to despatch the traditions ofChapelizod with one tale more.Let me, however, first give it a name; for an author can no more despatcha tale without a title, than an apothecary can deliver his physic withouta label. We shall, therefore, call it--The Spectre LoversThere lived some fifteen years since in a small and ruinous house, littlebetter than a hovel, an old woman who was reported to have considerablyexceeded her eightieth year, and who rejoiced in the name of Alice, orpopularly, Ally Moran. Her society was not much courted, for she wasneither rich, nor, as the reader may suppose, beautiful. In addition to alean cur and a cat she had one human companion, her grandson, PeterBrien, whom, with laudable good nature, she had supported from the periodof his orphanage down to that of my story, which finds him in histwentieth year. Peter was a good-natured slob of a fellow, much moreaddicted to wrestling, dancing, and love-making, than to hard work, andfonder of whiskey-punch than good advice. His grandmother had a highopinion of his accomplishments, which indeed was but natural, and also ofhis genius, for Peter had of late years begun to apply his mind topolitics; and as it was plain that he had a mortal hatred of honestlabour, his grandmother predicted, like a true fortuneteller, that he wasborn to marry an heiress, and Peter himself (who had no mind to foregohis freedom even on such terms) that he was destined to find a pot ofgold. Upon one point both agreed, that being unfitted by the peculiarbias of his genius for work, he was to acquire the immense fortune towhich his merits entitled him by means of a pure run of good luck. Thissolution of Peter's future had the double effect of reconciling bothhimself and his grandmother to his idle courses, and also of maintainingthat even flow of hilarious spirits which made him everywhere welcome,and which was in truth the natural result of his consciousness ofapproaching affluence.It happened one night that Peter had enjoyed himself to a very late hourwith two or three choice spirits near Palmerstown. They had talkedpolitics and love, sung songs, and told stories, and, above all, hadswallowed, in the chastened disguise of punch, at least a pint of goodwhiskey, every man.It was considerably past one o'clock when Peter bid his companionsgoodbye, with a sigh and a hiccough, and lighting his pipe set forth onhis solitary homeward way.The bridge of Chapelizod was pretty nearly the midway point of his nightmarch, and from one cause or another his progress was rather slow, and itwas past two o'clock by the time he found himself leaning over its oldbattlements, and looking up the river, over whose winding current andwooded banks the soft moonlight was falling.The cold breeze that blew lightly down the stream was grateful to him. Itcooled his throbbing head, and he drank it in at his hot lips. The scene,too, had, without his being well sensible of it, a secret fascination.The village was sunk in the profoundest slumber, not a mortal stirring,not a sound afloat, a soft haze covered it all, and the fairy moonlighthovered over the entire landscape.In a state between rumination and rapture, Peter continued to lean overthe battlements of the old bridge, and as he did so he saw, or fancied hesaw, emerging one after another along the river bank in the littlegardens and enclosures in the rear of the street of Chapelizod, thequeerest little white-washed huts and cabins he had ever seen therebefore. They had not been there that evening when he passed the bridge onthe way to his merry tryst. But the most remarkable thing about it wasthe odd way in which these quaint little cabins showed themselves. Firsthe saw one or two of them just with the corner of his eye, and when helooked full at them, strange to say, they faded away and disappeared.Then another and another came in view, but all in the same coy way, justappearing and gone again before he could well fix his gaze upon them; ina little while, however, they began to bear a fuller gaze, and he found,as it seemed to himself, that he was able by an effort of attention tofix the vision for a longer and a longer time, and when they waxed faintand nearly vanished, he had the power of recalling them into light andsubstance, until at last their vacillating indistinctness became less andless, and they assumed a permanent place in the moonlit landscape."Be the hokey," said Peter, lost in amazement, and dropping his pipe intothe river unconsciously, "them is the quarist bits iv mud cabins I everseen, growing up like musharoons in the dew of an evening, and poppin' uphere and down again there, and up again in another place, like so manywhite rabbits in a warren; and there they stand at last as firm and fastas if they were there from the Deluge; bedad it's enough to make a mana'most believe in the fairies."This latter was a large concession from Peter, who was a bit of afree-thinker, and spoke contemptuously in his ordinary conversation ofthat class of agencies.Having treated himself to a long last stare at these mysterious fabrics,Peter prepared to pursue his homeward way; having crossed the bridge andpassed the mill, he arrived at the corner of the main-street of thelittle town, and casting a careless look up the Dublin road, his eye wasarrested by a most unexpected spectacle.This was no other than a column of foot soldiers, marching with perfectregularity towards the village, and headed by an officer on horseback.They were at the far side of the turnpike, which was closed; but much tohis perplexity he perceived that they marched on through it withoutappearing to sustain the least check from that barrier.On they came at a slow march; and what was most singular in the matterwas, that they were drawing several cannons along with them; some heldropes, others spoked the wheels, and others again marched in front of theguns and behind them, with muskets shouldered, giving a stately characterof parade and regularity to this, as it seemed to Peter, most unmilitaryprocedure.It was owing either to some temporary defect in Peter's vision, or tosome illusion attendant upon mist and moonlight, or perhaps to some othercause, that the whole procession had a certain waving and vapourycharacter which perplexed and tasked his eyes not a little. It was likethe pictured pageant of a phantasmagoria reflected upon smoke. It was asif every breath disturbed it; sometimes it was blurred, sometimesobliterated; now here, now there. Sometimes, while the upper part wasquite distinct, the legs of the column would nearly fade away or vanishoutright, and then again they would come out into clear relief, marchingon with measured tread, while the cocked hats and shoulders grew, as itwere, transparent, and all but disappeared.Notwithstanding these strange optical fluctuations, however, the columncontinued steadily to advance. Peter crossed the street from the cornernear the old bridge, running on tip-toe, and with his body stooped toavoid observation, and took up a position upon the raised footpath in theshadow of the houses, where, as the soldiers kept the middle of the road,he calculated that he might, himself undetected, see them distinctlyenough as they passed."What the div--, what on airth," he muttered, checking the irreligiousejaculation with which he was about to start, for certain queermisgivings were hovering about his heart, notwithstanding the factitiouscourage of the whiskey bottle. "What on airth is the manin' of all this?is it the French that's landed at last to give us a hand and help us inairnest to this blessed repale? If it is not them, I simply ask who thediv--, I mane who on airth are they, for such sogers as them I neverseen before in my born days?"By this time the foremost of them were quite near, and truth to say theywere the queerest soldiers he had ever seen in the course of his life.They wore long gaiters and leather breeches, three-cornered hats, boundwith silver lace, long blue coats, with scarlet facings and linings,which latter were shewn by a fastening which held together the twoopposite corners of the skirt behind; and in front the breasts were inlike manner connected at a single point, where and below which theysloped back, disclosing a long-flapped waistcoat of snowy whiteness; theyhad very large, long cross-belts, and wore enormous pouches of whiteleather hung extraordinarily low, and on each of which a little silverstar was glittering. But what struck him as most grotesque and outlandishin their costume was their extraordinary display of shirt-frill in front,and of ruffle about their wrists, and the strange manner in which theirhair was frizzled out and powdered under their hats, and clubbed up intogreat rolls behind. But one of the party was mounted. He rode a tallwhite horse, with high action and arching neck; he had a snow-whitefeather in his three-cornered hat, and his coat was shimmering all overwith a profusion of silver lace. From these circumstances Peter concludedthat he must be the commander of the detachment, and examined him as hepassed attentively. He was a slight, tall man, whose legs did not halffill his leather breeches, and he appeared to be at the wrong side ofsixty. He had a shrunken, weather-beaten, mulberry-coloured face, carrieda large black patch over one eye, and turned neither to the right nor tothe left, but rode on at the head of his men, with a grim, militaryinflexibility.The countenances of these soldiers, officers as well as men, seemed allfull of trouble, and, so to speak, scared and wild. He watched in vainfor a single contented or comely face. They had, one and all, amelancholy and hang-dog look; and as they passed by, Peter fancied thatthe air grew cold and thrilling.He had seated himself upon a stone bench, from which, staring with allhis might, he gazed upon the grotesque and noiseless procession as itfiled by him. Noiseless it was; he could neither hear the jingle ofaccoutrements, the tread of feet, nor the rumble of the wheels; and whenthe old colonel turned his horse a little, and made as though he weregiving the word of command, and a trumpeter, with a swollen blue nose andwhite feather fringe round his hat, who was walking beside him, turnedabout and put his bugle to his lips, still Peter heard nothing, althoughit was plain the sound had reached the soldiers, for they instantlychanged their front to three abreast."Botheration!" muttered Peter, "is it deaf I'm growing?"But that could not be, for he heard the sighing of the breeze and therush of the neighbouring Liffey plain enough."Well," said he, in the same cautious key, "by the piper, this bangsBanagher fairly! It's either the Frinch army that's in it, come to takethe town iv Chapelizod by surprise, an' makin' no noise for feard ivwakenin' the inhabitants; or else it's--it's--what it's--somethin' else.But, tundher-an-ouns, what's gone wid Fitzpatrick's shop across the way?"The brown, dingy stone building at the opposite side of the street lookednewer and cleaner than he had been used to see it; the front door of itstood open, and a sentry, in the same grotesque uniform, with shoulderedmusket, was pacing noiselessly to and fro before it. At the angle of thisbuilding, in like manner, a wide gate (of which Peter had no recollectionwhatever) stood open, before which, also, a similar sentry was gliding,and into this gateway the whole column gradually passed, and Peterfinally lost sight of it."I'm not asleep; I'm not dhramin'," said he, rubbing his eyes, andstamping slightly on the pavement, to assure himself that he was wideawake. "It is a quare business, whatever it is; an' it's not alone that,but everything about town looks strange to me. There's Tresham's housenew painted, bedad, an' them flowers in the windies! An' Delany's house,too, that had not a whole pane of glass in it this morning, and scarce aslate on the roof of it! It is not possible it's what it's dhrunk I am.Sure there's the big tree, and not a leaf of it changed since I passed,and the stars overhead, all right. I don't think it is in my eyes it is."And so looking about him, and every moment finding or fancying new foodfor wonder, he walked along the pavement, intending, without furtherdelay, to make his way home.But his adventures for the night were not concluded. He had nearlyreached the angle of the short land that leads up to the church, when forthe first time he perceived that an officer, in the uniform he had justseen, was walking before, only a few yards in advance of him.The officer was walking along at an easy, swinging gait, and carriedhis sword under his arm, and was looking down on the pavement with anair of reverie.In the very fact that he seemed unconscious of Peter's presence, anddisposed to keep his reflections to himself, there was somethingreassuring. Besides, the reader must please to remember that our hero hada quantum sufficit of good punch before his adventure commenced, and wasthus fortified against those qualms and terrors under which, in a morereasonable state of mind, he might not impossibly have sunk.The idea of the French invasion revived in full power in Peter's fuddledimagination, as he pursued the nonchalant swagger of the officer."Be the powers iv Moll Kelly, I'll ax him what it is," said Peter, with asudden accession of rashness. "He may tell me or not, as he plases, buthe can't be offinded, anyhow."With this reflection having inspired himself, Peter cleared his voiceand began--"Captain!" said he, "I ax your pardon, captain, an' maybe you'd be socondescindin' to my ignorance as to tell me, if it's plasin' to yerhonour, whether your honour is not a Frinchman, if it's plasin' to you."This he asked, not thinking that, had it been as he suspected, not oneword of his question in all probability would have been intelligible tothe person he addressed. He was, however, understood, for the officeranswered him in English, at the same time slackening his pace and movinga little to the side of the pathway, as if to invite his interrogator totake his place beside him."No; I am an Irishman," he answered."I humbly thank your honour," said Peter, drawing nearer--for theaffability and the nativity of the officer encouraged him--"but maybeyour honour is in the _sarvice_ of the King of France?""I serve the same King as you do," he answered, with a sorrowfulsignificance which Peter did not comprehend at the time; and,interrogating in turn, he asked, "But what calls you forth at this hourof the day?""The _day,_ your honour!--the night, you mane.""It was always our way to turn night into day, and we keep to it still,"remarked the soldier. "But, no matter, come up here to my house; I have ajob for you, if you wish to earn some money easily. I live here."As he said this, he beckoned authoritatively to Peter, who followedalmost mechanically at his heels, and they turned up a little lane nearthe old Roman Catholic chapel, at the end of which stood, in Peter'stime, the ruins of a tall, stone-built house.Like everything else in the town, it had suffered a metamorphosis. Thestained and ragged walls were now erect, perfect, and covered withpebble-dash; window-panes glittered coldly in every window; the greenhall-door had a bright brass knocker on it. Peter did not know whether tobelieve his previous or his present impressions; seeing is believing, andPeter could not dispute the reality of the scene. All the records of hismemory seemed but the images of a tipsy dream. In a trance ofastonishment and perplexity, therefore, he submitted himself to thechances of his adventure.The door opened, the officer beckoned with a melancholy air of authorityto Peter, and entered. Our hero followed him into a sort of hall, whichwas very dark, but he was guided by the steps of the soldier, and, insilence, they ascended the stairs. The moonlight, which shone in at thelobbies, showed an old, dark wainscoting, and a heavy, oak banister. Theypassed by closed doors at different landing-places, but all was dark andsilent as, indeed, became that late hour of the night.Now they ascended to the topmost floor. The captain paused for a minuteat the nearest door, and, with a heavy groan, pushing it open, enteredthe room. Peter remained at the threshold. A slight female form in asort of loose, white robe, and with a great deal of dark hair hangingloosely about her, was standing in the middle of the floor, with herback towards them.The soldier stopped short before he reached her, and said, in a voice ofgreat anguish, "Still the same, sweet bird--sweet bird! still the same."Whereupon, she turned suddenly, and threw her arms about the neck of theofficer, with a gesture of fondness and despair, and her frame wasagitated as if by a burst of sobs. He held her close to his breast insilence; and honest Peter felt a strange terror creep over him, as hewitnessed these mysterious sorrows and endearments."To-night, to-night--and then ten years more--ten long years--anotherten years."The officer and the lady seemed to speak these words together; her voicemingled with his in a musical and fearful wail, like a distant summerwind, in the dead hour of night, wandering through ruins. Then he heardthe officer say, alone, in a voice of anguish--"Upon me be it all, for ever, sweet birdie, upon me."And again they seemed to mourn together in the same soft and desolatewail, like sounds of grief heard from a great distance.Peter was thrilled with horror, but he was also under a strangefascination; and an intense and dreadful curiosity held him fast.The moon was shining obliquely into the room, and through the windowPeter saw the familiar slopes of the Park, sleeping mistily under itsshimmer. He could also see the furniture of the room with tolerabledistinctness--the old balloon-backed chairs, a four-post bed in a sort ofrecess, and a rack against the wall, from which hung some militaryclothes and accoutrements; and the sight of all these homely objectsreassured him somewhat, and he could not help feeling unspeakably curiousto see the face of the girl whose long hair was streaming over theofficer's epaulet.Peter, accordingly, coughed, at first slightly, and afterward moreloudly, to recall her from her reverie of grief; and, apparently, hesucceeded; for she turned round, as did her companion, and both, standinghand in hand, gazed upon him fixedly. He thought he had never seen suchlarge, strange eyes in all his life; and their gaze seemed to chill thevery air around him, and arrest the pulses of his heart. An eternity ofmisery and remorse was in the shadowy faces that looked upon him.If Peter had taken less whisky by a single thimbleful, it is probablethat he would have lost heart altogether before these figures, whichseemed every moment to assume a more marked and fearful, though hardlydefinable, contrast to ordinary human shapes."What is it you want with me?" he stammered."To bring my lost treasure to the churchyard," replied the lady, in asilvery voice of more than mortal desolation.The word "treasure" revived the resolution of Peter, although a coldsweat was covering him, and his hair was bristling with horror; hebelieved, however, that he was on the brink of fortune, if he could butcommand nerve to brave the interview to its close."And where," he gasped, "is it hid--where will I find it?"They both pointed to the sill of the window, through which the moon wasshining at the far end of the room, and the soldier said--"Under that stone."Peter drew a long breath, and wiped the cold dew from his face,preparatory to passing to the window, where he expected to secure thereward of his protracted terrors. But looking steadfastly at the window,he saw the faint image of a new-born child sitting upon the sill in themoonlight, with its little arms stretched toward him, and a smile soheavenly as he never beheld before.At sight of this, strange to say, his heart entirely failed him, helooked on the figures that stood near, and beheld them gazing on theinfantine form with a smile so guilty and distorted, that he felt as ifhe were entering alive among the scenery of hell, and shuddering, hecried in an irrepressible agony of horror--"I'll have nothing to say with you, and nothing to do with you; I don'tknow what yez are or what yez want iv me, but let me go this minute,every one of yez, in the name of God."With these words there came a strange rumbling and sighing aboutPeter's ears; he lost sight of everything, and felt that peculiar andnot unpleasant sensation of falling softly, that sometimes supervenesin sleep, ending in a dull shock. After that he had neither dream norconsciousness till he wakened, chill and stiff, stretched between twopiles of old rubbish, among the black and roofless walls of theruined house.We need hardly mention that the village had put on its wonted air ofneglect and decay, or that Peter looked around him in vain for traces ofthose novelties which had so puzzled and distracted him upon theprevious night."Ay, ay," said his grandmother, removing her pipe, as he ended hisdescription of the view from the bridge, "sure enough I remember myself,when I was a slip of a girl, these little white cabins among the gardensby the river side. The artillery sogers that was married, or had not roomin the barracks, used to be in them, but they're all gone long ago."The Lord be merciful to us!" she resumed, when he had described themilitary procession, "It's often I seen the regiment marchin' into thetown, jist as you saw it last night, acushla. Oh, voch, but it makes myheart sore to think iv them days; they were pleasant times, sure enough;but is not it terrible, avick, to think it's what it was the ghost of therigiment you seen? The Lord betune us an' harm, for it was nothing else,as sure as I'm sittin' here."When he mentioned the peculiar physiognomy and figure of the old officerwho rode at the head of the regiment--"That," said the old crone, dogmatically, "was ould Colonel Grimshaw, theLord presarve us! he's buried in the churchyard iv Chapelizod, and well Iremember him, when I was a young thing, an' a cross ould floggin' fellowhe was wid the men, an' a devil's boy among the girls--rest his soul!""Amen!" said Peter; "it's often I read his tombstone myself; but he's along time dead.""Sure, I tell you he died when I was no more nor a slip iv a girl--theLord betune us and harm!""I'm afeard it is what I'm not long for this world myself, afther seeingsuch a sight as that," said Peter, fearfully."Nonsinse, avourneen," retorted his grandmother, indignantly, though shehad herself misgivings on the subject; "sure there was Phil Doolan, theferryman, that seen black Ann Scanlan in his own boat, and what harm everkem of it?"Peter proceeded with his narrative, but when he came to the descriptionof the house, in which his adventure had had so sinister a conclusion,the old woman was at fault."I know the house and the ould walls well, an' I can remember the timethere was a roof on it, and the doors an' windows in it, but it had a badname about being haunted, but by who, or for what, I forget intirely.""Did you ever hear was there goold or silver there?" he inquired."No, no, avick, don't be thinking about the likes; take a fool's advice,and never go next to near them ugly black walls again the longest day youhave to live; an' I'd take my davy, it's what it's the same word thepriest himself id be afther sayin' to you if you wor to ax his raverenceconsarnin' it, for it's plain to be seen it was nothing good you seenthere, and there's neither luck nor grace about it."Peter's adventure made no little noise in the neighbourhood, as thereader may well suppose; and a few evenings after it, being on an errandto old Major Vandeleur, who lived in a snug old-fashioned house, close bythe river, under a perfect bower of ancient trees, he was called on torelate the story in the parlour.The Major was, as I have said, an old man; he was small, lean, andupright, with a mahogany complexion, and a wooden inflexibility of face;he was a man, besides, of few words, and if _he_ was old, it followsplainly that his mother was older still. Nobody could guess or tell _how_old, but it was admitted that her own generation had long passed away,and that she had not a competitor left. She had French blood in herveins, and although she did not retain her charms quite so well as Ninonde l'Enclos, she was in full possession of all her mental activity, andtalked quite enough for herself and the Major."So, Peter," she said, "you have seen the dear, old Royal Irish again inthe streets of Chapelizod. Make him a tumbler of punch, Frank; and Peter,sit down, and while you take it let us have the story."Peter accordingly, seated, near the door, with a tumbler of the nectarianstimulant steaming beside him, proceeded with marvellous courage,considering they had no light but the uncertain glare of the fire, torelate with minute particularity his awful adventure. The old ladylistened at first with a smile of good-natured incredulity; hercross-examination touching the drinking-bout at Palmerstown had beenteazing, but as the narrative proceeded she became attentive, and atlength absorbed, and once or twice she uttered ejaculations of pity orawe. When it was over, the old lady looked with a somewhat sad and sternabstraction on the table, patting her cat assiduously meanwhile, and thensuddenly looking upon her son, the Major, she said--"Frank, as sure as I live he has seen the wicked Captain Devereux."The Major uttered an inarticulate expression of wonder."The house was precisely that he has described. I have told you the storyoften, as I heard it from your dear grandmother, about the poor younglady he ruined, and the dreadful suspicion about the little baby. _She_,poor thing, died in that house heart-broken, and you know he was shotshortly after in a duel."This was the only light that Peter ever received respecting hisadventure. It was supposed, however, that he still clung to the hope thattreasure of some sort was hidden about the old house, for he was oftenseen lurking about its walls, and at last his fate overtook him, poorfellow, in the pursuit; for climbing near the summit one day, his holdinggave way, and he fell upon the hard uneven ground, fracturing a leg and arib, and after a short interval died, and he, like the other heroes ofthese true tales, lies buried in the little churchyard of Chapelizod.       *       *       *       *       *THE DRUNKARD'S DREAM_Being a Fourth Extract from the Legacy of the Late F.

I have thought not alittle upon the subject, seeing it is one which has been often forcedupon my attention, and sometimes strangely enough; and yet I have neverarrived at any thing which at all appeared a satisfactory conclusion. Itdoes appear that a mental phenomenon so extraordinary cannot be whollywithout its use. We know, indeed, that in the olden times it has beenmade the organ of communication between the Deity and his creatures; andwhen, as I have seen, a dream produces upon a mind, to all appearancehopelessly reprobate and depraved, an effect so powerful and so lastingas to break down the inveterate habits, and to reform the life of anabandoned sinner. We see in the result, in the reformation of morals,which appeared incorrigible in the reclamation of a human soul whichseemed to be irretrievably lost, something more than could be produced bya mere chimaera of the slumbering fancy, something more than could arisefrom the capricious images of a terrified imagination; but onceprevented, we behold in all these things, in the tremendous andmysterious results, the operation of the hand of God. And while Reasonrejects as absurd the superstition which will read a prophecy in everydream, she may, without violence to herself, recognize, even in thewildest and most incongruous of the wanderings of a slumbering intellect,the evidences and the fragments of a language which may be spoken, which_has_ been spoken to terrify, to warn, and to command. We have reason tobelieve too, by the promptness of action, which in the age of theprophets, followed all intimations of this kind, and by the strength ofconviction and strange permanence of the effects resulting from certaindreams in latter times, which effects ourselves may have witnessed, thatwhen this medium of communication has been employed by the Deity, theevidences of his presence have been unequivocal. My thoughts weredirected to this subject, in a manner to leave a lasting impression uponmy mind, by the events which I shall now relate, the statement of which,however extraordinary, is nevertheless _accurately correct_.About the year l7-- having been appointed to the living of C----h, Irented a small house in the town, which bears the same name: one morning,in the month of November, I was awakened before my usual time, by myservant, who bustled into my bedroom for the purpose of announcing a sickcall. As the Catholic Church holds her last rites to be totallyindispensable to the safety of the departing sinner, no conscientiousclergyman can afford a moment's unnecessary delay, and in little morethan five minutes I stood ready cloaked and booted for the road in thesmall front parlour, in which the messenger, who was to act as my guide,awaited my coming. I found a poor little girl crying piteously near thedoor, and after some slight difficulty I ascertained that her father waseither dead, or just dying."And what may be your father's name, my poor child?" said I. She helddown her head, as if ashamed. I repeated the question, and the wretchedlittle creature burst into floods of tears, still more bitter than shehad shed before. At length, almost provoked by conduct which appeared tome so unreasonable, I began to lose patience, spite of the pity which Icould not help feeling towards her, and I said rather harshly, "If youwill not tell me the name of the person to whom you would lead me, yoursilence can arise from no good motive, and I might be justified inrefusing to go with you at all.""Oh! don't say that, don't say that," cried she. "Oh! sir, it was that Iwas afeard of when I would not tell you--I was afeard when you heard hisname you would not come with me; but it is no use hidin' it now--it's PatConnell, the carpenter, your honour."She looked in my face with the most earnest anxiety, as if her veryexistence depended upon what she should read there; but I relieved her atonce. The name, indeed, was most unpleasantly familiar to me; but,however fruitless my visits and advice might have been at another time,the present was too fearful an occasion to suffer my doubts of theirutility as my reluctance to re-attempting what appeared a hopeless taskto weigh even against the lightest chance, that a consciousness of hisimminent danger might produce in him a more docile and tractabledisposition. Accordingly I told the child to lead the way, and followedher in silence. She hurried rapidly through the long narrow street whichforms the great thoroughfare of the town. The darkness of the hour,rendered still deeper by the close approach of the old fashioned houses,which lowered in tall obscurity on either side of the way; the dampdreary chill which renders the advance of morning peculiarly cheerless,combined with the object of my walk, to visit the death-bed of apresumptuous sinner, to endeavour, almost against my own conviction, toinfuse a hope into the heart of a dying reprobate--a drunkard, but tooprobably perishing under the consequences of some mad fit ofintoxication; all these circumstances united served to enhance the gloomand solemnity of my feelings, as I silently followed my little guide, whowith quick steps traversed the uneven pavement of the main street. Aftera walk of about five minutes she turned off into a narrow lane, of thatobscure and comfortless class which are to be found in almost all smallold fashioned towns, chill without ventilation, reeking with all mannerof offensive effluviae, dingy, smoky, sickly and pent-up buildings,frequently not only in a wretched but in a dangerous condition."Your father has changed his abode since I last visited him, and, I amafraid, much for the worse," said I."Indeed he has, sir, but we must not complain," replied she; "we have tothank God that we have lodging and food, though it's poor enough, it is,your honour."Poor child! thought I, how many an older head might learn wisdom fromthee--how many a luxurious philosopher, who is skilled to preach but notto suffer, might not thy patient words put to the blush! The manner andlanguage of this child were alike above her years and station; and,indeed, in all cases in which the cares and sorrows of life haveanticipated their usual date, and have fallen, as they sometimes do, withmelancholy prematurity to the lot of childhood, I have observed theresult to have proved uniformly the same. A young mind, to which joy andindulgence have been strangers, and to which suffering and self-denialhave been familiarised from the first, acquires a solidity and anelevation which no other discipline could have bestowed, and which, inthe present case, communicated a striking but mournful peculiarity to themanners, even to the voice of the child. We paused before a narrow, crazydoor, which she opened by means of a latch, and we forthwith began toascend the steep and broken stairs, which led upwards to the sick man'sroom. As we mounted flight after flight towards the garret floor, I heardmore and more distinctly the hurried talking of many voices. I could alsodistinguish the low sobbing of a female. On arriving upon the uppermostlobby, these sounds became fully audible."This way, your honor," said my little conductress, at the same timepushing open a door of patched and half rotten plank, she admitted meinto the squalid chamber of death and misery. But one candle, held in thefingers of a scared and haggard-looking child, was burning in the room,and that so dim that all was twilight or darkness except within itsimmediate influence. The general obscurity, however, served to throw intoprominent and startling relief the death-bed and its occupant. The lightwas nearly approximated to, and fell with horrible clearness upon, theblue and swollen features of the drunkard. I did not think it possiblethat a human countenance could look so terrific. The lips were black anddrawn apart--the teeth were firmly set--the eyes a little unclosed, andnothing but the whites appearing--every feature was fixed and livid, andthe whole face wore a ghastly and rigid expression of despairing terrorsuch as I never saw equalled; his hands were crossed upon his breast, andfirmly clenched, while, as if to add to the corpse-like effect of thewhole, some white cloths, dipped in water, were wound about the foreheadand temples. As soon as I could remove my eyes from this horriblespectacle, I observed my friend Dr. D----, one of the most humane of ahumane profession, standing by the bedside. He had been attempting, butunsuccessfully, to bleed the patient, and had now applied his finger tothe pulse."Is there any hope?" I inquired in a whisper.A shake of the head was the reply. There was a pause while he continuedto hold the wrist; but he waited in vain for the throb of life, it wasnot there, and when he let go the hand it fell stiffly back into itsformer position upon the other."The man is dead," said the physician, as he turned from the bed wherethe terrible figure lay.Dead! thought I, scarcely venturing to look upon the tremendous andrevolting spectacle--dead! without an hour for repentance, even amoment for reflection--dead! without the rites which even the bestshould have. Is there a hope for him? The glaring eyeball, the grinningmouth, the distorted brow--that unutterable look in which a painterwould have sought to embody the fixed despair of the nethermosthell--these were my answer.The poor wife sat at a little distance, crying as if her heart wouldbreak--the younger children clustered round the bed, looking, withwondering curiosity, upon the form of death, never seen before. When thefirst tumult of uncontrollable sorrow had passed away, availing myself ofthe solemnity and impressiveness of the scene, I desired theheart-stricken family to accompany me in prayer, and all knelt down,while I solemnly and fervently repeated some of those prayers whichappeared most applicable to the occasion. I employed myself thus in amanner which, I trusted, was not unprofitable, at least to the living,for about ten minutes, and having accomplished my task, I was the firstto arise. I looked upon the poor, sobbing, helpless creatures who kneltso humbly around me, and my heart bled for them. With a naturaltransition, I turned my eyes from them to the bed in which the body lay,and, great God! what was the revulsion, the horror which I experienced onseeing the corpse-like, terrific thing seated half upright before me--thewhite cloths, which had been wound about the head, had now partly slippedfrom their position, and were hanging in grotesque festoons about theface and shoulders, while the distorted eyes leered from amid them--"A sight to dream of, not to tell."I stood actually rivetted to the spot. The figure nodded its head andlifted its arm, I thought with a menacing gesture. A thousand confusedand horrible thoughts at once rushed upon my mind. I had often read thatthe body of a presumptuous sinner, who, during life, had been the willingcreature of every satanic impulse, after the human tenant had desertedit, had been known to become the horrible sport of demoniac possession. Iwas roused from the stupefaction of terror in which I stood, by thepiercing scream of the mother, who now, for the first time, perceived thechange which had taken place. She rushed towards the bed, but, stunned bythe shock and overcome by the conflict of violent emotions, before shereached it, she fell prostrate upon the floor. I am perfectly convincedthat had I not been startled from the torpidity of horror in which I wasbound, by some powerful and arousing stimulant, I should have gazed uponthis unearthly apparition until I had fairly lost my senses. As it was,however, the spell was broken, superstition gave way to reason: the manwhom all believed to have been actually dead, was living! Dr. D---- wasinstantly standing by the bedside, and, upon examination, he found that asudden and copious flow of blood had taken place from the wound which thelancet had left, and this, no doubt, had effected his sudden and almostpreternatural restoration to an existence from which all thought he hadbeen for ever removed. The man was still speechless, but he seemed tounderstand the physician when he forbid his repeating the painful andfruitless attempts which he made to articulate, and he at once resignedhimself quietly into his hands.I left the patient with leeches upon his temples, and bleedingfreely--apparently with little of the drowsiness which accompaniesapoplexy; indeed, Dr. D---- told me that he had never before witnessed aseizure which seemed to combine the symptoms of so many kinds, and yetwhich belonged to none of the recognized classes; it certainly was notapoplexy, catalepsy, _nor delirium tremens_, and yet it seemed, in somedegree, to partake of the properties of all--it was strange, but strangerthings are coming.During two or three days Dr. D---- would not allow his patient toconverse in a manner which could excite or exhaust him, with any one; hesuffered him merely, as briefly as possible, to express his immediatewants, and it was not until the fourth day after my early visit, theparticulars of which I have just detailed, that it was thought expedientthat I should see him, and then only because it appeared that his extremeimportunity and impatience were likely to retard his recovery more thanthe mere exhaustion attendant upon a short conversation could possiblydo; perhaps, too, my friend entertained some hope that if by holyconfession his patient's bosom were eased of the perilous stuff, which nodoubt, oppressed it, his recovery would be more assured and rapid. Itwas, then, as I have said, upon the fourth day after my firstprofessional call, that I found myself once more in the dreary chamber ofwant and sickness. The man was in bed, and appeared low and restless. Onmy entering the room he raised himself in the bed, and muttered twice orthrice--"Thank God! thank God." I signed to those of his family who stoodby, to leave the room, and took a chair beside the bed. So soon as wewere alone, he said, rather doggedly--"There's no use now in telling meof the sinfulness of bad ways--I know it all--I know where they leadto--I seen everything about it with my own eyesight, as plain as I seeyou." He rolled himself in the bed, as if to hide his face in theclothes, and then suddenly raising himself, he exclaimed with startlingvehemence--"Look, sir, there is no use in mincing the matter; I'm blastedwith the fires of hell; I have been in hell; what do you think ofthat?--in hell--I'm lost for ever--I have not a chance--I am damnedalready--damned--damned--." The end of this sentence he actuallyshouted; his vehemence was perfectly terrific; he threw himself back, andlaughed, and sobbed hysterically. I poured some water into a tea-cup, andgave it to him. After he had swallowed it, I told him if he had anythingto communicate, to do so as briefly as he could, and in a manner aslittle agitating to himself as possible; threatening at the same time,though I had no intention of doing so, to leave him at once, in case heagain gave way to such passionate excitement. "It's only foolishness," hecontinued, "for me to try to thank you for coming to such a villain asmyself at all; it's no use for me to wish good to you, or to bless you;for such as me has no blessings to give." I told him that I had but donemy duty, and urged him to proceed to the matter which weighed upon hismind; he then spoke nearly as follows:--"I came in drunk on Friday nightlast, and got to my bed here, I don't remember how; sometime in thenight, it seemed to me, I wakened, and feeling unasy in myself, I got upout of the bed. I wanted the fresh air, but I would not make a noise toopen the window, for fear I'd waken the crathurs. It was very dark, andthroublesome to find the door; but at last I did get it, and I groped myway out, and went down as asy as I could. I felt quite sober, and Icounted the steps one after another, as I was going down, that I mightnot stumble at the bottom. When I came to the first landing-place, God beabout us always! the floor of it sunk under me, and I went down, down,down, till the senses almost left me. I do not know how long I wasfalling, but it seemed to me a great while. When I came rightly to myselfat last, I was sitting at a great table, near the top of it; and I couldnot see the end of it, if it had any, it was so far off; and there wasmen beyond reckoning, sitting down, all along by it, at each side, as faras I could see at all. I did not know at first was it in the open air;but there was a close smothering feel in it, that was not natural, andthere was a kind of light that my eyesight never saw before, red andunsteady, and I did not see for a long time where it was coming from,until I looked straight up, and then I seen that it came from great ballsof blood-coloured fire, that were rolling high over head with a sort ofrushing, trembling sound, and I perceived that they shone on the ribs ofa great roof of rock that was arched overhead instead of the sky. When Iseen this, scarce knowing what I did, I got up, and I said, 'I have noright to be here; I must go,' and the man that was sitting at my lefthand, only smiled, and said, 'sit down again, you can _never_ leave thisplace,' and his voice was weaker than any child's voice I ever heerd, andwhen he was done speaking he smiled again. Then I spoke out very loud andbold, and I said--'in the name of God, let me out of this bad place.' Andthere was a great man, that I did not see before, sitting at the end ofthe table that I was near, and he was taller than twelve men, and hisface was very proud and terrible to look at, and he stood up andstretched out his hand before him, and when he stood up, all that wasthere, great and small, bowed down with a sighing sound, and a dread cameon my heart, and he looked at me, and I could not speak. I felt I was hisown, to do what he liked with, for I knew at once who he was, and hesaid, 'if you promise to return, you may depart for a season'; and thevoice he spoke with was terrible and mournful, and the echoes of it wentrolling and swelling down the endless cave, and mixing with the tremblingof the fire overhead; so that, when he sate down, there was a sound afterhim, all through the place like the roaring of a furnace, and I said,with all the strength I had, 'I promise to come back; in God's name letme go,' and with that I lost the sight and the hearing of all that wasthere, and when my senses came to me again, I was sitting in the bed withthe blood all over me, and you and the rest praying around the room."Here he paused and wiped away the chill drops of horror which hung uponhis forehead.I remained silent for some moments. The vision which he had justdescribed struck my imagination not a little, for this was long beforeVathek and the "Hall of Iblis" had delighted the world; and thedescription which he gave had, as I received it, all the attractions ofnovelty beside the impressiveness which always belongs to the narrationof an _eye-witness_, whether in the body or in the spirit, of the sceneswhich he describes. There was something, too, in the stern horror withwhich the man related these things, and in the incongruity of hisdescription, with the vulgarly received notions of the great place ofpunishment, and of its presiding spirit, which struck my mind with awe,almost with fear. At length he said, with an expression of horrible,imploring earnestness, which I shall never forget--"Well, sir, is thereany hope; is there any chance at all? or, is my soul pledged and promisedaway for ever? is it gone out of my power? must I go back to the place?"In answering him I had no easy task to perform; for however clear mightbe my internal conviction of the groundlessness of his fears, and howeverstrong my scepticism respecting the reality of what he had described, Inevertheless felt that his impression to the contrary, and his humilityand terror resulting from it, might be made available as no mean enginesin the work of his conversion from profligacy, and of his restoration todecent habits, and to religious feeling. I therefore told him that he wasto regard his dream rather in the light of a warning than in that of aprophecy; that our salvation depended not upon the word or deed of amoment, but upon the habits of a life; that, in fine, if he at oncediscarded his idle companions and evil habits, and firmly adhered to asober, industrious, and religious course of life, the powers of darknessmight claim his soul in vain, for that there were higher and firmerpledges than human tongue could utter, which promised salvation to himwho should repent and lead a new life.I left him much comforted, and with a promise to return upon the nextday. I did so, and found him much more cheerful, and without any remainsof the dogged sullenness which I suppose had arisen from his despair.His promises of amendment were given in that tone of deliberateearnestness, which belongs to deep and solemn determination; and it waswith no small delight that I observed, after repeated visits, that hisgood resolutions, so far from failing, did but gather strength by time;and when I saw that man shake off the idle and debauched companions,whose society had for years formed alike his amusement and his ruin, andrevive his long discarded habits of industry and sobriety, I said withinmyself, there is something more in all this than the operation of anidle dream. One day, sometime after his perfect restoration to health, Iwas surprised on ascending the stairs, for the purpose of visiting thisman, to find him busily employed in nailing down some planks upon thelanding place, through which, at the commencement of his mysteriousvision, it seemed to him that he had sunk. I perceived at once that hewas strengthening the floor with a view to securing himself against sucha catastrophe, and could scarcely forbear a smile as I bid "God blesshis work."He perceived my thoughts, I suppose, for he immediately said,"I can never pass over that floor without trembling. I'd leave thishouse if I could, but I can't find another lodging in the town so cheap,and I'll not take a better till I've paid off all my debts, please God;but I could not be asy in my mind till I made it as safe as I could.You'll hardly believe me, your honor, that while I'm working, maybe amile away, my heart is in a flutter the whole way back, with the barethoughts of the two little steps I have to walk upon this bit of afloor. So it's no wonder, sir, I'd thry to make it sound and firm withany idle timber I have."I applauded his resolution to pay off his debts, and the steadiness withwhich he pursued his plans of conscientious economy, and passed on.Many months elapsed, and still there appeared no alteration in hisresolutions of amendment. He was a good workman, and with his betterhabits he recovered his former extensive and profitable employment. Everything seemed to promise comfort and respectability. I have little more toadd, and that shall be told quickly. I had one evening met Pat Connell,as he returned from his work, and as usual, after a mutual, and on hisside respectful salutation, I spoke a few words of encouragement andapproval. I left him industrious, active, healthy--when next I saw him,not three days after, he was a corpse. The circumstances which marked theevent of his death were somewhat strange--I might say fearful. Theunfortunate man had accidentally met an early friend, just returned,after a long absence, and in a moment of excitement, forgettingeverything in the warmth of his joy, he yielded to his urgent invitationto accompany him into a public house, which lay close by the spot wherethe encounter had taken place. Connell, however, previously to enteringthe room, had announced his determination to take nothing more than thestrictest temperance would warrant. But oh! who can describe theinveterate tenacity with which a drunkard's habits cling to him throughlife. He may repent--he may reform--he may look with actual abhorrenceupon his past profligacy; but amid all this reformation and compunction,who can tell the moment in which the base and ruinous propensity may notrecur, triumphing over resolution, remorse, shame, everything, andprostrating its victim once more in all that is destructive and revoltingin that fatal vice.The wretched man left the place in a state of utter intoxication. He wasbrought home nearly insensible, and placed in his bed, where he lay inthe deep calm lethargy of drunkenness. The younger part of the familyretired to rest much after their usual hour; but the poor wife remainedup sitting by the fire, too much grieved and shocked at the recurrence ofwhat she had so little expected, to settle to rest; fatigue, however, atlength overcame her, and she sunk gradually into an uneasy slumber. Shecould not tell how long she had remained in this state, when sheawakened, and immediately on opening her eyes, she perceived by the faintred light of the smouldering turf embers, two persons, one of whom sherecognized as her husband noiselessly gliding out of the room."Pat, darling, where are you going?" said she. There was no answer--thedoor closed after them; but in a moment she was startled and terrified bya loud and heavy crash, as if some ponderous body had been hurled downthe stair. Much alarmed, she started up, and going to the head of thestaircase, she called repeatedly upon her husband, but in vain. Shereturned to the room, and with the assistance of her daughter, whom I hadoccasion to mention before, she succeeded in finding and lighting acandle, with which she hurried again to the head of the staircase. At thebottom lay what seemed to be a bundle of clothes, heaped together,motionless, lifeless--it was her husband. In going down the stairs, forwhat purpose can never now be known, he had fallen helplessly andviolently to the bottom, and coming head foremost, the spine at the neckhad been dislocated by the shock, and instant death must have ensued. Thebody lay upon that landing-place to which his dream had referred. It isscarcely worth endeavouring to clear up a single point in a narrativewhere all is mystery; yet I could not help suspecting that the secondfigure which had been seen in the room by Connell's wife on the night ofhis death, might have been no other than his own shadow. I suggested thissolution of the difficulty; but she told me that the unknown person hadbeen considerably in advance of the other, and on reaching the door, hadturned back as if to communicate something to his companion--it was thena mystery. Was the dream verified?--whither had the disembodied spiritsped?--who can say? We know not. But I left the house of death that dayin a state of horror which I could not describe. It seemed to me that Iwas scarce awake. I heard and saw everything as if under the spell of anightmare. The coincidence was terrible.       *       *       *       *       *THE GHOST AND THE BONE-SETTERIn looking over the papers of my late valued and respected friend,Francis Purcell, who for nearly fifty years discharged the arduous dutiesof a parish priest in the south of Ireland, I met with the followingdocument. It is one of many such, for he was a curious and industriouscollector of old local traditions--a commodity in which the quarter wherehe resided mightily abounded. The collection and arrangement of suchlegends was, as long as I can remember him, his _hobby_; but I had neverlearned that his love of the marvellous and whimsical had carried him sofar as to prompt him to commit the results of his enquiries to writing,until, in the character of _residuary legatee_, his will put me inpossession of all his manuscript papers. To such as may think thecomposing of such productions as these inconsistent with the characterand habits of a country priest, it is necessary to observe, that theredid exist a race of priests--those of the old school, a race now nearlyextinct--whose habits were from many causes more refined, and whosetastes more literary than are those of the alumni of Maynooth.It is perhaps necessary to add that the superstition illustrated by thefollowing story, namely, that the corpse last buried is obliged, duringhis juniority of interment, to supply his brother tenants of thechurchyard in which he lies, with fresh water to allay the burning thirstof purgatory, is prevalent throughout the south of Ireland. The writercan vouch for a case in which a respectable and wealthy farmer, on theborders of Tipperary, in tenderness to the corns of his departedhelpmate, enclosed in her coffin two pair of brogues, a light and aheavy, the one for dry, the other for sloppy weather; seeking thus tomitigate the fatigues of her inevitable perambulations in procuringwater, and administering it to the thirsty souls of purgatory. Fierce anddesperate conflicts have ensued in the case of two funeral partiesapproaching the same churchyard together, each endeavouring to secure tohis own dead priority of sepulture, and a consequent immunity from thetax levied upon the pedestrian powers of the last comer. An instance notlong since occurred, in which one of two such parties, through fear oflosing to their deceased friend this inestimable advantage, made theirway to the churchyard by a _short cut_, and in violation of one of theirstrongest prejudices, actually threw the coffin over the wall, lest timeshould be lost in making their entrance through the gate. Innumerableinstances of the same kind might be quoted, all tending to show howstrongly, among the peasantry of the south, this superstition isentertained. However, I shall not detain the reader further, by anyprefatory remarks, but shall proceed to lay before him the following:--_Extract from the Ms. Papers of the Late Rev. Francis Purcell, ofDrumcoolagh_"I tell the following particulars, as nearly as I can recollect them,in the words of the narrator. It may be necessary to observe that hewas what is termed a _well-spoken_ man, having for a considerable timeinstructed the ingenious youth of his native parish in such of theliberal arts and sciences as he found it convenient to profess--acircumstance which may account for the occurrence of several bigwords, in the course of this narrative, more distinguished foreuphonious effect, than for correctness of application. I proceedthen, without further preface, to lay before you the wonderfuladventures of Terry Neil."Why, thin, 'tis a quare story, an' as thrue as you're sittin' there; andI'd make bould to say there isn't a boy in the seven parishes could tellit better nor crickther than myself, for 'twas my father himself ithappened to, an' many's the time I heerd it out iv his own mouth; an' Ican say, an' I'm proud av that same, my father's word was as incredibleas any squire's oath in the counthry; and so signs an' if a poor man gotinto any unlucky throuble, he was the boy id go into the court an' prove;but that dosen't signify--he was as honest and as sober a man, barrin' hewas a little bit too partial to the glass, as you'd find in a day's walk;an' there wasn't the likes of him in the counthry round for natelabourin' an' _baan_ diggin'; and he was mighty handy entirely forcarpenther's work, and mendin' ould spudethrees, an' the likes i' that.An' so he tuck up with bone-setting, as was most nathural, for none ofthem could come up to him in mendin' the leg iv a stool or a table; an'sure, there never was a bone-setter got so much custom--man an' child,young an' ould--there never was such breakin' and mendin' of bones knownin the memory of man. Well, Terry Neil, for that was my father's name,began to feel his heart growin' light and his purse heavy; an' he took abit iv a farm in Squire Phalim's ground, just undher the ould castle, an'a pleasant little spot it was; an' day an' mornin', poor crathurs notable to put a foot to the ground, with broken arms and broken legs, id becomin' ramblin' in from all quarters to have their bones spliced up.Well, yer honour, all this was as well as well could be; but it wascustomary when Sir Phelim id go any where out iv the country, for some ivthe tinants to sit up to watch in the ould castle, just for a kind of acompliment to the ould family--an' a mighty unpleasant compliment it wasfor the tinants, for there wasn't a man of them but knew there was something quare about the ould castle. The neighbours had it, that thesquire's ould grandfather, as good a gintleman, God be with him, as Iheer'd as ever stood in shoe leather, used to keep walkin' about in themiddle iv the night, ever sinst he bursted a blood vessel pullin' out acork out iv a bottle, as you or I might be doin', and will too, plaseGod; but that dosen't signify. So, as I was sayin', the ould squire usedto come down out of the frame, where his picthur was hung up, and tobrake the bottles and glasses, God be marciful to us all, an' dhrink allhe could come at--an' small blame to him for that same; and then if anyof the family id be comin' in, he id be up again in his place, looking asquite an' innocent as if he didn't know any thing about it--themischievous ould chap."Well, your honour, as I was sayin', one time the family up at thecastle was stayin' in Dublin for a week or two; and so as usual, some ofthe tenants had to sit up in the castle, and the third night it kem tomy father's turn. 'Oh, tare an ouns,' says he unto himself, 'an' must Isit up all night, and that ould vagabond of a sperit, glory be to God,'says he, 'serenading through the house, an' doin' all sorts ivmischief.' However, there was no gettin' aff, and so he put a bould faceon it, an' he went up at nightfall with a bottle of pottieen, andanother of holy wather."It was rainin' smart enough, an' the evenin' was darksome and gloomy,when my father got in, and the holy wather he sprinkled on himself, itwasn't long till he had to swallee a cup iv the pottieen, to keep thecowld out iv his heart. It was the ould steward, Lawrence Connor, thatopened the door--and he an' my father wor always very great. So when heseen who it was, an' my father tould him how it was his turn to watch inthe castle, he offered to sit up along with him; and you may be sure myfather wasn't sorry for that same. So says Larry,"'We'll have a bit iv fire in the parlour,' says he."'An' why not in the hall?' says my father, for he knew that the squire'spicthur was hung in the parlour."'No fire can be lit in the hall,' says Lawrence, 'for there's an ouldjackdaw's nest in the chimney.'"'Oh thin,' says my father, 'let us stop in the kitchen, for it's veryumproper for the likes iv me to be sittin' in the parlour,' says he."'Oh, Terry, that can't be,' says Lawrence; 'if we keep up the ouldcustom at all, we may as well keep it up properly,' says he."'Divil sweep the ould custom,' says my father--to himself, do ye mind,for he didn't like to let Lawrence see that he was more afeard himself."'Oh, very well,' says he. 'I'm agreeable, Lawrence,' says he; and sodown they both went to the kitchen, until the fire id be lit in theparlour--an' that same wasn't long doin'."Well, your honour, they soon wint up again, an' sat down mightycomfortable by the parlour fire, and they beginn'd to talk, an' to smoke,an' to dhrink a small taste iv the pottieen; and, moreover, they had agood rousing fire of bogwood and turf, to warm their shins over."Well, sir, as I was sayin' they kep convarsin' and smokin' togethermost agreeable, until Lawrence beginn'd to get sleepy, as was butnathural for him, for he was an ould sarvint man, and was used to agreat dale iv sleep."'Sure it's impossible,' says my father, 'it's gettin' sleepy you are?'"'Oh, divil a taste,' says Larry, 'I'm only shuttin' my eyes,' says he,'to keep out the parfume of the tibacky smoke, that's makin' themwather,' says he. 'So don't you mind other people's business,' says hestiff enough (for he had a mighty high stomach av his own, rest hissowl), 'and go on,' says he, 'with your story, for I'm listenin',' sayshe, shuttin' down his eyes."Well, when my father seen spakin' was no use, he went on with hisstory.--By the same token, it was the story of Jim Soolivan and his ouldgoat he was tellin'--an' a pleasant story it is--an' there was so muchdivarsion in it, that it was enough to waken a dormouse, let alone topervint a Christian goin' asleep. But, faix, the way my father tould it,I believe there never was the likes heerd sinst nor before for he bawledout every word av it, as if the life was fairly leavin' him thrying tokeep ould Larry awake; but, faix, it was no use, for the hoorsness camean him, an' before he kem to the end of his story, Larry O'Connorbeginned to snore like a bagpipes."'Oh, blur an' agres,' says my father, 'isn't this a hard case,' sayshe, 'that ould villain, lettin' on to be my friend, and to go asleepthis way, an' us both in the very room with a sperit,' says he. 'Thecrass o' Christ about us,' says he; and with that he was goin' to shakeLawrence to waken him, but he just remimbered if he roused him, thathe'd surely go off to his bed, an lave him completely alone, an' that idbe by far worse."'Oh thin,' says my father, 'I'll not disturb the poor boy. It id beneither friendly nor good-nathured,' says he, 'to tormint him while he isasleep,' says he; 'only I wish I was the same way myself,' says he."An' with that he beginned to walk up an' down, an' sayin' his prayers,until he worked himself into a sweat, savin' your presence. But it wasall no good; so he dhrunk about a pint of sperits, to compose his mind."'Oh,' says he, 'I wish to the Lord I was as asy in my mind as Larrythere. Maybe,' says he, 'if I thried I could go asleep'; an' with that hepulled a big arm-chair close beside Lawrence, an' settled himself in itas well as he could."But there was one quare thing I forgot to tell you. He couldn't help, inspite av himself, lookin' now an' thin at the picthur, an' he immediatelyobserved that the eyes av it was follyin' him about, an' starin' at him,an' winkin' at him, wherever he wint. 'Oh,' says he, when he seen that,'it's a poor chance I have,' says he; 'an' bad luck was with me the day Ikem into this unforthunate place,' says he; 'but any way there's no usein bein' freckened now,' says he; 'for if I am to die, I may as wellparspire undaunted,' says he."Well, your honour, he thried to keep himself quite an' asy, an' hethought two or three times he might have wint asleep, but for the way thestorm was groanin' and creekin' through the great heavy branches outside,an' whistlin' through the ould chimnies iv the castle. Well, afther onegreat roarin' blast iv the wind, you'd think the walls iv the castle wasjust goin' to fall, quite an' clane, with the shakin' iv it. All av asuddint the storm stopt, as silent an' as quite as if it was a Julyevenin'. Well, your honour, it wasn't stopped blowin' for three minnites,before he thought he hard a sort iv a noise over the chimney-piece; an'with that my father just opened his eyes the smallest taste in life, an'sure enough he seen the ould squire gettin' out iv the picthur, for allthe world as if he was throwin' aff his ridin' coat, until he stept outclane an' complate, out av the chimly-piece, an' thrun himself down anthe floor. Well, the slieveen ould chap--an' my father thought it was thedirtiest turn iv all--before he beginned to do anything out iv the way,he stopped, for a while, to listen wor they both asleep; an' as soon ashe thought all was quite, he put out his hand, and tuck hould iv thewhiskey bottle, an' dhrank at laste a pint iv it. Well, your honour, whenhe tuck his turn out iv it, he settled it back mighty cute intirely, inthe very same spot it was in before. An' he beginn'd to walk up an' downthe room, lookin' as sober an' as solid as if he never done the likes atall. An' whinever he went apast my father, he thought he felt a greatscent of brimstone, an' it was that that freckened him entirely; for heknew it was brimstone that was burned in hell, savin' your presence. Atany rate, he often heer'd it from Father Murphy, an' he had a right toknow what belonged to it--he's dead since, God rest him. Well, yourhonour, my father was asy enough until the sperit kem past him; so close,God be marciful to us all, that the smell iv the sulphur tuck the breathclane out iv him; an' with that he tuck such a fit iv coughin', that ital-a-most shuck him out iv the chair he was sittin' in."'Ho, ho!' says the squire, stoppin' short about two steps aff, andturnin' round facin' my father, 'is it you that's in it?--an' how's allwith you, Terry Neil?'"'At your honour's sarvice,' says my father (as well as the fright id lethim, for he was more dead than alive), 'an' it's proud I am to see yourhonour to-night,' says he."'Terence,' says the squire, 'you're a respectable man (an' it was thruefor him), an industhrious, sober man, an' an example of inebriety to thewhole parish,' says he."'Thank your honour,' says my father, gettin' courage, 'you were always acivil spoken gintleman, God rest your honour.'"'Rest my honour,' says the sperit (fairly gettin' red in the face withthe madness), 'Rest my honour?' says he. 'Why, you ignorant spalpeen,'says he, 'you mane, niggarly ignoramush,' says he, 'where did you laveyour manners?' says he. 'If I _am_ dead, it's no fault iv mine,' says he;'an' it's not to be thrun in my teeth at every hand's turn, by the likesiv you,' says he, stampin' his foot an the flure, that you'd think theboords id smash undher him."'Oh,' says my father, 'I'm only a foolish, ignorant, poor man,' says he."'You're nothing else,' says the squire; 'but any way,' says he, 'it'snot to be listenin' to your gosther, nor convarsin' with the likes ivyou, that I came _up_--down I mane,' says he--(an' as little as themistake was, my father tuck notice iv it). 'Listen to me now, TerenceNeil,' says he, 'I was always a good masther to Pathrick Neil, yourgrandfather,' says he."'Tis thrue for your honour,' says my father."'And, moreover, I think I was always a sober, riglar gintleman,' saysthe squire."'That's your name, sure enough,' says my father (though it was a big liefor him, but he could not help it)."'Well,' says the sperit, 'although I was as sober as most men--at lasteas most gintlemen'--says he; 'an' though I was at different pariods amost extempory Christian, and most charitable and inhuman to the poor,'says he; 'for all that I'm not as asy where I am now,' says he, 'as I hada right to expect,' says he."'An' more's the pity,' says my father; 'maybe your honour id wish tohave a word with Father Murphy?'"'Hould your tongue, you misherable bliggard,' says the squire; 'it'snot iv my sowl I'm thinkin'--an' I wondher you'd have the impitence totalk to a gintleman consarnin' his sowl;--and when I want _that_ fixed,'says he, slappin' his thigh, 'I'll go to them that knows what belongs tothe likes,' says he. 'It's not my sowl,' says he, sittin' down oppositemy father; 'it's not my sowl that's annoyin' me most--I'm unasy on myright leg,' says he, 'that I bruck at Glenvarloch cover the day I killedblack Barney.'"(My father found out afther, it was a favourite horse that fell undherhim, afther leapin' the big fince that runs along by the glen.)"'I hope,' says my father, 'your honour's not unasy about thekillin' iv him?"'Hould your tongue, ye fool,' said the squire, 'an' I'll tell you whyI'm anasy an my leg,' says he. 'In the place, where I spend most iv mytime,' says he, 'except the little leisure I have for lookin' about mehere,' says he, 'I have to walk a great dale more than I was ever usedto,' says he, 'and by far more than is good for me either,' says he; 'forI must tell you,' says he, 'the people where I am is ancommonly fond ivcould wather, for there is nothin' betther to be had; an', moreover, theweather is hotter than is altogether plisint,' says he; 'and I'mappinted,' says he, 'to assist in carryin' the wather, an' gets a mightypoor share iv it myself,' says he, 'an' a mighty throublesome, warin' jobit is, I can tell you,' says he; 'for they're all iv them surprisinglydhry, an' dhrinks it as fast as my legs can carry it,' says he; 'but whatkills me intirely,' says he, 'is the wakeness in my leg,' says he, 'an' Iwant you to give it a pull or two to bring it to shape,' says he, 'andthat's the long an' the short iv it,' says he."'Oh, plase your honour,' says my father (for he didn't like to handlethe sperit at all), 'I wouldn't have the impitence to do the likes toyour honour,' says he; 'it's only to poor crathurs like myself I'd do itto,' says he."'None iv your blarney,' says the squire, 'here's my leg,' says he,cockin' it up to him, 'pull it for the bare life,' says he; 'an' if youdon't, by the immortial powers I'll not lave a bone in your carcish I'llnot powdher,' says he."'When my father heerd that, he seen there was no use in purtendin', sohe tuck hould iv the leg, an' he kept pullin' an' pullin', till thesweat, God bless us, beginned to pour down his face."'Pull, you divil', says the squire."'At your sarvice, your honour,' says my father."'Pull harder,' says the squire."My father pulled like the divil."'I'll take a little sup,' says the squire, rachin' over his hand to thebottle, 'to keep up my courage,' says he, lettin' an to be very wake inhimself intirely. But, as cute as he was, he was out here, for he tuckthe wrong one. 'Here's to your good health, Terence,' says he, 'an' nowpull like the very divil,' 'an' with that he lifted the bottle of holywather, but it was hardly to his mouth, whin he let a screech out, you'dthink the room id fairly split with it, an' made one chuck that sent theleg clane aff his body in my father's hands; down wint the squire overthe table, an' bang wint my father half way across the room on his back,upon the flure. Whin he kem to himself the cheerful mornin' sun wasshinin' through the windy shutthers, an' he was lying flat an his back,with the leg iv one of the great ould chairs pulled clane out iv thesocket an' tight in his hand, pintin' up to the ceilin', an' ould Larryfast asleep, an' snorin' as loud as ever. My father wint that mornin' toFather Murphy, an' from that to the day of his death, he never neglectedconfission nor mass, an' what he tould was betther believed that he spakeav it but seldom. An', as for the squire, that is the sperit, whether itwas that he did not like his liquor, or by rason iv the loss iv his leg,he was never known to walk again."       *       *       *       *       *THE MYSTERIOUS LODGERPART IAbout the year 1822 I resided in a comfortable and roomy old house, theexact locality of which I need not particularise, further than to saythat it was not very far from Old Brompton, in the immediateneighbourhood, or rather continuity (as even my Connemara readersperfectly well know), of the renowned city of London.Though this house was roomy and comfortable, as I have said, it was not,by any means, a handsome one. It was composed of dark red brick, withsmall windows, and thick white sashes; a porch, too--none of your flimsytrellis-work, but a solid projection of the same vermillionmasonry--surmounted by a leaded balcony, with heavy, half-rottenbalustrades, darkened the hall-door with a perennial gloom. The mansionitself stood in a walled enclosure, which had, perhaps, from the date ofthe erection itself, been devoted to shrubs and flowers. Some of theformer had grown there almost to the dignity of trees; and two darklittle yews stood at each side of the porch, like swart and inauspiciousdwarfs, guarding the entrance of an enchanted castle. Not that mydomicile in any respect deserved the comparison: it had no reputation asa haunted house; if it ever had any ghosts, nobody remembered them. Itshistory was not known to me: it may have witnessed plots, cabals, andforgeries, bloody suicides and cruel murders. It was certainly old enoughto have become acquainted with iniquity; a small stone slab, under thebalustrade, and over the arch of the porch I mentioned, had the date1672, and a half-effaced coat of arms, which I might have deciphered anyday, had I taken the trouble to get a ladder, but always put it off. AllI can say for the house is, that it was well stricken in years, with acertain air of sombre comfort about it; contained a vast number of roomsand closets; and, what was of far greater importance, was got by me adead bargain.Its individuality attracted me. I grew fond of it for itself, and for itsassociations, until other associations of a hateful kind first disturbed,and then destroyed, their charm. I forgave its dull red brick, andpinched white windows, for the sake of the beloved and cheerful faceswithin: its ugliness was softened by its age; and its sombre evergreens,and moss-grown stone flower-pots, were relieved by the brilliant hues ofa thousand gay and graceful flowers that peeped among them, or noddedover the grass.Within that old house lay my life's treasure! I had a darling littlegirl of nine, and another little darling--a boy--just four years of age;and dearer, unspeakably, than either--a wife--the prettiest, gayest,best little wife in all London. When I tell you that our income wasscarcely L380 a-year, you will perceive that our establishment cannothave been a magnificent one; yet, I do assure you, we were morecomfortable than a great many lords, and happier, I dare say, than thewhole peerage put together.This happiness was not, however, what it ought to have been. The readerwill understand at once, and save me a world of moralisingcircumlocution, when he learns, bluntly and nakedly, that, among all mycomforts and blessings, I was an infidel.I had not been without religious training; on the contrary, more thanaverage pains had been bestowed upon my religious instruction from myearliest childhood. My father, a good, plain, country clergyman, hadworked hard to make me as good as himself; and had succeeded, at least,in training me in godly habits. He died, however, when I was but twelveyears of age; and fate had long before deprived me of the gentle care ofa mother. A boarding-school, followed by a college life, where nobodyhaving any very direct interest in realising in my behalf the ancientblessing, that in fulness of time I should "die a good old man," I wasleft very much to my own devices, which, in truth, were none of the best.Among these were the study of Voltaire, Tom Paine, Hume, Shelley, and thewhole school of infidels, poetical as well as prose. This pursuit, andthe all but blasphemous vehemence with which I gave myself up to it, was,perhaps, partly reactionary. A somewhat injudicious austerity andprecision had indissolubly associated in my childish days the ideas ofrestraint and gloom with religion. I bore it a grudge; and so, when Ibecame thus early my own master, I set about paying off, after my ownfashion, the old score I owed it. I was besides, like every other younginfidel whom it has been my fate to meet, a conceited coxcomb. Asmattering of literature, without any real knowledge, and a greatassortment of all the cut-and-dry flippancies of the school I hadembraced, constituted my intellectual stock in trade. I was, like most ofmy school of philosophy, very proud of being an unbeliever; and fanciedmyself, in the complacency of my wretched ignorance, at an immeasurableelevation above the church-going, Bible-reading herd, whom I treated witha good-humoured superciliousness which I thought vastly indulgent.My wife was an excellent little creature and truly pious. She had marriedme in the full confidence that my levity was merely put on, and would atonce give way before the influence she hoped to exert upon my mind. Poorlittle thing! she deceived herself. I allowed her, indeed, to do entirelyas she pleased; but for myself, I carried my infidelity to the length ofan absolute superstition. I made an ostentation of it. I would ratherhave been in a "hell" than in a church on Sunday; and though I did notprevent my wife's instilling her own principles into the minds of ourchildren, I, in turn, took especial care to deliver mine upon alloccasions in their hearing, by which means I trusted to sow the seeds ofthat unprejudiced scepticism in which I prided myself, at least as earlyas my good little partner dropped those of her own gentle "superstition"into their infant minds. Had I had my own absurd and impious will in thismatter, my children should have had absolutely no religious educationwhatsoever, and been left wholly unshackled to choose for themselvesamong all existing systems, infidelity included, precisely as chance,fancy, or interest might hereafter determine.It is not to be supposed that such a state of things did not afford hergreat uneasiness. Nevertheless, we were so very fond of one another,and in our humble way enjoyed so many blessings, that we were asentirely happy as any pair can be without the holy influence ofreligious sympathy.But the even flow of prosperity which had for so long gladdened my littlehousehold was not destined to last for ever. It was ordained that Ishould experience the bitter truth of more than one of the wise man'sproverbs, and first, especially, of that which declares that "he thathateth suretyship is sure." I found myself involved (as how many havebeen before) by a "d--d good-natured friend," for more than two hundredpounds. This agreeable intelligence was conveyed to me in an attorney'sletter, which, to obviate unpleasant measures, considerately advised mypaying the entire amount within just one week of the date of his pleasantepistle. Had I been called upon within that time to produce the Pittdiamond, or to make title to the Buckingham estates, the demand wouldhave been just as easily complied with.I have no wish to bore my reader further with this little worry--a veryserious one to me, however--and it will be enough to mention, that thekindness of a friend extricated me from the clutches of the law by atimely advance, which, however, I was bound to replace within two years.To enable me to fulfill this engagement, my wife and I, after repeatedconsultations, resolved upon the course which resulted in the odd andunpleasant consequences which form the subject of this narrative.We resolved to advertise for a lodger, with or without board, &c.; and byresolutely submitting, for a single year, to the economy we hadprescribed for ourselves, as well as to the annoyance of a stranger'sintrusion, we calculated that at the end of that term we should haveliquidated our debt.Accordingly, without losing time, we composed an advertisement in themost tempting phraseology we could devise, consistently with thateconomic laconism which the cost per line in the columns of the _Times_newspaper imposes upon the rhetoric of the advertising public.Somehow we were unlucky; for although we repeated our public notificationthree times in the course of a fortnight, we had but two applications.The one was from a clergyman in ill health--a man of great ability andzealous piety, whom we both knew by reputation, and who has since beencalled to his rest. My good little wife was very anxious that we shouldclose with his offer, which was very considerably under what we had fixedupon; and I have no doubt that she was influenced by the hope that histalents and zeal might exert a happy influence upon my stubborn andunbelieving heart. For my part, his religious character displeased me. Idid not wish my children's heads to be filled with mythic dogmas--for soI judged the doctrines of our holy faith--and instinctively wished himaway. I therefore declined his offer; and I have often since thought notquite so graciously as I ought to have done. The other offer--if so itcan be called--was so very inadequate that we could not entertain it.I was now beginning to grow seriously uneasy--our little project, so farfrom bringing in the gains on which we had calculated, had put meconsiderably out of pocket; for, independently of the cost of theadvertisement I have mentioned, there were sundry little expensesinvolved in preparing for the meet reception of our expected inmate,which, under ordinary circumstances, we should not have dreamed of.Matters were in this posture, when an occurrence took place whichimmediately revived my flagging hopes.As we had no superfluity of servants, our children were early obliged toacquire habits of independence; and my little girl, then just nine yearsof age, was frequently consigned with no other care than that of her owngood sense, to the companionship of a little band of playmates, prettysimilarly circumstanced, with whom it was her wont to play. Having onefine summer afternoon gone out as usual with these little companions, shedid not return quite so soon as we had expected her; when she did so, shewas out of breath, and excited."Oh, papa," she said, "I have seen such a nice old, kind gentleman, andhe told me to tell you that he has a particular friend who wants alodging in a quiet place, and that he thinks your house would suit himexactly, and ever so much more; and, look here, he gave me this."She opened her hand, and shewed me a sovereign."Well, this does look promisingly," I said, my wife and I having firstexchanged a smiling glance."And what kind of gentleman was he, dear?" inquired she. "Was he welldressed--whom was he like?""He was not like any one that I know," she answered; "but he had verynice new clothes on, and he was one of the fattest men I ever saw; andI am sure he is sick, for he looks very pale, and he had a crutchbeside him.""Dear me, how strange!" exclaimed my wife; though, in truth there wasnothing very wonderful in the matter. "Go on, child," I said; "let ushear it all out.""Well, papa, he had such an immense yellow waistcoat!--I never did seesuch a waistcoat," she resumed; "and he was sitting or leaning, I can'tsay which, against the bank of the green lane; I suppose to rest himself,for he seems very weak, poor gentleman!""And how did you happen to speak to him?" asked my wife."When we were passing by, none of us saw him at all but I suppose heheard them talking to me, and saying my name; for he said,'Fanny--little Fanny--so, that's your name--come here child, I have aquestion to ask you.'""And so you went to him?" I said."Yes," she continued, "he beckoned to me, and I did go over to him, butnot very near, for I was greatly afraid of him at first.""Afraid! dear, and why afraid?" asked I."I was afraid, because he looked very old, very frightful, and as if hewould hurt me.""What was there so old and frightful about him?" I asked.She paused and reflected a little, and then said--"His face was very large and pale, and it was looking upwards: it seemedvery angry, I thought, but maybe it was angry from pain; and sometimesone side of it used to twitch and tremble for a minute, and then to growquite still again; and all the time he was speaking to me, he neverlooked at me once, but always kept his face and eyes turned upwards; buthis voice was very soft, and he called me little Fanny, and gave me thispound to buy toys with; so I was not so frightened in a little time, andthen he sent a long message to you, papa, and told me if I forgot it hewould beat me; but I knew he was only joking, so that did not frightenme either.""And what was the message, my girl?" I asked, patting her pretty headwith my hand."Now, let me remember it all," she said, reflectively; "for he told it tome twice. He asked me if there was a good bedroom at the top of thehouse, standing by itself--and you know there is, so I told him so; itwas exactly the kind of room that he described. And then he said that hisfriend would pay two hundred pounds a-year for that bedroom, his boardand attendance; and he told me to ask you, and have your answer when heshould next meet me.""Two hundred pounds!" ejaculated my poor little wife; "why that is nearlytwice as much as we expected.""But did he say that his friend was sick, or very old; or that he had anyservant to be supported also?" I asked."Oh! no; he told me that he was quite able to take care of himself, andthat he had, I think he called it, an asthma, but nothing else thematter; and that he would give no trouble at all, and that any friend whocame to see him, he would see, not in the house, but only in the garden.""In the garden!" I echoed, laughing in spite of myself."Yes, indeed he said so; and he told me to say that he would pay onehundred pounds when he came here, and the next hundred in six months, andso on," continued she."Oh, ho! half-yearly in advance--better and better," said I."And he bid me say, too, if you should ask about his character, that heis just as good as the master of the house himself," she added; "and whenhe said that, he laughed a little.""Why, if he gives us a hundred pounds in advance," I answered, turning tomy wife, "we are safe enough; for he will not find half that value inplate and jewels in the entire household, if he is disposed to rob us. SoI see no reason against closing with the offer, should it be seriouslymeant--do you, dear?""Quite the contrary, love," said she. "I think it most desirable--indeed,most _providential_.""Providential! my dear little bigot!" I repeated, with a smile. "Well, beit so. I call it _lucky_ merely; but, perhaps, you are happier in yourfaith, than I in my philosophy. Yes, you are _grateful_ for the chancethat I only rejoice at. You receive it as a proof of a divine and tenderlove--I as an accident. Delusions are often more elevating than truth."And so saying, I kissed away the saddened cloud that for a momentovercast her face."Papa, he bid me be sure to have an answer for him when we meet again,"resumed the child. "What shall I say to him when he asks me?""Say that we agree to his proposal, my dear--or stay," I said, addressingmy wife, "may it not be prudent to reduce what the child says to writing,and accept the offer so? This will prevent misunderstanding, as she maypossibly have made some mistake."My wife agreed, and I wrote a brief note, stating that I was willing toreceive an inmate upon the terms recounted by little Fanny, and which Idistinctly specified, so that no mistake could possibly arise owing tothe vagueness of what lawyers term a parole agreement. This importantmemorandum I placed in the hands of my little girl, who was to deliverit whenever the old gentleman in the yellow waistcoat should chance tomeet her. And all these arrangements completed, I awaited the issue ofthe affair with as much patience as I could affect. Meanwhile, my wifeand I talked it over incessantly; and she, good little soul, almost woreherself to death in settling and unsettling the furniture anddecorations of our expected inmate's apartments. Days passed away--daysof hopes deferred, tedious and anxious. We were beginning to despondagain, when one morning our little girl ran into the breakfast-parlour,more excited even than she had been before, and fresh from a newinterview with the gentleman in the yellow waistcoat. She hadencountered him suddenly, pretty nearly where she had met him before,and the result was, that he had read the little note I have mentioned,and desired the child to inform me that his friend, _Mr. Smith_, wouldtake possession of the apartments I proposed setting, on the termsagreed between us, that very evening."This evening!" exclaimed my wife and I simultaneously--_I_ full of theidea of making a first instalment on the day following; _she_, of thehundred-and-one preparations which still remained to be completed."And so Smith is his name! Well, that does not tell us much," said I;"but where did you meet your friend on this occasion, and how long isit since?""Near the corner of the wall-flower lane (so we indicated one whichabounded in these fragrant plants); he was leaning with his back againstthe old tree you cut my name on, and his crutch was under his arm.""But how long ago?" I urged."Only this moment; I ran home as fast as I could," she replied."Why, you little blockhead, you should have told me that at first," Icried, snatching up my hat, and darting away in pursuit of the yellowwaistcoat, whose acquaintance I not unnaturally coveted, inasmuch as aman who, for the first time, admits a stranger into his house, on thefooting of permanent residence, desires generally to know a little moreabout him than that his name is Smith.The place indicated was only, as we say, a step away; and as yellowwaistcoat was fat, and used a crutch, I calculated on easily overtakinghim. I was, however, disappointed; crutch, waistcoat, and all haddisappeared. I climbed to the top of the wall, and from this commandingpoint of view made a sweeping observation--but in vain. I returnedhome, cursing my ill-luck, the child's dulness, and the fat oldfellow's activity.I need hardly say that Mr. Smith, in all his aspects, moral, social,physical, and monetary, formed a fruitful and interesting topic ofspeculation during dinner. How many phantom Smiths, short and long, stoutand lean, ill-tempered and well-tempered--rich, respectable, or highlydangerous merchants, spies, forgers, nabobs, swindlers, danced before us,in the endless mazes of fanciful conjecture, during that anxious_tete-a-tete_, which was probably to be interrupted by the arrival of thegentleman himself.My wife and I puzzled over the problem as people would over the possible_denouement_ of a French novel; and at last, by mutual consent, we cameto the conclusion that Smith could, and would turn out to be no otherthan the good-natured valetudinarian in the yellow waistcoat himself, ahumorist, as was evident enough, and a millionaire, as we unhesitatinglypronounced, who had no immediate relatives, and as I hoped, and my wife"was certain," taken a decided fancy to our little Fanny; I patted thechild's head with something akin to pride, as I thought of themagnificent, though remote possibilities, in store for her.Meanwhile, hour after hour stole away. It was a beautiful autumn evening,and the amber lustre of the declining sun fell softly upon the yews andflowers, and gave an air, half melancholy, half cheerful, to the dark-redbrick piers surmounted with their cracked and grass-grown stone urns, andfurnished with the light foliage of untended creeping plants. Down theshort broad walk leading to this sombre entrance, my eye constantlywandered; but no impatient rattle on the latch, no battering at the gate,indicated the presence of a visited, and the lazy bell hung dumbly amongthe honey-suckles."When will he come? Yellow waistcoat promised _this evening_! It hasbeen evening a good hour and a half, and yet he is not here. When willhe come? It will soon be dark--the evening will have passed--will hecome at all?"Such were the uneasy speculations which began to trouble us. Redder andduskier grew the light of the setting sun, till it saddened into themists of night. Twilight came, and then darkness, and still no arrival,no summons at the gate. I would not admit even to my wife the excess ofmy own impatience. I could, however, stand it no longer; so I took my hatand walked to the gate, where I stood by the side of the public road,watching every vehicle and person that approached, in a fever ofexpectation. Even these, however, began to fail me, and the road grewcomparatively quiet and deserted. Having kept guard like a sentinel formore than half an hour, I returned in no very good humour, with thepunctuality of an expected inmate--ordered the servant to draw thecurtains and secure the hall-door; and so my wife and I sate down to ourdisconsolate cup of tea. It must have been about ten o'clock, and we wereboth sitting silently--she working, I looking moodily into a paper--andneither of us any longer entertaining a hope that anything butdisappointment would come of the matter, when a sudden tapping, very loudand sustained, upon the window pane, startled us both in an instant fromour reveries.I am not sure whether I mentioned before that the sitting-room weoccupied was upon the ground-floor, and the sward came close under thewindow. I drew the curtains, and opened the shutters with a revived hope;and looking out, saw a very tall thin figure, a good deal wrapped up,standing about a yard before me, and motioning with head and handimpatiently towards the hall-door. Though the night was clear, there wasno moon, and therefore I could see no more than the black outline, likethat of an _ombre chinoise_ figure, signing to me with mop and moe. In amoment I was at the hall-door, candle in hand; the stranger stept in--hislong fingers clutched in the handle of a valise, and a bag which trailedupon the ground behind him.The light fell full upon him. He wore a long, ill-made, black surtout,buttoned across, and which wrinkled and bagged about his lank figure; hishat was none of the best, and rather broad in the brim; a sort of whitewoollen muffler enveloped the lower part of his face; a pair of prominentgreen goggles, fenced round with leather, completely concealed his eyes;and nothing of the genuine man, but a little bit of yellow forehead, anda small transverse segment of equally yellow cheek and nose, encounteredthe curious gaze of your humble servant."You are--I suppose"--I began; for I really was a little doubtfulabout my man."Mr. Smith--the same; be good enough to show me to my bedchamber,"interrupted the stranger, brusquely, and in a tone which, spite of themuffler that enveloped his mouth, was sharp and grating enough."Ha!--Mr. Smith--so I supposed. I hope you may find everything ascomfortable as we desire to make it--"I was about making a speech, but was cut short by a slight bow, and adecisive gesture of the hand in the direction of the staircase. It wasplain that the stranger hated ceremony.Together, accordingly, we mounted the staircase; he still pulling hisluggage after him, and striding lightly up without articulating a word;and on reaching his bedroom, he immediately removed his hat, showing asinister, black scratch-wig underneath, and then began unrolling themighty woolen wrapping of his mouth and chin."Come," thought I, "we _shall_ see something of your face after all."This something, however, proved to be very little; for under his mufflerwas a loose cravat, which stood up in front of his chin and upon hismouth, he wore a respirator--an instrument which I had never seen before,and of the use of which I was wholly ignorant.There was something so excessively odd in the effect of this piece ofunknown mechanism upon his mouth, surmounted by the huge goggles whichencased his eyes, that I believe I should have laughed outright, wereit not for a certain unpleasant and peculiar impressiveness in the_tout ensemble_ of the narrow-chested, long-limbed, and cadaverousfigure in black. As it was, we stood looking at one another in silencefor several seconds."Thank you, sir," at last he said, abruptly. "I shan't want anythingwhatever to-night; if you can only spare me this candle."I assented; and, becoming more communicative, he added--"I am, though an invalid, an independent sort of fellow enough. I am abit of a philosopher; I am my own servant, and, I hope, my own master,too. I rely upon myself in matters of the body and of the mind. I placevalets and priests in the same category--fellows who live by ourlaziness, intellectual or corporeal. I am a Voltaire, without hisluxuries--a Robinson Crusoe, without his Bible--an anchorite, without asuperstition--in short, my indulgence is asceticism, and my faithinfidelity. Therefore, I shan't disturb your servants much with my bell,nor yourselves with my psalmody. You have got a rational lodger, whoknows how to attend upon himself."During this singular address he was drawing off his ill-fitting blackgloves, and when he had done so, a bank-note, which had been slippedunderneath for safety, remained in his hand."Punctuality, sir, is one of my poor pleasures," he said; "will you allowme to enjoy it now? To-morrow you may acknowledge this; I should not restwere you to decline it."He extended his bony and discoloured fingers, and placed the note in myhand. Oh, Fortune and Plutus! It was a L100 bank-note."Pray, not one word, my dear sir," he continued, unbending still further;"it is simply done pursuant to agreement. We shall know one anotherbetter, I hope, in a little time; you will find me always equallypunctual. At present pray give yourself no further trouble; I requirenothing more. Good night."I returned the valediction, closed his door, and groped my way down thestairs. It was not until I had nearly reached the hall, that Irecollected that I had omitted to ask our new inmate at what hour hewould desire to be called in the morning, and so I groped my way backagain. As I reached the lobby on which his chamber opened, I perceived along line of light issuing from the partially-opened door, within whichstood Mr. Smith, the same odd figure I had just left; while along theboards was creeping towards him across the lobby, a great, big-headed,buff-coloured cat. I had never seen this ugly animal before; and it hadreached the threshold of his door, arching its back, and rubbing itselfon the post, before either appeared conscious of my approach, when, withan angry growl, it sprang into the stranger's room."What do you want?" he demanded, sharply, standing in the doorway.I explained my errand."I shall call myself," was his sole reply; and he shut the door with acrash that indicated no very pleasurable emotions.I cared very little about my lodger's temper. The stealthy rustle of hisbank-note in my waistcoat pocket was music enough to sweeten the harshesttones of his voice, and to keep alive a cheerful good humour in my heart;and although there was, indisputably, something queer about him, I was,on the whole, very well pleased with my bargain.The next day our new inmate did not ring his bell until noon. As soonas he had had some breakfast, of which he very sparingly partook, hetold the servant that, for the future, he desired that a certainquantity of milk and bread might be left outside his door; and thisbeing done, he would dispense with regular meals. He desired, too,that, on my return, I should be acquainted that he wished to see me inhis own room at about nine o'clock; and, meanwhile, he directed that heshould be left undisturbed. I found my little wife full of astonishmentat Mr. Smith's strange frugality and seclusion, and very curious tolearn the object of the interview he had desired with me. At nineo'clock I repaired to his room.I found him in precisely the costume in which I had left him--the samegreen goggles--the same muffling of the mouth, except that being now nomore than a broadly-folded black silk handkerchief, very loose, andcovering even the lower part of the nose, it was obviously intended forthe sole purpose of concealment. It was plain I was not to see more ofhis features than he had chosen to disclose at our first interview. Theeffect was as if the lower part of his face had some hideous wound orsore. He closed the door with his own hand on my entrance, noddedslightly, and took his seat. I expected him to begin, but he was so longsilent that I was at last constrained to address him.I said, for want of something more to the purpose, that I hoped he hadnot been tormented by the strange cat the night before."What cat?" he asked, abruptly; "what the plague do you mean?""Why, I certainly did see a cat go into your room last night," I resumed."Hey, and what if you did--though I fancy you dreamed it--I'm not afraidof a cat; are you?" he interrupted, tartly.At this moment there came a low growling mew from the closet which openedfrom the room in which we sat."Talk of the devil," said I, pointing towards the closet. My companion,without any exact change of expression, looked, I thought, somehowstill more sinister and lowering; and I felt for a moment a sort ofsuperstitious misgiving, which made the rest of the sentence die awayon my lips.Perhaps Mr. Smith perceived this, for he said, in a tone calculated toreassure me--"Well, sir, I think I am bound to tell you that I like my apartments verywell; they suit me, and I shall probably be your tenant for much longerthan at first you anticipated."I expressed my gratification.He then began to talk, something in the strain in which he had spoken ofhis own peculiarities of habit and thinking upon the previous evening. Hedisposed of all classes and denominations of superstition with an easysarcastic slang, which for me was so captivating, that I soon lost allreserve, and found myself listening and suggesting by turns--acquiescentand pleased--sometimes hazarding dissent; but whenever I did, foiled andfloored by a few pointed satirical sentences, whose sophistry, for such Imust now believe it, confounded me with a rapidity which, were it not forthe admiration with which he had insensibly inspired me, would havepiqued and irritated my vanity not a little.While this was going on, from time to time the mewing and growling of acat within the closet became more and more audible. At last these soundsbecame so loud, accompanied by scratching at the door, that I paused inthe midst of a sentence, and observed--"There certainly is a cat shut up in the closet?""Is there?" he ejaculated, in a surprised tone; "nay, I do not hear it."He rose abruptly and approached the door; his back was towards me, but Iobserved he raised the goggles which usually covered his eyes, and lookedsteadfastly at the closet door. The angry sounds all died away into alow, protracted growl, which again subsided into silence. He continued inthe same attitude for some moments, and then returned."I do not hear it," he said, as he resumed his place, and taking a bookfrom his capacious pocket, asked me if I had seen it before? I never had,and this surprised me, for I had flattered myself that I knew, at leastby name, every work published in England during the last fifty years infavour of that philosophy in which we both delighted. The book, moreover,was an odd one, as both its title and table of contents demonstrated.While we were discoursing upon these subjects, I became more and moredistinctly conscious of a new class of sounds proceeding from the samecloset. I plainly heard a measured and heavy tread, accompanied by thetapping of some hard and heavy substance like the end of a staff, pass upand down the floor--first, as it seemed, stealthily, and then more andmore unconcealedly. I began to feel very uncomfortable and suspicious. Asthe noise proceeded, and became more and more unequivocal, Mr. Smithabruptly rose, opened the closet door, just enough to admit his ownlath-like person, and steal within the threshold for some seconds. Whathe did I could not see--I felt conscious he had an associate concealedthere; and though my eyes remained fixed on the book, I could not avoidlistening for some audible words, or signal of caution. I heard, however,nothing of the kind. Mr. Smith turned back--walked a step or two towardsme, and said--"I fancied I heard a sound from that closet, but there isnothing--nothing--nothing whatever; bring the candle, let us both look."I obeyed with some little trepidation, for I fully anticipated that Ishould detect the intruder, of whose presence my own ears had given me,for nearly half an hour, the most unequivocal proofs. We entered thecloset together; it contained but a few chairs and a small spider table.At the far end of the room there was a sort of grey woollen cloth uponthe floor, and a bundle of something underneath it. I looked jealously atit, and half thought I could trace the outline of a human figure; but, ifso, it was perfectly motionless."Some of my poor wardrobe," he muttered, as he pointed his lean finger inthe direction. "It did not sound like a cat, did it--hey--did it?" hemuttered; and without attending to my answer, he went about theapartment, clapping his hands, and crying, "Hish--hish--hish!"The game, however, whatever it was, did not start. As I entered I hadseen, however, a large crutch reposing against the wall in the corneropposite to the door. This was the only article in the room, except thatI have mentioned, with which I was not familiar. With the exception ofour two selves, there was not a living creature to be seen there; noshadow but ours upon the bare walls; no feet but our own upon thecomfortless floor.I had never before felt so strange and unpleasant a sensation."There is nothing unusual in the room but that crutch," I said."What crutch, you dolt? I see no crutch," he ejaculated, in a tone ofsudden but suppressed fury."Why, _that_ crutch," I answered (for somehow I neither felt nor resentedhis rudeness), turning and pointing to the spot where I had seen it. Itwas gone!--it was neither there nor anywhere else. It must have been anillusion--rather an odd one, to be sure. And yet I could at this moment,with a safe conscience, _swear_ that I never saw an object moredistinctly than I had seen it but a second before.My companion was muttering fast to himself as we withdrew; his presencerather scared than reassured me; and I felt something almost amounting tohorror, as, holding the candle above his cadaverous and sable figure, hestood at his threshold, while I descended the stairs, and said, in a sortof whisper--"Why, but that I am, like yourself, a philosopher, I should say that yourhouse is--is--a--ha! ha! ha!--HAUNTED!""You look very pale, my love," said my wife, as I entered thedrawing-room, where she had been long awaiting my return. "Nothingunpleasant has happened?""Nothing, nothing, I assure you. Pale!--_do_ I look pale?" I answered."We are excellent friends, I assure you. So far from having had thesmallest disagreement, there is every prospect of our agreeing but toowell, as you will say; for I find that he holds all my opinions uponspeculative subjects. We have had a great deal of conversation thisevening, I assure you; and I never met, I think, so scholarlike andable a man.""I am sorry for it, dearest," she said, sadly. "The greater his talents,if such be his opinions, the more dangerous a companion is he."We turned, however, to more cheerful topics, and it was late before weretired to rest. I believe it was pride--perhaps only vanity--but, at allevents, some obstructive and stubborn instinct of my nature, which Icould not overcome--that prevented my telling my wife the odd occurrenceswhich had disturbed my visit to our guest. I was unable or ashamed toconfess that so slight a matter had disturbed me; and, above all, thatany accident could possibly have clouded, even for a moment, the frostyclearness of my pure and lofty scepticism with the shadows ofsuperstition.Almost every day seemed to develop some new eccentricity of our strangeguest. His dietary consisted, without any variety or relief, of themonotonous bread and milk with which he started; his bed had not beenmade for nearly a week; nobody had been admitted into his room since myvisit, just described; and he never ventured down stairs, or out ofdoors, until after nightfall, when he used sometimes to glide swiftlyround our little enclosed shrubbery, and at others stand quitemotionless, composed, as if in an attitude of deep attention. Afteremploying about an hour in this way, he would return, and steal up stairsto his room, when he would shut himself up, and not be seen again untilthe next night--or, it might be, the night after that--when, perhaps, hewould repeat his odd excursion.Strange as his habits were, their eccentricity was all upon the sideleast troublesome to us. He required literally no attendance; and as tohis occasional night ramble, even _it_ caused not the slightestdisturbance of our routine hour for securing the house and locking up thehall-door for the night, inasmuch as he had invariably retired beforethat hour arrived.All this stimulated curiosity, and, in no small degree, that of my wife,who, notwithstanding her vigilance and her anxiety to see our strangeinmate, had been hitherto foiled by a series of cross accidents. We weresitting together somewhere about ten o'clock at night, when there came atap at the room-door. We had just been discussing the unaccountableSmith; and I felt a sheepish consciousness that he might be himself atthe door, and have possibly even overheard our speculation--some of themanything but complimentary, respecting himself."Come in," cried, I, with an effort; and the tall form of our lodgerglided into the room. My wife was positively frightened, and stoodlooking at him, as he advanced, with a stare of manifest apprehension,and even recoiled mechanically, and caught my hand.Sensitiveness, however, was not his fault: he made a kind of stiff nod asI mumbled an introduction; and seating himself unasked, began at once tochat in that odd, off-hand, and sneering style, in which he excelled, andwhich had, as he wielded it, a sort of fascination of which I can pretendto convey no idea.My wife's alarm subsided, and although she still manifestly felt somesort of misgiving about our visitor, she yet listened to hisconversation, and, spite of herself, soon began to enjoy it. He stayedfor nearly half an hour. But although he glanced at a great variety oftopics, he did not approach the subject of religion. As soon as he wasgone, my wife delivered judgment upon him in form. She admitted he wasagreeable; but then he was such an unnatural, awful-looking object: therewas, besides, something indescribably frightful, she thought, in hismanner--the very tone of his voice was strange and hateful; and, on thewhole, she felt unutterably relieved at his departure.A few days after, on my return, I found my poor little wife agitated anddispirited. Mr. Smith had paid her a visit, and brought with him a book,which he stated he had been reading, and which contained some referencesto the Bible which he begged of her to explain in that profounder andless obvious sense in which they had been cited. This she had endeavouredto do; and affecting to be much gratified by her satisfactory exposition,he had requested her to reconcile some discrepancies which he said hadoften troubled him when reading the Scriptures. Some of them were quitenew to my good little wife; they startled and even horrified her. Hepursued this theme, still pretending only to seek for information toquiet his own doubts, while in reality he was sowing in her mind theseeds of the first perturbations that had ever troubled the sources ofher peace. He had been with her, she thought, no more than a quarter ofan hour; but he had contrived to leave her abundant topics on which toruminate for days. I found her shocked and horrified at the doubts whichthis potent Magus had summoned from the pit--doubts which she knew nothow to combat, and from the torment of which she could not escape."He has made me very miserable with his deceitful questions. I neverthought of them before; and, merciful Heaven! I cannot answer them! Whatam I to do? My serenity is gone; I shall never be happy again."In truth, she was so very miserable, and, as it seemed to me, sodisproportionately excited, that, inconsistent in me as the task wouldhave been, I would gladly have explained away her difficulties, andrestored to her mind its wonted confidence and serenity, had I possessedsufficient knowledge for the purpose. I really pitied her, and heartilywished Mr. Smith, for the nonce, at the devil.I observed after this that my wife's spirits appeared permanentlyaffected. There was a constantly-recurring anxiety, and I thoughtsomething was lying still more heavily at her heart than theuncertainties inspired by our lodger.One evening, as we two were sitting together, after a long silence, shesuddenly laid her hand upon my arm, and said--"Oh, Richard, my darling! would to God you could pray for me!"There was something so agitated, and even terrified, in her manner,that I was absolutely startled. I urged her to disclose whatever preyedupon her mind."You can't sympathise with me--you can't help me--you can scarcelycompassionate me in my misery! Oh, dearest Richard! Some evil influencehas been gaining upon my heart, dulling and destroying my convictions,killing all my holy affections, and--and absolutely transforming me. Ilook inward upon myself with amazement, with terror--with--oh, God!--withactual despair!"Saying this, she threw herself on her knees, and wept an agonised floodof tears, with her head reposing in my lap.Poor little thing, my heart bled for her! But what could I do or say?All I could suggest was what I really thought, that she wasunwell--hysterical--and needed to take better care of her precious self;that her change of feeling was fancied, not real; and that a few dayswould restore her to her old health and former spirits and serenity."And sometimes," she resumed, after I had ended a consolatory discussion,which it was but too manifest had fallen unprofitably upon her ear, "suchdreadful, impious thoughts come into my mind, whether I choose it or not;they come, and stay, and return, strive as I may; and I can't prayagainst them. They are forced upon me with the strength of an independentwill; and oh!--horrible--frightful--they blaspheme the character of Godhimself. They upbraid the Almighty upon his throne, and I can't prayagainst them; there is something in me now that resists prayer."There was such a real and fearful anguish in the agitation of my gentlecompanion, that it shook my very soul within me, even while I wasaffecting to make light of her confessions. I had never before witnesseda struggle at all like this, and I was awe-struck at the spectacle.At length she became comparatively calm. I did gradually succeed, thoughvery imperfectly, in reassuring her. She strove hard against herdepression, and recovered a little of her wonted cheerfulness.After a while, however, the cloud returned. She grew sad and earnest,though no longer excited; and entreated, or rather implored, of me togrant her one special favour, and this was, to avoid the society ofour lodger."I never," she said, "could understand till now the instinctive dreadwith which poor Margaret, in _Faust_, shrinks from the hateful presenceof Mephistopheles. I now feel it in myself. The dislike and suspicion Ifirst felt for that man--Smith, or whatever else he may call himself--hasgrown into literal detestation and terror. I hate him--I am afraid ofhim--I never knew what anguish of mind was until he entered our doors;and would to God--would to God he were gone."I reasoned with her--kissed her--laughed at her; but could not dissipate,in the least degree, the intense and preternatural horror with which shehad grown to regard the poor philosophic invalid, who was probably, atthat moment, poring over some metaphysical book in his solitarybedchamber.The circumstance I am about to mention will give you some notion of theextreme to which these excited feelings had worked upon her nerves. I wasthat night suddenly awakened by a piercing scream--I started upright inthe bed, and saw my wife standing at the bedside, white as ashes withterror. It was some seconds, so startled was I, before I could find wordsto ask her the cause of her affright. She caught my wrist in her icygrasp, and climbed, trembling violently, into bed. Notwithstanding myrepeated entreaties, she continued for a long time stupified and dumb. Atlength, however, she told me, that having lain awake for a long time, shefelt, on a sudden, that she could pray, and lighting the candle, she hadstolen from beside me, and kneeled down for the purpose. She had,however, scarcely assumed the attitude of prayer, when somebody, shesaid, clutched her arm violently near the wrist, and she heard, at thesame instant, some blasphemous menace, the import of which escaped herthe moment it was spoken, muttered close in her ear. This terrifyinginterruption was the cause of the scream which had awakened me; and thecondition in which she continued during the remainder of the nightconfirmed me more than ever in the conviction, that she was sufferingunder some morbid action of the nervous system.After this event, which _I_ had no hesitation in attributing to fancy,she became literally afraid to pray, and her misery and despondencyincreased proportionately.It was shortly after this that an unusual pressure of business called meinto town one evening after office hours. I had left my dear little wifetolerably well, and little Fanny was to be her companion until Ireturned. She and her little companion occupied the same room in which wesat on the memorable evening which witnessed the arrival of our eccentricguest. Though usually a lively child, it most provokingly happened uponthis night that Fanny was heavy and drowsy to excess. Her mamma wouldhave sent her to bed, but that she now literally feared to be left alone;although, however, she could not so far overcome her horror of solitudeas to do this, she yet would not persist in combating the poor child'ssleepiness.Accordingly, little Fanny was soon locked in a sound sleep, while hermamma quietly pursued her work beside her. They had been perhaps someten minutes thus circumstanced, when my wife heard the window softlyraised from without--a bony hand parted the curtains, and Mr. Smithleaned into the room.She was so utterly overpowered at sight of this apparition, that even hadit, as she expected, climbed into the room, she told me she could nothave uttered a sound, or stirred from the spot where she sate transfixedand petrified."Ha, ha!" he said gently, "I hope you'll excuse this, I must admit, veryodd intrusion; but I knew I should find you here, and could not resistthe opportunity of raising the window just for a moment, to look in upona little family picture, and say a word to yourself. I understand thatyou are troubled, because for some cause you cannot say yourprayers--because what you call your 'faith' is, so to speak, dead andgone, and also because what _you_ consider bad thoughts are constantlyrecurring to your mind. Now, all that is very silly. If it is reallyimpossible for you to believe and to pray, what are you to infer fromthat? It is perfectly plain your Christian system can't be a trueone--faith and _prayer_ it everywhere represents as the conditions ofgrace, acceptance, and salvation; and yet your Creator will not _permit_you either to believe or pray. The Christian system is, forsooth, a_free_ gift, and yet he who formed _you_ and _it_, makes it absolutelyimpossible for you to accept it. _Is_ it, I ask you, from your ownexperience--is it a free gift? And if your own experience, in which youcan't be mistaken, gives its pretensions the lie, why, in the name ofcommon sense, will you persist in believing it? I say it is downrightblasphemy to think it has emanated from the Good Spirit--assuming thatthere is one. It tells you that you must be tormented hereafter in a wayonly to be made intelligible by the image of eternal fires--prettystrong, we must all allow--unless you comply with certain conditions,which it pretends are so easy that it is a positive pleasure to embraceand perform them; and yet, for the life of you, you can't--physically_can't_--do either. Is this truth and mercy?--or is it swindling andcruelty? Is it the part of the Redeemer, or that of the tyrant, deceiver,and tormentor?"Up to that moment, my wife had sate breathless and motionless, listening,in the catalepsy of nightmare, to a sort of echo of the vile and impiousreasoning which had haunted her for so long. At the last words of thesentence his voice became harsh and thrilling; and his whole mannerbespoke a sort of crouching and terrific hatred, the like of which shecould not have conceived.Whatever may have been the cause, she was on a sudden disenchanted. Shestarted to her feet; and, freezing with horror though she was, in ashrill cry of agony commanded him, in the name of God, to depart fromher. His whole frame seemed to darken; he drew back silently; thecurtains dropped into their places, the window was let down again asstealthily as it had just been raised; and my wife found herself alone inthe chamber with our little child, who had been startled from her sleepby her mother's cry of anguish, and with the fearful words, "tempter,""destroyer," "devil," still ringing in her ears, was weeping bitterly,and holding her terrified mother's hand.There is nothing, I believe, more infectious than that species ofnervousness which shows itself in superstitious fears. I began--althoughI could not bring myself to admit anything the least like it--to partakeinsensibly, but strongly of the peculiar feelings with which my wife, andindeed my whole household, already regarded the lodger up stairs. Thefact was, beside, that the state of my poor wife's mind began to make meseriously uneasy; and, although I was fully sensible of the pecuniary andother advantages attendant upon his stay, they were yet far fromoutweighing the constant gloom and frequent misery in which theprotracted sojourn was involving my once cheerful house. I resolved,therefore, at whatever monetary sacrifice, to put an end to thesecommotions; and, after several debates with my wife, in which the subjectwas, as usual, turned in all its possible and impossible bearings, weagreed that, deducting a fair proportion for his five weeks' sojourn, Ishould return the remainder of his L100, and request immediate possessionof his apartments. Like a man suddenly relieved of an insufferable load,and breathing freely once more, I instantly prepared to carry into effectthe result of our deliberations.In pursuance of this resolution, I waited upon Mr. Smith. This time mycall was made in the morning, somewhere about nine o'clock. Hereceived me at his door, standing as usual in the stealthy openingwhich barely admitted his lank person. There he stood, fully equippedwith goggles and respirator, and swathed, rather than dressed, in hispuckered black garments.As he did not seem disposed to invite me into his apartment, althoughI had announced my visit as one of business, I was obliged to open myerrand where I stood; and after a great deal of fumbling andmuttering, I contrived to place before him distinctly the resolutionto which I had come."But I can't think of taking back any portion of the sum I have paidyou," said he, with a cool, dry emphasis."Your reluctance to do so, Mr. Smith, is most handsome, and I assure you,appreciated," I replied. "It is very generous; but, at the same time, itis quite impossible for me to accept what I have no right to take, and Imust beg of you not to mention that part of the subject again.""And why should _I_ take it?" demanded Mr. Smith."Because you have paid this hundred pounds for six months, and you areleaving me with nearly five months of the term still unexpired," Ireplied. "I expect to receive fair play myself, and always give it.""But who on earth said that I was going away so soon?" pursued Mr. Smith,in the same dry, sarcastic key. "_I_ have not said so--because I reallydon't intend it; I mean to stay here to the last day of the six monthsfor which I have paid you. I have no notion of vacating my hiredlodgings, simply because you say, _go_. I shan't quarrel with you--Inever quarrel with anybody. I'm as much your friend as ever; but, withoutthe least wish to disoblige, I can't do this, positively I cannot. Isthere anything else?"I had not anticipated in the least the difficulty which thusencountered and upset our plans. I had so set my heart upon effectingthe immediate retirement of our inauspicious inmate, that thedisappointment literally stunned me for a moment. I, however, returnedto the charge: I urged, and prayed, and almost besought him to give uphis apartments, and to leave us. I offered to repay every farthing ofthe sum he had paid me--reserving nothing on account of the time he hadalready been with us. I suggested all the disadvantages of the house. Ishifted my ground, and told him that my wife wanted the rooms; Ipressed his gallantry--his good nature--his economy; in short, Iassailed him upon every point--but in vain, he did not even take thetrouble of repeating what he had said before--he neither relented, norshowed the least irritation, but simply said--"I can't do this; here I am, and here I stay until the half-year hasexpired. You wanted a lodger, and you have got one--the quietest, leasttroublesome, least expensive person you could have; and though yourhouse, servants, and furniture are none of the best, I don't care forthat. I pursue my own poor business and enjoyments here entirely to mysatisfaction."Having thus spoken, he gave me a sort of nod, and closed the door.So, instead of getting rid of him the next day, as we had hoped, we hadnearly five months more of his company in expectancy; I hated, and mywife dreaded the prospect. She was literally miserable and panic-struckat her disappointment--and grew so nervous and wretched that I made up mymind to look out for lodgings for her and the children (subversive of allour schemes of retrenchment as such a step would be), and surrenderingthe house absolutely to Mr. Smith and the servants during the remainderof his term.Circumstances, however, occurred to prevent our putting this plan inexecution. My wife, meanwhile, was, if possible, more depressed andnervous every day. The servants seemed to sympathise in the dread andgloom which involved ourselves; the very children grew timid andspiritless, without knowing why--and the entire house was pervaded withan atmosphere of uncertainty and fear. A poorhouse or a dungeon wouldhave been cheerful, compared with a dwelling haunted unceasingly withunearthly suspicions and alarms. I would have made any sacrifice short ofruin, to emancipate our household from the odious mental and moralthraldom which was invisibly established over us--overcasting us withstrange anxieties and an undefined terror.About this time my wife had a dream which troubled her much, althoughshe could not explain its supposed significance satisfactorily by anyof the ordinary rules of interpretation in such matters. The vision wasas follows.She dreamed that we were busily employed in carrying out our scheme ofremoval, and that I came into the parlour where she was making somearrangements, and, with rather an agitated manner, told her that thecarriage had come for the children. She thought she went out to the hall,in consequence, holding little Fanny by one hand, and the boy--or, as westill called him, "baby,"--by the other, and feeling, as she did so, anunaccountable gloom, almost amounting to terror, steal over her. Thechildren, too, seemed, she thought, frightened, and disposed to cry.So close to the hall-door as to exclude the light, stood some kind ofvehicle, of which she could see nothing but that its door was wide open,and the interior involved in total darkness. The children, she thought,shrunk back in great trepidation, and she addressed herself to inducethem, by persuasion, to enter, telling them that they were only "going totheir new home." So, in a while, little Fanny approached it; but, at thesame instant, some person came swiftly up from behind, and, raising thelittle boy in his hands, said fiercely, "No, the baby first"; and placedhim in the carriage. This person was our lodger, Mr. Smith, and was goneas soon as seen. My wife, even in her dream, could not act or speak; butas the child was lifted into the carriage-door, a man, whose face wasfull of beautiful tenderness and compassion, leaned forward from thecarriage and received the little child, which, stretching his arms to thestranger, looked back with a strange smile upon his mother."He is safe with me, and I will deliver him to you when you come."These words the man spoke, looking upon her, as he received him, andimmediately the carriage-door shut, and the noise of its closing wakenedmy wife from her nightmare.This dream troubled her very much, and even haunted my mind unpleasantlytoo. We agreed, however, not to speak of it to anybody, not to divulgeany of our misgivings respecting the stranger. We were anxious thatneither the children nor the servants should catch the contagion of thosefears which had seized upon my poor little wife, and, if truth werespoken, upon myself in some degree also. But this precaution was, Ibelieve, needless, for, as I said before, everybody under the same roofwith Mr. Smith was, to a certain extent, affected with the same nervousgloom and apprehension.And now commences a melancholy chapter in my life. My poor little Fannywas attacked with a cough which soon grew very violent, and after a timedegenerated into a sharp attack of inflammation. We were seriouslyalarmed for her life, and nothing that care and medicine could effectwas spared to save it. Her mother was indefatigable, and scarcely lefther night or day; and, indeed, for some time, we all but despaired ofher recovery.One night, when she was at the worst, her poor mother, who had sat formany a melancholy hour listening, by her bedside, to those plaintiveincoherences of delirium and moanings of fever, which have harrowed somany a fond heart, gained gradually from her very despair the couragewhich she had so long wanted, and knelt down at the side of her sickdarling's bed to pray for her deliverance.With clasped hands, in an agony of supplication, she prayed that Godwould, in his mercy, spare her little child--that, justly as she herselfdeserved the sorest chastisement his hand could inflict, he would yetdeal patiently and tenderly with her in this one thing. She poured outher sorrows before the mercy-seat--she opened her heart, and declared heronly hope to be in his pity; without which, she felt that her darlingwould only leave the bed where she was lying for her grave.Exactly as she came to this part of her supplication, the child, who hadgrown, as it seemed, more and more restless, and moaned and muttered withincreasing pain and irritation, on a sudden started upright in her bed,and, in a thrilling voice, cried--"No! no!--the baby first."The mysterious sentence which had secretly tormented her for so long,thus piercingly uttered by this delirious, and, perhaps, dying child,with what seemed a preternatural earnestness and strength, arrested herdevotions, and froze her with a feeling akin to terror."Hush, hush, my darling!" said the poor mother, almost wildly, as sheclasped the attenuated frame of the sick child in her arms; "hush, mydarling; don't cry out so loudly--there--there--my own love."The child did not appear to see or hear her, but sate up still withfeverish cheeks, and bright unsteady eyes, while her dry lips weremuttering inaudible words."Lie down, my sweet child--lie down, for your own mother," she said;"if you tire yourself, you can't grow well, and your poor mother willlose you."At these words, the child suddenly cried out again, in precisely the sameloud, strong voice--"No! no! the baby first, the baby first"--andimmediately afterwards lay down, and fell, for the first time since herillness into a tranquil sleep.My good little wife sate, crying bitterly by her bedside. The child wasbetter--_that_ was, indeed, delightful. But then there was an omen in thewords, thus echoed from her dream, which she dared not trust herself tointerpret, and which yet had seized, with a grasp of iron, upon everyfibre of her brain."Oh, Richard," she cried, as she threw her arms about my neck, "I amterrified at this horrible menace from the unseen world. Oh! poor,darling little baby, I shall lose you--I am sure I shall lose you.Comfort me, darling, and say he is not to die."And so I did; and tasked all my powers of argument and persuasion toconvince her how unsubstantial was the ground of her anxiety. The littleboy was perfectly well, and, even were he to die before his sister thatevent might not occur for seventy years to come. I could not, however,conceal from myself that there was something odd and unpleasant in thecoincidence; and my poor wife had grown so nervous and excitable, that amuch less ominous conjecture would have sufficed to alarm her.Meanwhile, the unaccountable terror which our lodger's presence inspiredcontinued to increase. One of our maids gave us warning, solely from herdread of our queer inmate, and the strange accessories which haunted him.She said--and this was corroborated by her fellow-servant--that Mr. Smithseemed to have constantly a companion in his room; that although theynever heard them speak, they continually and distinctly heard the treadof two persons walking up and down the room together, and describedaccurately the peculiar sound of a stick or crutch tapping upon thefloor, which my own ears had heard. They also had seen the large,ill-conditioned cat I have mentioned, frequently steal in and out of thestranger's room; and observed that when our little girl was in greatestdanger, the hateful animal was constantly writhing, fawning, and crawlingabout the door of the sick room after nightfall. They were thoroughlypersuaded that this ill-omened beast was the foul fiend himself, and Iconfess I could not--sceptic as I was--bring myself absolutely to thebelief that he was nothing more than a "harmless, necessary cat." Theseand similar reports--implicitly believed as they palpably were by thosewho made them--were certainly little calculated to allay the perturbationand alarm with which our household was filled.The evenings had by this time shortened very much, and darkness oftenovertook us before we sate down to our early tea. It happened just atthis period of which I have been speaking, after my little girl had begundecidedly to mend, that I was sitting in our dining-parlour, with mylittle boy fast asleep upon my knees, and thinking of I know not what, mywife having gone up stairs, as usual, to sit in the room with littleFanny. As I thus sate in what was to me, in effect, total solitude,darkness unperceived stole on us.On a sudden, as I sate, with my elbow leaning upon the table, and myother arm round the sleeping child, I felt, as I thought, a coldcurrent of air faintly blowing upon my forehead. I raised my head, andsaw, as nearly as I could calculate, at the far end of the table onwhich my arm rested, two large green eyes confronting me. I could seeno more, but instantly concluded they were those of the abominable cat.Yielding to an impulse of horror and abhorrence, I caught a water-croftthat was close to my hand, and threw it full at it with all my force. Imust have missed my object, for the shining eyes continued fixed for asecond, and then glided still nearer to me, and then a little nearerstill. The noise of the glass smashed with so much force upon the tablecalled in the servant, who happened to be passing. She had a candle inher hand, and, perhaps, the light alarmed the odious beast, for as shecame in it was gone.I had had an undefined idea that its approach was somehow connected witha designed injury of some sort to the sleeping child. I could not bemistaken as to the fact that I had plainly seen the two broad, glaring,green eyes. Where the cursed animal had gone I had not observed: itmight, indeed, easily have run out at the door as the servant opened it,but neither of us had seen it do so; and we were every one of us in sucha state of nervous excitement, that even this incident was something inthe catalogue of our ambiguous experiences.It was a great happiness to see our darling little Fanny every daymending, and now quite out of danger: this was cheering and delightful.It was also something to know that more than two months of our lodger'sterm of occupation had already expired; and to realise, as we now coulddo, by anticipation, the unspeakable relief of his departure.My wife strove hard to turn our dear child's recovery to good account forme; but the impressions of fear soon depart, and those of religiousgratitude must be preceded by religious faith. All as yet was but as seedstrewn upon the rock.Little Fanny, though recovering rapidly, was still very weak, and hermother usually passed a considerable part of every evening in herbedroom--for the child was sometimes uneasy and restless at night. Ithappened at this period that, sitting as usual at Fanny's bedside, shewitnessed an occurrence which agitated her not a little.The child had been, as it seems, growing sleepy, and was lyinglistlessly, with eyes half open, apparently taking no note of what waspassing. Suddenly, however, with an expression of the wildest terror, shedrew up her limbs, and cowered in the bed's head, gazing at some object;which, judging from the motion of her eyes, must have been slowlyadvancing from the end of the room next the door.The child made a low shuddering cry, as she grasped her mother's hand,and, with features white and tense with terror, slowly following with hereyes the noiseless course of some unseen spectre, shrinking more and morefearfully backward every moment."What is it? Where? What is it that frightens you, my darling?" asked thepoor mother, who, thrilled with horror, looked in vain for the apparitionwhich seemed to have all but bereft the child of reason."Stay with me--save me--keep it away--look, look at it--making signs tome--don't let it hurt me--it is angry--Oh! mamma, save me, save me!"The child said this, all the time clinging to her with both her hands, inan ecstasy of panic."There--there, my darling," said my poor wife, "don't be afraid; there'snothing but me--your own mamma--and little baby in the room; nothing, mydarling; nothing indeed.""Mamma, mamma, don't move; don't go near him"; the child continuedwildly. "It's only his back now; don't make him turn again; he's untyinghis handkerchief. Oh! baby, baby; he'll _kill_ baby! and he's lifting upthose green things from his eyes; don't you see him doing it? Mamma,mamma, why does he come here? Oh, mamma, poor baby--poor little baby!"She was looking with a terrified gaze at the little boy's bed, which laydirectly opposite to her own, and in which he was sleeping calmly."Hush, hush, my darling child," said my wife, with difficultyrestraining an hysterical burst of tears; "for God's sake don't speak sowildly, my own precious love--there, there--don't be frightened--there,darling, there.""Oh! poor baby--poor little darling baby," the child continued as before;"will no one save him--tell that wicked man to go away--oh--there--why,mamma--don't--oh, sure you won't let him--don't--don't--he'll take thechild's life--will you let him lie down that way on the bed--save poorlittle baby--oh, baby, baby, waken--his head is on your face."As she said this she raised her voice to a cry of despairing terror whichmade the whole room ring again.This cry, or rather yell, reached my ears as I sate reading in theparlour by myself, and fearing I knew not what, I rushed to theapartment; before I reached it, the sound had subsided into low butviolent sobbing; and, just as I arrived at the threshold I heard, closeat my feet, a fierce protracted growl, and something rubbing along thesurbase. I was in the dark, but, with a feeling of mingled terror andfury, I stamped and struck at the abhorred brute with my feet, but invain. The next moment I was in the room, and heard little Fanny, throughher sobs, cry--"Oh, poor baby is killed--that wicked man has killed him--he uncoveredhis face, and put it on him, and lay upon the bed and killed poor baby. Iknew he came to kill him. Ah, papa, papa, why did you not come up beforehe went?--he is gone, he went away as soon as he killed our poor littledarling baby."I could not conceal my agitation, quite, and I said to my wife--"Has he, Smith, been here?""No.""What is it, then?""The child has seen _some_ one.""Seen whom? Who? Who has been here?""I did not see it; but--but I am sure the child saw--that is, _thought_she saw _him_;--the person you have named. Oh, God, in mercy deliver us!What shall I do--what shall I do!"Thus saying, the dear little woman burst into tears, and crying, as ifher heart would break, sobbed out an entreaty that I would look at baby;adding, that she herself had not courage to see whether her darling wassleeping or dead."Dead!" I exclaimed. "Tut, tut, my darling; you must not give way to suchmorbid fancies--he is very well, I see him breathing;" and so saying, Iwent over to the bed where our little boy was lying. He was slumbering;though it seemed to me very heavily, and his cheeks were flushed."Sleeping tranquilly, my darling--tranquilly, and deeply; and with awarm colour in his cheeks," I said, rearranging the coverlet, andretiring to my wife, who sate almost breathless whilst I was looking atour little boy."Thank God--thank God," she said quietly; and she wept again; and rising,came to his bedside."Yes, yes--alive; thank God; but it seems to me he is breathing veryshort, and with difficulty, and he looks--_does_ he not look hot andfeverish? Yes, he _is_ very hot; feel his little hand--feel his neck;merciful heaven! he is burning."It was, indeed, very true, that his skin was unnaturally dry and hot; hislittle pulse, too, was going at a fearful rate."I do think," said I--resolved to conceal the extent of my ownapprehensions--"I do think that he is just a _little_ feverish; but hehas often been much more so; and will, I dare say, in the morning, beperfectly well again. I dare say, but for little Fanny's _dream_, weshould not have observed it at all.""Oh, my darling, my darling, my darling!" sobbed the poor little woman,leaning over the bed, with her hands locked together, and looking thevery picture of despair. "Oh, my darling, what has happened to you? I putyou into your bed, looking so well and beautiful, this evening, and hereyou are, stricken with sickness, my own little love. Oh, you willnot--you cannot, leave your poor mother!"It was quite plain that she despaired of the child from the moment we hadascertained that it was unwell. As it happened, her presentiment was buttoo truly prophetic. The apothecary said the child's ailment was"suppressed small-pox"; the physician pronounced it "typhus." The onlycertainty about it was the issue--the child died.To me few things appear so beautiful as a very young child in itsshroud. The little innocent face looks so sublimely simple and confidingamongst the cold terrors of death--crimeless, and fearless, that littlemortal has passed alone under the shadow, and explored the mystery ofdissolution. There is death in its sublimest and purest image--nohatred, no hypocrisy, no suspicion, no care for the morrow ever darkenedthat little face; death has come lovingly upon it; there is nothingcruel, or harsh, in his victory. The yearnings of love, indeed, cannotbe stifled; for the prattle, and smiles, and all the little world ofthoughts that were so delightful, are gone for ever. Awe, too, willovercast us in its presence--for we are looking on death; but we do notfear for the little, lonely voyager--for the child has gone, simple andtrusting, into the presence of its all-wise Father; and of such, weknow, is the kingdom of heaven.And so we parted from poor little baby. I and his poor old nursedrove in a mourning carriage, in which lay the little coffin, earlyin the morning, to the churchyard of ----. Sore, indeed, was myheart, as I followed that little coffin to the grave! Another burialhad just concluded as we entered the churchyard, and the mournersstood in clusters round the grave, into which the sexton was nowshovelling the mould.As I stood, with head uncovered, listening to the sublime and touchingservice which our ritual prescribes, I found that a gentleman had drawnnear also, and was standing at my elbow. I did not turn to look at himuntil the earth had closed over my darling boy; I then walked a littleway apart, that I might be alone, and drying my eyes, sat down upon atombstone, to let the confusion of my mind subside.While I was thus lost in a sorrowful reverie, the gentleman who had stoodnear me at the grave was once more at my side. The face of the stranger,though I could not call it handsome, was very remarkable; its expressionwas the purest and noblest I could conceive, and it was made verybeautiful by a look of such compassion as I never saw before."Why do you sorrow as one without hope?" he said, gently."I _have_ no hope," I answered."Nay, I think you have," he answered again; "and I am sure you will soonhave more. That little child for which you grieve, has escaped thedangers and miseries of life; its body has perished; but he will receivein the end the crown of life. God has given him an early victory."I know not what it was in him that rebuked my sullen pride, and humbledand saddened me, as I listened to this man. He was dressed in deepmourning, and looked more serene, noble, and sweet than any I had everseen. He was young, too, as I have said, and his voice very clear andharmonious. He talked to me for a long time, and I listened to him withinvoluntary reverence. At last, however, he left me, saying he had oftenseen me walking into town, about the same hour that he used to go thatway, and that if he saw me again he would walk with me, and so we mightreason of these things together.It was late when I returned to my home, now a house of mourning.PART IIOur home was one of sorrow and of fear. The child's death had stricken uswith terror no less than grief. Referring it, as we both tacitly did, tothe mysterious and fiendish agency of the abhorred being whom, in an evilhour, we had admitted into our house, we both viewed him with a degreeand species of fear for which I can find no name.I felt that some further calamity was impending. I could not hope that wewere to be delivered from the presence of the malignant agent whohaunted, rather than inhabited our home, without some additional proofsalike of his malice and his power.My poor wife's presentiments were still more terrible and overpowering,though not more defined, than my own. She was never tranquil while ourlittle girl was out of her sight; always dreading and expecting some newrevelation of the evil influence which, as we were indeed both persuaded,had bereft our darling little boy of life. Against an hostility sounearthly and intangible there was no guarding, and the sense ofhelplessness intensified the misery of our situation. Tormented withdoubts of the very basis of her religion, and recoiling from the ordealof prayer with the strange horror with which the victim of hydrophobiarepels the pure water, she no longer found the consolation which, hadsorrow reached her in any other shape, she would have drawn from thehealing influence of religion. We were both of us unhappy, dismayed,DEMON-STRICKEN.Meanwhile, our lodger's habits continued precisely the same. If, indeed,the sounds which came from his apartments were to be trusted, he and hisagents were more on the alert than ever. I can convey to you, goodreader, no notion, even the faintest, of the dreadful sensation alwaysmore or less present to my mind, and sometimes with a reality whichthrilled me almost to frenzy--the apprehension that I had admitted intomy house the incarnate spirit of the dead or damned, to torment me andmy family.It was some nights after the burial of our dear little baby; we had notgone to bed until late, and I had slept, I suppose, some hours, when Iwas awakened by my wife, who clung to me with the energy of terror. Shesaid nothing, but grasped and shook me with more than her naturalstrength. She had crept close to me, and was cowering with her head underthe bedclothes.The room was perfectly dark, as usual, for we burned no night-light; butfrom the side of the bed next her proceeded a voice as of one sittingthere with his head within a foot of the curtains--and, merciful heavens!it was the voice of our lodger.He was discoursing of the death of our baby, and inveighing, in the oldmocking tone of hate and suppressed fury, against the justice, mercy, andgoodness of God. He did this with a terrible plausibility of sophistry,and with a resolute emphasis and precision, which seemed to imply, "Ihave got something to tell you, and, whether you like it or like it not,I _will_ say out my say."To pretend that I felt anger at his intrusion, or emotion of any sort,save the one sense of palsied terror, would be to depart from the truth.I lay, cold and breathless, as if frozen to death--unable to move, unableto utter a cry--with the voice of that demon pouring, in the dark, hisundisguised blasphemies and temptations close into my ears. At last thedreadful voice ceased--whether the speaker went or stayed I could nottell--the silence, which he might be improving for the purpose of somehellish strategem, was to me more tremendous even than his speech.We both lay awake, not daring to move or speak, scarcely even breathing,but clasping one another fast, until at length the welcome light of daystreamed into the room through the opening door, as the servant came into call us. I need not say that our nocturnal visitant had left us.The magnanimous reader will, perhaps, pronounce that I ought to havepulled on my boots and inexpressibles with all available despatch, run tomy lodger's bedroom, and kicked him forthwith downstairs, and the entireway moreover out to the public road, as some compensation for thescandalous affront put upon me and my wife by his impertinent visit. Now,at that time, I had no scruples against what are termed the laws ofhonour, was by no means deficient in "pluck," and gifted, moreover, witha somewhat excitable temper. Yet, I will honestly avow that, so far fromcourting a collision with the dreaded stranger, I would have recoiled athis very sight, and given my eyes to avoid him, such was the ascendancywhich he had acquired over me, as well as everybody else in my household,in his own quiet, irresistible, hellish way.The shuddering antipathy which our guest inspired did not rob hisinfernal homily of its effect. It was not a new or strange thing whichhe presented to our minds. There was an awful subtlety in the train ofhis suggestions. All that he had said had floated through my own mindbefore, without order, indeed, or shew of logic. From my own rebelliousheart the same evil thoughts had risen, like pale apparitions hoveringand lost in the fumes of a necromancer's cauldron. His was like thesumming up of all this--a reflection of my own feelings and fancies--butreduced to an awful order and definiteness, and clothed with asophistical form of argument. The effect of it was powerful. It revivedand exaggerated these bad emotions--it methodised and justifiedthem--and gave to impulses and impressions, vague and desultory before,something of the compactness of a system.My misfortune, therefore, did not soften, it exasperated me. I regardedthe Great Disposer of events as a persecutor of the human race, who tookdelight in their miseries. I asked why my innocent child had been smittendown into the grave?--and why my darling wife, whose first object, Iknew, had ever been to serve and glorify her Maker, should have been thustortured and desolated by the cruelest calamity which the malignity of ademon could have devised? I railed and blasphemed, and even in my agonydefied God with the impotent rage and desperation of a devil, in hiseverlasting torment.In my bitterness, I could not forbear speaking these impenitentrepetitions of the language of our nightly visitant, even in the presenceof my wife. She heard me with agony, almost with terror. I pitied andloved her too much not to respect even her weaknesses--for so Icharacterised her humble submission to the chastisements of heaven. Buteven while I spared her reverential sensitiveness, the spectacle of herpatience but enhanced my own gloomy and impenitent rage.I was walking into town in this evil mood, when I was overtaken by thegentleman whom I had spoken with in the churchyard on the morning when mylittle boy was buried. I call him _gentleman_, but I could not say _what_was his rank--I never thought about it; there was a grace, a purity, acompassion, and a grandeur of intellect in his countenance, in hislanguage, in his mien, that was beautiful and kinglike. I felt, in hiscompany, a delightful awe, and an humbleness more gratifying than anyelation of earthly pride.He divined my state of feeling, but he said nothing harsh. He did notrebuke, but he reasoned with me--and oh! how mighty was thatreasoning--without formality--without effort--as the flower grows andblossoms. Its process was in harmony with the successions ofnature--gentle, spontaneous, irresistible.At last he left me. I was grieved at his departure--I waswonder-stricken. His discourse had made me cry tears at once sweet andbitter; it had sounded depths I knew not of, and my heart was disquietedwithin me. Yet my trouble was happier than the resentful and defiant calmthat had reigned within me before.When I came home, I told my wife of my having met the same good, wise manI had first seen by the grave of my child. I recounted to her hisdiscourse, and, as I brought it again to mind, my tears flowed afresh,and I was happy while I wept.I now see that the calamity which bore at first such evil fruit, was goodfor me. It fixed my mind, however rebelliously, upon God, and it stirredup all the passions of my heart. Levity, inattention, andself-complacency are obstacles harder to be overcome than the violence ofevil passions--the transition from hate is easier than from indifference,to love. A mighty change was making on my mind.I need not particularise the occasions upon which I again met myfriend, for so I knew him to be, nor detail the train of reasoning andfeeling which in such interviews he followed out; it is enough to say,that he assiduously cultivated the good seed he had sown, and that hisbenignant teachings took deep root, and flourished in my soul,heretofore so barren.One evening, having enjoyed on the morning of the same day another ofthose delightful and convincing conversations, I was returning on foothomeward; and as darkness had nearly closed, and the night threatenedcold and fog, the footpaths were nearly deserted.As I walked on, deeply absorbed in the discourse I had heard on the samemorning, a person overtook me, and continued to walk, without muchincreasing the interval between us, a little in advance of me. There cameupon me, at the same moment, an indefinable sinking of the heart, astrange and unaccountable fear. The pleasing topics of my meditationsmelted away, and gave place to a sense of danger, all the more unpleasantthat it was vague and objectless. I looked up. What was that which movedbefore me? I stared--I faltered; my heart fluttered as if it would chokeme, and then stood still. It was the peculiar and unmistakeable form ofour lodger.Exactly as I looked at him, he turned his head, and looked at me over hisshoulder. His face was muffled as usual. I cannot have seen its featureswith any completeness, yet I felt that his look was one of fury. The nextinstant he was at my side; and my heart quailed within me--my limbs allbut refused their office; yet the very emotions of terror, which mighthave overcome me, acted as a stimulus, and I quickened my pace."Hey! what a pious person! So I suppose you have learned at last that'evil communications corrupt good manners'; and you are absolutely afraidof the old infidel, the old blasphemer, hey?"I made him no answer; I was indeed too much agitated to speak."You'll make a good Christian, no doubt," he continued; "the independentman, who thinks for himself, reasons his way to his principles, andsticks fast to them, is sure to be true to whatever system he embraces.You have been so consistent a philosopher, that I am sure you will make asteady Christian. You're not the man to be led by the nose by asophistical mumbler. _You_ could never be made the prey of a graspingproselytism; _you_ are not the sport of every whiff of doctrine, nor thefacile slave of whatever superstition is last buzzed in your ear. No, no:you've got a masculine intellect, and think for yourself, hey?"I was incapable of answering him. I quickened my pace to escape from hisdetested persecution; but he was close beside me still.We walked on together thus for a time, during which I heard him mutteringfast to himself, like a man under fierce and malignant excitement. Wereached, at length, the gateway of my dwelling; and I turned thelatch-key in the wicket, and entered the enclosure. As we stood togetherwithin, he turned full upon me, and confronting me with an aspect whosecharacter I felt rather than saw, he said--"And so you mean to be a Christian, after all! Now just reflect how veryabsurdly you are choosing. Leave the Bible to that class of fanatics whomay hope to be saved under its system, and, in the name of common sense,study the Koran, or some less ascetic tome. Don't be gulled by aplausible slave, who wants nothing more than to multiply _professors_ ofhis theory. Why don't you _read_ the Bible, you miserable, pulingpoltroon, before you hug it as a treasure? Why don't you read it, andlearn out of the mouth of the founder of Christianity, that there is onesin for which there is _no_ forgiveness--blasphemy against the HolyGhost, hey?--and that sin I myself have heard you commit by the hour--inmy presence--in my room. I have heard you commit it in our freediscussions a dozen times. The Bible seals against you the lips of mercy.If _it_ be true, you are this moment as irrevocably damned as if you haddied with those blasphemies on your lips."Having thus spoken, he glided into the house. I followed slowly.His words rang in my ears--I was stunned. What he had said I feared mightbe true. Giant despair felled me to the earth. He had recalled, andlighted up with a glare from the pit, remembrances with which I knew nothow to cope. It was true I had spoken with daring impiety of subjectswhose sacredness I now began to appreciate. With trembling hands I openedthe Bible. I read and re-read the mysterious doom recorded by theRedeemer himself against blasphemers of the Holy Ghost--monsters setapart from the human race, and damned and dead, even while they live andwalk upon the earth. I groaned--I wept. Henceforward the Bible, Ithought, must be to me a dreadful record of despair. I dared not read it.I will not weary you with all my mental agonies. My dear little wife didsomething toward relieving my mind, but it was reserved for the friend,to whose heavenly society I owed so much, to tranquillise it once more.He talked this time to me longer, and even more earnestly than before. Isoon encountered him again. He expounded to me the ways of Providence,and showed me how needful sorrow was for every servant of God. How mercywas disguised in tribulation, and our best happiness came to us, like ourchildren, in tears and wailing. He showed me that trials were sent tocall us up, with a voice of preternatural power, from the mortal apathyof sin and the world. And then, again, in our new and better state, toprove our patience and our faith--"The more trouble befalls you, the nearer is God to you. He visits you insorrow--and sorrow, as well as joy, is a sign of his presence. If, then,other griefs overtake you, remember this--be patient, be faithful; andbless the name of God."I returned home comforted and happy, although I felt assured that somefurther and sadder trial was before me.Still our household was overcast by the same insurmountable dread of ourtenant. The same strange habits characterised him, and the sameunaccountable sounds disquieted us--an atmosphere of death and malicehovered about his door, and we all hated and feared to pass it.Let me now tell, as well and briefly as I may, the dreadful circumstancesof my last great trial. One morning, my wife being about her householdaffairs, and I on the point of starting for town, I went into the parlourfor some letters which I was to take with me. I cannot easily describe myconsternation when, on entering the room, I saw our lodger seated nearthe window, with our darling little girl upon his knee.His back was toward the door, but I could plainly perceive that therespirator had been removed from his mouth, and that the odious greengoggles were raised. He was sitting, as it seemed, absolutely withoutmotion, and his face was advanced close to that of the child.I stood looking at this group in a state of stupor for some seconds. Hewas, I suppose, conscious of my presence, for although he did not turnhis head, or otherwise take any note of my arrival, he readjusted themuffler which usually covered his mouth, and lowered the clumsyspectacles to their proper place.The child was sitting upon his knee as motionless as he himself, with acountenance white and rigid as that of a corpse, and from which everytrace of meaning, except some vague character of terror, had fled, andstaring with a fixed and dilated gaze into his face.As it seemed, she did not perceive my presence. Her eyes were transfixedand fascinated. She did not even seem to me to breathe. Horror andanguish at last overcame my stupefaction."What--what is it?" I cried; "what ails my child, my darling child?""I'd be glad to know, myself," he replied, coolly; "it is certainlysomething very queer.""What is it, darling?" I repeated, frantically, addressing the child."What is it?" he reiterated. "Why it's pretty plain, I should suppose,that the child is ill.""Oh merciful God!" I cried, half furious, half terrified--"You haveinjured her--you have terrified her. Give me my child--give her to me."These words I absolutely shouted, and stamped upon the floor in my horridexcitement."Pooh, pooh!" he said, with a sort of ugly sneer; "the child isnervous--you'll make her more so--be quiet and she'll probably find hertongue presently. I have had her on my knee some minutes, but the sweetbird could not tell what ails her.""Let the child go," I shouted in a voice of thunder; "let her go, Isay--let her go."He took the passive, death-like child, and placed her standing by thewindow, and rising, he simply said--"As soon as you grow cool, you are welcome to ask me what questions youlike. The child is plainly ill. I should not wonder if she had seensomething that frightened her."Having thus spoken, he passed from the room. I felt as if I spoke, saw,and walked in a horrid dream. I seized the darling child in my arms, andbore her away to her mother."What is it--for mercy's sake what is the matter?" she cried, growing inan instant as pale as the poor child herself."I found that--that _demon_--in the parlour with the child on his lap,staring in her face. She is manifestly terrified.""Oh! gracious God! she is lost--she is killed," cried the poormother, frantically looking into the white, apathetic, meaninglessface of the child."Fanny, darling Fanny, tell us if you are ill," I cried, pressing thelittle girl in terror to my heart."Tell your own mother, my darling," echoed my poor little wife. "Oh!darling, darling child, speak to your poor mother."It was all in vain. Still the same dilated, imploring gaze--the same paleface--wild and dumb. We brought her to the open window--we gave her coldwater to drink--we sprinkled it in her face. We sent for the apothecary,who lived hard by, and he arrived in a few moments, with a parcel oftranquillising medicines. These, however, were equally unavailing.Hour after hour passed away. The darling child looked upon us as if shewould have given the world to speak to us, or to weep, but she uttered nosound. Now and then she drew a long breath as though preparing to saysomething, but still she was mute. She often put her hand to her throat,as if there was some pain or obstruction there.I never can, while I live, lose one line of that mournful and terribleportrait--the face of my stricken child. As hour after hour passed away,without bringing the smallest change or amendment, we grew both alarmed,and at length absolutely terrified for her safety.We called in a physician toward night, and told him that we had reason tosuspect that the child had somehow been frightened, and that in no otherway could we at all account for the extraordinary condition in which hefound her.This was a man, I may as well observe, though I do not name him, of thehighest eminence in his profession, and one in whose skill, from pastpersonal experience, I had the best possible reasons for implicitlyconfiding.He asked a multiplicity of questions, the answers to which seemed tobaffle his attempts to arrive at a satisfactory diagnosis. There wassomething undoubtedly anomalous in the case, and I saw plainly that therewere features in it which puzzled and perplexed him not a little.At length, however, he wrote his prescription, and promised to return atnine o'clock. I remember there was something to be rubbed along herspine, and some medicines beside.But these remedies were as entirely unavailing as the others. In a stateof dismay and distraction we watched by the bed in which, in accordancewith the physician's direction, we had placed her. The absolutechangelessness of her condition filled us with despair. The day which hadelapsed had not witnessed even a transitory variation in the dreadfulcharacter of her seizure. Any change, even a change for the worse, wouldhave been better than this sluggish, hopeless monotony of suffering.At the appointed hour the physician returned. He appeared disappointed,almost shocked, at the failure of his prescriptions. On feeling her pulsehe declared that she must have a little wine. There had been a wonderfulprostration of all the vital powers since he had seen her before. Heevidently thought the case a strange and precarious one.She was made to swallow the wine, and her pulse rallied for a time, butsoon subsided again. I and the physician were standing by the fire,talking in whispers of the darling child's symptoms, and likelihood ofrecovery, when we were arrested in our conversation by a cry of anguishfrom the poor mother, who had never left the bedside of her little child,and this cry broke into bitter and convulsive weeping.The poor little child had, on a sudden, stretched down her little handsand feet, and died. There is no mistaking the features of death: thefilmy eye and dropt jaw once seen, are recognised whenever we meet themagain. Yet, spite of our belief, we cling to hope; and the distractedmother called on the physician, in accents which might have moved astatue, to say that her darling was not dead, not quite dead--thatsomething might still be done--that it could not be all over. Silentlyhe satisfied himself that no throb of life still fluttered in thatlittle frame."It is, indeed, all over," he said, in tones scarce above a whisper; andpressing my hand kindly, he said, "comfort your poor wife"; and so, aftera momentary pause, he left the room.This blow had smitten me with stunning suddenness. I looked at the deadchild, and from her to her poor mother. Grief and pity were bothswallowed up in transports of fury and detestation with which thepresence in my house of the wretch who had wrought all this destructionand misery filled my soul. My heart swelled with ungovernable rage; for amoment my habitual fear of him was neutralised by the vehemence of thesepassions. I seized a candle in silence, and mounted the stairs. The sightof the accursed cat, flitting across the lobby, and the loneliness of thehour, made me hesitate for an instant. I had, however, gone so far, thatshame sustained me. Overcoming a momentary thrill of dismay, anddetermined to repel and defy the influence that had so long awed me, Iknocked sharply at the door, and, almost at the same instant, pushed itopen, and entered our lodger's chamber.He had had no candle in the room, and it was lighted only by the"darkness visible" that entered through the window. The candle which Iheld very imperfectly illuminated the large apartment; but I saw hisspectral form floating, rather than walking, back and forward in front ofthe windows.At sight of him, though I hated him more than ever, my instinctive fearreturned. He confronted me, and drew nearer and nearer, without speaking.There was something indefinably fearful in the silent attraction whichseemed to be drawing him to me. I could not help recoiling, little bylittle, as he came toward me, and with an effort I said--"You know why I have come: the child--she's dead!""Dead--ha!--_dead_--is she?" he said, in his odious, mocking tone."Yes--dead!" I cried, with an excitement which chilled my very marrowwith horror; "and _you_ have killed her, as you killed my other.""How?--I killed her!--eh?--ha, ha!" he said, still edging nearerand nearer."Yes; I say you!" I shouted, trembling in every joint, butpossessed by that unaccountable infatuation which has made meninvoke, spite of themselves, their own destruction, and which I waspowerless to resist--"deny it as you may, it is you who killedher--wretch!--FIEND!--no wonder she could not stand the breath andglare of HELL!""And you are one of those who believe that not a sparrow falls to theground without your Creator's consent," he said, with icy sarcasm; "andthis is a specimen of Christian resignation--hey? You charge his act upona poor fellow like me, simply that you may cheat the devil, and rave andrebel against the decrees of heaven, under pretence of abusing me. Thebreath and flare of hell!--eh? You mean that I removed this and these(touching the covering of his mouth and eyes successively) as I _shall_do now again, and show you there's no great harm in that."There was a tone of menace in his concluding words not to be mistaken."Murderer and liar from the beginning, as you are, I defy you!" Ishouted, in a frenzy of hate and horror, stamping furiously on the floor.As I said this, it seemed to me that he darkened and dilated before myeyes. My senses, thoughts, consciousness, grew horribly confused, as ifsome powerful, extraneous will, were seizing upon the functions of mybrain. Whether I were to be mastered by death, or madness, or possession,I knew not; but hideous destruction of some sort was impending: all hungupon the moment, and I cried aloud, in my agony, an adjuration in thename of the three persons of the Trinity, that he should not torment me.Stunned, bewildered, like a man recovered from a drunken fall, I stood,freezing and breathless, in the same spot, looking into the room, whichwore, in my eyes, a strange, unearthly character. Mr. Smith was coweringdarkly in the window, and, after a silence, spoke to me in a croaking,sulky tone, which was, however, unusually submissive."Don't it strike you as an odd procedure to break into a gentleman'sapartment at such an hour, for the purpose of railing at him in thecoarsest language? If you have any charge to make against me, do so; Iinvite inquiry and defy your worst. If you think you can bring home to methe smallest share of blame in this unlucky matter, call the coroner, andlet his inquest examine and cross-examine me, and sift the matter--if,indeed, there is anything to _be_ sifted--to the bottom. Meanwhile, goyou about your business, and leave me to mine. But I see how the windsits; you want to get rid of me, and so you make the place odious to me.But it won't do; and if you take to making criminal charges against me,you had better look to yourself; for two can play at that game."There was a suppressed whine in all this, which strangely contrasted withthe cool and threatening tone of his previous conversation.Without answering a word I hurried from the room, and scarcely feltsecure, even when once more in the melancholy chamber, where my poor wifewas weeping.Miserable, horrible was the night that followed. The loss of our childwas a calamity which we had not dared to think of. It had come, and witha suddenness enough to bereave me of reason. It seemed all unreal, allfantastic. It needed an effort to convince me, minute after minute, thatthe dreadful truth was so; and the old accustomed feeling that she wasstill alive, still running from room to room, and the expectation that Ishould hear her step and her voice, and see her entering at the door,would return. But still the sense of dismay, of having received somestunning, irreparable blow, remained behind; and then came the horribleeffort, like that with which one rouses himself from a haunted sleep, thequestion, "What disaster is this that has befallen?"--answered, alas! buttoo easily, too terribly! Amidst all this was perpetually rising beforemy fancy the obscure, dilated figure of our lodger, as he had confrontedme in his malign power that night. I dismissed the image with a shudderas often as it recurred; and even now, at this distance of time, I havefelt more than I could well describe in the mere effort to fix myrecollection upon its hated traits, while writing the passages I havejust concluded.This hateful scene I did not recount to my poor wife. Its horrors weretoo fresh upon me. I had not courage to trust myself with the agitatingnarrative; and so I sate beside her, with her hand locked in mine: I hadno comfort to offer but the dear love I bore her.At last, like a child, she cried herself to sleep--the dull, heavyslumber of worn-out grief. As for me, the agitation of my soul was toofearful and profound for repose. My eye accidentally rested on the holyvolume, which lay upon the table open, as I had left it in the morning;and the first words which met my eye were these--"For our lightaffliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far moreexceeding and eternal weight of glory." This blessed sentence riveted myattention, and shed a stream of solemn joy upon my heart; and so thegreater part of that mournful night, I continued to draw comfort andheavenly wisdom from the same inspired source.Next day brought the odious incident, the visit of the undertaker--thecarpentery, upholstery, and millinery of death. Why has not civilisationabolished these repulsive and shocking formalities? What has the poorcorpse to do with frills, and pillows, and napkins, and all the equipagein which it rides on its last journey? There is no intrusion so jarringto the decent grief of surviving affection, no conceivable mummery morederisive of mortality.In the room which we had been so long used to call "the nursery," nowdesolate and mute, the unclosed coffin lay, with our darling shrouded init. Before we went to our rest at night we visited it. In the morning thelid was to close over that sweet face, and I was to see the child laid byher little brother. We looked upon the well-known and loved features,purified in the sublime serenity of death, for a long time, whispering toone another, among our sobs, how sweet and beautiful we thought shelooked; and at length, weeping bitterly, we tore ourselves away.We talked and wept for many hours, and at last, in sheer exhaustion,dropt asleep. My little wife awaked me, and said--"I think they have come--the--the undertakers."It was still dark, so I could not consult my watch; but they were to havearrived early, and as it was winter, and the nights long, the hour oftheir visit might well have arrived."What, darling, is your reason for thinking so?" I asked."I am sure I have heard them for some time in the nursery," she answered."Oh! dear, dear little Fanny! Don't allow them to close the coffin untilI have seen my darling once more."I got up, and threw some clothes hastily about me. I opened the door andlistened. A sound like a muffled knocking reached me from the nursery."Yes, my darling!" I said, "I think they have come. I will go and desirethem to wait until you have seen her again."And, so saying, I hastened from the room.Our bedchamber lay at the end of a short corridor, opening from thelobby, at the head of the stairs, and the nursery was situated nearly atthe end of a corresponding passage, which opened from the same lobby atthe opposite side As I hurried along I distinctly heard the same sounds.The light of dawn had not yet appeared, but there was a strong moonlightshining through the windows. I thought the morning could hardly be so faradvanced as we had at first supposed; but still, strangely as it nowseems to me, suspecting nothing amiss, I walked on in noiseless,slippered feet, to the nursery-door. It stood half open; some one hadunquestionably visited it since we had been there. I stepped forward, andentered. At the threshold horror arrested my advance.The coffin was placed upon tressles at the further extremity of thechamber, with the foot of it nearly towards the door, and a large windowat the side of it admitted the cold lustre of the moon full upon theapparatus of mortality, and the objects immediately about it.At the foot of the coffin stood the ungainly form of our lodger. Heseemed to be intently watching the face of the corpse, and was stooped alittle, while with his hands he tapped sharply, from time to time at thesides of the coffin, like one who designs to awaken a slumberer. Perchedupon the body of the child, and nuzzling among the grave-clothes, with astrange kind of ecstasy, was the detested brute, the cat I have so oftenmentioned.The group thus revealed, I looked upon but for one instant; in the next Ishouted, in absolute terror--"In God's name! what are you doing?"Our lodger shuffled away abruptly, as if disconcerted; but theill-favoured cat, whisking round, stood like a demon sentinel upon thecorpse, growling and hissing, with arched back and glaring eyes.The lodger, turning abruptly toward me, motioned me to one side.Mechanically I obeyed his gesture, and he hurried hastily from the room.Sick and dizzy, I returned to my own chamber. I confess I had not nerveto combat the infernal brute, which still held possession of the room,and so I left it undisturbed.This incident I did not tell to my wife until some time afterwards; and Imention it here because it was, and is, in my mind associated with apainful circumstance which very soon afterwards came to light.That morning I witnessed the burial of my darling child. Sore anddesolate was my heart; but with infinite gratitude to the greatcontroller of all events, I recognised in it a change which nothing butthe spirit of all good can effect. The love and fear of God had grownstrong within me--in humbleness I bowed to his awful will--with a sinceretrust I relied upon the goodness, the wisdom, and the mercy of him whohad sent this great affliction. But a further incident connected withthis very calamity was to test this trust and patience to the uttermost.It was still early when I returned, having completed the last sad office.My wife, as I afterwards learned, still lay weeping upon her bed. Butsomebody awaited my return in the hall, and opened the door, anticipatingmy knock. This person was our lodger.I was too much appalled by the sudden presentation of this abhorredspectre even to retreat, as my instinct would have directed, through theopen door."I have been expecting your return," he said, "with the design of sayingsomething which it might have profited you to learn, but now I apprehendit is too late. What a pity you are so violent and impatient; you wouldnot have heard me, in all probability, this morning. You cannot thinkhow cross-grained and intemperate you have grown since you became asaint--but that is your affair, not mine. You have buried your littledaughter this morning. It requires a good deal of that new attribute ofyours, _faith_, which judges all things by a rule of contraries, and cannever see anything but kindness in the worst afflictions which malignitycould devise, to discover benignity and mercy in the torturing calamitywhich has just punished you and your wife for _nothing_! But I fancythat it will be harder still when I tell you what I more thansuspect--ha, ha. It would be really ridiculous, if it were notheart-rending; that your little girl has been actually buried _alive_;do you comprehend me?--alive. For, upon my life, I fancy she was notdead as she lay in her coffin."I knew the wretch was exulting in the fresh anguish he had justinflicted. I know not how it was, but any announcement of _disaster_ fromhis lips, seemed to me to be necessarily true. Half-stifled with thedreadful emotions he had raised, palpitating between hope and terror, Irushed frantically back again, the way I had just come, running as fastas my speed could carry me, toward the, alas! distant burial-ground wheremy darling lay.I stopped a cab slowly returning to town, at the corner of the lane,sprang into it, directed the man to drive to the church of ----, andpromised him anything and everything for despatch. The man seemed amazed;doubtful, perhaps, whether he carried a maniac or a malefactor. Still hetook his chance for the promised reward, and galloped his horse, while I,tortured with suspense, yelled my frantic incentives to further speed.At last, in a space immeasurably short, but which to me was protractedalmost beyond endurance, we reached the spot. I halloed to the sexton,who was now employed upon another grave, to follow me. I myself seized amattock, and in obedience to my incoherent and agonised commands, heworked as he had never worked before. The crumbling mould flew swiftly tothe upper soil--deeper and deeper, every moment, grew the narrowgrave--at last I sobbed, "Thank God--thank God," as I saw the face of thecoffin emerge; a few seconds more and it lay upon the sward beside me,and we both, with the edges of our spades, ripped up the lid._There_ was the corpse--but not the tranquil statue I had seen it last.Its knees were both raised, and one of its little hands drawn up andclenched near its throat, as if in a feeble but agonised struggle toforce up the superincumbent mass. The eyes, that I had last seen closed,were now open, and the face no longer serenely pale, but livid anddistorted.I had time to see all in an instant; the whole scene reeled and darkenedbefore me, and I swooned away.When I came to myself, I found that I had been removed to thevestry-room. The open coffin was in the aisle of the church, surroundedby a curious crowd. A medical gentleman had examined the body carefully,and had pronounced life totally extinct. The trepidation and horror Iexperienced were indescribable. I felt like the murderer of my own child.Desperate as I was of any chance of its life, I dispatched messengers forno less than three of the most eminent physicians then practising inLondon. All concurred--the child was now as dead as any other, the oldesttenant of the churchyard.Notwithstanding which, I would not permit the body to be reinterred forseveral days, until the symptoms of decay became unequivocal, and themost fantastic imagination could no longer cherish a doubt. This,however, I mention only parenthetically, as I hasten to the conclusion ofmy narrative. The circumstance which I have last described found its wayto the public, and caused no small sensation at the time.I drove part of the way home, and then discharged the cab, and walked theremainder. On my way, with an emotion of ecstasy I cannot describe, I metthe good being to whom I owed so much. I ran to meet him, and felt as ifI could throw myself at his feet, and kiss the very ground before him. Iknew by his heavenly countenance he was come to speak comfort and healingto my heart.With humbleness and gratitude, I drank in his sage and holy discourse. Ineed not follow the gracious and delightful exposition of God's revealedwill and character with which he cheered and confirmed my falteringspirit. A solemn joy, a peace and trust, streamed on my heart. The wreckand desolation there, lost their bleak and ghastly character, like ruinsilluminated by the mellow beams of a solemn summer sunset.In this conversation, I told him what I had never revealed to any onebefore--the absolute terror, in all its stupendous and maddeningamplitude, with which I regarded our ill-omened lodger, and my agonisedanxiety to rid my house of him. My companion answered me--"I know the person of whom you speak--he designs no good for you or anyother. He, too, knows me, and I have intimated to him that he must nowleave you, and visit you no more. Be firm and bold, trusting in God,through his Son, like a good soldier, and you will win the victory from agreater and even worse than he--the _unseen_ enemy of mankind. You neednot see or speak with your evil tenant any more. Call to him from yourhall, in the name of the Most Holy, to leave you bodily, with all thatappertains to him, this evening. He knows that he must go, and will obeyyou. But leave the house as soon as may be yourself; you will scarce havepeace in it. Your own remembrances will trouble you and _other minds haveestablished associations within its walls and chambers too_."These words sounded mysteriously in my ears.Let me say here, before I bring my reminiscences to a close, a word ortwo about the house in which these detested scenes occurred, and which Idid not long continue to inhabit. What I afterwards learned of it, seemedto supply in part a dim explanation of these words.In a country village there is no difficulty in accounting for thetenacity with which the sinister character of a haunted tenement cleavesto it. Thin neighbourhoods are favourable to scandal; and in suchlocalities the reputation of a house, like that of a woman, once blownupon, never quite recovers. In huge London, however, it is quite anothermatter; and, therefore, it was with some surprise that, five years afterI had vacated the house in which the occurrences I have described tookplace, I learned that a respectable family who had taken it were obligedto give it up, on account of annoyances, for which they could notaccount, and all proceeding from the apartments formerly occupied by our"lodger." Among the sounds described were footsteps restlesslytraversing the floor of that room, accompanied by the peculiar tappingof the crutch.I was so anxious about this occurrence, that I contrived to have strictinquiries made into the matter. The result, however, added little to whatI had at first learned--except, indeed, that our old friend, the cat,bore a part in the transaction as I suspected; for the servant, who hadbeen placed to sleep in the room, complained that something bounded onand off, and ran to-and-fro along the foot of the bed, in the dark. Thesame servant, while in the room, in the broad daylight, had heard thesound of walking, and even the rustling of clothes near him, as of peoplepassing and repassing; and, although he had never seen anything, he yetbecame so terrified that he would not remain in the house, andultimately, in a short time, left his situation.These sounds, attention having been called to them, were now incessantlyobserved--the measured walking up and down the room, the opening andclosing of the door, and the teazing tap of the crutch--all these soundswere continually repeated, until at last, worn out, frightened, andworried, its occupants resolved on abandoning the house.About four years since, having had occasion to visit the capital, Iresolved on a ramble by Old Brompton, just to see if the house were stillinhabited. I searched for it, however, in vain, and at length, withdifficulty, ascertained its site, upon which now stood two small,staring, bran-new brick houses, with each a gay enclosure of flowers.Every trace of our old mansion, and, let us hope, of our "mysteriouslodger," had entirely vanished.Let me, however, return to my narrative where I left it.Discoursing upon heavenly matters, my good and gracious friendaccompanied me even within the outer gate of my own house. I asked him tocome in and rest himself, but he would not; and before he turned todepart, he lifted up his hand, and blessed me and my household.Having done this, he went away. My eyes followed him till he disappeared,and I turned to the house. My darling wife was standing at the window ofthe parlour. There was a seraphic smile on her face--pale, pure, andbeautiful as death. She was gazing with an humble, heavenly earnestnesson us. The parting blessing of the stranger shed a sweet and hallowedinfluence on my heart. I went into the parlour, to my darling: childlessshe was now; I had now need to be a tender companion to her.She raised her arms in a sort of transport, with the same smile ofgratitude and purity, and, throwing them round my neck, she said--"I have seen him--it is he--the man that came with you to the door, andblessed us as he went away--is the same I saw in my dream--the same whotook little baby in his arms, and said he would take care of him, andgive him safely to me again."More than a quarter of a century has glided away since then; otherchildren have been given us by the good God--children who have been, frominfancy to maturity, a pride and blessing to us. Sorrows and reverses,too, have occasionally visited us; yet, on the whole, we have beengreatly blessed; prosperity has long since ended all the cares of the_res angusta domi_, and expanded our power of doing good to ourfellow-creatures. God has given it; and God, we trust, directs itsdispensation. In our children, and--would you think it?--our_grand_-children, too, the same beneficent God has given us objects thatelicit and return all the delightful affections, and exchange the sweetconverse that makes home and family dearer than aught else, save thatblessed home where the Christian family shall meet at last.The dear companion of my early love and sorrows still lives, blessed beHeaven! The evening tints of life have fallen upon her; but the dearremembrance of a first love, that never grew cold, makes her beautychangeless for me. As for your humble servant, he is considerably hersenior, and looks it: time has stolen away his raven locks, and givenhim a _chevelure_ of snow instead. But, as I said before, I and my wifelove, and, I believe, _admire_ one another more than ever; and I haveoften seen our elder children smile archly at one another, when theythought we did not observe them, thinking, no doubt, how like a pair oflovers we two were.***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK J.

But this the world is just beginning to know. Theworld's explorers have known it, from time to time, but hitherto theyhave never returned to tell the world.The Barrens--well, they are the Barrens, the bad lands of the Arctic,the deserts of the Circle, the bleak and bitter home of the musk-oxand the lean plains wolf. So Avery Van Brunt found them, treeless andcheerless, sparsely clothed with moss and lichens, and altogetheruninviting. At least so he found them till he penetrated to the whiteblank spaces on the map, and came upon undreamed-of rich spruceforests and unrecorded Eskimo tribes. It had been his intention, (andhis bid for fame), to break up these white blank spaces and diversifythem with the black markings of mountain-chains, sinks and basins, andsinuous river courses; and it was with added delight that he came tospeculate upon the possibilities of timber belts and native villages.Avery Van Brunt, or, in full distinction, Professor A. Van Brunt ofthe Geological Survey, was second in command of the expedition, andfirst in command of the sub-expedition which he had led on a side tourof some half a thousand miles up one of the branches of the Thelon andwhich he was now leading into one of his unrecorded villages. At hisback plodded eight men, two of them French-Canadian _voyageurs_,and the remainder strapping Crees from Manitoba-way. He, alone, wasfull-blooded Saxon, and his blood was pounding fiercely through hisveins to the traditions of his race. Clive and Hastings, Drake andRaleigh, Hengest and Horsa, walked with him. First of all men of hisbreed was he to enter this lone Northland village, and at the thoughtan exultancy came upon him, an exaltation, and his followers notedthat his leg-weariness fell from him and that he insensibly quickenedthe pace.The village emptied itself, and a motley crowd trooped out to meethim, men in the forefront, with bows and spears clutched menacingly,and women and children faltering timidly in the rear. Van Brunt liftedhis right arm and made the universal peace sign, a sign which allpeoples know, and the villagers answered in peace. But to his chagrin,a skin-clad man ran forward and thrust out his hand with a familiar"Hello." He was a bearded man, with cheeks and brow bronzed tocopper-brown, and in him Van Brunt knew his kind."Who are you?" he asked, gripping the extended hand. "Andree?""Who's Andree?" the man asked back.Van Brunt looked at him more sharply. "By George, you've been heresome time.""Five years," the man answered, a dim flicker of pride in his eyes."But come on, let's talk.""Let them camp alongside of me," he answered Van Brunt's glance at hisparty. "Old Tantlatch will take care of them. Come on."He swung off in a long stride, Van Brunt following at his heelsthrough the village. In irregular fashion, wherever the groundfavored, the lodges of moose hide were pitched. Van Brunt ran hispractised eye over them and calculated."Two hundred, not counting the young ones," he summed up.The man nodded. "Pretty close to it. But here's where I live, out ofthe thick of it, you know--more privacy and all that. Sit down. I'lleat with you when your men get something cooked up. I've forgottenwhat tea tastes like.... Five years and never a taste or smell.... Anytobacco?... Ah, thanks, and a pipe? Good. Now for a fire-stick andwe'll see if the weed has lost its cunning."He scratched the match with the painstaking care of the woodsman,cherished its young flame as though there were never another in allthe world, and drew in the first mouthful of smoke. This he retainedmeditatively for a time, and blew out through his pursed lips slowlyand caressingly. Then his face seemed to soften as he leaned back,and a soft blur to film his eyes. He sighed heavily, happily, withimmeasurable content, and then said suddenly:"God! But that tastes good!"Van Brunt nodded sympathetically. "Five years, you say?""Five years." The man sighed again. "And you, I presume, wish to knowabout it, being naturally curious, and this a sufficiently strangesituation, and all that. But it's not much. I came in from Edmontonafter musk-ox, and like Pike and the rest of them, had my mischances,only I lost my party and outfit. Starvation, hardship, the regulartale, you know, sole survivor and all that, till I crawled intoTantlatch's, here, on hand and knee.""Five years," Van Brunt murmured retrospectively, as though turningthings over in his mind."Five years on February last. I crossed the Great Slave early inMay--""And you are ... Fairfax?" Van Brunt interjected.The man nodded."Let me see ... John, I think it is, John Fairfax.""How did you know?" Fairfax queried lazily, half-absorbed in curlingsmoke-spirals upward in the quiet air."The papers were full of it at the time. Prevanche--""Prevanche!" Fairfax sat up, suddenly alert. "He was lost in the SmokeMountains.""Yes, but he pulled through and came out."Fairfax settled back again and resumed his smoke-spirals. "I am gladto hear it," he remarked reflectively. "Prevanche was a bully fellowif he _did_ have ideas about head-straps, the beggar. And he pulledthrough? Well, I'm glad."Five years ... the phrase drifted recurrently through Van Brunt'sthought, and somehow the face of Emily Southwaithe seemed to rise upand take form before him. Five years ... A wedge of wild-fowl honkedlow overhead and at sight of the encampment veered swiftly to thenorth into the smouldering sun. Van Brunt could not follow them. Hepulled out his watch. It was an hour past midnight. The northwardclouds flushed bloodily, and rays of sombre-red shot southward, firingthe gloomy woods with a lurid radiance. The air was in breathlesscalm, not a needle quivered, and the least sounds of the camp weredistinct and clear as trumpet calls. The Crees and _voyageurs_ feltthe spirit of it and mumbled in dreamy undertones, and the cookunconsciously subdued the clatter of pot and pan. Somewhere a childwas crying, and from the depths of the forest, like a silverthread, rose a woman's voice in mournful chant:"O-o-o-o-o-o-a-haa-ha-a-ha-aa-a-a, O-o-o-o-o-o-a-ha-a-ha-a."Van Brunt shivered and rubbed the backs of his hands briskly."And they gave me up for dead?" his companion asked slowly."Well, you never came back, so your friends--""Promptly forgot." Fairfax laughed harshly, defiantly."Why didn't you come out?""Partly disinclination, I suppose, and partly because of circumstancesover which I had no control. You see, Tantlatch, here, was down with abroken leg when I made his acquaintance,--a nasty fracture,--and Iset it for him and got him into shape. I stayed some time, getting mystrength back. I was the first white man he had seen, and of course Iseemed very wise and showed his people no end of things. Coached themup in military tactics, among other things, so that they conquered thefour other tribal villages, (which you have not yet seen), and came torule the land. And they naturally grew to think a good deal of me, somuch so that when I was ready to go they wouldn't hear of it. Weremost hospitable, in fact. Put a couple of guards over me and watchedme day and night. And then Tantlatch offered me inducements,--in asense, inducements,--so to say, and as it didn't matter much one wayor the other, I reconciled myself to remaining.""I knew your brother at Freiburg. I am Van Brunt."Fairfax reached forward impulsively and shook his hand. "You wereBilly's friend, eh? Poor Billy! He spoke of you often.""Rum meeting place, though," he added, casting an embracing glanceover the primordial landscape and listening for a moment to thewoman's mournful notes. "Her man was clawed by a bear, and she'staking it hard.""Beastly life!" Van Brunt grimaced his disgust. "I suppose, after fiveyears of it, civilization will be sweet? What do you say?"Fairfax's face took on a stolid expression. "Oh, I don't know. Atleast they're honest folk and live according to their lights. And thenthey are amazingly simple. No complexity about them, no thousand andone subtle ramifications to every single emotion they experience. Theylove, fear, hate, are angered, or made happy, in common, ordinary, andunmistakable terms. It may be a beastly life, but at least it is easyto live. No philandering, no dallying. If a woman likes you, she'llnot be backward in telling you so. If she hates you, she'll tell youso, and then, if you feel inclined, you can beat her, but the thingis, she knows precisely what you mean, and you know precisely whatshe means. No mistakes, no misunderstandings. It has its charm, aftercivilization's fitful fever. Comprehend?""No, it's a pretty good life," he continued, after a pause; "goodenough for me, and I intend to stay with it."Van Brunt lowered his head in a musing manner, and an imperceptiblesmile played on his mouth. No philandering, no dallying, nomisunderstanding. Fairfax also was taking it hard, he thought, justbecause Emily Southwaithe had been mistakenly clawed by a bear. Andnot a bad sort of a bear, either, was Carlton Southwaithe."But you are coming along with me," Van Brunt said deliberately."No, I'm not.""Yes, you are.""Life's too easy here, I tell you." Fairfax spoke with decision."I understand everything, and I am understood. Summer and winteralternate like the sun flashing through the palings of a fence, theseasons are a blur of light and shade, and time slips by, and lifeslips by, and then ... a wailing in the forest, and the dark. Listen!"He held up his hand, and the silver thread of the woman's sorrow rosethrough the silence and the calm. Fairfax joined in softly."O-o-o-o-o-o-a-haa-ha-a-ha-aa-a-a, O-o-o-o-o-o-a-ha-a-ha-a," he sang."Can't you hear it? Can't you see it? The women mourning? the funeralchant? my hair white-locked and patriarchal? my skins wrapped in rudesplendor about me? my hunting-spear by my side? And who shall say itis not well?"Van Brunt looked at him coolly. "Fairfax, you are a damned fool. Fiveyears of this is enough to knock any man, and you are in an unhealthy,morbid condition. Further, Carlton Southwaithe is dead."Van Brunt filled his pipe and lighted it, the while watching slylyand with almost professional interest. Fairfax's eyes flashed on theinstant, his fists clenched, he half rose up, then his muscles relaxedand he seemed to brood. Michael, the cook, signalled that the meal wasready, but Van Brunt motioned back to delay. The silence hung heavy,and he fell to analyzing the forest scents, the odors of mould androtting vegetation, the resiny smells of pine cones and needles, thearomatic savors of many camp-smokes. Twice Fairfax looked up, but saidnothing, and then:"And ... Emily ...?""Three years a widow; still a widow."Another long silence settled down, to be broken by Fairfax finallywith a naive smile. "I guess you're right, Van Brunt. I'll go along.""I knew you would." Van Brunt laid his hand on Fairfax's shoulder. "Ofcourse, one cannot know, but I imagine--for one in her position--shehas had offers--""When do you start?" Fairfax interrupted."After the men have had some sleep. Which reminds me, Michael isgetting angry, so come and eat."After supper, when the Crees and _voyageurs_ had rolled into theirblankets, snoring, the two men lingered by the dying fire. There wasmuch to talk about,--wars and politics and explorations, the doingsof men and the happening of things, mutual friends, marriages,deaths,--five years of history for which Fairfax clamored."So the Spanish fleet was bottled up in Santiago," Van Brunt wassaying, when a young woman stepped lightly before him and stood byFairfax's side. She looked swiftly into his face, then turned atroubled gaze upon Van Brunt."Chief Tantlatch's daughter, sort of princess," Fairfax explained,with an honest flush. "One of the inducements, in short, to make mestay. Thom, this is Van Brunt, friend of mine."Van Brunt held out his hand, but the woman maintained a rigid reposequite in keeping with her general appearance. Not a line of her facesoftened, not a feature unbent. She looked him straight in the eyes,her own piercing, questioning, searching."Precious lot she understands," Fairfax laughed. "Her firstintroduction, you know. But as you were saying, with the Spanish fleetbottled up in Santiago?"Thom crouched down by her husband's side, motionless as a bronzestatue, only her eyes flashing from face to face in ceaseless search.And Avery Van Brunt, as he talked on and on, felt a nervousness underthe dumb gaze. In the midst of his most graphic battle descriptions,he would become suddenly conscious of the black eyes burning into him,and would stumble and flounder till he could catch the gait and goagain. Fairfax, hands clasped round knees, pipe out, absorbed, spurredhim on when he lagged, and repictured the world he thought he hadforgotten.One hour passed, and two, and Fairfax rose reluctantly to his feet."And Cronje was cornered, eh? Well, just wait a moment till I run overto Tantlatch. He'll be expecting you, and I'll arrange for you to seehim after breakfast. That will be all right, won't it?"He went off between the pines, and Van Brunt found himself staringinto Thom's warm eyes. Five years, he mused, and she can't be morethan twenty now. A most remarkable creature. Being Eskimo, she shouldhave a little flat excuse for a nose, and lo, it is neither broad norflat, but aquiline, with nostrils delicately and sensitively formedas any fine lady's of a whiter breed--the Indian strain somewhere, beassured, Avery Van Brunt. And, Avery Van Brunt, don't be nervous, shewon't eat you; she's only a woman, and not a bad-looking one at that.Oriental rather than aborigine. Eyes large and fairly wide apart, withjust the faintest hint of Mongol obliquity. Thom, you're an anomaly.You're out of place here among these Eskimos, even if your father isone. Where did your mother come from? or your grandmother? And Thom,my dear, you're a beauty, a frigid, frozen little beauty with Alaskanlava in your blood, and please don't look at me that way.He laughed and stood up. Her insistent stare disconcerted him. A dogwas prowling among the grub-sacks. He would drive it away and placethem into safety against Fairfax's return. But Thom stretched out adetaining hand and stood up, facing him."You?" she said, in the Arctic tongue which differs little fromGreenland to Point Barrow. "You?"And the swift expression of her face demanded all for which "you"stood, his reason for existence, his presence there, his relation toher husband--everything."Brother," he answered in the same tongue, with a sweeping gesture tothe south. "Brothers we be, your man and I."She shook her head. "It is not good that you be here.""After one sleep I go.""And my man?" she demanded, with tremulous eagerness.Van Brunt shrugged his shoulders. He was aware of a certain secretshame, of an impersonal sort of shame, and an anger against Fairfax.And he felt the warm blood in his face as he regarded the youngsavage. She was just a woman. That was all--a woman. The whole sordidstory over again, over and over again, as old as Eve and young as thelast new love-light."My man! My man! My man!" she was reiterating vehemently, her facepassionately dark, and the ruthless tenderness of the Eternal Woman,the Mate-Woman, looking out at him from her eyes."Thom," he said gravely, in English, "you were born in the Northlandforest, and you have eaten fish and meat, and fought with frost andfamine, and lived simply all the days of your life. And there are manythings, indeed not simple, which you do not know and cannot come tounderstand. You do not know what it is to long for the fleshpots afar,you cannot understand what it is to yearn for a fair woman's face. Andthe woman is fair, Thom, the woman is nobly fair. You have been womanto this man, and you have been your all, but your all is very little,very simple. Too little and too simple, and he is an alien man. Himyou have never known, you can never know. It is so ordained. You heldhim in your arms, but you never held his heart, this man with hisblurring seasons and his dreams of a barbaric end. Dreams anddream-dust, that is what he has been to you. You clutched at form andgripped shadow, gave yourself to a man and bedded with the wraith ofa man. In such manner, of old, did the daughters of men whom the godsfound fair. And, Thom, Thom, I should not like to be John Fairfax inthe night-watches of the years to come, in the night-watches, when hiseyes shall see, not the sun-gloried hair of the woman by his side, butthe dark tresses of a mate forsaken in the forests of the North."Though she did not understand, she had listened with intenseattention, as though life hung on his speech. But she caught at herhusband's name and cried out in Eskimo:--"Yes! Yes! Fairfax! My man!""Poor little fool, how could he be your man?"But she could not understand his English tongue, and deemed that shewas being trifled with. The dumb, insensate anger of the Mate-Womanflamed in her face, and it almost seemed to the man as though shecrouched panther-like for the spring.He cursed softly to himself and watched the fire fade from her faceand the soft luminous glow of the appealing woman spring up, of theappealing woman who foregoes strength and panoplies herself wisely inher weakness."He is my man," she said gently. "Never have I known other. It cannotbe that I should ever know other. Nor can it be that he should go fromme.""Who has said he shall go from thee?" he demanded sharply, half inexasperation, half in impotence."It is for thee to say he shall not go from me," she answered softly,a half-sob in her throat.Van Brunt kicked the embers of the fire savagely and sat down."It is for thee to say. He is my man. Before all women he is my man.Thou art big, thou art strong, and behold, I am very weak. See, I amat thy feet. It is for thee to deal with me. It is for thee.""Get up!" He jerked her roughly erect and stood up himself. "Thou arta woman. Wherefore the dirt is no place for thee, nor the feet of anyman.""He is my man.""Then Jesus forgive all men!" Van Brunt cried out passionately."He is my man," she repeated monotonously, beseechingly."He is my brother," he answered."My father is Chief Tantlatch. He is a power over five villages. Iwill see that the five villages be searched for thy choice of allmaidens, that thou mayest stay here by thy brother, and dwell incomfort.""After one sleep I go.""And my man?""Thy man comes now. Behold!"From among the gloomy spruces came the light carolling of Fairfax'svoice.As the day is quenched by a sea of fog, so his song smote the lightout of her face. "It is the tongue of his own people," she said; "thetongue of his own people."She turned, with the free movement of a lithe young animal, and madeoff into the forest."It's all fixed," Fairfax called as he came up. "His regal highnesswill receive you after breakfast.""Have you told him?" Van Brunt asked."No. Nor shall I tell him till we're ready to pull out."Van Brunt looked with moody affection over the sleeping forms of hismen."I shall be glad when we are a hundred leagues upon our way," he said.       *       *       *       *       *Thom raised the skin-flap of her father's lodge. Two men sat withhim, and the three looked at her with swift interest. But her facebetokened nothing as she entered and took seat quietly, withoutspeech. Tantlatch drummed with his knuckles on a spear-heft acrosshis knees, and gazed idly along the path of a sun-ray which pierced alacing-hole and flung a glittering track across the murky atmosphereof the lodge. To his right, at his shoulder, crouched Chugungatte, theshaman. Both were old men, and the weariness of many years brooded intheir eyes. But opposite them sat Keen, a young man and chief favoritein the tribe. He was quick and alert of movement, and his black eyesflashed from face to face in ceaseless scrutiny and challenge.Silence reigned in the place. Now and again camp noises penetrated,and from the distance, faint and far, like the shadows of voices, camethe wrangling of boys in thin shrill tones. A dog thrust his head intothe entrance and blinked wolfishly at them for a space, the slaverdripping from his ivory-white fangs. After a time he growledtentatively, and then, awed by the immobility of the human figures,lowered his head and grovelled away backward. Tantlatch glancedapathetically at his daughter."And thy man, how is it with him and thee?""He sings strange songs," Thom made answer, "and there is a new lookon his face.""So? He hath spoken?""Nay, but there is a new look on his face, a new light in his eyes,and with the New-Comer he sits by the fire, and they talk and talk,and the talk is without end."Chugungatte whispered in his master's ear, and Keen leaned forwardfrom his hips."There be something calling him from afar," she went on, "and heseems to sit and listen, and to answer, singing, in his own people'stongue."Again Chugungatte whispered and Keen leaned forward, and Thom held herspeech till her father nodded his head that she might proceed."It be known to thee, O Tantlatch, that the wild goose and the swanand the little ringed duck be born here in the low-lying lands. Itbe known that they go away before the face of the frost to unknownplaces. And it be known, likewise, that always do they return when thesun is in the land and the waterways are free. Always do they returnto where they were born, that new life may go forth. The land calls tothem and they come. And now there is another land that calls, and itis calling to my man,--the land where he was born,--and he hath it inmind to answer the call. Yet is he my man. Before all women is he myman.""Is it well, Tantlatch? Is it well?" Chugungatte demanded, with thehint of menace in his voice."Ay, it is well!" Keen cried boldly. "The land calls to its children,and all lands call their children home again. As the wild goose andthe swan and the little ringed duck are called, so is called thisStranger Man who has lingered with us and who now must go. Also therebe the call of kind. The goose mates with the goose, nor does the swanmate with the little ringed duck. It is not well that the swan shouldmate with the little ringed duck. Nor is it well that stranger menshould mate with the women of our villages. Wherefore I say the manshould go, to his own kind, in his own land.""He is my own man," Thom answered, "and he is a great man.""Ay, he is a great man." Chugungatte lifted his head with a faintrecrudescence of youthful vigor. "He is a great man, and he putstrength in thy arm, O Tantlatch, and gave thee power, and made thyname to be feared in the land, to be feared and to be respected. Heis very wise, and there be much profit in his wisdom. To him are webeholden for many things,--for the cunning in war and the secrets ofthe defence of a village and a rush in the forest, for the discussionin council and the undoing of enemies by word of mouth and thehard-sworn promise, for the gathering of game and the making of trapsand the preserving of food, for the curing of sickness and mending ofhurts of trail and fight. Thou, Tantlatch, wert a lame old man thisday, were it not that the Stranger Man came into our midst andattended on thee. And ever, when in doubt on strange questions, havewe gone to him, that out of his wisdom he might make things clear, andever has he made things clear. And there be questions yet to arise,and needs upon his wisdom yet to come, and we cannot bear to let himgo. It is not well that we should let him go."Tantlatch continued to drum on the spear-haft, and gave no sign thathe had heard. Thom studied his face in vain, and Chugungatte seemed toshrink together and droop down as the weight of years descended uponhim again."No man makes my kill." Keen smote his breast a valorous blow. "I makemy own kill. I am glad to live when I make my own kill. When I creepthrough the snow upon the great moose, I am glad. And when I draw thebow, so, with my full strength, and drive the arrow fierce and swiftand to the heart, I am glad. And the meat of no man's kill tastesas sweet as the meat of my kill. I am glad to live, glad in my owncunning and strength, glad that I am a doer of things, a doer ofthings for myself. Of what other reason to live than that? Why shouldI live if I delight not in myself and the things I do? And it isbecause I delight and am glad that I go forth to hunt and fish, and itis because I go forth to hunt and fish that I grow cunning and strong.The man who stays in the lodge by the fire grows not cunning andstrong. He is not made happy in the eating of my kill, nor is livingto him a delight. He does not live. And so I say it is well thisStranger Man should go. His wisdom does not make us wise. If he becunning, there is no need that we be cunning. If need arise, we goto him for his cunning. We eat the meat of his kill, and it tastesunsweet. We merit by his strength, and in it there is no delight.We do not live when he does our living for us. We grow fat and likewomen, and we are afraid to work, and we forget how to do things forourselves. Let the man go, O Tantlatch, that we may be men! I am Keen,a man, and I make my own kill!"Tantlatch turned a gaze upon him in which seemed the vacancy ofeternity. Keen waited the decision expectantly; but the lips did notmove, and the old chief turned toward his daughter."That which be given cannot be taken away," she burst forth. "I wasbut a girl when this Stranger Man, who is my man, came among us. AndI knew not men, or the ways of men, and my heart was in the play ofgirls, when thou, Tantlatch, thou and none other, didst call me tothee and press me into the arms of the Stranger Man. Thou and noneother, Tantlatch; and as thou didst give me to the man, so didst thougive the man to me. He is my man. In my arms has he slept, and from myarms he cannot be taken.""It were well, O Tantlatch," Keen followed quickly, with a significantglance at Thom, "it were well to remember that that which be givencannot be taken away."Chugungatte straightened up. "Out of thy youth, Keen, come the wordsof thy mouth. As for ourselves, O Tantlatch, we be old men and weunderstand. We, too, have looked into the eyes of women and felt ourblood go hot with strange desires. But the years have chilled us, andwe have learned the wisdom of the council, the shrewdness of the coolhead and hand, and we know that the warm heart be over-warm and proneto rashness. We know that Keen found favor in thy eyes. We know thatThom was promised him in the old days when she was yet a child. And weknow that the new days came, and the Stranger Man, and that out of ourwisdom and desire for welfare was Thom lost to Keen and the promisebroken."The old shaman paused, and looked directly at the young man."And be it known that I, Chugungatte, did advise that the promise bebroken.""Nor have I taken other woman to my bed," Keen broke in. "And I havebuilded my own fire, and cooked my own food, and ground my teeth in myloneliness."Chugungatte waved his hand that he had not finished. "I am an old manand I speak from understanding. It be good to be strong and grasp forpower. It be better to forego power that good come out of it. In theold days I sat at thy shoulder, Tantlatch, and my voice was heard overall in the council, and my advice taken in affairs of moment. And Iwas strong and held power. Under Tantlatch I was the greatest man.Then came the Stranger Man, and I saw that he was cunning and wise andgreat. And in that he was wiser and greater than I, it was plain thatgreater profit should arise from him than from me. And I had thy ear,Tantlatch, and thou didst listen to my words, and the Stranger Man wasgiven power and place and thy daughter, Thom. And the tribe prosperedunder the new laws in the new days, and so shall it continue toprosper with the Stranger Man in our midst. We be old men, we two, OTantlatch, thou and I, and this be an affair of head, not heart. Hearmy words, Tantlatch! Hear my words! The man remains!"There was a long silence. The old chief pondered with the massivecertitude of God, and Chugungatte seemed to wrap himself in the mistsof a great antiquity. Keen looked with yearning upon the woman, andshe, unnoting, held her eyes steadfastly upon her father's face. Thewolf-dog shoved the flap aside again, and plucking courage at thequiet, wormed forward on his belly. He sniffed curiously at Thom'slistless hand, cocked ears challengingly at Chugungatte, and huncheddown upon his haunches before Tantlatch. The spear rattled to theground, and the dog, with a frightened yell, sprang sideways, snappingin mid-air, and on the second leap cleared the entrance.Tantlatch looked from face to face, pondering each one long andcarefully. Then he raised his head, with rude royalty, and gavejudgment in cold and even tones: "The man remains. Let the hunters becalled together. Send a runner to the next village with word tobring on the fighting men. I shall not see the New-Comer. Do thou,Chugungatte, have talk with him. Tell him he may go at once, if hewould go in peace. And if fight there be, kill, kill, kill, to thelast man; but let my word go forth that no harm befall our man,--theman whom my daughter hath wedded. It is well."Chugungatte rose and tottered out; Thom followed; but as Keen stoopedto the entrance the voice of Tantlatch stopped him."Keen, it were well to hearken to my word. The man remains. Let noharm befall him."Because of Fairfax's instructions in the art of war, the tribesmen didnot hurl themselves forward boldly and with clamor. Instead, there wasgreat restraint and self-control, and they were content to advancesilently, creeping and crawling from shelter to shelter. By the riverbank, and partly protected by a narrow open space, crouched the Creesand _voyageurs_. Their eyes could see nothing, and only in vagueways did their ears hear, but they felt the thrill of life whichran through the forest, the indistinct, indefinable movement of anadvancing host."Damn them," Fairfax muttered. "They've never faced powder, but Itaught them the trick."Avery Van Brunt laughed, knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and put itcarefully away with the pouch, and loosened the hunting-knife in itssheath at his hip."Wait," he said. "We'll wither the face of the charge and break theirhearts.""They'll rush scattered if they remember my teaching.""Let them. Magazine rifles were made to pump. We'll--good! Firstblood! Extra tobacco, Loon!"Loon, a Cree, had spotted an exposed shoulder and with a stingingbullet apprised its owner of his discovery."If we can tease them into breaking forward," Fairfax muttered,--"ifwe can only tease them into breaking forward."Van Brunt saw a head peer from behind a distant tree, and with a quickshot sent the man sprawling to the ground in a death struggle. Michaelpotted a third, and Fairfax and the rest took a hand, firing at everyexposure and into each clump of agitated brush. In crossing one littleswale out of cover, five of the tribesmen remained on their faces, andto the left, where the covering was sparse, a dozen men were struck.But they took the punishment with sullen steadiness, coming oncautiously, deliberately, without haste and without lagging.Ten minutes later, when they were quite close, all movement wassuspended, the advance ceased abruptly, and the quietness thatfollowed was portentous, threatening. Only could be seen the green andgold of the woods, and undergrowth, shivering and trembling to thefirst faint puffs of the day-wind. The wan white morning sun mottledthe earth with long shadows and streaks of light. A wounded man liftedhis head and crawled painfully out of the swale, Michael followinghim with his rifle but forbearing to shoot. A whistle ran along theinvisible line from left to right, and a flight of arrows archedthrough the air."Get ready," Van Brunt commanded, a new metallic note in his voice."Now!"They broke cover simultaneously. The forest heaved into sudden life.A great yell went up, and the rifles barked back sharp defiance.Tribesmen knew their deaths in mid-leap, and as they fell, theirbrothers surged over them in a roaring, irresistible wave. In theforefront of the rush, hair flying and arms swinging free, flashingpast the tree-trunks, and leaping the obstructing logs, came Thom.Fairfax sighted on her and almost pulled trigger ere he knew her."The woman! Don't shoot!" he cried. "See! She is unarmed!"The Crees never heard, nor Michael and his brother _voyageur_, nor VanBrunt, who was keeping one shell continuously in the air. But Thombore straight on, unharmed, at the heels of a skin-clad hunter who hadveered in before her from the side. Fairfax emptied his magazine intothe men to right and left of her, and swung his rifle to meet the bighunter. But the man, seeming to recognize him, swerved suddenly asideand plunged his spear into the body of Michael. On the moment Thom hadone arm passed around her husband's neck, and twisting half about,with voice and gesture was splitting the mass of charging warriors.A score of men hurled past on either side, and Fairfax, for a briefinstant's space, stood looking upon her and her bronze beauty,thrilling, exulting, stirred to unknown deeps, visioning strangethings, dreaming, immortally dreaming. Snatches and scraps ofold-world philosophies and new-world ethics floated through his mind,and things wonderfully concrete and woefully incongruous--huntingscenes, stretches of sombre forest, vastnesses of silent snow, theglittering of ballroom lights, great galleries and lecture halls, afleeting shimmer of glistening test-tubes, long rows of book-linedshelves, the throb of machinery and the roar of traffic, a fragmentof forgotten song, faces of dear women and old chums, a lonelywatercourse amid upstanding peaks, a shattered boat on a pebblystrand, quiet moonlit fields, fat vales, the smell of hay....A hunter, struck between the eyes with a rifle-ball, pitched forwardlifeless, and with the momentum of his charge slid along the ground.Fairfax came back to himself. His comrades, those that lived, had beenswept far back among the trees beyond. He could hear the fierce "Hia!Hia!" of the hunters as they closed in and cut and thrust with theirweapons of bone and ivory. The cries of the stricken men smote himlike blows. He knew the fight was over, the cause was lost, but allhis race traditions and race loyalty impelled him into the welter thathe might die at least with his kind."My man! My man!" Thom cried. "Thou art safe!"He tried to struggle on, but her dead weight clogged his steps."There is no need! They are dead, and life be good!"She held him close around the neck and twined her limbs about his tillhe tripped and stumbled, reeled violently to recover footing, trippedagain, and fell backward to the ground. His head struck a juttingroot, and he was half-stunned and could struggle but feebly. In thefall she had heard the feathered swish of an arrow darting past, andshe covered his body with hers, as with a shield, her arms holding himtightly, her face and lips pressed upon his neck.Then it was that Keen rose up from a tangled thicket a score of feetaway. He looked about him with care. The fight had swept on and thecry of the last man was dying away. There was no one to see. He fittedan arrow to the string and glanced at the man and woman. Between herbreast and arm the flesh of the man's side showed white. Keen bent thebow and drew back the arrow to its head. Twice he did so, calmly andfor certainty, and then drove the bone-barbed missile straight hometo the white flesh, gleaming yet more white in the dark-armed,dark-breasted embrace.THE LAW OF LIFEOld Koskoosh listened greedily. Though his sight had long since faded,his hearing was still acute, and the slightest sound penetrated to theglimmering intelligence which yet abode behind the withered forehead,but which no longer gazed forth upon the things of the world. Ah! thatwas Sit-cum-to-ha, shrilly anathematizing the dogs as she cuffedand beat them into the harnesses. Sit-cum-to-ha was his daughter'sdaughter, but she was too busy to waste a thought upon her brokengrandfather, sitting alone there in the snow, forlorn and helpless.Camp must be broken. The long trail waited while the short day refusedto linger. Life called her, and the duties of life, not death. And hewas very close to death now.The thought made the old man panicky for the moment, and he stretchedforth a palsied hand which wandered tremblingly over the small heapof dry wood beside him. Reassured that it was indeed there, his handreturned to the shelter of his mangy furs, and he again fell tolistening. The sulky crackling of half-frozen hides told him that thechief's moose-skin lodge had been struck, and even then was beingrammed and jammed into portable compass. The chief was his son,stalwart and strong, head man of the tribesmen, and a mighty hunter.As the women toiled with the camp luggage, his voice rose, chidingthem for their slowness. Old Koskoosh strained his ears. It was thelast time he would hear that voice. There went Geehow's lodge! AndTusken's! Seven, eight, nine; only the shaman's could be stillstanding. There! They were at work upon it now. He could hear theshaman grunt as he piled it on the sled. A child whimpered, and awoman soothed it with soft, crooning gutturals. Little Koo-tee, theold man thought, a fretful child, and not overstrong. It would diesoon, perhaps, and they would burn a hole through the frozen tundraand pile rocks above to keep the wolverines away. Well, what did itmatter? A few years at best, and as many an empty belly as a full one.And in the end, Death waited, ever-hungry and hungriest of them all.What was that? Oh, the men lashing the sleds and drawing tight thethongs. He listened, who would listen no more. The whip-lashes snarledand bit among the dogs. Hear them whine! How they hated the work andthe trail! They were off! Sled after sled churned slowly away into thesilence. They were gone. They had passed out of his life, and he facedthe last bitter hour alone. No. The snow crunched beneath a moccasin;a man stood beside him; upon his head a hand rested gently. His sonwas good to do this thing. He remembered other old men whose sons hadnot waited after the tribe. But his son had. He wandered away into thepast, till the young man's voice brought him back."Is it well with you?" he asked.And the old man answered, "It is well.""There be wood beside you," the younger man continued, "and the fireburns bright. The morning is gray, and the cold has broken. It willsnow presently. Even now is it snowing.""Ay, even now is it snowing.""The tribesmen hurry. Their bales are heavy, and their bellies flatwith lack of feasting. The trail is long and they travel fast. I gonow. It is well?""It is well. I am as a last year's leaf, clinging lightly to the stem.The first breath that blows, and I fall. My voice is become like anold woman's. My eyes no longer show me the way of my feet, and my feetare heavy, and I am tired. It is well."He bowed his head in content till the last noise of the complainingsnow had died away, and he knew his son was beyond recall. Then hishand crept out in haste to the wood. It alone stood between him andthe eternity that yawned in upon him. At last the measure of his lifewas a handful of fagots. One by one they would go to feed the fire,and just so, step by step, death would creep upon him. When the laststick had surrendered up its heat, the frost would begin to gatherstrength. First his feet would yield, then his hands; and the numbnesswould travel, slowly, from the extremities to the body. His head wouldfall forward upon his knees, and he would rest. It was easy. All menmust die.He did not complain. It was the way of life, and it was just. He hadbeen born close to the earth, close to the earth had he lived, and thelaw thereof was not new to him. It was the law of all flesh. Naturewas not kindly to the flesh. She had no concern for that concretething called the individual. Her interest lay in the species, therace. This was the deepest abstraction old Koskoosh's barbaric mindwas capable of, but he grasped it firmly. He saw it exemplified in alllife. The rise of the sap, the bursting greenness of the willow bud,the fall of the yellow leaf--in this alone was told the whole history.But one task did Nature set the individual. Did he not perform it, hedied. Did he perform it, it was all the same, he died. Nature didnot care; there were plenty who were obedient, and it was only theobedience in this matter, not the obedient, which lived and livedalways. The tribe of Koskoosh was very old. The old men he had knownwhen a boy, had known old men before them. Therefore it was true thatthe tribe lived, that it stood for the obedience of all its members,way down into the forgotten past, whose very resting-places wereunremembered. They did not count; they were episodes. They had passedaway like clouds from a summer sky. He also was an episode, and wouldpass away. Nature did not care. To life she set one task, gave onelaw. To perpetuate was the task of life, its law was death. A maidenwas a good creature to look upon, full-breasted and strong, withspring to her step and light in her eyes. But her task was yet beforeher. The light in her eyes brightened, her step quickened, she wasnow bold with the young men, now timid, and she gave them of her ownunrest. And ever she grew fairer and yet fairer to look upon, tillsome hunter, able no longer to withhold himself, took her to his lodgeto cook and toil for him and to become the mother of his children. Andwith the coming of her offspring her looks left her. Her limbs draggedand shuffled, her eyes dimmed and bleared, and only the littlechildren found joy against the withered cheek of the old squaw by thefire. Her task was done. But a little while, on the first pinch offamine or the first long trail, and she would be left, even as he hadbeen left, in the snow, with a little pile of wood. Such was the law.He placed a stick carefully upon the fire and resumed his meditations.It was the same everywhere, with all things. The mosquitoes vanishedwith the first frost. The little tree-squirrel crawled away to die.When age settled upon the rabbit it became slow and heavy, and couldno longer outfoot its enemies. Even the big bald-face grew clumsy andblind and quarrelsome, in the end to be dragged down by a handful ofyelping huskies. He remembered how he had abandoned his own fatheron an upper reach of the Klondike one winter, the winter before themissionary came with his talk-books and his box of medicines. Many atime had Koskoosh smacked his lips over the recollection of that box,though now his mouth refused to moisten. The "painkiller" had beenespecially good. But the missionary was a bother after all, for hebrought no meat into the camp, and he ate heartily, and the huntersgrumbled. But he chilled his lungs on the divide by the Mayo, and thedogs afterwards nosed the stones away and fought over his bones.Koskoosh placed another stick on the fire and harked back deeper intothe past. There was the time of the Great Famine, when the old mencrouched empty-bellied to the fire, and let fall from their lips dimtraditions of the ancient day when the Yukon ran wide open for threewinters, and then lay frozen for three summers. He had lost his motherin that famine. In the summer the salmon run had failed, and the tribelooked forward to the winter and the coming of the caribou. Then thewinter came, but with it there were no caribou. Never had the likebeen known, not even in the lives of the old men. But the cariboudid not come, and it was the seventh year, and the rabbits had notreplenished, and the dogs were naught but bundles of bones. Andthrough the long darkness the children wailed and died, and the women,and the old men; and not one in ten of the tribe lived to meet the sunwhen it came back in the spring. That _was_ a famine!But he had seen times of plenty, too, when the meat spoiled on theirhands, and the dogs were fat and worthless with overeating--times whenthey let the game go unkilled, and the women were fertile, and thelodges were cluttered with sprawling men-children and women-children.Then it was the men became high-stomached, and revived ancientquarrels, and crossed the divides to the south to kill the Pellys, andto the west that they might sit by the dead fires of the Tananas. Heremembered, when a boy, during a time of plenty, when he saw a moosepulled down by the wolves. Zing-ha lay with him in the snow andwatched--Zing-ha, who later became the craftiest of hunters, and who,in the end, fell through an air-hole on the Yukon. They found him, amonth afterward, just as he had crawled halfway out and frozen stiffto the ice.But the moose. Zing-ha and he had gone out that day to play at huntingafter the manner of their fathers. On the bed of the creek they struckthe fresh track of a moose, and with it the tracks of many wolves. "Anold one," Zing-ha, who was quicker at reading the sign, said--"an oldone who cannot keep up with the herd. The wolves have cut him out fromhis brothers, and they will never leave him." And it was so. It wastheir way. By day and by night, never resting, snarling on his heels,snapping at his nose, they would stay by him to the end. How Zing-haand he felt the blood-lust quicken! The finish would be a sight tosee!Eager-footed, they took the trail, and even he, Koskoosh, slow ofsight and an unversed tracker, could have followed it blind, it wasso wide. Hot were they on the heels of the chase, reading the grimtragedy, fresh-written, at every step. Now they came to where themoose had made a stand. Thrice the length of a grown man's body, inevery direction, had the snow been stamped about and uptossed. In themidst were the deep impressions of the splay-hoofed game, and allabout, everywhere, were the lighter footmarks of the wolves. Some,while their brothers harried the kill, had lain to one side andrested. The full-stretched impress of their bodies in the snow was asperfect as though made the moment before. One wolf had been caughtin a wild lunge of the maddened victim and trampled to death. A fewbones, well picked, bore witness.Again, they ceased the uplift of their snowshoes at a second stand.Here the great animal had fought desperately. Twice had he beendragged down, as the snow attested, and twice had he shaken hisassailants clear and gained footing once more. He had done his tasklong since, but none the less was life dear to him. Zing-ha said itwas a strange thing, a moose once down to get free again; but this onecertainly had. The shaman would see signs and wonders in this whenthey told him.And yet again, they come to where the moose had made to mount the bankand gain the timber. But his foes had laid on from behind, till hereared and fell back upon them, crushing two deep into the snow. Itwas plain the kill was at hand, for their brothers had left themuntouched. Two more stands were hurried past, brief in time-length andvery close together. The trail was red now, and the clean stride ofthe great beast had grown short and slovenly. Then they heard thefirst sounds of the battle--not the full-throated chorus of the chase,but the short, snappy bark which spoke of close quarters and teeth toflesh. Crawling up the wind, Zing-ha bellied it through the snow, andwith him crept he, Koskoosh, who was to be chief of the tribesmen inthe years to come. Together they shoved aside the under branches of ayoung spruce and peered forth. It was the end they saw.The picture, like all of youth's impressions, was still strong withhim, and his dim eyes watched the end played out as vividly as inthat far-off time. Koskoosh marvelled at this, for in the days whichfollowed, when he was a leader of men and a head of councillors, hehad done great deeds and made his name a curse in the mouths of thePellys, to say naught of the strange white man he had killed, knife toknife, in open fight.For long he pondered on the days of his youth, till the fire died downand the frost bit deeper. He replenished it with two sticks this time,and gauged his grip on life by what remained. If Sit-cum-to-ha hadonly remembered her grandfather, and gathered a larger armful, hishours would have been longer. It would have been easy. But she wasever a careless child, and honored not her ancestors from the time theBeaver, son of the son of Zing-ha, first cast eyes upon her. Well,what mattered it? Had he not done likewise in his own quick youth? Fora while he listened to the silence. Perhaps the heart of his son mightsoften, and he would come back with the dogs to take his old father onwith the tribe to where the caribou ran thick and the fat hung heavyupon them.He strained his ears, his restless brain for the moment stilled. Not astir, nothing. He alone took breath in the midst of the great silence.It was very lonely. Hark! What was that? A chill passed over his body.The familiar, long-drawn howl broke the void, and it was close athand. Then on his darkened eyes was projected the vision of themoose--the old bull moose--the torn flanks and bloody sides, theriddled mane, and the great branching horns, down low and tossing tothe last. He saw the flashing forms of gray, the gleaming eyes, thelolling tongues, the slavered fangs. And he saw the inexorable circleclose in till it became a dark point in the midst of the stamped snow.A cold muzzle thrust against his cheek, and at its touch his soulleaped back to the present. His hand shot into the fire and draggedout a burning faggot. Overcome for the nonce by his hereditary fear ofman, the brute retreated, raising a prolonged call to his brothers;and greedily they answered, till a ring of crouching, jaw-slobberedgray was stretched round about. The old man listened to the drawingin of this circle. He waved his brand wildly, and sniffs turned tosnarls; but the panting brutes refused to scatter. Now one wormed hischest forward, dragging his haunches after, now a second, now a third;but never a one drew back. Why should he cling to life? he asked, anddropped the blazing stick into the snow. It sizzled and went out. Thecircle grunted uneasily, but held its own. Again he saw the last standof the old bull moose, and Koskoosh dropped his head wearily upon hisknees. What did it matter after all? Was it not the law of life?NAM-BOK THE UNVERACIOUS"A bidarka, is it not so? Look! a bidarka, and one man who drivesclumsily with a paddle!"Old Bask-Wah-Wan rose to her knees, trembling with weakness andeagerness, and gazed out over the sea."Nam-Bok was ever clumsy at the paddle," she maundered reminiscently,shading the sun from her eyes and staring across the silver-spilledwater. "Nam-Bok was ever clumsy. I remember...."But the women and children laughed loudly, and there was a gentlemockery in their laughter, and her voice dwindled till her lips movedwithout sound.Koogah lifted his grizzled head from his bone-carving and followedthe path of her eyes. Except when wide yaws took it off its course, abidarka was heading in for the beach. Its occupant was paddling withmore strength than dexterity, and made his approach along the zigzagline of most resistance. Koogah's head dropped to his work again, andon the ivory tusk between his knees he scratched the dorsal fin of afish the like of which never swam in the sea."It is doubtless the man from the next village," he said finally,"come to consult with me about the marking of things on bone. And theman is a clumsy man. He will never know how.""It is Nam-Bok," old Bask-Wah-Wan repeated. "Should I not know myson?" she demanded shrilly. "I say, and I say again, it is Nam-Bok.""And so thou hast said these many summers," one of the women chidedsoftly. "Ever when the ice passed out of the sea hast thou sat andwatched through the long day, saying at each chance canoe, 'This isNam-Bok.' Nam-Bok is dead, O Bask-Wah-Wan, and the dead do not comeback. It cannot be that the dead come back.""Nam-Bok!" the old woman cried, so loud and clear that the wholevillage was startled and looked at her.She struggled to her feet and tottered down the sand. She stumbledover a baby lying in the sun, and the mother hushed its crying andhurled harsh words after the old woman, who took no notice. Thechildren ran down the beach in advance of her, and as the man in thebidarka drew closer, nearly capsizing with one of his ill-directedstrokes, the women followed. Koogah dropped his walrus tusk and wentalso, leaning heavily upon his staff, and after him loitered the menin twos and threes.The bidarka turned broadside and the ripple of surf threatened toswamp it, only a naked boy ran into the water and pulled the bow highup on the sand. The man stood up and sent a questing glance along theline of villagers. A rainbow sweater, dirty and the worse for wear,clung loosely to his broad shoulders, and a red cotton handkerchiefwas knotted in sailor fashion about his throat. A fisherman'stam-o'-shanter on his close-clipped head, and dungaree trousers andheavy brogans, completed his outfit.But he was none the less a striking personage to these simplefisherfolk of the great Yukon Delta, who, all their lives, had staredout on Bering Sea and in that time seen but two white men,--the censusenumerator and a lost Jesuit priest. They were a poor people, withneither gold in the ground nor valuable furs in hand, so the whiteshad passed them afar. Also, the Yukon, through the thousands of years,had shoaled that portion of the sea with the detritus of Alaska tillvessels grounded out of sight of land. So the sodden coast, with itslong inside reaches and huge mud-land archipelagoes, was avoided bythe ships of men, and the fisherfolk knew not that such things were.Koogah, the Bone-Scratcher, retreated backward in sudden haste,tripping over his staff and falling to the ground. "Nam-Bok!" hecried, as he scrambled wildly for footing. "Nam-Bok, who was blown offto sea, come back!"The men and women shrank away, and the children scuttled off betweentheir legs. Only Opee-Kwan was brave, as befitted the head man ofthe village. He strode forward and gazed long and earnestly at thenew-comer."It _is_ Nam-Bok," he said at last, and at the conviction in his voicethe women wailed apprehensively and drew farther away.The lips of the stranger moved indecisively, and his brown throatwrithed and wrestled with unspoken words."La la, it is Nam-Bok," Bask-Wah-Wan croaked, peering up into hisface. "Ever did I say Nam-Bok would come back.""Ay, it is Nam-Bok come back." This time it was Nam-Bok himself whospoke, putting a leg over the side of the bidarka and standing withone foot afloat and one ashore. Again his throat writhed and wrestledas he grappled after forgotten words. And when the words came forththey were strange of sound and a spluttering of the lips accompaniedthe gutturals. "Greeting, O brothers," he said, "brothers of old timebefore I went away with the off-shore wind."He stepped out with both feet on the sand, and Opee-Kwan waved himback."Thou art dead, Nam-Bok," he said.Nam-Bok laughed. "I am fat.""Dead men are not fat," Opee-Kwan confessed. "Thou hast fared well,but it is strange. No man may mate with the off-shore wind and comeback on the heels of the years.""I have come back," Nam-Bok answered simply."Mayhap thou art a shadow, then, a passing shadow of the Nam-Bok thatwas. Shadows come back.""I am hungry. Shadows do not eat."But Opee-Kwan doubted, and brushed his hand across his brow in sorepuzzlement. Nam-Bok was likewise puzzled, and as he looked up and downthe line found no welcome in the eyes of the fisherfolk. The men andwomen whispered together. The children stole timidly back among theirelders, and bristling dogs fawned up to him and sniffed suspiciously."I bore thee, Nam-Bok, and I gave thee suck when thou wast little,"Bask-Wah-Wan whimpered, drawing closer; "and shadow though thou be, orno shadow, I will give thee to eat now."Nam-Bok made to come to her, but a growl of fear and menace warnedhim back. He said something in a strange tongue which sounded like"Goddam," and added, "No shadow am I, but a man.""Who may know concerning the things of mystery?" Opee-Kwan demanded,half of himself and half of his tribespeople. "We are, and in a breathwe are not. If the man may become shadow, may not the shadow becomeman? Nam-Bok was, but is not. This we know, but we do not know if thisbe Nam-Bok or the shadow of Nam-Bok."Nam-Bok cleared his throat and made answer. "In the old time long ago,thy father's father, Opee-Kwan, went away and came back on the heelsof the years. Nor was a place by the fire denied him. It is said ..."He paused significantly, and they hung on his utterance. "It is said,"he repeated, driving his point home with deliberation, "that Sipsip,his _klooch_, bore him two sons after he came back.""But he had no doings with the off-shore wind," Opee-Kwan retorted."He went away into the heart of the land, and it is in the nature ofthings that a man may go on and on into the land.""And likewise the sea. But that is neither here nor there. It is said... that thy father's father told strange tales of the things he saw.""Ay, strange tales he told.""I, too, have strange tales to tell," Nam-Bok stated insidiously. And,as they wavered, "And presents likewise."He pulled from the bidarka a shawl, marvellous of texture and color,and flung it about his mother's shoulders. The women voiced acollective sigh of admiration, and old Bask-Wah-Wan ruffled the gaymaterial and patted it and crooned in childish joy."He has tales to tell," Koogah muttered. "And presents," a womanseconded.And Opee-Kwan knew that his people were eager, and further, he wasaware himself of an itching curiosity concerning those untold tales."The fishing has been good," he said judiciously, "and we have oil inplenty. So come, Nam-Bok, let us feast."Two of the men hoisted the bidarka on their shoulders and carriedit up to the fire. Nam-Bok walked by the side of Opee-Kwan, and thevillagers followed after, save those of the women who lingered amoment to lay caressing fingers on the shawl.There was little talk while the feast went on, though many and curiouswere the glances stolen at the son of Bask-Wah-Wan. This embarrassedhim--not because he was modest of spirit, however, but for the factthat the stench of the seal-oil had robbed him of his appetite, andthat he keenly desired to conceal his feelings on the subject."Eat; thou art hungry," Opee-Kwan commanded, and Nam-Bok shut both hiseyes and shoved his fist into the big pot of putrid fish."La la, be not ashamed. The seal were many this year, and strong menare ever hungry." And Bask-Wah-Wan sopped a particularly offensivechunk of salmon into the oil and passed it fondly and dripping to herson.In despair, when premonitory symptoms warned him that his stomach wasnot so strong as of old, he filled his pipe and struck up a smoke. Thepeople fed on noisily and watched. Few of them could boast of intimateacquaintance with the precious weed, though now and again smallquantities and abominable qualities were obtained in trade from theEskimos to the northward. Koogah, sitting next to him, indicated thathe was not averse to taking a draw, and between two mouthfuls,with the oil thick on his lips, sucked away at the amber stem. Andthereupon Nam-Bok held his stomach with a shaky hand and declined theproffered return. Koogah could keep the pipe, he said, for he hadintended so to honor him from the first. And the people licked theirfingers and approved of his liberality.Opee-Kwan rose to his feet "And now, O Nam-Bok, the feast is ended,and we would listen concerning the strange things you have seen."The fisherfolk applauded with their hands, and gathering about themtheir work, prepared to listen. The men were busy fashioning spearsand carving on ivory, while the women scraped the fat from the hidesof the hair seal and made them pliable or sewed muclucs with threadsof sinew. Nam-Bok's eyes roved over the scene, but there was not thecharm about it that his recollection had warranted him to expect.During the years of his wandering he had looked forward to just thisscene, and now that it had come he was disappointed. It was a bare andmeagre life, he deemed, and not to be compared to the one to which hehad become used. Still, he would open their eyes a bit, and his owneyes sparkled at the thought."Brothers," he began, with the smug complacency of a man about torelate the big things he has done, "it was late summer of many summersback, with much such weather as this promises to be, when I went away.You all remember the day, when the gulls flew low, and the wind blewstrong from the land, and I could not hold my bidarka against it. Itied the covering of the bidarka about me so that no water could getin, and all of the night I fought with the storm. And in the morningthere was no land,--only the sea,--and the off-shore wind held meclose in its arms and bore me along. Three such nights whitened intodawn and showed me no land, and the off-shore wind would not let mego."And when the fourth day came, I was as a madman. I could not dip mypaddle for want of food; and my head went round and round, what of thethirst that was upon me. But the sea was no longer angry, and the softsouth wind was blowing, and as I looked about me I saw a sight thatmade me think I was indeed mad."Nam-Bok paused to pick away a sliver of salmon lodged between histeeth, and the men and women, with idle hands and heads cranedforward, waited."It was a canoe, a big canoe. If all the canoes I have ever seen weremade into one canoe, it would not be so large."There were exclamations of doubt, and Koogah, whose years were many,shook his head."If each bidarka were as a grain of sand," Nam-Bok defiantlycontinued, "and if there were as many bidarkas as there be grains ofsand in this beach, still would they not make so big a canoe as this Isaw on the morning of the fourth day. It was a very big canoe, andit was called a _schooner_. I saw this thing of wonder, this greatschooner, coming after me, and on it I saw men--""Hold, O Nam-Bok!" Opee-Kwan broke in. "What manner of men werethey?--big men?""Nay, mere men like you and me.""Did the big canoe come fast?""Ay.""The sides were tall, the men short." Opee-Kwan stated the premiseswith conviction. "And did these men dip with long paddles?"Nam-Bok grinned. "There were no paddles," he said.Mouths remained open, and a long silence dropped down. Opee-Kwanborrowed Koogah's pipe for a couple of contemplative sucks. One of theyounger women giggled nervously and drew upon herself angry eyes."There were no paddles?" Opee-Kwan asked softly, returning the pipe."The south wind was behind," Nam-Bok explained."But the wind-drift is slow.""The schooner had wings--thus." He sketched a diagram of masts andsails in the sand, and the men crowded around and studied it. The windwas blowing briskly, and for more graphic elucidation he seized thecorners of his mother's shawl and spread them out till it bellied likea sail. Bask-Wah-Wan scolded and struggled, but was blown down thebeach for a score of feet and left breathless and stranded in a heapof driftwood. The men uttered sage grunts of comprehension, but Koogahsuddenly tossed back his hoary head."Ho! Ho!" he laughed. "A foolish thing, this big canoe! A most foolishthing! The plaything of the wind! Wheresoever the wind goes, it goestoo. No man who journeys therein may name the landing beach, foralways he goes with the wind, and the wind goes everywhere, but no manknows where.""It is so," Opee-Kwan supplemented gravely. "With the wind the goingis easy, but against the wind a man striveth hard; and for that theyhad no paddles these men on the big canoe did not strive at all.""Small need to strive," Nam-Bok cried angrily. "The schooner wentlikewise against the wind.""And what said you made the sch--sch--schooner go?" Koogah asked,tripping craftily over the strange word."The wind," was the impatient response."Then the wind made the sch--sch--schooner go against the wind." OldKoogah dropped an open leer to Opee-Kwan, and, the laughter growingaround him, continued: "The wind blows from the south and blows theschooner south. The wind blows against the wind. The wind blows oneway and the other at the same time. It is very simple. We understand,Nam-Bok. We clearly understand.""Thou art a fool!""Truth falls from thy lips," Koogah answered meekly. "I was over-longin understanding, and the thing was simple."But Nam-Bok's face was dark, and he said rapid words which they hadnever heard before. Bone-scratching and skin-scraping were resumed,but he shut his lips tightly on the tongue that could not be believed."This sch--sch--schooner," Koogah imperturbably asked; "it was made ofa big tree?""It was made of many trees," Nam-Bok snapped shortly. "It was verybig."He lapsed into sullen silence again, and Opee-Kwan nudged Koogah, whoshook his head with slow amazement and murmured, "It is very strange."Nam-bok took the bait. "That is nothing," he said airily; "you shouldsee the _steamer_. As the grain of sand is to the bidarka, as thebidarka is to the schooner, so the schooner is to the steamer.Further, the steamer is made of iron. It is all iron.""Nay, nay, Nam-Bok," cried the head man; "how can that be? Always irongoes to the bottom. For behold, I received an iron knife in trade fromthe head man of the next village, and yesterday the iron knife slippedfrom my fingers and went down, down, into the sea. To all things therebe law. Never was there one thing outside the law. This we know. And,moreover, we know that things of a kind have the one law, and that alliron has the one law. So unsay thy words, Nam-Bok, that we may yethonor thee.""It is so," Nam-Bok persisted. "The steamer is all iron and does notsink.""Nay, nay; this cannot be.""With my own eyes I saw it.""It is not in the nature of things.""But tell me, Nam-Bok," Koogah interrupted, for fear the tale wouldgo no farther, "tell me the manner of these men in finding their wayacross the sea when there is no land by which to steer.""The sun points out the path.""But how?""At midday the head man of the schooner takes a thing through whichhis eye looks at the sun, and then he makes the sun climb down out ofthe sky to the edge of the earth.""Now this be evil medicine!" cried Opee-Kwan, aghast at the sacrilege.The men held up their hands in horror, and the women moaned. "This beevil medicine. It is not good to misdirect the great sun which drivesaway the night and gives us the seal, the salmon, and warm weather.""What if it be evil medicine?" Nam-Bok demanded truculently. "I, too,have looked through the thing at the sun and made the sun climb downout of the sky."Those who were nearest drew away from him hurriedly, and a womancovered the face of a child at her breast so that his eye might notfall upon it."But on the morning of the fourth day, O Nam-Bok," Koogah suggested;"on the morning of the fourth day when the sch--sch--schooner cameafter thee?""I had little strength left in me and could not run away. So I wastaken on board and water was poured down my throat and good food givenme. Twice, my brothers, you have seen a white man. These men were allwhite and as many as have I fingers and toes. And when I saw they werefull of kindness, I took heart, and I resolved to bring away with mereport of all that I saw. And they taught me the work they did, andgave me good food and a place to sleep."And day after day we went over the sea, and each day the head mandrew the sun down out of the sky and made it tell where we were. Andwhen the waves were kind, we hunted the fur seal and I marvelled much,for always did they fling the meat and the fat away and save only theskin."Opee-Kwan's mouth was twitching violently, and he was about to makedenunciation of such waste when Koogah kicked him to be still."After a weary time, when the sun was gone and the bite of the frostcome into the air, the head man pointed the nose of the schoonersouth. South and east we travelled for days upon days, with never theland in sight, and we were near to the village from which hailed themen--""How did they know they were near?" Opee-Kwan, unable to containhimself longer, demanded. "There was no land to see."Nam-Bok glowered on him wrathfully. "Did I not say the head manbrought the sun down out of the sky?"Koogah interposed, and Nam-Bok went on."As I say, when we were near to that village a great storm blew up,and in the night we were helpless and knew not where we were--""Thou hast just said the head man knew--""Oh, peace, Opee-Kwan! Thou art a fool and cannot understand. As Isay, we were helpless in the night, when I heard, above the roar ofthe storm, the sound of the sea on the beach. And next we struck witha mighty crash and I was in the water, swimming. It was a rock-boundcoast, with one patch of beach in many miles, and the law was that Ishould dig my hands into the sand and draw myself clear of the surf.The other men must have pounded against the rocks, for none of themcame ashore but the head man, and him I knew only by the ring on hisfinger."When day came, there being nothing of the schooner, I turned my faceto the land and journeyed into it that I might get food and look uponthe faces of the people. And when I came to a house I was taken in andgiven to eat, for I had learned their speech, and the white men areever kindly. And it was a house bigger than all the houses built by usand our fathers before us.""It was a mighty house," Koogah said, masking his unbelief withwonder."And many trees went into the making of such a house," Opee-Kwanadded, taking the cue."That is nothing." Nam-Bok shrugged his shoulders in belittlingfashion. "As our houses are to that house, so that house was to thehouses I was yet to see.""And they are not big men?""Nay; mere men like you and me," Nam-Bok answered. "I had cut a stickthat I might walk in comfort, and remembering that I was to bringreport to you, my brothers, I cut a notch in the stick for each personwho lived in that house. And I stayed there many days, and worked, forwhich they gave me _money_--a thing of which you know nothing, butwhich is very good."And one day I departed from that place to go farther into the land.And as I walked I met many people, and I cut smaller notches in thestick, that there might be room for all. Then I came upon a strangething. On the ground before me was a bar of iron, as big in thicknessas my arm, and a long step away was another bar of iron--""Then wert thou a rich man," Opee-Kwan asserted; "for iron be worthmore than anything else in the world. It would have made many knives.""Nay, it was not mine.""It was a find, and a find be lawful.""Not so; the white men had placed it there And further, these barswere so long that no man could carry them away--so long that as far asI could see there was no end to them.""Nam-Bok, that is very much iron," Opee-Kwan cautioned."Ay, it was hard to believe with my own eyes upon it; but I could notgainsay my eyes. And as I looked I heard...." He turned abruptly uponthe head man. "Opee-Kwan, thou hast heard the sea-lion bellow in hisanger. Make it plain in thy mind of as many sea-lions as there bewaves to the sea, and make it plain that all these sea-lions be madeinto one sea-lion, and as that one sea-lion would bellow so bellowedthe thing I heard."The fisherfolk cried aloud in astonishment, and Opee-Kwan's jawlowered and remained lowered."And in the distance I saw a monster like unto a thousand whales.It was one-eyed, and vomited smoke, and it snorted with exceedingloudness. I was afraid and ran with shaking legs along the pathbetween the bars. But it came with the speed of the wind, thismonster, and I leaped the iron bars with its breath hot on myface...."Opee-Kwan gained control of his jaw again. "And--and then, O Nam-Bok?""Then it came by on the bars, and harmed me not; and when my legscould hold me up again it was gone from sight. And it is a very commonthing in that country. Even the women and children are not afraid. Menmake them to do work, these monsters.""As we make our dogs do work?" Koogah asked, with sceptic twinkle inhis eye."Ay, as we make our dogs do work.""And how do they breed these--these things?" Opee-Kwan questioned."They breed not at all. Men fashion them cunningly of iron, and feedthem with stone, and give them water to drink. The stone becomes fire,and the water becomes steam, and the steam of the water is the breathof their nostrils, and--""There, there, O Nam-Bok," Opee-Kwan interrupted. "Tell us of otherwonders. We grow tired of this which we may not understand.""You do not understand?" Nam-Bok asked despairingly."Nay, we do not understand," the men and women wailed back. "We cannotunderstand."Nam-Bok thought of a combined harvester, and of the machines whereinvisions of living men were to be seen, and of the machines from whichcame the voices of men, and he knew his people could never understand."Dare I say I rode this iron monster through the land?" he askedbitterly.Opee-Kwan threw up his hands, palms outward, in open incredulity. "Sayon; say anything. We listen.""Then did I ride the iron monster, for which I gave money--""Thou saidst it was fed with stone.""And likewise, thou fool, I said money was a thing of which you knownothing. As I say, I rode the monster through the land, and throughmany villages, until I came to a big village on a salt arm of the sea.And the houses shoved their roofs among the stars in the sky, and theclouds drifted by them, and everywhere was much smoke. And the roarof that village was like the roar of the sea in storm, and the peoplewere so many that I flung away my stick and no longer remembered thenotches upon it.""Hadst thou made small notches," Koogah reproved, "thou mightst havebrought report."Nam-Bok whirled upon him in anger. "Had I made small notches! Listen,Koogah, thou scratcher of bone! If I had made small notches, neitherthe stick, nor twenty sticks, could have borne them--nay, not all thedriftwood of all the beaches between this village and the next. And ifall of you, the women and children as well, were twenty times as many,and if you had twenty hands each, and in each hand a stick and aknife, still the notches could not be cut for the people I saw, somany were they and so fast did they come and go.""There cannot be so many people in all the world," Opee-Kwan objected,for he was stunned and his mind could not grasp such magnitude ofnumbers."What dost thou know of all the world and how large it is?" Nam-Bokdemanded."But there cannot be so many people in one place.""Who art thou to say what can be and what cannot be?""It stands to reason there cannot be so many people in one place.Their canoes would clutter the sea till there was no room. And theycould empty the sea each day of its fish, and they would not all befed.""So it would seem," Nam-Bok made final answer; "yet it was so. With myown eyes I saw, and flung my stick away." He yawned heavily and roseto his feet. "I have paddled far. The day has been long, and I amtired. Now I will sleep, and to-morrow we will have further talk uponthe things I have seen."Bask-Wah-Wan, hobbling fearfully in advance, proud indeed, yet awed byher wonderful son, led him to her igloo and stowed him away among thegreasy, ill-smelling furs. But the men lingered by the fire, and acouncil was held wherein was there much whispering and low-voiceddiscussion.An hour passed, and a second, and Nam-Bok slept, and the talk went on.The evening sun dipped toward the northwest, and at eleven atnight was nearly due north. Then it was that the head man and thebone-scratcher separated themselves from the council and arousedNam-Bok. He blinked up into their faces and turned on his side tosleep again. Opee-Kwan gripped him by the arm and kindly but firmlyshook his senses back into him."Come, Nam-Bok, arise!" he commanded. "It be time.""Another feast?" Nam-Bok cried. "Nay, I am not hungry. Go on with theeating and let me sleep.""Time to be gone!" Koogah thundered.But Opee-Kwan spoke more softly. "Thou wast bidarka-mate with me whenwe were boys," he said. "Together we first chased the seal and drewthe salmon from the traps. And thou didst drag me back to life,Nam-Bok, when the sea closed over me and I was sucked down to theblack rocks. Together we hungered and bore the chill of the frost, andtogether we crawled beneath the one fur and lay close to each other.And because of these things, and the kindness in which I stood tothee, it grieves me sore that thou shouldst return such a remarkableliar. We cannot understand, and our heads be dizzy with the thingsthou hast spoken. It is not good, and there has been much talk in thecouncil. Wherefore we send thee away, that our heads may remain clearand strong and be not troubled by the unaccountable things.""These things thou speakest of be shadows," Koogah took up the strain."From the shadow-world thou hast brought them, and to the shadow-worldthou must return them. Thy bidarka be ready, and the tribespeoplewait. They may not sleep until thou art gone."Nam-Bok was perplexed, but hearkened to the voice of the head man."If thou art Nam-Bok," Opee-Kwan was saying, "thou art a fearful andmost wonderful liar; if thou art the shadow of Nam-Bok, then thouspeakest of shadows, concerning which it is not good that living menhave knowledge. This great village thou hast spoken of we deem thevillage of shadows. Therein flutter the souls of the dead; for thedead be many and the living few. The dead do not come back. Never havethe dead come back--save thou with thy wonder-tales. It is not meetthat the dead come back, and should we permit it, great trouble may beour portion."Nam-Bok knew his people well and was aware that the voice of thecouncil was supreme. So he allowed himself to be led down to thewater's edge, where he was put aboard his bidarka and a paddle thrustinto his hand. A stray wild-fowl honked somewhere to seaward, and thesurf broke limply and hollowly on the sand. A dim twilight broodedover land and water, and in the north the sun smouldered, vague andtroubled, and draped about with blood-red mists. The gulls were flyinglow. The off-shore wind blew keen and chill, and the black-massedclouds behind it gave promise of bitter weather."Out of the sea thou earnest," Opee-Kwan chanted oracularly, "andback into the sea thou goest. Thus is balance achieved and all thingsbrought to law."Bask-Wah-Wan limped to the froth-mark and cried, "I bless thee,Nam-Bok, for that thou remembered me."But Koogah, shoving Nam-Bok clear of the beach, tore the shawl fromher shoulders and flung it into the bidarka."It is cold in the long nights," she wailed; "and the frost is proneto nip old bones.""The thing is a shadow," the bone-scratcher answered, "and shadowscannot keep thee warm."Nam-Bok stood up that his voice might carry. "O Bask-Wah-Wan, motherthat bore me!" he called. "Listen to the words of Nam-Bok, thy son.There be room in his bidarka for two, and he would that thou camestwith him. For his journey is to where there are fish and oil inplenty. There the frost comes not, and life is easy, and the things ofiron do the work of men. Wilt thou come, O Bask-Wah-Wan?"She debated a moment, while the bidarka drifted swiftly from her, thenraised her voice to a quavering treble. "I am old, Nam-Bok, and soon Ishall pass down among the shadows. But I have no wish to go before mytime. I am old, Nam-Bok, and I am afraid."A shaft of light shot across the dim-lit sea and wrapped boat and manin a splendor of red and gold. Then a hush fell upon the fisherfolk,and only was heard the moan of the off-shore wind and the cries of thegulls flying low in the air.THE MASTER OF MYSTERYThere was complaint in the village. The women chattered together withshrill, high-pitched voices. The men were glum and doubtful of aspect,and the very dogs wandered dubiously about, alarmed in vague ways bythe unrest of the camp, and ready to take to the woods on the firstoutbreak of trouble. The air was filled with suspicion. No man wassure of his neighbor, and each was conscious that he stood in likeunsureness with his fellows. Even the children were oppressed andsolemn, and little Di Ya, the cause of it all, had been soundlythrashed, first by Hooniah, his mother, and then by his father, Bawn,and was now whimpering and looking pessimistically out upon the worldfrom the shelter of the big overturned canoe on the beach.And to make the matter worse, Scundoo, the shaman, was in disgrace,and his known magic could not be called upon to seek out theevil-doer. Forsooth, a month gone, he had promised a fair south windso that the tribe might journey to the _potlatch_ at Tonkin, whereTaku Jim was giving away the savings of twenty years; and when the daycame, lo, a grievous north wind blew, and of the first three canoes toventure forth, one was swamped in the big seas, and two were poundedto pieces on the rocks, and a child was drowned. He had pulled thestring of the wrong bag, he explained,--a mistake. But the peoplerefused to listen; the offerings of meat and fish and fur ceased tocome to his door; and he sulked within--so they thought, fasting inbitter penance; in reality, eating generously from his well-storedcache and meditating upon the fickleness of the mob.The blankets of Hooniah were missing. They were good blankets, of mostmarvellous thickness and warmth, and her pride in them was greatenedin that they had been come by so cheaply. Ty-Kwan, of the next villagebut one, was a fool to have so easily parted with them. But then,she did not know they were the blankets of the murdered Englishman,because of whose take-off the United States cutter nosed along thecoast for a time, while its launches puffed and snorted among thesecret inlets. And not knowing that Ty-Kwan had disposed of them inhaste so that his own people might not have to render account to theGovernment, Hooniah's pride was unshaken. And because the women enviedher, her pride was without end and boundless, till it filled thevillage and spilled over along the Alaskan shore from Dutch Harbor toSt. Mary's. Her totem had become justly celebrated, and her nameknown on the lips of men wherever men fished and feasted, what of theblankets and their marvellous thickness and warmth. It was a mostmysterious happening, the manner of their going."I but stretched them up in the sun by the side-wall of the house,"Hooniah disclaimed for the thousandth time to her Thlinget sisters. "Ibut stretched them up and turned my back; for Di Ya, dough-thiefand eater of raw flour that he is, with head into the big iron pot,overturned and stuck there, his legs waving like the branches of aforest tree in the wind. And I did but drag him out and twice knockhis head against the door for riper understanding, and behold, theblankets were not!""The blankets were not!" the women repeated in awed whispers."A great loss," one added. A second, "Never were there such blankets."And a third, "We be sorry, Hooniah, for thy loss." Yet each womanof them was glad in her heart that the odious, dissension-breedingblankets were gone. "I but stretched them up in the sun," Hooniahbegan for the thousand and first time."Yea, yea," Bawn spoke up, wearied. "But there were no gossips in thevillage from other places. Wherefore it be plain that some of our owntribespeople have laid unlawful hand upon the blankets.""How can that be, O Bawn?" the women chorussed indignantly. "Whoshould there be?""Then has there been witchcraft," Bawn continued stolidly enough,though he stole a sly glance at their faces."_Witchcraft!_" And at the dread word their voices hushed and eachlooked fearfully at each."Ay," Hooniah affirmed, the latent malignancy of her nature flashinginto a moment's exultation. "And word has been sent to Klok-No-Ton,and strong paddles. Truly shall he be here with the afternoon tide."The little groups broke up, and fear descended upon the village. Ofall misfortune, witchcraft was the most appalling. With the intangibleand unseen things only the shamans could cope, and neither man, woman,nor child could know, until the moment of ordeal, whether devilspossessed their souls or not. And of all shamans, Klok-No-Ton, whodwelt in the next village, was the most terrible. None found moreevil spirits than he, none visited his victims with more frightfultortures. Even had he found, once, a devil residing within the body ofa three-months babe--a most obstinate devil which could only be drivenout when the babe had lain for a week on thorns and briers. The bodywas thrown into the sea after that, but the waves tossed it back againand again as a curse upon the village, nor did it finally go away tilltwo strong men were staked out at low tide and drowned.And Hooniah had sent for this Klok-No-Ton. Better had it been ifScundoo, their own shaman, were undisgraced. For he had ever a gentlerway, and he had been known to drive forth two devils from a manwho afterward begat seven healthy children. But Klok-No-Ton! Theyshuddered with dire foreboding at thought of him, and each one felthimself the centre of accusing eyes, and looked accusingly upon hisfellows--each one and all, save Sime, and Sime was a scoffer whoseevil end was destined with a certitude his successes could not shake."Hoh! Hoh!" he laughed. "Devils and Klok-No-Ton!--than whom no greaterdevil can be found in Thlinket Land.""Thou fool! Even now he cometh with witcheries and sorceries; sobeware thy tongue, lest evil befall thee and thy days be short in theland!"So spoke La-lah, otherwise the Cheater, and Sime laughed scornfully."I am Sime, unused to fear, unafraid of the dark. I am a strong man,as my father before me, and my head is clear. Nor you nor I have seenwith our eyes the unseen evil things--""But Scundoo hath," La-lah made answer. "And likewise Klok-No-Ton.This we know.""How dost thou know, son of a fool?" Sime thundered, the cholericblood darkening his thick bull neck."By the word of their mouths--even so."Sime snorted. "A shaman is only a man. May not his words be crooked,even as thine and mine? Bah! Bah! And once more, bah! And this for thyshamans and thy shamans' devils! and this! and this!"And snapping his fingers to right and left, Sime strode through theon-lookers, who made over-zealous and fearsome way for him."A good fisher and strong hunter, but an evil man," said one."Yet does he flourish," speculated another."Wherefore be thou evil and flourish," Sime retorted over hisshoulder. "And were all evil, there would be no need for shamans. Bah!You children-afraid-of-the-dark!"And when Klok-No-Ton arrived on the afternoon tide, Sime's defiantlaugh was unabated; nor did he forbear to make a joke when the shamantripped on the sand in the landing. Klok-No-Ton looked at him sourly,and without greeting stalked straight through their midst to the houseof Scundoo.Of the meeting with Scundoo none of the tribespeople might know, forthey clustered reverently in the distance and spoke in whispers whilethe masters of mystery were together."Greeting, O Scundoo!" Klok-No-Ton rumbled, wavering perceptibly fromdoubt of his reception.He was a giant in stature, and towered massively above little Scundoo,whose thin voice floated upward like the faint far rasping of acricket."Greeting, Klok-No-Ton," he returned. "The day is fair with thycoming.""Yet it would seem ..." Klok-No-Ton hesitated."Yea, yea," the little shaman put in impatiently, "that I have fallenon ill days, else would I not stand in gratitude to you in that you domy work.""It grieves me, friend Scundoo ...""Nay, I am made glad, Klok-No-Ton.""But will I give thee half of that which be given me.""Not so, good Klok-No-Ton," murmured Scundoo, with a deprecatory waveof the hand. "It is I who am thy slave, and my days shall be filledwith desire to befriend thee.""As I--""As thou now befriendest me.""That being so, it is then a bad business, these blankets of the womanHooniah?"The big shaman blundered tentatively in his quest, and Scundoo smileda wan, gray smile, for he was used to reading men, and all men seemedvery small to him."Ever hast thou dealt in strong medicine," he said. "Doubtless theevil-doer will be briefly known to thee.""Ay, briefly known when I set eyes upon him." Again Klok-No-Tonhesitated. "Have there been gossips from other places?" he asked.Scundoo shook his head. "Behold! Is this not a most excellent mucluc?"He held up the foot-covering of sealskin and walrus hide, and hisvisitor examined it with secret interest."It did come to me by a close-driven bargain."Klok-No-Ton nodded attentively."I got it from the man La-lah. He is a remarkable man, and often haveI thought ...""So?" Klok-No-Ton ventured impatiently."Often have I thought," Scundoo concluded, his voice falling as hecame to a full pause. "It is a fair day, and thy medicine be strong,Klok-No-Ton."Klok-No-Ton's face brightened. "Thou art a great man, Scundoo, ashaman of shamans. I go now. I shall remember thee always. And the manLa-lah, as you say, is a remarkable man."Scundoo smiled yet more wan and gray, closed the door on the heels ofhis departing visitor, and barred and double-barred it.Sime was mending his canoe when Klok-No-Ton came down the beach, andhe broke off from his work only long enough to ostentatiously load hisrifle and place it near him.The shaman noted the action and called out: "Let all the people cometogether on this spot! It is the word of Klok-No-Ton, devil-seeker anddriver of devils!"He had been minded to assemble them at Hooniah's house, but it wasnecessary that all should be present, and he was doubtful of Sime'sobedience and did not wish trouble. Sime was a good man to let alone,his judgment ran, and withal, a bad one for the health of any shaman."Let the woman Hooniah be brought," Klok-No-Ton commanded, glaringferociously about the circle and sending chills up and down the spinesof those he looked upon.Hooniah waddled forward, head bent and gaze averted."Where be thy blankets?""I but stretched them up in the sun, and behold, they were not!" shewhined."So?""It was because of Di Ya.""So?""Him have I beaten sore, and he shall yet be beaten, for that hebrought trouble upon us who be poor people.""The blankets!" Klok-No-Ton bellowed hoarsely, foreseeing her desireto lower the price to be paid. "The blankets, woman! Thy wealth isknown.""I but stretched them up in the sun," she sniffled, "and we be poorpeople and have nothing."He stiffened suddenly, with a hideous distortion of the face, andHooniah shrank back. But so swiftly did he spring forward, within-turned eyeballs and loosened jaw, that she stumbled and fell downgrovelling at his feet. He waved his arms about, wildly flagellatingthe air, his body writhing and twisting in torment. An epilepsy seemedto come upon him. A white froth flecked his lips, and his body wasconvulsed with shiverings and tremblings.The women broke into a wailing chant, swaying backward and forward inabandonment, while one by one the men succumbed to the excitement tillonly Sime remained. He, perched upon his canoe, looked on in mockery;yet the ancestors whose seed he bore pressed heavily upon him, andhe swore his strongest oaths that his courage might be cheered.Klok-No-Ton was horrible to behold. He had cast off his blanket andtorn his clothes from him, so that he was quite naked, save for agirdle of eagle-claws about his thighs. Shrieking and yelling, hislong black hair flying like a blot of night, he leaped franticallyabout the circle. A certain rude rhythm characterized his frenzy, andwhen all were under its sway, swinging their bodies in accord withhis and venting their cries in unison, he sat bolt upright, with armoutstretched and long, talon-like finger extended. A low moaning, asof the dead, greeted this, and the people cowered with shaking kneesas the dread finger passed them slowly by. For death went with it, andlife remained with those who watched it go; and being rejected, theywatched with eager intentness.Finally, with a tremendous cry, the fateful finger rested upon La-lah.He shook like an aspen, seeing himself already dead, his householdgoods divided, and his widow married to his brother. He strove tospeak, to deny, but his tongue clove to his mouth and his throat wassanded with an intolerable thirst. Klok-No-Ton seemed to half swoonaway, now that his work was done; but he waited, with closed eyes,listening for the great blood-cry to go up--the great blood-cry,familiar to his ear from a thousand conjurations, when thetribespeople flung themselves like wolves upon the trembling victim.But only was there silence, then a low tittering, from nowhere inparticular, which spread and spread until a vast laughter welled up tothe sky."Wherefore?" he cried."Na! Na!" the people laughed. "Thy medicine be ill, O Klok-No-Ton!""It be known to all," La-lah stuttered. "For eight weary months haveI been gone afar with the Siwash sealers, and but this day am I comeback to find the blankets of Hooniah gone ere I came!""It be true!" they cried with one accord. "The blankets of Hooniahwere gone ere he came!""And thou shalt be paid nothing for thy medicine which is of noavail," announced Hooniah, on her feet once more and smarting from asense of ridiculousness.But Klok-No-Ton saw only the face of Scundoo and its wan, gray smile,heard only the faint far cricket's rasping. "I got it from the manLa-lah, and often have I thought," and, "It is a fair day and thymedicine be strong."He brushed by Hooniah, and the circle instinctively gave way forhim to pass. Sime flung a jeer from the top of the canoe, the womensnickered in his face, cries of derision rose in his wake, but he tookno notice, pressing onward to the house of Scundoo. He hammered on thedoor, beat it with his fists, and howled vile imprecations. Yet therewas no response, save that in the lulls Scundoo's voice rose eerilyin incantation. Klok-No-Ton raged about like a madman, but when heattempted to break in the door with a huge stone, murmurs arose fromthe men and women. And he, Klok-No-Ton, knew that he stood shorn ofhis strength and authority before an alien people. He saw a man stoopfor a stone, and a second, and a bodily fear ran through him."Harm not Scundoo, who is a master!" a woman cried out."Better you return to your own village," a man advised menacingly.Klok-No-Ton turned on his heel and went down among them to the beach,a bitter rage at his heart, and in his head a just apprehension forhis defenceless back. But no stones were cast. The children swarmedmockingly about his feet, and the air was wild with laughter andderision, but that was all. Yet he did not breathe freely until thecanoe was well out upon the water, when he rose up and laid a futilecurse upon the village and its people, not forgetting to particularlyspecify Scundoo who had made a mock of him.Ashore there was a clamor for Scundoo, and the whole populationcrowded his door, entreating and imploring in confused babel till hecame forth and raised his hand."In that ye are my children I pardon freely," he said. "But neveragain. For the last time thy foolishness goes unpunished. That whichye wish shall be granted, and it be already known to me. This night,when the moon has gone behind the world to look upon the mightydead, let all the people gather in the blackness before the house ofHooniah. Then shall the evil-doer stand forth and take his meritedreward. I have spoken.""It shall be death!" Bawn vociferated, "for that it hath brought worryupon us, and shame.""So be it," Scundoo replied, and shut his door."Now shall all be made clear and plain, and content rest upon us onceagain," La-lah declaimed oracularly."Because of Scundoo, the little man," Sime sneered."Because of the medicine of Scundoo, the little man," La-lahcorrected."Children of foolishness, these Thlinket people!" Sime smote his thigha resounding blow. "It passeth understanding that grown women andstrong men should get down in the dirt to dream-things and wondertales.""I am a travelled man," La-lah answered. "I have journeyed on the deepseas and seen signs and wonders, and I know that these things be so.I am La-lah--""The Cheater--""So called, but the Far-Journeyer right-named.""I am not so great a traveller--" Sime began."Then hold thy tongue," Bawn cut in, and they separated in anger.When the last silver moonlight had vanished beyond the world, Scundoocame among the people huddled about the house of Hooniah. He walkedwith a quick, alert step, and those who saw him in the light ofHooniah's slush-lamp noticed that he came empty-handed, withoutrattles, masks, or shaman's paraphernalia, save for a great sleepyraven carried under one arm."Is there wood gathered for a fire, so that all may see when the workbe done?" he demanded."Yea," Bawn answered. "There be wood in plenty.""Then let all listen, for my words be few. With me have I broughtJelchs, the Raven, diviner of mystery and seer of things. Him, in hisblackness, shall I place under the big black pot of Hooniah, in theblackest corner of her house. The slush-lamp shall cease to burn, andall remain in outer darkness. It is very simple. One by one shall yego into the house, lay hand upon the pot for the space of one longintake of the breath, and withdraw again. Doubtless Jelchs will makeoutcry when the hand of the evil-doer is nigh him. Or who knows butotherwise he may manifest his wisdom. Are ye ready?""We be ready," came the multi-voiced response."Then will I call the name aloud, each in his turn and hers, till allare called."Thereat La-lah was first chosen, and he passed in at once. Everyear strained, and through the silence they could hear his footstepscreaking across the rickety floor. But that was all. Jelchs made nooutcry, gave no sign. Bawn was next chosen, for it well might be thata man should steal his own blankets with intent to cast shame upon hisneighbors. Hooniah followed, and other women and children, but withoutresult."Sime!" Scundoo called out."Sime!" he repeated.But Sime did not stir."Art thou afraid of the dark?" La-lah, his own integrity being proved,demanded fiercely.Sime chuckled. "I laugh at it all, for it is a great foolishness.Yet will I go in, not in belief in wonders, but in token that I amunafraid."And he passed in boldly, and came out still mocking."Some day shalt thou die with great suddenness," La-lah whispered,righteously indignant."I doubt not," the scoffer answered airily. "Few men of us die in ourbeds, what of the shamans and the deep sea."When half the villagers had safely undergone the ordeal, theexcitement, because of its repression, was painfully intense. Whentwo-thirds had gone through, a young woman, close on her firstchild-bed, broke down and in nervous shrieks and laughter gave form toher terror.Finally the turn came for the last of all to go in, and nothing hadhappened. And Di Ya was the last of all. It must surely be he. Hooniahlet out a lament to the stars, while the rest drew back from theluckless lad. He was half-dead from fright, and his legs gave underhim so that he staggered on the threshold and nearly fell. Scundooshoved him inside and closed the door. A long time went by, duringwhich could be heard only the boy's weeping. Then, very slowly, camethe creak of his steps to the far corner, a pause, and the creaking ofhis return. The door opened and he came forth. Nothing had happened,and he was the last."Let the fire be lighted," Scundoo commanded.The bright flames rushed upward, revealing faces yet marked withvanishing fear, but also clouded with doubt."Surely the thing has failed," Hooniah whispered hoarsely."Yea," Bawn answered complacently. "Scundoo groweth old, and we standin need of a new shaman.""Where now is the wisdom of Jelchs?" Sime snickered in La-lah's ear.La-lah brushed his brow in a puzzled manner and said nothing.Sime threw his chest out arrogantly and strutted up to the littleshaman. "Hoh! Hoh! As I said, nothing has come of it!""So it would seem, so it would seem," Scundoo answered meekly. "And itwould seem strange to those unskilled in the affairs of mystery.""As thou?" Sime queried audaciously."Mayhap even as I." Scundoo spoke quite softly, his eyelids drooping,slowly drooping, down, down, till his eyes were all but hidden. "So Iam minded of another test. Let every man, woman, and child, now and atonce, hold their hands well up above their heads!"So unexpected was the order, and so imperatively was it given, that itwas obeyed without question. Every hand was in the air."Let each look on the other's hands, and let all look," Scundoocommanded, "so that--"But a noise of laughter, which was more of wrath, drowned his voice.All eyes had come to rest upon Sime. Every hand but his was black withsoot, and his was guiltless of the smirch of Hooniah's pot.A stone hurtled through the air and struck him on the cheek."It is a lie!" he yelled. "A lie! I know naught of Hooniah'sblankets!"A second stone gashed his brow, a third whistled past his head, thegreat blood-cry went up, and everywhere were people groping on theground for missiles. He staggered and half sank down."It was a joke! Only a joke!" he shrieked. "I but took them for ajoke!""Where hast thou hidden them?" Scundoo's shrill, sharp voice cutthrough the tumult like a knife."In the large skin-bale in my house, the one slung by the ridge-pole,"came the answer. "But it was a joke, I say, only--"Scundoo nodded his head, and the air went thick with flying stones.Sime's wife was crying silently, her head upon her knees; but hislittle boy, with shrieks and laughter, was flinging stones with therest.Hooniah came waddling back with the precious blankets. Scundoo stoppedher."We be poor people and have little," she whimpered. "So be not hardupon us, O Scundoo."The people ceased from the quivering stone-pile they had builded, andlooked on."Nay, it was never my way, good Hooniah," Scundoo made answer,reaching for the blankets. "In token that I am not hard, these onlyshall I take.""Am I not wise, my children?" he demanded."Thou art indeed wise, O Scundoo!" they cried in one voice.And he went away into the darkness, the blankets around him, andJelchs nodding sleepily under his arm.THE SUNLANDERSMandell is an obscure village on the rim of the polar sea. It is notlarge, and the people are peaceable, more peaceable even than thoseof the adjacent tribes. There are few men in Mandell, and many women;wherefore a wholesome and necessary polygamy is in practice; the womenbear children with ardor, and the birth of a man-child is hailed withacclamation. Then there is Aab-Waak, whose head rests always on oneshoulder, as though at some time the neck had become very tired andrefused forevermore its wonted duty.The cause of all these things,--the peaceableness, and the polygamy,and the tired neck of Aab-Waak,--goes back among the years to the timewhen the schooner _Search_ dropped anchor in Mandell Bay, and whenTyee, chief man of the tribe, conceived a scheme of sudden wealth. Tothis day the story of things that happened is remembered and spokenof with bated breath by the people of Mandell, who are cousins to theHungry Folk who live in the west. Children draw closer when the taleis told, and marvel sagely to themselves at the madness of those whomight have been their forebears had they not provoked the Sunlandersand come to bitter ends.It began to happen when six men came ashore from the _Search_,with heavy outfits, as though they had come to stay, and quarteredthemselves in Neegah's igloo. Not but that they paid well in flour andsugar for the lodging, but Neegah was aggrieved because Mesahchie, hisdaughter, elected to cast her fortunes and seek food and blanket withBill-Man, who was leader of the party of white men."She is worth a price," Neegah complained to the gathering by thecouncil-fire, when the six white men were asleep. "She is worth aprice, for we have more men than women, and the men be bidding high.The hunter Ounenk offered me a kayak, new-made, and a gun which he gotin trade from the Hungry Folk. This was I offered, and behold, now sheis gone and I have nothing!""I, too, did bid for Mesahchie," grumbled a voice, in tones notaltogether joyless, and Peelo shoved his broad-cheeked, jovial facefor a moment into the light."Thou, too," Neegah affirmed. "And there were others. Why is theresuch a restlessness upon the Sunlanders?" he demanded petulantly. "Whydo they not stay at home? The Snow People do not wander to the landsof the Sunlanders.""Better were it to ask why they come," cried a voice from thedarkness, and Aab-Waak pushed his way to the front."Ay! Why they come!" clamored many voices, and Aab-Waak waved his handfor silence."Men do not dig in the ground for nothing," he began. "And I have itin mind of the Whale People, who are likewise Sunlanders, and who losttheir ship in the ice. You all remember the Whale People, who came tous in their broken boats, and who went away into the south with dogsand sleds when the frost arrived and snow covered the land. And youremember, while they waited for the frost, that one man of them dug inthe ground, and then two men and three, and then all men of them, withgreat excitement and much disturbance. What they dug out of the groundwe do not know, for they drove us away so we could not see. Butafterward, when they were gone, we looked and found nothing. Yet therebe much ground and they did not dig it all.""Ay, Aab-Waak! Ay!" cried the people in admiration."Wherefore I have it in mind," he concluded, "that one Sunlander tellsanother, and that these Sunlanders have been so told and are come todig in the ground.""But how can it be that Bill-Man speaks our tongue?" demanded a littleweazened old hunter,--"Bill-Man, upon whom never before our eyes haverested?""Bill-Man has been other times in the Snow Lands," Aab-Waak answered,"else would he not speak the speech of the Bear People, which is likethe speech of the Hungry Folk, which is very like the speech of theMandells. For there have been many Sunlanders among the Bear People,few among the Hungry Folk, and none at all among the Mandells, savethe Whale People and those who sleep now in the igloo of Neegah.""Their sugar is very good," Neegah commented, "and their flour.""They have great wealth," Ounenk added. "Yesterday I was to theirship, and beheld most cunning tools of iron, and knives, and guns, andflour, and sugar, and strange foods without end.""It is so, brothers!" Tyee stood up and exulted inwardly at therespect and silence his people accorded him. "They be very rich,these Sunlanders. Also, they be fools. For behold! They come among usboldly, blindly, and without thought for all of their great wealth.Even now they snore, and we are many and unafraid.""Mayhap they, too, are unafraid, being great fighters," the weazenedlittle old hunter objected.But Tyee scowled upon him. "Nay, it would not seem so. They live tothe south, under the path of the sun, and are soft as their dogs aresoft. You remember the dog of the Whale People? Our dogs ate him thesecond day, for he was soft and could not fight. The sun is warm andlife easy in the Sun Lands, and the men are as women, and the women aschildren."Heads nodded in approval, and the women craned their necks to listen."It is said they are good to their women, who do little work,"tittered Likeeta, a broad-hipped, healthy young woman, daughter toTyee himself."Thou wouldst follow the feet of Mesahchie, eh?" he cried angrily.Then he turned swiftly to the tribesmen. "Look you, brothers, this isthe way of the Sunlanders! They have eyes for our women, and take themone by one. As Mesahchie has gone, cheating Neegah of her price, sowill Likeeta go, so will they all go, and we be cheated. I have talkedwith a hunter from the Bear People, and I know. There be Hungry Folkamong us; let them speak if my words be true."The six hunters of the Hungry Folk attested the truth and fell eachto telling his neighbor of the Sunlanders and their ways. There weremutterings from the younger men, who had wives to seek, and from theolder men, who had daughters to fetch prices, and a low hum of ragerose higher and clearer."They are very rich, and have cunning tools of iron, and knives, andguns without end," Tyee suggested craftily, his dream of sudden wealthbeginning to take shape."I shall take the gun of Bill-Man for myself," Aab-Waak suddenlyproclaimed."Nay, it shall be mine!" shouted Neegah; "for there is the price ofMesahchie to be reckoned.""Peace! O brothers!" Tyee swept the assembly with his hands. "Let thewomen and children go to their igloos. This is the talk of men; let itbe for the ears of men.""There be guns in plenty for all," he said when the women hadunwillingly withdrawn. "I doubt not there will be two guns for eachman, without thought of the flour and sugar and other things. And itis easy. The six Sunlanders in Neegah's igloo will we kill to-nightwhile they sleep. To-morrow will we go in peace to the ship totrade, and there, when the time favors, kill all their brothers. Andto-morrow night there shall be feasting and merriment and divisionof wealth. And the least man shall possess more than did ever thegreatest before. Is it wise, that which I have spoken, brothers?"A low growl of approval answered him, and preparation for the attackwas begun. The six Hungry Folk, as became members of a wealthiertribe, were armed with rifles and plenteously supplied withammunition. But it was only here and there that a Mandell possessed agun, many of which were broken, and there was a general slackness ofpowder and shells. This poverty of war weapons, however, was relievedby myriads of bone-headed arrows and casting-spears for work at adistance, and for close quarters steel knives of Russian and Yankeemake."Let there be no noise," Tyee finally instructed; "but be there manyon every side of the igloo, and close, so that the Sunlanders may notbreak through. Then do you, Neegah, with six of the young men behind,crawl in to where they sleep. Take no guns, which be prone to gooff at unexpected times, but put the strength of your arms into theknives.""And be it understood that no harm befall Mesahchie, who is worth aprice," Neegah whispered hoarsely.Flat upon the ground, the small army concentred on the igloo, andbehind, deliciously expectant, crouched many women and children, comeout to witness the murder. The brief August night was passing, and inthe gray of dawn could be dimly discerned the creeping forms of Neegahand the young men. Without pause, on hands and knees, they entered thelong passageway and disappeared. Tyee rose up and rubbed his hands.All was going well. Head after head in the big circle lifted andwaited. Each man pictured the scene according to his nature--thesleeping men, the plunge of the knives, and the sudden death in thedark.A loud hail, in the voice of a Sunlander, rent the silence, and ashot rang out. Then an uproar broke loose inside the igloo. Withoutpremeditation, the circle swept forward into the passageway. On theinside, half a dozen repeating rifles began to chatter, and theMandells, jammed in the confined space, were powerless. Those at thefront strove madly to retreat from the fire-spitting guns in theirvery faces, and those in the rear pressed as madly forward to theattack. The bullets from the big 45:90's drove through half a dozenmen at a shot, and the passageway, gorged with surging, helpless men,became a shambles. The rifles, pumped without aim into the mass,withered it away like a machine gun, and against that steady stream ofdeath no man could advance."Never was there the like!" panted one of the Hungry Folk. "I didbut look in, and the dead were piled like seals on the ice after akilling!""Did I not say, mayhap, they were fighters?" cackled the weazened oldhunter."It was to be expected," Aab-Waak answered stoutly. "We fought in atrap of our making.""O ye fools!" Tyee chided. "Ye sons of fools! It was not planned, thisthing ye have done. To Neegah and the six young men only was it givento go inside. My cunning is superior to the cunning of the Sunlanders,but ye take away its edge, and rob me of its strength, and make itworse than no cunning at all!"No one made reply, and all eyes centred on the igloo, which loomedvague and monstrous against the clear northeast sky. Through a holein the roof the smoke from the rifles curled slowly upward in thepulseless air, and now and again a wounded man crawled painfullythrough the gray."Let each ask of his neighbor for Neegah and the six young men," Tyeecommanded.And after a time the answer came back, "Neegah and the six young menare not.""And many more are not!" wailed a woman to the rear."The more wealth for those who are left," Tyee grimly consoled. Then,turning to Aab-Waak, he said: "Go thou, and gather together manysealskins filled with oil. Let the hunters empty them on the outsidewood of the igloo and of the passage. And let them put fire to it erethe Sunlanders make holes in the igloo for their guns."Even as he spoke a hole appeared in the dirt plastered between thelogs, a rifle muzzle protruded, and one of the Hungry Folk clappedhand to his side and leaped in the air. A second shot, through thelungs, brought him to the ground. Tyee and the rest scattered toeither side, out of direct range, and Aab-Waak hastened the menforward with the skins of oil. Avoiding the loopholes, which weremaking on every side of the igloo, they emptied the skins on the drydrift-logs brought down by the Mandell River from the tree-lands tothe south. Ounenk ran forward with a blazing brand, and the flamesleaped upward. Many minutes passed, without sign, and they held theirweapons ready as the fire gained headway.Tyee rubbed his hands gleefully as the dry structure burned andcrackled. "Now we have them, brothers! In the trap!""And no one may gainsay me the gun of Bill-Man," Aab-Waak announced."Save Bill-Man," squeaked the old hunter. "For behold, he cometh now!"Covered with a singed and blackened blanket, the big white man leapedout of the blazing entrance, and on his heels, likewise shielded, cameMesahchie, and the five other Sunlanders. The Hungry Folk tried tocheck the rush with an ill-directed volley, while the Mandells hurledin a cloud of spears and arrows. But the Sunlanders cast their flamingblankets from them as they ran, and it was seen that each bore on hisshoulders a small pack of ammunition. Of all their possessions, theyhad chosen to save that. Running swiftly and with purpose, they brokethe circle and headed directly for the great cliff, which toweredblackly in the brightening day a half-mile to the rear of the village.But Tyee knelt on one knee and lined the sights of his rifle on therearmost Sunlander. A great shout went up when he pulled the triggerand the man fell forward, struggled partly up, and fell again. Withoutregard for the rain of arrows, another Sunlander ran back, bent overhim, and lifted him across his shoulders. But the Mandell spearmenwere crowding up into closer range, and a strong cast transfixed thewounded man. He cried out and became swiftly limp as his comradelowered him to the ground. In the meanwhile, Bill-Man and the threeothers had made a stand and were driving a leaden hail into theadvancing spearmen. The fifth Sunlander bent over his stricken fellow,felt the heart, and then coolly cut the straps of the pack and stoodup with the ammunition and extra gun."Now is he a fool!" cried Tyee, leaping high, as he ran forward, toclear the squirming body of one of the Hungry Folk.His own rifle was clogged so that he could not use it, and he calledout for some one to spear the Sunlander, who had turned and wasrunning for safety under the protecting fire. The little old hunterpoised his spear on the throwing-stick, swept his arm back as he ran,and delivered the cast."By the body of the Wolf, say I, it was a good throw!" Tyee praised,as the fleeing man pitched forward, the spear standing upright betweenhis shoulders and swaying slowly forward and back.The little weazened old man coughed and sat down. A streak of redshowed on his lips and welled into a thick stream. He coughed again,and a strange whistling came and went with his breath."They, too, are unafraid, being great fighters," he wheezed, pawingaimlessly with his hands. "And behold! Bill-Man comes now!"Tyee glanced up. Four Mandells and one of the Hungry Folk had rushedupon the fallen man and were spearing him from his knees back to theearth. In the twinkling of an eye, Tyee saw four of them cut down bythe bullets of the Sunlanders. The fifth, as yet unhurt, seized thetwo rifles, but as he stood up to make off he was whirled almostcompletely around by the impact of a bullet in the arm, steadied bya second, and overthrown by the shock of a third. A moment later andBill-Man was on the spot, cutting the pack-straps and picking up theguns.This Tyee saw, and his own people falling as they straggled forward,and he was aware of a quick doubt, and resolved to lie where he wasand see more. For some unaccountable reason, Mesahchie was runningback to Bill-Man; but before she could reach him, Tyee saw Peelo runout and throw arms about her. He essayed to sling her across hisshoulder, but she grappled with him, tearing and scratching at hisface. Then she tripped him, and the pair fell heavily. When theyregained their feet, Peelo had shifted his grip so that one armwas passed under her chin, the wrist pressing into her throat andstrangling her. He buried his face in her breast, taking the blows ofher hands on his thick mat of hair, and began slowly to force her offthe field. Then it was, retreating with the weapons of his fallencomrades, that Bill-Man came upon them. As Mesahchie saw him, shetwirled the victim around and held him steady. Bill-Man swung therifle in his right hand, and hardly easing his stride, delivered theblow. Tyee saw Peelo drive to the earth as smote by a falling star,and the Sunlander and Neegah's daughter fleeing side by side.A bunch of Mandells, led by one of the Hungry Folk, made a futile rushwhich melted away into the earth before the scorching fire.Tyee caught his breath and murmured, "Like the young frost in themorning sun.""As I say, they are great fighters," the old hunter whispered weakly,far gone in hemorrhage. "I know. I have heard. They be sea-robbers andhunters of seals; and they shoot quick and true, for it is their wayof life and the work of their hands.""Like the young frost in the morning sun," Tyee repeated, crouchingfor shelter behind the dying man and peering at intervals about him.It was no longer a fight, for no Mandell man dared venture forward,and as it was, they were too close to the Sunlanders to go back. Threetried it, scattering and scurrying like rabbits; but one came downwith a broken leg, another was shot through the body, and the third,twisting and dodging, fell on the edge of the village. So thetribesmen crouched in the hollow places and burrowed into the dirt inthe open, while the Sunlanders' bullets searched the plain."Move not," Tyee pleaded, as Aab-Waak came worming over the ground tohim. "Move not, good Aab-Waak, else you bring death upon us.""Death sits upon many," Aab-Waak laughed; "wherefore, as you say,there will be much wealth in division. My father breathes fast andshort behind the big rock yon, and beyond, twisted like in a knot,lieth my brother. But their share shall be my share, and it is well.""As you say, good Aab-Waak, and as I have said; but before divisionmust come that which we may divide, and the Sunlanders be not yetdead."A bullet glanced from a rock before them, and singing shrilly, roselow over their heads on its second flight. Tyee ducked and shivered,but Aab-Waak grinned and sought vainly to follow it with his eyes."So swiftly they go, one may not see them," he observed."But many be dead of us," Tyee went on."And many be left," was the reply. "And they hug close to the earth,for they have become wise in the fashion of righting. Further, theyare angered. Moreover, when we have killed the Sunlanders on the ship,there will remain but four on the land. These may take long to kill,but in the end it will happen.""How may we go down to the ship when we cannot go this way or that?"Tyee questioned."It is a bad place where lie Bill-Man and his brothers," Aab-Waakexplained. "We may come upon them from every side, which is not good.So they aim to get their backs against the cliff and wait until theirbrothers of the ship come to give them aid.""Never shall they come from the ship, their brothers! I have said it."Tyee was gathering courage again, and when the Sunlanders verified theprediction by retreating to the cliff, he was light-hearted as ever."There be only three of us!" complained one of the Hungry Folk as theycame together for council."Therefore, instead of two, shall you have four guns each," was Tyee'srejoinder."We did good fighting.""Ay; and if it should happen that two of you be left, then will youhave six guns each. Therefore, fight well.""And if there be none of them left?" Aab-Waak whispered slyly."Then will _we_ have the guns, you and I," Tyee whispered back.However, to propitiate the Hungry Folk, he made one of them leaderof the ship expedition. This party comprised fully two-thirds of thetribesmen, and departed for the coast, a dozen miles away, laden withskins and things to trade. The remaining men were disposed in a largehalf-circle about the breastwork which Bill-Man and his Sunlanders hadbegun to throw up. Tyee was quick to note the virtues of things, andat once set his men to digging shallow trenches."The time will go before they are aware," he explained to Aab-Waak;"and their minds being busy, they will not think overmuch of the deadthat are, nor gather trouble to themselves. And in the dark of nightthey may creep closer, so that when the Sunlanders look forth in themorning light they will find us very near."In the midday heat the men ceased from their work and made a meal ofdried fish and seal oil which the women brought up. There was someclamor for the food of the Sunlanders in the igloo of Neegah, but Tyeerefused to divide it until the return of the ship party. Speculationsupon the outcome became rife, but in the midst of it a dull boomdrifted up over the land from the sea. The keen-eyed ones made outa dense cloud of smoke, which quickly disappeared, and which theyaverred was directly over the ship of the Sunlanders. Tyee was of theopinion that it was a big gun. Aab-Waak did not know, but thought itmight be a signal of some sort. Anyway, he said, it was time somethinghappened.Five or six hours afterward a solitary man was descried coming acrossthe wide flat from the sea, and the women and children poured out uponhim in a body. It was Ounenk, naked, winded, and wounded. The bloodstill trickled down his face from a gash on the forehead. His leftarm, frightfully mangled, hung helpless at his side. But mostsignificant of all, there was a wild gleam in his eyes which betokenedthe women knew not what."Where be Peshack?" an old squaw queried sharply."And Olitlie?" "And Polak?" "And Mah-Kook?" the voices took up thecry.But he said nothing, brushing his way through the clamorous mass anddirecting his staggering steps toward Tyee. The old squaw raised thewail, and one by one the women joined her as they swung in behind. Themen crawled out of their trenches and ran back to gather about Tyee,and it was noticed that the Sunlanders climbed upon their barricade tosee.Ounenk halted, swept the blood from his eyes, and looked about. Hestrove to speak, but his dry lips were glued together. Likeeta fetchedhim water, and he grunted and drank again."Was it a fight?" Tyee demanded finally,--"a good fight?""Ho! ho! ho!" So suddenly and so fiercely did Ounenk laugh that everyvoice hushed. "Never was there such a fight! So I say, I, Ounenk,fighter beforetime of beasts and men. And ere I forget, let me speakfat words and wise. By fighting will the Sunlanders teach us MandellFolk how to fight. And if we fight long enough, we shall be greatfighters, even as the Sunlanders, or else we shall be--dead. Ho! ho!ho! It was a fight!""Where be thy brothers?" Tyee shook him till he shrieked from the painof his hurts.Ounenk sobered. "My brothers? They are not.""And Pome-Lee?" cried one of the two Hungry Folk; "Pome-Lee, the sonof my mother?""Pome-Lee is not," Ounenk answered in a monotonous voice."And the Sunlanders?" from Aab-Waak."The Sunlanders are not.""Then the ship of the Sunlanders, and the wealth and guns and things?"Tyee demanded."Neither the ship of the Sunlanders, nor the wealth and guns andthings," was the unvarying response. "All are not. Nothing is. I onlyam.""And thou art a fool.""It may be so," Ounenk answered, unruffled."I have seen that which would well make me a fool."Tyee held his tongue, and all waited till it should please Ounenk totell the story in his own way."We took no guns, O Tyee," he at last began; "no guns, mybrothers--only knives and hunting bows and spears. And in twos andthrees, in our kayaks, we came to the ship. They were glad to see us,the Sunlanders, and we spread our skins and they brought outtheir articles of trade, and everything was well. And Pome-Leewaited--waited till the sun was well overhead and they sat at meat,when he gave the cry and we fell upon them. Never was there such afight, and never such fighters. Half did we kill in the quicknessof surprise, but the half that was left became as devils, and theymultiplied themselves, and everywhere they fought like devils. Threeput their backs against the mast of the ship, and we ringed them withour dead before they died. And some got guns and shot with both eyeswide open, and very quick and sure. And one got a big gun, from whichat one time he shot many small bullets. And so, behold!"Ounenk pointed to his ear, neatly pierced by a buckshot."But I, Ounenk, drove my spear through his back from behind. And insuch fashion, one way and another, did we kill them all--all save thehead man. And him we were about, many of us, and he was alone, when hemade a great cry and broke through us, five or six dragging upon him,and ran down inside the ship. And then, when the wealth of theship was ours, and only the head man down below whom we would killpresently, why then there was a sound as of all the guns in theworld--a mighty sound! And like a bird I rose up in the air, and theliving Mandell Folk, and the dead Sunlanders, the little kayaks, thebig ship, the guns, the wealth--everything rose up in the air. So Isay, I, Ounenk, who tell the tale, am the only one left."A great silence fell upon the assemblage. Tyee looked at Aab-Waak withawe-struck eyes, but forbore to speak. Even the women were too stunnedto wail the dead.Ounenk looked about him with pride. "I, only, am left," he repeated.But at that instant a rifle cracked from Bill-Man's barricade, andthere was a sharp spat and thud on the chest of Ounenk. He swayedbackward and came forward again, a look of startled surprise on hisface. He gasped, and his lips writhed in a grim smile. There was ashrinking together of the shoulders and a bending of the knees. Heshook himself, as might a drowsing man, and straightened up. But theshrinking and bending began again, and he sank down slowly, quiteslowly, to the ground.It was a clean mile from the pit of the Sunlanders, and death hadspanned it. A great cry of rage went up, and in it there was much ofblood-vengeance, much of the unreasoned ferocity of the brute. Tyeeand Aab-Waak tried to hold the Mandell Folk back, were thrust aside,and could only turn and watch the mad charge. But no shots camefrom the Sunlanders, and ere half the distance was covered, many,affrighted by the mysterious silence of the pit, halted and waited.The wilder spirits bore on, and when they had cut the remainingdistance in half, the pit still showed no sign of life. At two hundredyards they slowed down and bunched; at one hundred, they stopped, ascore of them, suspicious, and conferred together.Then a wreath of smoke crowned the barricade, and they scattered likea handful of pebbles thrown at random. Four went down, and four more,and they continued swiftly to fall, one and two at a time, till butone remained, and he in full flight with death singing about his ears.It was Nok, a young hunter, long-legged and tall, and he ran as neverbefore. He skimmed across the naked open like a bird, and soared andsailed and curved from side to side. The rifles in the pit rang outin solid volley; they flut-flut-flut-flutted in ragged sequence; andstill Nok rose and dipped and rose again unharmed. There was a lull inthe firing, as though the Sunlanders had given over, and Nok curvedless and less in his flight till he darted straight forward at everyleap. And then, as he leaped cleanly and well, one lone rifle barkedfrom the pit, and he doubled up in mid-air, struck the ground in aball, and like a ball bounced from the impact, and came down in abroken heap."Who so swift as the swift-winged lead?" Aab-Waak pondered.Tyee grunted and turned away. The incident was closed and there wasmore pressing matter at hand. One Hungry Man and forty fighters, someof them hurt, remained; and there were four Sunlanders yet to reckonwith."We will keep them in their hole by the cliff," he said, "and whenfamine has gripped them hard we will slay them like children.""But of what matter to fight?" queried Oloof, one of the younger men."The wealth of the Sunlanders is not; only remains that in the iglooof Neegah, a paltry quantity--"He broke off hastily as the air by his ear split sharply to thepassage of a bullet.Tyee laughed scornfully. "Let that be thy answer. What else may we dowith this mad breed of Sunlanders which will not die?""What a thing is foolishness!" Oloof protested, his ears furtivelyalert for the coming of other bullets. "It is not right that theyshould fight so, these Sunlanders. Why will they not die easily? Theyare fools not to know that they are dead men, and they give us muchtrouble.""We fought before for great wealth; we fight now that we may live,"Aab-Waak summed up succinctly.That night there was a clash in the trenches, and shots exchanged. Andin the morning the igloo of Neegah was found empty of the Sunlanders'possessions. These they themselves had taken, for the signs of theirtrail were visible to the sun. Oloof climbed to the brow of the cliffto hurl great stones down into the pit, but the cliff overhung, and hehurled down abuse and insult instead, and promised bitter torture tothem in the end. Bill-Man mocked him back in the tongue of the BearFolk, and Tyee, lifting his head from a trench to see, had hisshoulder scratched deeply by a bullet.And in the dreary days that followed, and in the wild nights when theypushed the trenches closer, there was much discussion as to the wisdomof letting the Sunlanders go. But of this they were afraid, and thewomen raised a cry always at the thought This much they had seen ofthe Sunlanders; they cared to see no more. All the time the whistleand blub-blub of bullets filled the air, and all the time thedeath-list grew. In the golden sunrise came the faint, far crack of arifle, and a stricken woman would throw up her hands on the distantedge of the village; in the noonday heat, men in the trenches heardthe shrill sing-song and knew their deaths; or in the gray afterglowof evening, the dirt kicked up in puffs by the winking fires. Andthrough the nights the long "Wah-hoo-ha-a wah-hoo-ha-a!" of mourningwomen held dolorous sway.As Tyee had promised, in the end famine gripped the Sunlanders. Andonce, when an early fall gale blew, one of them crawled through thedarkness past the trenches and stole many dried fish.But he could not get back with them, and the sun found him vainlyhiding in the village. So he fought the great fight by himself, andin a narrow ring of Mandell Folk shot four with his revolver, and erethey could lay hands on him for the torture, turned it on himself anddied.This threw a gloom upon the people. Oloof put the question, "If oneman die so hard, how hard will die the three who yet are left?"Then Mesahchie stood up on the barricade and called in by name threedogs which had wandered close,--meat and life,--which set back the dayof reckoning and put despair in the hearts of the Mandell Folk. And onthe head of Mesahchie were showered the curses of a generation.The days dragged by. The sun hurried south, the nights grew long andlonger, and there was a touch of frost in the air. And still theSunlanders held the pit. Hearts were breaking under the unendingstrain, and Tyee thought hard and deep. Then he sent forth word thatall the skins and hides of all the tribe be collected. These he hadmade into huge cylindrical bales, and behind each bale he placed aman.When the word was given the brief day was almost spent, and it wasslow work and tedious, rolling the big bales forward foot by foot Thebullets of the Sunlanders blub-blubbed and thudded against them, butcould not go through, and the men howled their delight But the darkwas at hand, and Tyee, secure of success, called the bales back to thetrenches.In the morning, in the face of an unearthly silence from the pit, thereal advance began. At first with large intervals between, the balesslowly converged as the circle drew in. At a hundred yards they werequite close together, so that Tyee's order to halt was passed alongin whispers. The pit showed no sign of life. They watched long andsharply, but nothing stirred. The advance was taken up and themanoeuvre repeated at fifty yards. Still no sign nor sound. Tyee shookhis head, and even Aab-Waak was dubious. But the order was given to goon, and go on they did, till bale touched bale and a solid rampart ofskin and hide bowed out from the cliff about the pit and back to thecliff again.Tyee looked back and saw the women and children clustering blackly inthe deserted trenches. He looked ahead at the silent pit. The men werewriggling nervously, and he ordered every second bale forward. Thisdouble line advanced till bale touched bale as before. Then Aab-Waak,of his own will, pushed one bale forward alone. When it touched thebarricade, he waited a long while. After that he tossed unresponsiverocks over into the pit, and finally, with great care, stood up andpeered in. A carpet of empty cartridges, a few white-picked dog bones,and a soggy place where water dripped from a crevice, met his eyes.That was all. The Sunlanders were gone.There were murmurings of witchcraft, vague complaints, dark lookswhich foreshadowed to Tyee dread things which yet might come to pass,and he breathed easier when Aab-Waak took up the trail along the baseof the cliff."The cave!" Tyee cried. "They foresaw my wisdom of the skin-bales andfled away into the cave!"The cliff was honey-combed with a labyrinth of subterranean passageswhich found vent in an opening midway between the pit and where thetrench tapped the wall. Thither, and with many exclamations, thetribesmen followed Aab-Waak, and, arrived, they saw plainly where theSunlanders had climbed to the mouth, twenty and odd feet above."Now the thing is done," Tyee said, rubbing his hands. "Let word goforth that rejoicing be made, for they are in the trap now, theseSunlanders, in the trap. The young men shall climb up, and the mouthof the cave be filled with stones, so that Bill-Man and his brothersand Mesahchie shall by famine be pinched to shadows and die cursing inthe silence and dark."Cries of delight and relief greeted this, and Howgah, the last of theHungry Folk, swarmed up the steep slant and drew himself, crouching,upon the lip of the opening. But as he crouched, a muffled reportrushed forth, and as he clung desperately to the slippery edge, asecond. His grip loosed with reluctant weakness, and he pitched downat the feet of Tyee, quivered for a moment like some monstrous jelly,and was still."How should I know they were great fighters and unafraid?" Tyeedemanded, spurred to defence by recollection of the dark looks andvague complaints."We were many and happy," one of the men stated baldly. Anotherfingered his spear with a prurient hand.But Oloof cried them cease. "Give ear, my brothers! There be anotherway! As a boy I chanced upon it playing along the steep. It is hiddenby the rocks, and there is no reason that a man should go there;wherefore it is secret, and no man knows. It is very small, and youcrawl on your belly a long way, and then you are in the cave. To-nightwe will so crawl, without noise, on our bellies, and come upon theSunlanders from behind. And to-morrow we will be at peace, and neveragain will we quarrel with the Sunlanders in the years to come.""Never again!" chorussed the weary men. "Never again!" And Tyee joinedwith them.That night, with the memory of their dead in their hearts, and intheir hands stones and spears and knives, the horde of women andchildren collected about the known mouth of the cave. Down the twentyand odd precarious feet to the ground no Sunlander could hope to passand live. In the village remained only the wounded men, while everyable man--and there were thirty of them--followed Oloof to the secretopening. A hundred feet of broken ledges and insecurely heaped rockswere between it and the earth, and because of the rocks, which mightbe displaced by the touch of hand or foot, but one man climbed at atime. Oloof went up first, called softly for the next to come on, anddisappeared inside. A man followed, a second, and a third, and so on,till only Tyee remained. He received the call of the last man, but aquick doubt assailed him and he stayed to ponder. Half an hour laterhe swung up to the opening and peered in. He could feel the narrownessof the passage, and the darkness before him took on solidity. The fearof the walled-in earth chilled him and he could not venture. All themen who had died, from Neegah the first of the Mandells, to Howgahthe last of the Hungry Folk, came and sat with him, but he chose theterror of their company rather than face the horror which he felt tolurk in the thick blackness. He had been sitting long when somethingsoft and cold fluttered lightly on his cheek, and he knew the firstwinter's snow was falling. The dim dawn came, and after that thebright day, when he heard a low guttural sobbing, which came and wentat intervals along the passage and which drew closer each time andmore distinct He slipped over the edge, dropped his feet to the firstledge, and waited.That which sobbed made slow progress, but at last, after many halts,it reached him, and he was sure no Sunlander made the noise. So hereached a hand inside, and where there should have been a head feltthe shoulders of a man uplifted on bent arms. The head he found later,not erect, but hanging straight down so that the crown rested on thefloor of the passage."Is it you, Tyee?" the head said. "For it is I, Aab-Waak, who amhelpless and broken as a rough-flung spear. My head is in the dirt,and I may not climb down unaided."Tyee clambered in, dragged him up with his back against the wall, butthe head hung down on the chest and sobbed and wailed."Ai-oo-o, ai-oo-o!" it went "Oloof forgot, for Mesahchie likewise knewthe secret and showed the Sunlanders, else they would not have waitedat the end of the narrow way. Wherefore, I am a broken man, andhelpless--ai-oo-o, ai-oo-o!""And did they die, the cursed Sunlanders, at the end of the narrowway?" Tyee demanded."How should I know they waited?" Aab-Waak gurgled. "For my brothershad gone before, many of them, and there was no sound of struggle.How should I know why there should be no sound of struggle? And ereI knew, two hands were about my neck so that I could not cry out andwarn my brothers yet to come. And then there were two hands more on myhead, and two more on my feet. In this fashion the three Sunlandershad me. And while the hands held my head in the one place, the handson my feet swung my body around, and as we wring the neck of a duck inthe marsh, so my week was wrung."But it was not given that I should die," he went on, a remnant ofpride yet glimmering. "I, only, am left. Oloof and the rest lie ontheir backs in a row, and their faces turn this way and that, and thefaces of some be underneath where the backs of their heads should be.It is not good to look upon; for when life returned to me I saw themall by the light of a torch which the Sunlanders left, and I had beenlaid with them in the row.""So? So?" Tyee mused, too stunned for speech.He started suddenly, and shivered, for the voice of Bill-Man shot outat him from the passage."It is well," it said. "I look for the man who crawls with the brokenneck, and lo, do I find Tyee. Throw down thy gun, Tyee, so that I mayhear it strike among the rocks."Tyee obeyed passively, and Bill-Man crawled forward into the light.Tyee looked at him curiously. He was gaunt and worn and dirty, and hiseyes burned like twin coals in their cavernous sockets."I am hungry, Tyee," he said. "Very hungry.""And I am dirt at thy feet," Tyee responded."Thy word is my law. Further, I commanded my people not to withstandthee. I counselled--"But Bill-Man had turned and was calling back into the passage. "Hey!Charley! Jim! Fetch the woman along and come on!""We go now to eat," he said, when his comrades and Mesahchie hadjoined him.Tyee rubbed his hands deprecatingly. "We have little, but it isthine.""After that we go south on the snow," Bill-Man continued."May you go without hardship and the trail be easy.""It is a long way. We will need dogs and food--much!""Thine the pick of our dogs and the food they may carry."Bill-Man slipped over the edge of the opening and prepared to descend."But we come again, Tyee. We come again, and our days shall be long inthe land."And so they departed into the trackless south, Bill-Man, his brothers,and Mesahchie. And when the next year came, the _Search Number Two_rode at anchor in Mandell Bay. The few Mandell men, who survivedbecause their wounds had prevented their crawling into the cave, wentto work at the best of the Sunlanders and dug in the ground. They huntand fish no more, but receive a daily wage, with which they buy flour,sugar, calico, and such things which the _Search Number Two_ brings onher yearly trip from the Sunlands.And this mine is worked in secret, as many Northland mines have beenworked; and no white man outside the Company, which is Bill-Man, Jim,and Charley, knows the whereabouts of Mandell on the rim of the polarsea. Aab-Waak still carries his head on one shoulder, is become anoracle, and preaches peace to the younger generation, for which hereceives a pension from the Company. Tyee is foreman of the mine. Buthe has achieved a new theory concerning the Sunlanders."They that live under the path of the sun are not soft," he says,smoking his pipe and watching the day-shift take itself off and thenight-shift go on. "For the sun enters into their blood and burns themwith a great fire till they are filled with lusts and passions. Theyburn always, so that they may not know when they are beaten. Further,there is an unrest in them, which is a devil, and they are flung outover the earth to toil and suffer and fight without end. I know. I amTyee."THE SICKNESS OF LONE CHIEFThis is a tale that was told to me by two old men. We sat in the smokeof a mosquito-smudge, in the cool of the day, which was midnight;and ever and anon, throughout the telling, we smote lustily and withpurpose at such of the winged pests as braved the smoke for a snack atour hides. To the right, beneath us, twenty feet down the crumblingbank, the Yukon gurgled lazily. To the left, on the rose-leaf rim ofthe low-lying hills, smouldered the sleepy sun, which saw no sleepthat night nor was destined to see sleep for many nights to come.The old men who sat with me and valorously slew mosquitoes wereLone Chief and Mutsak, erstwhile comrades in arms, and now witheredrepositories of tradition and ancient happening. They were the lastof their generation and without honor among the younger set which hadgrown up on the farthest fringe of a mining civilization. Who caredfor tradition in these days, when spirits could be evoked from blackbottles, and black bottles could be evoked from the complaisant whitemen for a few hours' sweat or a mangy fur? Of what potency the fearfulrites and masked mysteries of shamanism, when daily that livingwonder, the steamboat, coughed and spluttered up and down the Yukon indefiance of all law, a veritable fire-breathing monster? And of whatvalue was hereditary prestige, when he who now chopped the most wood,or best conned a stern-wheeler through the island mazes, attained thechiefest consideration of his fellows?Of a truth, having lived too long, they had fallen on evil days, thesetwo old men, Lone Chief and Mutsak, and in the new order they werewithout honor or place. So they waited drearily for death, and thewhile their hearts warmed to the strange white man who shared withthem the torments of the mosquito-smudge and lent ready ear to theirtales of old time before the steamboat came."So a girl was chosen for me," Lone Chief was saying. His voice,shrill and piping, ever and again dropped plummet-like into a hoarseand rattling bass, and, just as one became accustomed to it, soaringupward into the thin treble--alternate cricket chirpings and bullfrogcroakings, as it were."So a girl was chosen for me," he was saying. "For my father, who wasKask-ta-ka, the Otter, was angered because I looked not with a needfuleye upon women. He was an old man, and chief of his tribe. I was thelast of his sons to be alive, and through me, only, could he look tosee his blood go down among those to come after and as yet unborn. Butknow, O White Man, that I was very sick; and when neither the huntingnor the fishing delighted me, and by meat my belly was not made warm,how should I look with favor upon women? or prepare for the feastof marriage? or look forward to the prattle and troubles of littlechildren?""Ay," Mutsak interrupted. "For had not Lone Chief fought in the armsof a great bear till his head was cracked and blood ran from out hisears?"Lone Chief nodded vigorously. "Mutsak speaks true. In the time thatfollowed, my head was well, and it was not well. For though the fleshhealed and the sore went away, yet was I sick inside. When I walked,my legs shook under me, and when I looked at the light, my eyes becamefilled with tears. And when I opened my eyes, the world outside wentaround and around, and when I closed my eyes, my head inside wentaround and around, and all the things I had ever seen went around andaround inside my head. And above my eyes there was a great pain, asthough something heavy rested always upon me, or like a band that isdrawn tight and gives much hurt. And speech was slow to me, and Iwaited long for each right word to come to my tongue. And when Iwaited not long, all manner of words crowded in, and my tongue spokefoolishness. I was very sick, and when my father, the Otter, broughtthe girl Kasaan before me--""Who was a young girl, and strong, my sister's child," Mutsak brokein. "Strong-hipped for children was Kasaan, and straight-legged andquick of foot. She made better moccasins than any of all the younggirls, and the bark-rope she braided was the stoutest. And she had asmile in her eyes, and a laugh on her lips; and her temper was nothasty, nor was she unmindful that men give the law and women everobey.""As I say, I was very sick," Lone Chief went on. "And when my father,the Otter, brought the girl Kasaan before me, I said rather shouldthey make me ready for burial than for marriage. Whereat the face ofmy father went black with anger, and he said that I should be servedaccording to my wish, and that I who was yet alive should be madeready for death as one already dead--""Which be not the way of our people, O White Man," spoke up Mutsak."For know that these things that were done to Lone Chief it was ourcustom to do only to dead men. But the Otter was very angry.""Ay," said Lone Chief. "My father, the Otter, was a man short ofspeech and swift of deed. And he commanded the people to gather beforethe lodge wherein I lay. And when they were gathered, he commandedthem to mourn for his son who was dead--""And before the lodge they sang thedeath-song--_O-o-o-o-o-o-a-haa-ha-a-ich-klu-kuk-ich-klu-kuk_," wailedMutsak, in so excellent an imitation that all the tendrils of my spinecrawled and curved in sympathy."And inside the lodge," continued Lone Chief, "my mother blackened herface with soot, and flung ashes upon her head, and mourned for me asone already dead; for so had my father commanded. So Okiakuta, mymother, mourned with much noise, and beat her breasts and tore herhair; and likewise Hooniak, my sister, and Seenatah, my mother'ssister; and the noise they made caused a great ache in my head, and Ifelt that I would surely and immediately die."And the elders of the tribe gathered about me where I lay anddiscussed the journey my soul must take. One spoke of the thick andendless forests where lost souls wandered crying, and where I, too,might chance to wander and never see the end. And another spoke ofthe big rivers, rapid with bad water, where evil spirits shrieked andlifted up their formless arms to drag one down by the hair. For theserivers, all said together, a canoe must be provided me. And yetanother spoke of the storms, such as no live man ever saw, when thestars rained down out of the sky, and the earth gaped wide in manycracks, and all the rivers in the heart of the earth rushed out andin. Whereupon they that sat by me flung up their arms and wailedloudly; and those outside heard, and wailed more loudly. And as tothem I was as dead, so was I to my own mind dead. I did not know when,or how, yet did I know that I had surely died."And Okiakuta, my mother, laid beside me my squirrel-skin parka. Alsoshe laid beside me my parka of caribou hide, and my rain coat of sealgut, and my wet-weather muclucs, that my soul should be warm and dryon its long journey. Further, there was mention made of a steep hill,thick with briers and devil's-club, and she fetched heavy moccasins tomake the way easy for my feet."And when the elders spoke of the great beasts I should have to slay,the young men laid beside me my strongest bow and straightest arrows,my throwing-stick, my spear and knife. And when the elders spoke ofthe darkness and silence of the great spaces my soul must wanderthrough, my mother wailed yet more loudly and flung yet more ashesupon her head."And the girl, Kasaan, crept in, very timid and quiet, and dropped alittle bag upon the things for my journey. And in the little bag, Iknew, were the flint and steel and the well-dried tinder for the firesmy soul must build. And the blankets were chosen which were to bewrapped around me. Also were the slaves selected that were to bekilled that my soul might have company. There were seven of theseslaves, for my father was rich and powerful, and it was fit that I,his son, should have proper burial. These slaves we had got in warfrom the Mukumuks, who live down the Yukon. On the morrow, Skolka, theshaman, would kill them, one by one, so that their souls should goquesting with mine through the Unknown. Among other things, they wouldcarry my canoe till we came to the big river, rapid with bad water.And there being no room, and their work being done, they would come nofarther, but remain and howl forever in the dark and endless forest."And as I looked on my fine warm clothes, and my blankets and weaponsof war, and as I thought of the seven slaves to be slain, I felt proudof my burial and knew that I must be the envy of many men. And all thewhile my father, the Otter, sat silent and black. And all that day andnight the people sang my death-song and beat the drums, till it seemedthat I had surely died a thousand times."But in the morning my father arose and made talk. He had been afighting man all his days, he said, as the people knew. Also thepeople knew that it were a greater honor to die fighting in battlethan on the soft skins by the fire. And since I was to die anyway, itwere well that I should go against the Mukumuks and be slain. Thuswould I attain honor and chieftainship in the final abode of the dead,and thus would honor remain to my father, who was the Otter. Whereforehe gave command that a war party be made ready to go down the river.And that when we came upon the Mukumuks I was to go forth alone frommy party, giving semblance of battle, and so be slain.""Nay, but hear, O White Man!" cried Mutsak, unable longer to containhimself. "Skolka, the shaman, whispered long that night in the ear ofthe Otter, and it was his doing that Lone Chief should be sent forthto die. For the Otter being old, and Lone Chief the last of his sons,Skolka had it in mind to become chief himself over the people. Andwhen the people had made great noise for a day and a night and LoneChief was yet alive, Skolka was become afraid that he would not die.So it was the counsel of Skolka, with fine words of honor and deeds,that spoke through the mouth of the Otter."Ay," replied Lone Chief. "Well did I know it was the doing of Skolka,but I was unmindful, being very sick. I had no heart for anger, norbelly for stout words, and I cared little, one way or the other, onlyI cared to die and have done with it all. So, O White Man, the warparty was made ready. No tried fighters were there, nor elders, craftyand wise--naught but five score of young men who had seen littlefighting. And all the village gathered together above the bank of theriver to see us depart. And we departed amid great rejoicing and thesinging of my praises. Even thou, O White Man, wouldst rejoice atsight of a young man going forth to battle, even though doomed to die."So we went forth, the five score young men, and Mutsak came also, forhe was likewise young and untried. And by command of my father, theOtter, my canoe was lashed on either side to the canoe of Mutsak andthe canoe of Kannakut. Thus was my strength saved me from the work ofthe paddles, so that, for all of my sickness, I might make a braveshow at the end. And thus we went down the river."Nor will I weary thee with the tale of the journey, which was notlong. And not far above the village of the Mukumuks we came upon twoof their fighting men in canoes, that fled at the sight of us. Andthen, according to the command of my father, my canoe was cast looseand I was left to drift down all alone. Also, according to hiscommand, were the young men to see me die, so that they might returnand tell the manner of my death. Upon this, my father, the Otter,and Skolka, the shaman, had been very clear, with stern promises ofpunishment in case they were not obeyed."I dipped my paddle and shouted words of scorn after the fleeingwarriors. And the vile things I shouted made them turn their heads inanger, when they beheld that the young men held back, and that I cameon alone. Whereupon, when they had made a safe distance, the twowarriors drew their canoes somewhat apart and waited side by side forme to come between. And I came between, spear in hand, and singing thewar-song of my people. Each flung a spear, but I bent my body, andthe spears whistled over me, and I was unhurt. Then, and we were alltogether, we three, I cast my spear at the one to the right, and itdrove into his throat and he pitched backward into the water."Great was my surprise thereat, for I had killed a man. I turned tothe one on the left and drove strong with my paddle, to meet Deathface to face; but the man's second spear, which was his last, but bitinto the flesh of my shoulder. Then was I upon him, making no cast,but pressing the point into his breast and working it through him withboth my hands. And while I worked, pressing with all my strength, hesmote me upon my head, once and twice, with the broad of his paddle."Even as the point of the spear sprang out beyond his back, he smoteme upon the head. There was a flash, as of bright light, and inside myhead I felt something give, with a snap--just like that, with a snap.And the weight that pressed above my eyes so long was lifted, and theband that bound my brows so tight was broken. And a great gladnesscame upon me, and my heart sang with joy."This be death, I thought; wherefore I thought that death was verygood. And then I saw the two empty canoes, and I knew that I was notdead, but well again. The blows of the man upon my head had made mewell. I knew that I had killed, and the taste of the blood made mefierce, and I drove my paddle into the breast of the Yukon and urgedmy canoe toward the village of the Mukumuks. The young men behind megave a great cry. I looked over my shoulder and saw the water foamingwhite from their paddles--""Ay, it foamed white from our paddles," said Mutsak. "For weremembered the command of the Otter, and of Skolka, that we beholdwith our own eyes the manner of Lone Chief's death. A young man ofthe Mukumuks, on his way to a salmon trap, beheld the coming of LoneChief, and of the five score men behind him. And the young man fledin his canoe, straight for the village, that alarm might be given andpreparation made. But Lone Chief hurried after him, and we hurriedafter Lone Chief to behold the manner of his death. Only, in the faceof the village, as the young man leaped to the shore, Lone Chief roseup in his canoe and made a mighty cast. And the spear entered the bodyof the young man above the hips, and the young man fell upon his face."Whereupon Lone Chief leaped up the bank war-club in hand and a greatwar-cry on his lips, and dashed into the village. The first man he metwas Itwilie, chief over the Mukumuks, and him Lone Chief smote uponthe head with his war-club, so that he fell dead upon the ground. Andfor fear we might not behold the manner of his death, we too, the fivescore young men, leaped to the shore and followed Lone Chief into thevillage. Only the Mukumuks did not understand, and thought we had cometo fight; so their bow-thongs sang and their arrows whistled among us.Whereat we forgot our errand, and fell upon them with our spears andclubs; and they being unprepared, there was great slaughter--""With my own hands I slew their shaman," proclaimed Lone Chief, hiswithered face a-work with memory of that old-time day. "With my ownhands I slew him, who was a greater shaman than Skolka, our ownshaman. And each time I faced a man, I thought, 'Now cometh Death; andeach time I slew the man, and Death came not. It seemed the breath oflife was strong in my nostrils and I could not die--""And we followed Lone Chief the length of the village and back again,"continued Mutsak. "Like a pack of wolves we followed him, back andforth, and here and there, till there were no more Mukumuks left tofight. Then we gathered together five score men-slaves, and double asmany women, and countless children, and we set fire and burned allthe houses and lodges, and departed. And that was the last of theMukumuks.""And that was the last of the Mukumuks," Lone Chief repeatedexultantly. "And when we came to our own village, the people wereamazed at our burden of wealth and slaves, and in that I was stillalive they were more amazed. And my father, the Otter, came tremblingwith gladness at the things I had done. For he was an old man, and Ithe last of his sons. And all the tried fighting men came, and thecrafty and wise, till all the people were gathered together. And thenI arose, and with a voice like thunder, commanded Skolka, the shaman,to stand forth--""Ay, O White Man," exclaimed Mutsak. "With a voice like thunder, thatmade the people shake at the knees and become afraid.""And when Skolka had stood forth," Lone Chief went on, "I said thatI was not minded to die. Also, I said it were not well thatdisappointment come to the evil spirits that wait beyond the grave.Wherefore I deemed it fit that the soul of Skolka fare forth into theUnknown, where doubtless it would howl forever in the dark and endlessforest. And then I slew him, as he stood there, in the face of allthe people. Even I, Lone Chief, with my own hands, slew Skolka, theshaman, in the face of all the people. And when a murmuring arose, Icried aloud--""With a voice like thunder," prompted Mutsak."Ay, with a voice like thunder I cried aloud: 'Behold, O ye people! Iam Lone Chief, slayer of Skolka, the false shaman! Alone among men,have I passed down through the gateway of Death and returned again.Mine eyes have looked upon the unseen things. Mine ears have heard theunspoken words. Greater am I than Skolka, the shaman. Greater than allshamans am I. Likewise am I a greater chief than my father, the Otter.All his days did he fight with the Mukumuks, and lo, in one day have Idestroyed them all. As with the breathing of a breath have I destroyedthem. Wherefore, my father, the Otter, being old, and Skolka, theshaman, being dead, I shall be both chief and shaman. Henceforth shallI be both chief and shaman to you, O my people. And if any man disputemy word, let that man stand forth!'"I waited, but no man stood forth. Then I cried: 'Hoh! I have tastedblood! Now bring meat, for I am hungry. Break open the caches, teardown the fish-racks, and let the feast be big. Let there be merriment,and songs, not of burial, but marriage. And last of all, let the girlKasaan be brought. The girl Kasaan, who is to be the mother of thechildren of Lone Chief!'"And at my words, and because that he was very old, my father, theOtter, wept like a woman, and put his arms about my knees. And fromthat day I was both chief and shaman. And great honor was mine, andall men yielded me obedience.""Until the steamboat came," Mutsak prompted."Ay," said Lone Chief. "Until the steamboat came."KEESH, THE SON OF KEESH"Thus will I give six blankets, warm and double; six files, large andhard; six Hudson Bay knives, keen-edged and long; two canoes, the workof Mogum, The Maker of Things; ten dogs, heavy-shouldered and strongin the harness; and three guns--the trigger of one be broken, but itis a good gun and can doubtless be mended."Keesh paused and swept his eyes over the circle of intent faces. Itwas the time of the Great Fishing, and he was bidding to Gnob forSu-Su his daughter. The place was the St. George Mission by the Yukon,and the tribes had gathered for many a hundred miles. From north,south, east, and west they had come, even from Tozikakat and farTana-naw."And further, O Gnob, thou art chief of the Tana-naw; and I, Keesh,the son of Keesh, am chief of the Thlunget. Wherefore, when my seedsprings from the loins of thy daughter, there shall be a friendshipbetween the tribes, a great friendship, and Tana-naw and Thlungetshall be brothers of the blood in the time to come. What I have saidI will do, that will I do. And how is it with you, O Gnob, in thismatter?"Gnob nodded his head gravely, his gnarled and age-twisted faceinscrutably masking the soul that dwelt behind. His narrow eyesburned like twin coals through their narrow slits, as he piped in ahigh-cracked voice, "But that is not all.""What more?" Keesh demanded. "Have I not offered full measure? Wasthere ever yet a Tana-naw maiden who fetched so great a price? Thenname her!"An open snicker passed round the circle, and Keesh knew that he stoodin shame before these people."Nay, nay, good Keesh, thou dost not understand." Gnob made a soft,stroking gesture. "The price is fair. It is a good price. Nor do Iquestion the broken trigger. But that is not all. What of the man?""Ay, what of the man?" the circle snarled."It is said," Gnob's shrill voice piped, "it is said that Keesh doesnot walk in the way of his fathers. It is said that he has wanderedinto the dark, after strange gods, and that he is become afraid."The face of Keesh went dark. "It is a lie!" he thundered. "Keesh isafraid of no man!""It is said," old Gnob piped on, "that he has harkened to the speechof the white man up at the Big House, and that he bends head to thewhite man's god, and, moreover, that blood is displeasing to the whiteman's god."Keesh dropped his eyes, and his hands clenched passionately. Thesavage circle laughed derisively, and in the ear of Gnob whisperedMadwan, the shaman, high-priest of the tribe and maker of medicine.The shaman poked among the shadows on the rim of the firelight androused up a slender young boy, whom he brought face to face withKeesh; and in the hand of Keesh he thrust a knife.Gnob leaned forward. "Keesh! O Keesh! Darest thou to kill a man?Behold! This be Kitz-noo, a slave. Strike, O Keesh, strike with thestrength of thy arm!"The boy trembled and waited the stroke. Keesh looked at him, andthoughts of Mr. Brown's higher morality floated through his mind, andstrong upon him was a vision of the leaping flames of Mr. Brown'sparticular brand of hell-fire. The knife fell to the ground, and theboy sighed and went out beyond the firelight with shaking knees. Atthe feet of Gnob sprawled a wolf-dog, which bared its gleaming teethand prepared to spring after the boy. But the shaman ground his footinto the brute's body, and so doing, gave Gnob an idea."And then, O Keesh, what wouldst thou do, should a man do this thingto you?"--as he spoke, Gnob held a ribbon of salmon to White Fang, andwhen the animal attempted to take it, smote him sharply on the nosewith a stick. "And afterward, O Keesh, wouldst thou do thus?"--WhiteFang was cringing back on his belly and fawning to the hand of Gnob."Listen!"--leaning on the arm of Madwan, Gnob had risen to his feet."I am very old, and because I am very old I will tell thee things.Thy father, Keesh, was a mighty man. And he did love the song of thebowstring in battle, and these eyes have beheld him cast a spear tillthe head stood out beyond a man's body. But thou art unlike. Sincethou left the Raven to worship the Wolf, thou art become afraid ofblood, and thou makest thy people afraid. This is not good. Forbehold, when I was a boy, even as Kitz-noo there, there was no whiteman in all the land. But they came, one by one, these white men, tillnow they are many. And they are a restless breed, never content torest by the fire with a full belly and let the morrow bring its ownmeat. A curse was laid upon them, it would seem, and they must work itout in toil and hardship."Keesh was startled. A recollection of a hazy story told by Mr. Brownof one Adam, of old time, came to him, and it seemed that Mr. Brownhad spoken true."So they lay hands upon all they behold, these white men, and they goeverywhere and behold all things. And ever do more follow in theirsteps, so that if nothing be done they will come to possess all theland and there will be no room for the tribes of the Raven. Whereforeit is meet that we fight with them till none are left. Then willwe hold the passes and the land, and perhaps our children and ourchildren's children shall flourish and grow fat. There is a greatstruggle to come, when Wolf and Raven shall grapple; but Keesh willnot fight, nor will he let his people fight. So it is not well that heshould take to him my daughter. Thus have I spoken, I, Gnob, chief ofthe Tana-naw.""But the white men are good and great," Keesh made answer. "The whitemen have taught us many things. The white men have given us blanketsand knives and guns, such as we have never made and never could make.I remember in what manner we lived before they came. I was unbornthen, but I have it from my father. When we went on the hunt wemust creep so close to the moose that a spear-cast would cover thedistance. To-day we use the white man's rifle, and farther away thancan a child's cry be heard. We ate fish and meat and berries--therewas nothing else to eat--and we ate without salt. How many be thereamong you who care to go back to the fish and meat without salt?"It would have sunk home, had not Madwan leaped to his feet ere silencecould come. "And first a question to thee, Keesh. The white man up atthe Big House tells you that it is wrong to kill. Yet do we not knowthat the white men kill? Have we forgotten the great fight on theKoyokuk? or the great fight at Nuklukyeto, where three white menkilled twenty of the Tozikakats? Do you think we no longer rememberthe three men of the Tana-naw that the white man Macklewrath killed?Tell me, O Keesh, why does the Shaman Brown teach you that it is wrongto fight, when all his brothers fight?""Nay, nay, there is no need to answer," Gnob piped, while Keeshstruggled with the paradox. "It is very simple. The Good Man Brownwould hold the Raven tight whilst his brothers pluck the feathers." Heraised his voice. "But so long as there is one Tana-naw to strikea blow, or one maiden to bear a man-child, the Raven shall not beplucked!"Gnob turned to a husky young man across the fire. "And what sayestthou, Makamuk, who art brother to Su-Su?"Makamuk came to his feet. A long face-scar lifted his upper lip intoa perpetual grin which belied the glowing ferocity of his eyes."This day," he began with cunning irrelevance, "I came by the TraderMacklewrath's cabin. And in the door I saw a child laughing at thesun. And the child looked at me with the Trader Macklewrath's eyes,and it was frightened. The mother ran to it and quieted it. The motherwas Ziska, the Thlunget woman."A snarl of rage rose up and drowned his voice, which he stilled byturning dramatically upon Keesh with outstretched arm and accusingfinger."So? You give your women away, you Thlunget, and come to the Tana-nawfor more? But we have need of our women, Keesh; for we must breed men,many men, against the day when the Raven grapples with the Wolf."Through the storm of applause, Gnob's voice shrilled clear. "And thou,Nossabok, who art her favorite brother?"The young fellow was slender and graceful, with the strong aquilinenose and high brows of his type; but from some nervous affliction thelid of one eye drooped at odd times in a suggestive wink. Even as hearose it so drooped and rested a moment against his cheek. But it wasnot greeted with the accustomed laughter. Every face was grave. "I,too, passed by the Trader Macklewrath's cabin," he rippled in soft,girlish tones, wherein there was much of youth and much of his sister."And I saw Indians with the sweat running into their eyes and theirknees shaking with weariness--I say, I saw Indians groaning under thelogs for the store which the Trader Macklewrath is to build. And withmy eyes I saw them chopping wood to keep the Shaman Brown's Big Housewarm through the frost of the long nights. This be squaw work. Nevershall the Tana-naw do the like. We shall be blood brothers to men, notsquaws; and the Thlunget be squaws."A deep silence fell, and all eyes centred on Keesh. He looked abouthim carefully, deliberately, full into the face of each grown man."So," he said passionlessly. And "So," he repeated. Then turned on hisheel without further word and passed out into the darkness.Wading among sprawling babies and bristling wolf-dogs, he threadedthe great camp, and on its outskirts came upon a woman at work by thelight of a fire. With strings of bark stripped from the long roots ofcreeping vines, she was braiding rope for the Fishing. For some time,without speech, he watched her deft hands bringing law and order outof the unruly mass of curling fibres. She was good to look upon,swaying there to her task, strong-limbed, deep-chested, and with hipsmade for motherhood. And the bronze of her face was golden in theflickering light, her hair blue-black, her eyes jet."O Su-Su," he spoke finally, "thou hast looked upon me kindly in thedays that have gone and in the days yet young--""I looked kindly upon thee for that thou wert chief of the Thlunget,"she answered quickly, "and because thou wert big and strong.""Ay--""But that was in the old days of the Fishing," she hastened to add,"before the Shaman Brown came and taught thee ill things and led thyfeet on strange trails.""But I would tell thee the--"She held up one hand in a gesture which reminded him of her father."Nay, I know already the speech that stirs in thy throat, O Keesh, andI make answer now. It so happeneth that the fish of the water and thebeasts of the forest bring forth after their kind. And this is good.Likewise it happeneth to women. It is for them to bring forth theirkind, and even the maiden, while she is yet a maiden, feels the pangof the birth, and the pain of the breast, and the small hands at theneck. And when such feeling is strong, then does each maiden lookabout her with secret eyes for the man--for the man who shall be fitto father her kind. So have I felt. So did I feel when I looked uponthee and found thee big and strong, a hunter and fighter of beasts andmen, well able to win meat when I should eat for two, well able tokeep danger afar off when my helplessness drew nigh. But that wasbefore the day the Shaman Brown came into the land and taught thee--""But it is not right, Su-Su. I have it on good word--""It is not right to kill. I know what thou wouldst say. Then breedthou after thy kind, the kind that does not kill; but come not on suchquest among the Tana-naw. For it is said in the time to come, thatthe Raven shall grapple with the Wolf. I do not know, for this be theaffair of men; but I do know that it is for me to bring forth menagainst that time.""Su-Su," Keesh broke in, "thou must hear me--""A _man_ would beat me with a stick and make me hear," she sneered."But thou ... here!" She thrust a bunch of bark into his hand. "Icannot give thee myself, but this, yes. It looks fittest in thy hands.It is squaw work, so braid away."He flung it from him, the angry blood pounding a muddy path under hisbronze."One thing more," she went on. "There be an old custom which thyfather and mine were not strangers to. When a man falls in battle, hisscalp is carried away in token. Very good. But thou, who have forswornthe Raven, must do more. Thou must bring me, not scalps, but heads,two heads, and then will I give thee, not bark, but a brave-beadedbelt, and sheath, and long Russian knife. Then will I look kindly uponthee once again, and all will be well.""So," the man pondered. "So." Then he turned and passed out throughthe light."Nay, O Keesh!" she called after him. "Not two heads, but three atleast!"       *       *       *       *       *But Keesh remained true to his conversion, lived uprightly, and madehis tribespeople obey the gospel as propounded by the Rev. JacksonBrown. Through all the time of the Fishing he gave no heed to theTana-naw, nor took notice of the sly things which were said, nor ofthe laughter of the women of the many tribes. After the Fishing, Gnoband his people, with great store of salmon, sun-dried and smoke-cured,departed for the Hunting on the head reaches of the Tana-naw. Keeshwatched them go, but did not fail in his attendance at Missionservice, where he prayed regularly and led the singing with his deepbass voice.The Rev. Jackson Brown delighted in that deep bass voice, and becauseof his sterling qualities deemed him the most promising convert.Macklewrath doubted this. He did not believe in the efficacy of theconversion of the heathen, and he was not slow in speaking his mind.But Mr. Brown was a large man, in his way, and he argued it out withsuch convincingness, all of one long fall night, that the trader,driven from position after position, finally announced in desperation,"Knock out my brains with apples, Brown, if I don't become a convertmyself, if Keesh holds fast, true blue, for two years!" Mr. Brownnever lost an opportunity, so he clinched the matter on the spotwith a virile hand-grip, and thenceforth the conduct of Keesh was todetermine the ultimate abiding-place of Macklewrath's soul.But there came news one day, after the winter's rime had settled downover the land sufficiently for travel. A Tana-naw man arrived at theSt. George Mission in quest of ammunition and bringing informationthat Su-Su had set eyes on Nee-Koo, a nervy young hunter who had bidbrilliantly for her by old Gnob's fire. It was at about this time thatthe Rev. Jackson Brown came upon Keesh by the wood-trail which leadsdown to the river. Keesh had his best dogs in the harness, and shovedunder the sled-lashings was his largest and finest pair of snow-shoes."Where goest thou, O Keesh? Hunting?" Mr. Brown asked, falling intothe Indian manner.Keesh looked him steadily in the eyes for a full minute, then startedup his dogs. Then again, turning his deliberate gaze upon themissionary, he answered, "No; I go to hell."       *       *       *       *       *In an open space, striving to burrow into the snow as though forshelter from the appalling desolateness, huddled three dreary lodges.Ringed all about, a dozen paces away, was the sombre forest. Overheadthere was no keen, blue sky of naked space, but a vague, mistycurtain, pregnant with snow, which had drawn between. There was nowind, no sound, nothing but the snow and silence. Nor was there eventhe general stir of life about the camp; for the hunting party had runupon the flank of the caribou herd and the kill had been large. Thus,after the period of fasting had come the plenitude of feasting, andthus, in broad daylight, they slept heavily under their roofs ofmoosehide.By a fire, before one of the lodges, five pairs of snow-shoes stoodon end in their element, and by the fire sat Su-Su. The hood of hersquirrel-skin parka was about her hair, and well drawn up around herthroat; but her hands were unmittened and nimbly at work with needleand sinew, completing the last fantastic design on a belt of leatherfaced with bright scarlet cloth. A dog, somewhere at the rear of oneof the lodges, raised a short, sharp bark, then ceased as abruptly asit had begun. Once, her father, in the lodge at her back, gurgled andgrunted in his sleep. "Bad dreams," she smiled to herself. "He growsold, and that last joint was too much."She placed the last bead, knotted the sinew, and replenished the fire.Then, after gazing long into the flames, she lifted her head to theharsh _crunch-crunch_ of a moccasined foot against the flinty snowgranules. Keesh was at her side, bending slightly forward to a loadwhich he bore upon his back. This was wrapped loosely in a soft-tannedmoosehide, and he dropped it carelessly into the snow and sat down.They looked at each other long and without speech."It is a far fetch, O Keesh," she said at last, "a far fetch from St.George Mission by the Yukon.""Ay," he made answer, absently, his eyes fixed keenly upon the beltand taking note of its girth. "But where is the knife?" he demanded."Here." She drew it from inside her parka and flashed its naked lengthin the firelight. "It is a good knife.""Give it me!" he commanded."Nay, O Keesh," she laughed. "It may be that thou wast not born towear it.""Give it me!" he reiterated, without change of tone. "I was so born."But her eyes, glancing coquettishly past him to the moosehide, saw thesnow about it slowly reddening. "It is blood, Keesh?" she asked."Ay, it is blood. But give me the belt and the long Russian knife."She felt suddenly afraid, but thrilled when he took the belt roughlyfrom her, thrilled to the roughness. She looked at him softly, and wasaware of a pain at the breast and of small hands clutching her throat."It was made for a smaller man," he remarked grimly, drawing in hisabdomen and clasping the buckle at the first hole.Su-Su smiled, and her eyes were yet softer. Again she felt the softhands at her throat. He was good to look upon, and the belt was indeedsmall, made for a smaller man; but what did it matter? She could makemany belts."But the blood?" she asked, urged on by a hope new-born and growing."The blood, Keesh? Is it ... are they ... heads?""Ay.""They must be very fresh, else would the blood be frozen.""Ay, it is not cold, and they be fresh, quite fresh.""Oh, Keesh!" Her face was warm and bright. "And for me?""Ay; for thee."He took hold of a corner of the hide, flirted it open, and rolled theheads out before her."Three," he whispered savagely; "nay, four at least."But she sat transfixed. There they lay--the soft-featured Nee-Koo; thegnarled old face of Gnob; Makamuk, grinning at her with his liftedupper lip; and lastly, Nossabok, his eyelid, up to its old trick,drooped on his girlish cheek in a suggestive wink. There they lay, thefirelight flashing upon and playing over them, and from each of them awidening circle dyed the snow to scarlet.Thawed by the fire, the white crust gave way beneath the head of Gnob,which rolled over like a thing alive, spun around, and came to rest ather feet. But she did not move. Keesh, too, sat motionless, his eyesunblinking, centred steadfastly upon her.Once, in the forest, an overburdened pine dropped its load of snow,and the echoes reverberated hollowly down the gorge; but neitherstirred. The short day had been waning fast, and darkness was wrappinground the camp when White Fang trotted up toward the fire. He pausedto reconnoitre, but not being driven back, came closer. His nose shotswiftly to the side, nostrils a-tremble and bristles rising along thespine; and straight and true, he followed the sudden scent to hismaster's head. He sniffed it gingerly at first and licked the foreheadwith his red lolling tongue. Then he sat abruptly down, pointed hisnose up at the first faint star, and raised the long wolf-howl.This brought Su-Su to herself. She glanced across at Keesh, who hadunsheathed the Russian knife and was watching her intently. His facewas firm and set, and in it she read the law. Slipping back the hoodof her parka, she bared her neck and rose to her feet There she pausedand took a long look about her, at the rimming forest, at the faintstars in the sky, at the camp, at the snow-shoes in the snow--a lastlong comprehensive look at life. A light breeze stirred her hair fromthe side, and for the space of one deep breath she turned her head andfollowed it around until she met it full-faced.Then she thought of her children, ever to be unborn, and she walkedover to Keesh and said, "I am ready."THE DEATH OF LIGOUNBlood for blood, rank for rank.--_Thlinket Code_."Hear now the death of Ligoun--"The speaker ceased, or rather suspended utterance, and gazed upon mewith an eye of understanding. I held the bottle between our eyes andthe fire, indicated with my thumb the depth of the draught, and shovedit over to him; for was he not Palitlum, the Drinker? Many tales hadhe told me, and long had I waited for this scriptless scribe to speakof the things concerning Ligoun; for he, of all men living, knew thesethings best.He tilted back his head with a grunt that slid swiftly into a gurgle,and the shadow of a man's torso, monstrous beneath a huge invertedbottle, wavered and danced on the frown of the cliff at our backs.Palitlum released his lips from the glass with a caressing suck andglanced regretfully up into the ghostly vault of the sky where playedthe wan white light of the summer borealis."It be strange," he said; "cold like water and hot like fire. Tothe drinker it giveth strength, and from the drinker it taketh awaystrength. It maketh old men young, and young men old. To the manwho is weary it leadeth him to get up and go onward, and to the manunweary it burdeneth him into sleep. My brother was possessed of theheart of a rabbit, yet did he drink of it, and forthwith slay four ofhis enemies. My father was like a great wolf, showing his teeth to allmen, yet did he drink of it and was shot through the back, runningswiftly away. It be most strange.""It is 'Three Star,' and a better than what they poison their bellieswith down there," I answered, sweeping my hand, as it were, over theyawning chasm of blackness and down to where the beach fires glintedfar below--tiny jets of flame which gave proportion and reality to thenight.Palitlum sighed and shook his head. "Wherefore I am here with thee."And here he embraced the bottle and me in a look which told moreeloquently than speech of his shameless thirst."Nay," I said, snuggling the bottle in between my knees. "Speak now ofLigoun. Of the 'Three Star' we will hold speech hereafter.""There be plenty, and I am not wearied," he pleaded brazenly. "But thefeel of it on my lips, and I will speak great words of Ligoun and hislast days.""From the drinker it taketh away strength," I mocked, "and to the manunweary it burdeneth him into sleep.""Thou art wise," he rejoined, without anger and pridelessly. "Like allof thy brothers, thou art wise. Waking or sleeping, the 'Three Star'be with thee, yet never have I known thee to drink overlong orovermuch. And the while you gather to you the gold that hides in ourmountains and the fish that swim in our seas; and Palitlum, and thebrothers of Palitlum, dig the gold for thee and net the fish, and areglad to be made glad when out of thy wisdom thou deemest it fit thatthe 'Three Star' should wet our lips.""I was minded to hear of Ligoun," I said impatiently. "The night growsshort, and we have a sore journey to-morrow."I yawned and made as though to rise, but Palitlum betrayed a quickanxiety, and with abruptness began:--"It was Ligoun's desire, in his old age, that peace should be amongthe tribes. As a young man he had been first of the fighting men andchief over the war-chiefs of the Islands and the Passes. All his dayshad been full of fighting. More marks he boasted of bone and lead andiron than any other man. Three wives he had, and for each wife twosons; and the sons, eldest born and last and all died by his side inbattle. Restless as the bald-face, he ranged wide and far--north toUnalaska and the Shallow Sea; south to the Queen Charlottes, ay, evendid he go with the Kakes, it is told, to far Puget Sound, and slay thybrothers in their sheltered houses."But, as I say, in his old age he looked for peace among the tribes.Not that he was become afraid, or overfond of the corner by thefire and the well-filled pot. For he slew with the shrewdness andblood-hunger of the fiercest, drew in his belly to famine with theyoungest, and with the stoutest faced the bitter seas and stingingtrail. But because of his many deeds, and in punishment, a warshipcarried him away, even to thy country, O Hair-Face and Boston Man; andthe years were many ere he came back, and I was grown to somethingmore than a boy and something less than a young man. And Ligoun, beingchildless in his old age, made much of me, and grown wise, gave me ofhis wisdom."'It be good to fight, O Palitlum,' said he. Nay, O Hair-Face, forI was unknown as Palitlum in those days, being called Olo, theEver-Hungry. The drink was to come after. 'It be good to fight,' spokeLigoun, 'but it be foolish. In the Boston Man Country, as I saw withmine eyes, they are not given to fighting one with another, and theybe strong. Wherefore, of their strength, they come against us of theIslands and Passes, and we are as camp smoke and sea mist before them.Wherefore I say it be good to fight, most good, but it be likewisefoolish.'"And because of this, though first always of the fighting men,Ligoun's voice was loudest, ever, for peace. And when he was very old,being greatest of chiefs and richest of men, he gave a potlatch. Neverwas there such a potlatch. Five hundred canoes were lined against theriver bank, and in each canoe there came not less than ten of men andwomen. Eight tribes were there; from the first and oldest man to thelast and youngest babe were they there. And then there were men fromfar-distant tribes, great travellers and seekers who had heard of thepotlatch of Ligoun. And for the length of seven days they filled theirbellies with his meat and drink. Eight thousand blankets did he giveto them, as I well know, for who but I kept the tally and apportionedaccording to degree and rank? And in the end Ligoun was a poor man;but his name was on all men's lips, and other chiefs gritted theirteeth in envy that he should be so great."And so, because there was weight to his words, he counselled peace;and he journeyed to every potlatch and feast and tribal gathering thathe might counsel peace. And so it came that we journeyed together,Ligoun and I, to the great feast given by Niblack, who was chief overthe river Indians of the Skoot, which is not far from the Stickeen.This was in the last days, and Ligoun was very old and very close todeath. He coughed of cold weather and camp smoke, and often the redblood ran from out his mouth till we looked for him to die."'Nay,' he said once at such time; 'it were better that I should diewhen the blood leaps to the knife, and there is a clash of steel andsmell of powder, and men crying aloud what of the cold iron and quicklead.' So, it be plain, O Hair-Face, that his heart was yet strong forbattle."It is very far from the Chilcat to the Skoot, and we were many daysin the canoes. And the while the men bent to the paddles, I sat at thefeet of Ligoun and received the Law. Of small need for me to say theLaw, O Hair-Face, for it be known to me that in this thou art wellskilled. Yet do I speak of the Law of blood for blood, and rank forrank. Also did Ligoun go deeper into the matter, saying:--"'But know this, O Olo, that there be little honor in the killing of aman less than thee. Kill always the man who is greater, and thy honorshall be according to his greatness. But if, of two men, thou killestthe lesser, then is shame thine, for which the very squaws will lifttheir lips at thee. As I say, peace be good; but remember, O Olo, ifkill thou must, that thou killest by the Law.'"It is a way of the Thlinket-folk," Palitlum vouchsafed halfapologetically.And I remembered the gun-fighters and bad men of my own Western land,and was not perplexed at the way of the Thlinket-folk."In time," Palitlum continued, "we came to Chief Niblack and theSkoots. It was a feast great almost as the potlatch of Ligoun. Therewere we of the Chilcat, and the Sitkas, and the Stickeens who areneighbors to the Skoots, and the Wrangels and the Hoonahs. There wereSundowns and Tahkos from Port Houghton, and their neighbors the Awksfrom Douglass Channel; the Naass River people, and the Tongas fromnorth of Dixon, and the Kakes who come from the island calledKupreanoff. Then there were Siwashes from Vancouver, Cassiars from theGold Mountains, Teslin men, and even Sticks from the Yukon Country."It was a mighty gathering. But first of all, there was to be ameeting of the chiefs with Niblack, and a drowning of all enmities inquass. The Russians it was who showed us the way of making quass, forso my father told me,--my father, who got it from his father beforehim. But to this quass had Niblack added many things, such as sugar,flour, dried apples, and hops, so that it was a man's drink, strongand good. Not so good as 'Three Star,' O Hair-Face, yet good."This quass-feast was for the chiefs, and the chiefs only, and therewas a score of them. But Ligoun being very old and very great, it wasgiven that I walk with him that he might lean upon my shoulder andthat I might ease him down when he took his seat and raise him up whenhe arose. At the door of Niblack's house, which was of logs and verybig, each chief, as was the custom, laid down his spear or rifle andhis knife. For as thou knowest, O Hair-Face, strong drink quickens,and old hates flame up, and head and hand are swift to act. But Inoted that Ligoun had brought two knives, the one he left outside thedoor, the other slipped under his blanket, snug to the grip. The otherchiefs did likewise, and I was troubled for what was to come."The chiefs were ranged, sitting, in a big circle about the room. Istood at Ligoun's elbow. In the middle was the barrel of quass, and byit a slave to serve the drink. First, Niblack made oration, with muchshow of friendship and many fine words. Then he gave a sign, and theslave dipped a gourd full of quass and passed it to Ligoun, as wasfit, for his was the highest rank."Ligoun drank it, to the last drop, and I gave him my strength to geton his feet so that he, too, might make oration. He had kind speechfor the many tribes, noted the greatness of Niblack to give such afeast, counselled for peace as was his custom, and at the end saidthat the quass was very good."Then Niblack drank, being next of rank to Ligoun, and after him onechief and another in degree and order. And each spoke friendly wordsand said that the quass was good, till all had drunk. Did I say all?Nay, not all, O Hair-Face. For last of them was one, a lean andcatlike man, young of face, with a quick and daring eye, who drankdarkly, and spat forth upon the ground, and spoke no word."To not say that the quass was good were insult; to spit forth uponthe ground were worse than insult. And this very thing did he do. Hewas known for a chief over the Sticks of the Yukon, and further naughtwas known of him."As I say, it was an insult. But mark this, O Hair-Face: it was aninsult, not to Niblack the feast-giver, but to the man chiefest ofrank who sat among those of the circle. And that man was Ligoun. Therewas no sound. All eyes were upon him to see what he might do. He madeno movement. His withered lips trembled not into speech; nor did anostril quiver, nor an eyelid droop. But I saw that he looked wanand gray, as I have seen old men look of bitter mornings when faminepressed, and the women wailed and the children whimpered, and therewas no meat nor sign of meat. And as the old men looked, so lookedLigoun."There was no sound. It were as a circle of the dead, but that eachchief felt beneath his blanket to make sure, and that each chiefglanced to his neighbor, right and left, with a measuring eye. I wasa stripling; the things I had seen were few; yet I knew it to be themoment one meets but once in all a lifetime."The Stick rose up, with every eye upon him, and crossed the room tillhe stood before Ligoun."'I am Opitsah, the Knife,' he said."But Ligoun said naught, nor looked at him, but gazed unblinking atthe ground."'You are Ligoun,' Opitsah said. 'You have killed many men. I am stillalive.'"And still Ligoun said naught, though he made the sign to me and withmy strength arose and stood upright on his two feet. He was as an oldpine, naked and gray, but still a-shoulder to the frost and storm. Hiseyes were unblinking, and as he had not heard Opitsah, so it seemed hedid not see him."And Opitsah was mad with anger, and danced stiff-legged before him,as men do when they wish to give another shame. And Opitsah sang asong of his own greatness and the greatness of his people, filled withbad words for the Chilcats and for Ligoun. And as he danced and sang,Opitsah threw off his blanket and with his knife drew bright circlesbefore the face of Ligoun. And the song he sang was the Song of theKnife."And there was no other sound, only the singing of Opitsah, and thecircle of chiefs that were as dead, save that the flash of the knifeseemed to draw smouldering fire from their eyes. And Ligoun, also, wasvery still. Yet did he know his death, and was unafraid. And the knifesang closer and yet closer to his face, but his eyes were unblinkingand he swayed not to right or left, or this way or that."And Opitsah drove in the knife, so, twice on the forehead of Ligoun,and the red blood leaped after it. And then it was that Ligoun gave methe sign to bear up under him with my youth that he might walk. And helaughed with a great scorn, full in the face of Opitsah, the Knife.And he brushed Opitsah to the side, as one brushes to the side alow-hanging branch on the trail and passes on."And I knew and understood, for there was but shame in the killing ofOpitsah before the faces of a score of greater chiefs. I rememberedthe Law, and knew Ligoun had it in mind to kill by the Law. And who,chiefest of rank but himself, was there but Niblack? And towardNiblack, leaning on my arm, he walked. And to his other arm, clingingand striking, was Opitsah, too small to soil with his blood the handsof so great a man. And though the knife of Opitsah bit in again andagain, Ligoun noted it not, nor winced. And in this fashion we threewent our way across the room, Niblack sitting in his blanket andfearful of our coming."And now old hates flamed up and forgotten grudges were remembered.Lamuk, a Kake, had had a brother drowned in the bad water of theStickeen, and the Stickeens had not paid in blankets for their badwater, as was the custom to pay. So Lamuk drove straight with hislong knife to the heart of Klok-Kutz the Stickeen. And Katchahookremembered a quarrel of the Naass River people with the Tongas ofnorth of Dixon, and the chief of the Tongas he slew with a pistolwhich made much noise. And the blood-hunger gripped all the men whosat in the circle, and chief slew chief, or was slain, as chance mightbe. Also did they stab and shoot at Ligoun, for whoso killed him wongreat honor and would be unforgotten for the deed. And they were abouthim like wolves about a moose, only they were so many they were intheir own way, and they slew one another to make room. And there wasgreat confusion."But Ligoun went slowly, without haste, as though many years were yetbefore him. It seemed that he was certain he would make his kill, inhis own way, ere they could slay him. And as I say, he went slowly,and knives bit into him, and he was red with blood. And though nonesought after me, who was a mere stripling, yet did the knives find me,and the hot bullets burn me. And still Ligoun leaned his weight on myyouth, and Opitsah struck at him, and we three went forward. And whenwe stood by Niblack, he was afraid, and covered his head with hisblanket. The Skoots were ever cowards."And Goolzug and Kadishan, the one a fish-eater and the other ameat-killer, closed together for the honor of their tribes. And theyraged madly about, and in their battling swung against the knees ofOpitsah, who was overthrown and trampled upon. And a knife, singingthrough the air, smote Skulpin, of the Sitkas, in the throat, and heflung his arms out blindly, reeling, and dragged me down in his fall."And from the ground I beheld Ligoun bend over Niblack, and uncoverthe blanket from his head, and turn up his face to the light. AndLigoun was in no haste. Being blinded with his own blood, he sweptit out of his eyes with the back of his hand, so he might see and besure. And when he was sure that the upturned face was the face ofNiblack, he drew the knife across his throat as one draws a knifeacross the throat of a trembling deer. And then Ligoun stood erect,singing his death-song and swaying gently to and fro. And Skulpin, whohad dragged me down, shot with a pistol from where he lay, and Ligountoppled and fell, as an old pine topples and falls in the teeth of thewind."Palitlum ceased. His eyes, smouldering moodily, were bent upon thefire, and his cheek was dark with blood."And thou, Palitlum?" I demanded. "And thou?""I? I did remember the Law, and I slew Opitsah the Knife, which waswell. And I drew Ligoun's own knife from the throat of Niblack, andslew Skulpin, who had dragged me down. For I was a stripling, and Icould slay any man and it were honor. And further, Ligoun being dead,there was no need for my youth, and I laid about me with his knife,choosing the chiefest of rank that yet remained."Palitlum fumbled under his shirt and drew forth a beaded sheath, andfrom the sheath, a knife. It was a knife home-wrought and crudelyfashioned from a whip-saw file; a knife such as one may find possessedby old men in a hundred Alaskan villages."The knife of Ligoun?" I said, and Palitlum nodded."And for the knife of Ligoun," I said, "will I give thee ten bottlesof 'Three Star.'"But Palitlum looked at me slowly. "Hair-Face, I am weak as water, andeasy as a woman. I have soiled my belly with quass, and hooch, and'Three Star.' My eyes are blunted, my ears have lost their keenness,and my strength has gone into fat. And I am without honor in thesedays, and am called Palitlum, the Drinker. Yet honor was mine at thepotlatch of Niblack, on the Skoot, and the memory of it, and thememory of Ligoun, be dear to me. Nay, didst thou turn the sea itselfinto 'Three Star' and say that it were all mine for the knife, yetwould I keep the knife. I am Palitlum, the Drinker, but I was onceOlo, the Ever-Hungry, who bore up Ligoun with his youth!""Thou art a great man, Palitlum," I said, "and I honor thee."Palitlum reached out his hand."The 'Three Star' between thy knees be mine for the tale I have told,"he said.And as I looked on the frown of the cliff at our backs, I saw theshadow of a man's torso, monstrous beneath a huge inverted bottle.LI WAN, THE FAIR"The sun sinks, Canim, and the heat of the day is gone!"So called Li Wan to the man whose head was hidden beneath thesquirrel-skin robe, but she called softly, as though divided betweenthe duty of waking him and the fear of him awake. For she was afraidof this big husband of hers, who was like unto none of the men she hadknown. The moose-meat sizzled uneasily, and she moved the frying-panto one side of the red embers. As she did so she glanced warily at thetwo Hudson Bay dogs dripping eager slaver from their scarlet tonguesand following her every movement. They were huge, hairy fellows,crouched to leeward in the thin smoke-wake of the fire to escape theswarming myriads of mosquitoes. As Li Wan gazed down the steep towhere the Klondike flung its swollen flood between the hills, one ofthe dogs bellied its way forward like a worm, and with a deft, catlikestroke of the paw dipped a chunk of hot meat out of the pan to theground. But Li Wan caught him from out the tail of her eye, and hesprang back with a snap and a snarl as she rapped him over the nosewith a stick of firewood."Nay, Olo," she laughed, recovering the meat without removing her eyefrom him. "Thou art ever hungry, and for that thy nose leads thee intoendless troubles."But the mate of Olo joined him, and together they defied the woman.The hair on their backs and shoulders bristled in recurrent wavesof anger, and the thin lips writhed and lifted into ugly wrinkles,exposing the flesh-tearing fangs, cruel and menacing. Their very nosesserrulated and shook in brute passion, and they snarled as the wolvessnarl, with all the hatred and malignity of the breed impelling themto spring upon the woman and drag her down."And thou, too, Bash, fierce as thy master and never at peace with thehand that feeds thee! This is not thy quarrel, so that be thine! andthat!"As she cried, she drove at them with the firewood, but they avoidedthe blows and refused to retreat. They separated and approached herfrom either side, crouching low and snarling. Li Wan had struggledwith the wolf-dog for mastery from the time she toddled among theskin-bales of the teepee, and she knew a crisis was at hand. Bashhad halted, his muscles stiff and tense for the spring; Olo was yetcreeping into striking distance.Grasping two blazing sticks by the charred ends, she faced the brutes.The one held back, but Bash sprang, and she met him in mid-air withthe flaming weapon. There were sharp yelps of pain and swift odors ofburning hair and flesh as he rolled in the dirt and the woman groundthe fiery embers into his mouth. Snapping wildly, he flung himselfsidewise out of her reach and in a frenzy of fear scrambled forsafety. Olo, on the other side, had begun his retreat, when Li Wanreminded him of her primacy by hurling a heavy stick of wood into hisribs. Then the pair retreated under a rain of firewood, and on theedge of the camp fell to licking their wounds and whimpering by turnsand snarling.Li Wan blew the ashes off the meat and sat down again. Her heart hadnot gone up a beat, and the incident was already old, for this wasthe routine of life. Canim had not stirred during the disorder, butinstead had set up a lusty snoring."Come, Canim!" she called. "The heat of the day is gone, and the trailwaits for our feet."The squirrel-skin robe was agitated and cast aside by a brown arm.Then the man's eyelids fluttered and drooped again."His pack is heavy," she thought, "and he is tired with the work ofthe morning."A mosquito stung her on the neck, and she daubed the unprotected spotwith wet clay from a ball she had convenient to hand. All morning,toiling up the divide and enveloped in a cloud of the pests, the manand woman had plastered themselves with the sticky mud, which, dryingin the sun, covered their faces with masks of clay. These masks,broken in divers places by the movement of the facial muscles, hadconstantly to be renewed, so that the deposit was irregular of depthand peculiar of aspect.Li Wan shook Canim gently but with persistence till he roused andsat up. His first glance was to the sun, and after consulting thecelestial timepiece he hunched over to the fire and fell-to ravenouslyon the meat. He was a large Indian fully six feet in height,deep-chested and heavy-muscled, and his eyes were keener and vestedwith greater mental vigor than the average of his kind. The lines ofwill had marked his face deeply, and this, coupled with a sternnessand primitiveness, advertised a native indomitability, unswerving ofpurpose, and prone, when thwarted, to sullen cruelty."To-morrow, Li Wan, we shall feast." He sucked a marrow-bone cleanand threw it to the dogs. "We shall have _flapjacks_ fried in _bacongrease_, and _sugar_, which is more toothsome--""_Flapjacks_?" she questioned, mouthing the word curiously."Ay," Canim answered with superiority; "and I shall teach you new waysof cookery. Of these things I speak you are ignorant, and of many morethings besides. You have lived your days in a little corner of theearth and know nothing. But I,"--he straightened himself and looked ather pridefully,--"I am a great traveller, and have been all places,even among the white people, and I am versed in their ways, and inthe ways of many peoples. I am not a tree, born to stand in one placealways and know not what there be over the next hill; for I am Canim,the Canoe, made to go here and there and to journey and quest up anddown the length and breadth of the world."She bowed her head humbly. "It is true. I have eaten fish and meat andberries all my days and lived in a little corner of the earth. Nor didI dream the world was so large until you stole me from my people andI cooked and carried for you on the endless trails." She looked up athim suddenly. "Tell me, Canim, does this trail ever end?""Nay," he answered. "My trail is like the world; it never ends. Mytrail _is_ the world, and I have travelled it since the time my legscould carry me, and I shall travel it until I die. My father and mymother may be dead, but it is long since I looked upon them, and Ido not care. My tribe is like your tribe. It stays in the oneplace--which is far from here,--but I care naught for my tribe, for Iam Canim, the Canoe!""And must I, Li Wan, who am weary, travel always your trail until Idie?""You, Li Wan, are my wife, and the wife travels the husband's trailwheresoever it goes. It is the law. And were it not the law, yet wouldit be the law of Canim, who is lawgiver unto himself and his."She bowed her head again, for she knew no other law than that man wasthe master of woman."Be not in haste," Canim cautioned her, as she began to strap themeagre camp outfit to her pack. "The sun is yet hot, and the trailleads down and the footing is good."She dropped her work obediently and resumed her seat.Canim regarded her with speculative interest. "You do not squat onyour hams like other women," he remarked."No," she answered. "It never came easy. It tires me, and I cannottake my rest that way.""And why is it your feet point not straight before you?""I do not know, save that they are unlike the feet of other women."A satisfied light crept into his eyes, but otherwise he gave no sign."Like other women, your hair is black; but have you ever noticed thatit is soft and fine, softer and finer than the hair of other women?""I have noticed," she answered shortly, for she was not pleased atsuch cold analysis of her sex-deficiencies."It is a year, now, since I took you from your people," he went on,"and you are nigh as shy and afraid of me as when first I looked uponyou. How does this thing be?"Li Wan shook her head. "I am afraid of you, Canim, you are so big andstrange. And further, before you looked upon me even, I was afraid ofall the young men. I do not know ... I cannot say ... only it seemed,somehow, as though I should not be for them, as though ...""Ay," he encouraged, impatient at her faltering."As though they were not my kind.""Not your kind?" he demanded slowly. "Then what is your kind?""I do not know, I ..." She shook her head in a bewildered manner. "Icannot put into words the way I felt. It was strangeness in me. I wasunlike other maidens, who sought the young men slyly. I could notcare for the young men that way. It would have been a great wrong, itseemed, and an ill deed.""What is the first thing you remember?" Canim asked with abruptirrelevance."Pow-Wah-Kaan, my mother.""And naught else before Pow-Wah-Kaan?""Naught else."But Canim, holding her eyes with his, searched her secret soul and sawit waver."Think, and think hard, Li Wan!" he threatened.She stammered, and her eyes were piteous and pleading, but his willdominated her and wrung from her lips the reluctant speech."But it was only dreams, Canim, ill dreams of childhood, shadows ofthings not real, visions such as the dogs, sleeping in the sun-warmth,behold and whine out against.""Tell me," he commanded, "of the things before Pow-Wah-Kaan, yourmother.""They are forgotten memories," she protested. "As a child I dreamedawake, with my eyes open to the day, and when I spoke of the strangethings I saw I was laughed at, and the other children were afraidand drew away from me. And when I spoke of the things I saw toPow-Wah-Kaan, she chided me and said they were evil; also she beat me.It was a sickness, I believe, like the falling-sickness that comes toold men; and in time I grew better and dreamed no more. And now ...I cannot remember"--she brought her hand in a confused manner to herforehead--"they are there, somewhere, but I cannot find them,only ...""Only," Canim repeated, holding her."Only one thing. But you will laugh at its foolishness, it is sounreal.""Nay, Li Wan. Dreams are dreams. They may be memories of other liveswe have lived. I was once a moose. I firmly believe I was once amoose, what of the things I have seen in dreams, and heard."Strive as he would to hide it, a growing anxiety was manifest, but LiWan, groping after the words with which to paint the picture, took noheed."I see a snow-tramped space among the trees," she began, "and acrossthe snow the sign of a man where he has dragged himself heavily onhand and knee. And I see, too, the man in the snow, and it seems I amvery close to him when I look. He is unlike real men, for he has hairon his face, much hair, and the hair of his face and head is yellowlike the summer coat of the weasel. His eyes are closed, but they openand search about. They are blue like the sky, and look into mine andsearch no more. And his hand moves, slow, as from weakness, andI feel ...""Ay," Canim whispered hoarsely. "You feel--?""No! no!" she cried in haste. "I feel nothing. Did I say 'feel'? I didnot mean it. It could not be that I should mean it. I see, and I seeonly, and that is all I see--a man in the snow, with eyes like thesky, and hair like the weasel. I have seen it many times, and alwaysit is the same--a man in the snow--""And do you see yourself?" he asked, leaning forward and regarding herintently. "Do you ever see yourself and the man in the snow?""Why should I see myself? Am I not real?"His muscles relaxed and he sank back, an exultant satisfaction in hiseyes which he turned from her so that she might not see."I will tell you, Li Wan," he spoke decisively; "you were a littlebird in some life before, a little moose-bird, when you saw thisthing, and the memory of it is with you yet. It is not strange. I wasonce a moose, and my father's father afterward became a bear--so saidthe shaman, and the shaman cannot lie. Thus, on the Trail of the Godswe pass from life to life, and the gods know only and understand.Dreams and the shadows of dreams be memories, nothing more, and thedog, whining asleep in the sun-warmth, doubtless sees and remembersthings gone before. Bash, there, was a warrior once. I do firmlybelieve he was once a warrior."Canim tossed a bone to the brute and got upon his feet. "Come, let usbegone. The sun is yet hot, but it will get no cooler.""And these white people, what are they like?" Li Wan made bold to ask."Like you and me," he answered, "only they are less dark of skin. Youwill be among them ere the day is dead."Canim lashed the sleeping-robe to his one-hundred-and-fifty-poundpack, smeared his face with wet clay, and sat down to rest till Li Wanhad finished loading the dogs. Olo cringed at sight of the club in herhand, and gave no trouble when the bundle of forty pounds and odd wasstrapped upon him. But Bash was aggrieved and truculent, and could notforbear to whimper and snarl as he was forced to receive the burden.He bristled his back and bared his teeth as she drew the straps tight,the while throwing all the malignancy of his nature into the glancesshot at her sideways and backward. And Canim chuckled and said, "Did Inot say he was once a very great warrior?""These furs will bring a price," he remarked as he adjusted hishead-strap and lifted his pack clear of the ground. "A big price. Thewhite men pay well for such goods, for they have no time to hunt andare soft to the cold. Soon shall we feast, Li Wan, as you have feastednever in all the lives you have lived before."She grunted acknowledgment and gratitude for her lord's condescension,slipped into the harness, and bent forward to the load."The next time I am born, I would be born a white man," he added, andswung off down the trail which dived into the gorge at his feet.The dogs followed close at his heels, and Li Wan brought up the rear.But her thoughts were far away, across the Ice Mountains to the east,to the little corner of the earth where her childhood had been lived.Ever as a child, she remembered, she had been looked upon as strange,as one with an affliction. Truly she had dreamed awake and beenscolded and beaten for the remarkable visions she saw, till, after atime, she had outgrown them. But not utterly. Though they troubled herno more waking, they came to her in her sleep, grown woman that shewas, and many a night of nightmare was hers, filled with flutteringshapes, vague and meaningless. The talk with Canim had excited her,and down all the twisted slant of the divide she harked back to themocking fantasies of her dreams."Let us take breath," Canim said, when they had tapped midway the bedof the main creek.He rested his pack on a jutting rock, slipped the head-strap, and satdown. Li Wan joined him, and the dogs sprawled panting on the groundbeside them. At their feet rippled the glacial drip of the hills, butit was muddy and discolored, as if soiled by some commotion of theearth."Why is this?" Li Wan asked."Because of the white men who work in the ground. Listen!" He held uphis hand, and they heard the ring of pick and shovel, and the sound ofmen's voices. "They are made mad by _gold_, and work without ceasingthat they may find it. _Gold?_ It is yellow and comes from the ground,and is considered of great value. It is also a measure of price."But Li Wan's roving eyes had called her attention from him. A fewyards below and partly screened by a clump of young spruce, the tieredlogs of a cabin rose to meet its overhanging roof of dirt. A thrillran through her, and all her dream-phantoms roused up and stirredabout uneasily."Canim," she whispered in an agony of apprehension. "Canim, what isthat?""The white man's teepee, in which he eats and sleeps."She eyed it wistfully, grasping its virtues at a glance and thrillingagain at the unaccountable sensations it aroused. "It must be verywarm in time of frost," she said aloud, though she felt that she mustmake strange sounds with her lips.She felt impelled to utter them, but did not, and the next instantCanim said, "It is called a _cabin_."Her heart gave a great leap. The sounds! the very sounds! She lookedabout her in sudden awe. How should she know that strange word beforeever she heard it? What could be the matter? And then with a shock,half of fear and half of delight, she realized that for the first timein her life there had been sanity and significance in the promptingsof her dreams."_Cabin_" she repeated to herself. "_Cabin._" An incoherent flood ofdream-stuff welled up and up till her head was dizzy and herheart seemed bursting. Shadows, and looming bulks of things, andunintelligible associations fluttered and whirled about, and shestrove vainly with her consciousness to grasp and hold them. Forshe felt that there, in that welter of memories, was the key of themystery; could she but grasp and hold it, all would be clear andplain--O Canim! O Pow-Wah-Kaan! O shades and shadows, what was that?She turned to Canim, speechless and trembling, the dream-stuff in mad,overwhelming riot. She was sick and fainting, and could only listento the ravishing sounds which proceeded from the cabin in a wonderfulrhythm."Hum, _fiddle,_" Canim vouchsafed.But she did not hear him, for in the ecstasy she was experiencing,it seemed at last that all things were coming clear. Now! now! shethought. A sudden moisture swept into her eyes, and the tears trickleddown her cheeks. The mystery was unlocking, but the faintness wasoverpowering her. If only she could hold herself long enough! Ifonly--but the landscape bent and crumpled up, and the hills swayedback and forth across the sky as she sprang upright and screamed,"_Daddy! Daddy!_" Then the sun reeled, and darkness smote her, and shepitched forward limp and headlong among the rocks.Canim looked to see if her neck had been broken by the heavy pack,grunted his satisfaction, and threw water upon her from the creek. Shecame to slowly, with choking sobs, and sat up."It is not good, the hot sun on the head," he ventured.And she answered, "No, it is not good, and the pack bore upon mehard.""We shall camp early, so that you may sleep long and win strength," hesaid gently. "And if we go now, we shall be the quicker to bed."Li Wan said nothing, but tottered to her feet in obedience and stirredup the dogs. She took the swing of his pace mechanically, and followedhim past the cabin, scarce daring to breathe. But no sounds issuedforth, though the door was open and smoke curling upward from thesheet-iron stovepipe.They came upon a man in the bend of the creek, white of skin and blueof eye, and for a moment Li Wan saw the other man in the snow. But shesaw dimly, for she was weak and tired from what she had undergone.Still, she looked at him curiously, and stopped with Canim to watchhim at his work. He was washing gravel in a large pan, with acircular, tilting movement; and as they looked, giving a deft flirt,he flashed up the yellow gold in a broad streak across the bottom ofthe pan."Very rich, this creek," Canim told her, as they went on. "Sometime Iwill find such a creek, and then I shall be a big man."Cabins and men grew more plentiful, till they came to where the mainportion of the creek was spread out before them. It was the scene of avast devastation. Everywhere the earth was torn and rent as though bya Titan's struggles. Where there were no upthrown mounds of gravel,great holes and trenches yawned, and chasms where the thick rime ofthe earth had been peeled to bed-rock. There was no worn channel forthe creek, and its waters, dammed up, diverted, flying through the airon giddy flumes, trickling into sinks and low places, and raised byhuge water-wheels, were used and used again a thousand times. Thehills had been stripped of their trees, and their raw sides gored andperforated by great timber-slides and prospect holes. And over all,like a monstrous race of ants, was flung an army of men--mud-covered,dirty, dishevelled men, who crawled in and out of the holes of theirdigging, crept like big bugs along the flumes, and toiled and sweatedat the gravel-heaps which they kept in constant unrest--men, as far asthe eye could see, even to the rims of the hilltops, digging, tearing,and scouring the face of nature.Li Wan was appalled at the tremendous upheaval. "Truly, these men aremad," she said to Canim."Small wonder. The gold they dig after is a great thing," he replied."It is the greatest thing in the world."For hours they threaded the chaos of greed, Canim eagerly intent,Li Wan weak and listless. She knew she had been on the vergeof disclosure, and she felt that she was still on the verge ofdisclosure, but the nervous strain she had undergone had tired her,and she passively waited for the thing, she knew not what, to happen.From every hand her senses snatched up and conveyed to her innumerableimpressions, each of which became a dull excitation to her jadedimagination. Somewhere within her, responsive notes were answering tothe things without, forgotten and undreamed-of correspondences werebeing renewed; and she was aware of it in an incurious way, and hersoul was troubled, but she was not equal to the mental exultationnecessary to transmute and understand. So she plodded wearily onat the heels of her lord, content to wait for that which she knew,somewhere, somehow, must happen.After undergoing the mad bondage of man, the creek finally returned toits ancient ways, all soiled and smirched from its toil, and coiledlazily among the broad flats and timbered spaces where the valleywidened to its mouth. Here the "pay" ran out, and men were loth toloiter with the lure yet beyond. And here, as Li Wan paused to prodOlo with her staff, she heard the mellow silver of a woman's laughter.Before a cabin sat a woman, fair of skin and rosy as a child, dimplingwith glee at the words of another woman in the doorway. But the womanwho sat shook about her great masses of dark, wet hair which yieldedup its dampness to the warm caresses of the sun.For an instant Li Wan stood transfixed. Then she was aware of ablinding flash, and a snap, as though something gave way; and thewoman before the cabin vanished, and the cabin and the tall sprucetimber, and the jagged sky-line, and Li Wan saw another woman, in theshine of another sun, brushing great masses of black hair, andsinging as she brushed. And Li Wan heard the words of the song, andunderstood, and was a child again. She was smitten with a vision,wherein all the troublesome dreams merged and became one, and shapesand shadows took up their accustomed round, and all was clear andplain and real. Many pictures jostled past, strange scenes, and trees,and flowers, and people; and she saw them and knew them all."When you were a little bird, a little moose-bird," Canim said, hiseyes upon her and burning into her."When I was a little moose-bird," she whispered, so faint and low hescarcely heard. And she knew she lied, as she bent her head to thestrap and took the swing of the trail.And such was the strangeness of it, the real now became unreal. Themile tramp and the pitching of camp by the edge of the stream seemedlike a passage in a nightmare. She cooked the meat, fed the dogs, andunlashed the packs as in a dream, and it was not until Canim began tosketch his next wandering that she became herself again."The Klondike runs into the Yukon," he was saying; "a mighty river,mightier than the Mackenzie, of which you know. So we go, you and I,down to Fort o' Yukon. With dogs, in time of winter, it is twentysleeps. Then we follow the Yukon away into the west--one hundredsleeps, two hundred--I have never heard. It is very far. And then wecome to the sea. You know nothing of the sea, so let me tell you. Asthe lake is to the island, so the sea is to the land; all the riversrun to it, and it is without end. I have seen it at Hudson Bay; I haveyet to see it in Alaska. And then we may take a great canoe upon thesea, you and I, Li Wan, or we may follow the land into the south manya hundred sleeps. And after that I do not know, save that I am Canim,the Canoe, wanderer and far-journeyer over the earth!"She sat and listened, and fear ate into her heart as she pondered overthis plunge into the illimitable wilderness. "It is a weary way," wasall she said, head bowed on knee in resignation.Then it was a splendid thought came to her, and at the wonder of itshe was all aglow. She went down to the stream and washed the driedclay from her face. When the ripples died away, she stared long at hermirrored features; but sun and weather-beat had done their work, and,what of roughness and bronze, her skin was not soft and dimpled as achild's. But the thought was still splendid and the glow unabated asshe crept in beside her husband under the sleeping-robe.She lay awake, staring up at the blue of the sky and waiting for Canimto sink into the first deep sleep. When this came about, she wormedslowly and carefully away, tucked the robe around him, and stood up.At her second step, Bash growled savagely. She whispered persuasivelyto him and glanced at the man. Canim was snoring profoundly. Then sheturned, and with swift, noiseless feet sped up the back trail.Mrs. Evelyn Van Wyck was just preparing for bed. Bored by the dutiesput upon her by society, her wealth, and widowed blessedness, she hadjourneyed into the Northland and gone to housekeeping in a cosey cabinon the edge of the diggings. Here, aided and abetted by her friend andcompanion, Myrtle Giddings, she played at living close to the soil,and cultivated the primitive with refined abandon.She strove to get away from the generations of culture and parlorselection, and sought the earth-grip her ancestors had forfeited.Likewise she induced mental states which she fondly believed toapproximate those of the stone-folk, and just now, as she put up herhair for the pillow, she was indulging her fancy with a palaeolithicwooing. The details consisted principally of cave-dwellings andcracked marrow-bones, intersprinkled with fierce carnivora, hairymammoths, and combats with rude flaked knives of flint; but thesensations were delicious. And as Evelyn Van Wyck fled throughthe sombre forest aisles before the too arduous advances of herslant-browed, skin-clad wooer, the door of the cabin opened, withoutthe courtesy of a knock, and a skin-clad woman, savage and primitive,came in."Mercy!"With a leap that would have done credit to a cave-woman, Miss Giddingslanded in safety behind the table. But Mrs. Van Wyck held her ground.She noticed that the intruder was laboring under a strong excitement,and cast a swift glance backward to assure herself that the way wasclear to the bunk, where the big Colt's revolver lay beneath a pillow."Greeting, O Woman of the Wondrous Hair," said Li Wan.But she said it in her own tongue, the tongue spoken in but a littlecorner of the earth, and the women did not understand."Shall I go for help?" Miss Giddings quavered."The poor creature is harmless, I think," Mrs. Van Wyck replied. "Andjust look at her skin-clothes, ragged and trail-worn and all that.They are certainly unique. I shall buy them for my collection. Get mysack, Myrtle, please, and set up the scales."Li Wan followed the shaping of the lips, but the words wereunintelligible, and then, and for the first time, she realized, ina moment of suspense and indecision, that there was no medium ofcommunication between them.And at the passion of her dumbness she cried out, with arms stretchedwide apart, "O Woman, thou art sister of mine!"The tears coursed down her cheeks as she yearned toward them, and thebreak in her voice carried the sorrow she could not utter. But MissGiddings was trembling, and even Mrs. Van Wyck was disturbed."I would live as you live. Thy ways are my ways, and our ways be one.My husband is Canim, the Canoe, and he is big and strange, and I amafraid. His trail is all the world and never ends, and I am weary. Mymother was like you, and her hair was as thine, and her eyes. And lifewas soft to me then, and the sun warm."She knelt humbly, and bent her head at Mrs. Van Wyck's feet. But Mrs.Van Wyck drew away, frightened at her vehemence.Li Wan stood up, panting for speech. Her dumb lips could notarticulate her overmastering consciousness of kind."Trade? you trade?" Mrs. Van Wyck questioned, slipping, after thefashion of the superior peoples, into pigeon tongue.She touched Li Wan's ragged skins to indicate her choice, and pouredseveral hundreds of gold into the blower. She stirred the dust aboutand trickled its yellow lustre temptingly through her fingers. But LiWan saw only the fingers, milk-white and shapely, tapering daintilyto the rosy, jewel-like nails. She placed her own hand alongside, allwork-worn and calloused, and wept.Mrs. Van Wyck misunderstood. "Gold," she encouraged. "Good gold! Youtrade? You changee for changee?" And she laid her hand again on LiWan's skin garments."How much? You sell? How much?" she persisted, running her handagainst the way of the hair so that she might make sure of thesinew-thread seam.But Li Wan was deaf as well, and the woman's speech was withoutsignificance. Dismay at her failure sat upon her. How could sheidentify herself with these women? For she knew they were of the onebreed, blood-sisters among men and the women of men. Her eyes rovedwildly about the interior, taking in the soft draperies hangingaround, the feminine garments, the oval mirror, and the dainty toiletaccessories beneath. And the things haunted her, for she had seen likethings before; and as she looked at them her lips involuntarily formedsounds which her throat trembled to utter. Then a thought flashed uponher, and she steadied herself. She must be calm. She must controlherself, for there must be no misunderstanding this time, orelse,--and she shook with a storm of suppressed tears and steadiedherself again.She put her hand on the table. "_Table_," she clearly and distinctlyenunciated. "_Table_," she repeated.She looked at Mrs. Van Wyck, who nodded approbation. Li Wan exulted,but brought her will to bear and held herself steady. "_Stove_" shewent on. "_Stove_."And at every nod of Mrs. Van Wyck, Li Wan's excitement mounted.Now stumbling and halting, and again in feverish haste, as therecrudescence of forgotten words was fast or slow, she moved about thecabin, naming article after article. And when she paused finally,it was in triumph, with body erect and head thrown back, expectant,waiting."Cat," Mrs. Van Wyck, laughing, spelled out in kindergarten fashion."I--see--the--cat--catch--the--rat."Li Wan nodded her head seriously. They were beginning to understandher at last, these women. The blood flushed darkly under her bronze atthe thought, and she smiled and nodded her head still more vigorously.Mrs. Van Wyck turned to her companion. "Received a smattering ofmission education somewhere, I fancy, and has come to show it off.""Of course," Miss Giddings tittered. "Little fool! We shall lose oursleep with her vanity.""All the same I want that jacket. If it _is_ old, the workmanshipis good--a most excellent specimen." She returned to her visitor."Changee for changee? You! Changee for changee? How much? Eh? Howmuch, you?""Perhaps she'd prefer a dress or something," Miss Giddings suggested.Mrs. Van Wyck went up to Li Wan and made signs that she would exchangeher wrapper for the jacket. And to further the transaction, she tookLi Wan's hand and placed it amid the lace and ribbons of the flowingbosom, and rubbed the fingers back and forth so they might feel thetexture. But the jewelled butterfly which loosely held the fold inplace was insecurely fastened, and the front of the gown slipped tothe side, exposing a firm white breast, which had never known thelip-clasp of a child.Mrs. Van Wyck coolly repaired the mischief; but Li Wan uttered a loudcry, and ripped and tore at her skin-shirt till her own breast showedfirm and white as Evelyn Van Wyck's. Murmuring inarticulately andmaking swift signs, she strove to establish the kinship."A half-breed," Mrs. Van Wyck commented. "I thought so from her hair."Miss Giddings made a fastidious gesture. "Proud of her father's whiteskin. It's beastly! Do give her something, Evelyn, and make her go."But the other woman sighed. "Poor creature, I wish I could dosomething for her."A heavy foot crunched the gravel without. Then the cabin door swungwide, and Canim stalked in. Miss Giddings saw a vision of suddendeath, and screamed; but Mrs. Van Wyck faced him composedly."What do you want?" she demanded."How do?" Canim answered suavely and directly, pointing at the sametime to Li Wan. "Um my wife."He reached out for her, but she waved him back."Speak, Canim! Tell them that I am--""Daughter of Pow-Wah-Kaan? Nay, of what is it to them that theyshould care? Better should I tell them thou art an ill wife, given tocreeping from thy husband's bed when sleep is heavy in his eyes."Again he reached out for her, but she fled away from him to Mrs. VanWyck, at whose feet she made frenzied appeal, and whose knees shetried to clasp. But the lady stepped back and gave permission with hereyes to Canim. He gripped Li Wan under the shoulders and raised her toher feet. She fought with him, in a madness of despair, till his chestwas heaving with the exertion, and they had reeled about over half theroom."Let me go, Canim," she sobbed.But he twisted her wrist till she ceased to struggle. "The memories ofthe little moose-bird are overstrong and make trouble," he began."I know! I know!" she broke in. "I see the man in the snow, and asnever before I see him crawl on hand and knee. And I, who am a littlechild, am carried on his back. And this is before Pow-Wah-Kaan and thetime I came to live in a little corner of the earth.""You know," he answered, forcing her toward the door; "but you will gowith me down the Yukon and forget.""Never shall I forget! So long as my skin is white shall I remember!"She clutched frantically at the door-post and looked a last appeal toMrs. Evelyn Van Wyck."Then will I teach thee to forget, I, Canim, the Canoe!"As he spoke he pulled her fingers clear and passed out with her uponthe trail.THE LEAGUE OF THE OLD MENAt the Barracks a man was being tried for his life. He was an old man,a native from the Whitefish River, which empties into the Yukon belowLake Le Barge. All Dawson was wrought up over the affair, and likewisethe Yukon-dwellers for a thousand miles up and down. It has been thecustom of the land-robbing and sea-robbing Anglo-Saxon to give the lawto conquered peoples, and ofttimes this law is harsh. But in thecase of Imber the law for once seemed inadequate and weak. In themathematical nature of things, equity did not reside in the punishmentto be accorded him. The punishment was a foregone conclusion, therecould be no doubt of that; and though it was capital, Imber had butone life, while the tale against him was one of scores.In fact, the blood of so many was upon his hands that the killingsattributed to him did not permit of precise enumeration. Smoking apipe by the trail-side or lounging around the stove, men made roughestimates of the numbers that had perished at his hand. They had beenwhites, all of them, these poor murdered people, and they had beenslain singly, in pairs, and in parties. And so purposeless and wantonhad been these killings, that they had long been a mystery to themounted police, even in the time of the captains, and later, when thecreeks realized, and a governor came from the Dominion to make theland pay for its prosperity.But more mysterious still was the coming of Imber to Dawson to givehimself up. It was in the late spring, when the Yukon was growling andwrithing under its ice, that the old Indian climbed painfully up thebank from the river trail and stood blinking on the main street. Menwho had witnessed his advent, noted that he was weak and tottery, andthat he staggered over to a heap of cabin-logs and sat down. He satthere a full day, staring straight before him at the unceasing tide ofwhite men that flooded past. Many a head jerked curiously to the sideto meet his stare, and more than one remark was dropped anent the oldSiwash with so strange a look upon his face. No end of men rememberedafterward that they had been struck by his extraordinary figure, andforever afterward prided themselves upon their swift discernment ofthe unusual.But it remained for Dickensen, Little Dickensen, to be the hero of theoccasion. Little Dickensen had come into the land with great dreamsand a pocketful of cash; but with the cash the dreams vanished, andto earn his passage back to the States he had accepted a clericalposition with the brokerage firm of Holbrook and Mason. Acrossthe street from the office of Holbrook and Mason was the heap ofcabin-logs upon which Imber sat. Dickensen looked out of the windowat him before he went to lunch; and when he came back from lunch helooked out of the window, and the old Siwash was still there.Dickensen continued to look out of the window, and he, too, foreverafterward prided himself upon his swiftness of discernment. He was aromantic little chap, and he likened the immobile old heathen to thegenius of the Siwash race, gazing calm-eyed upon the hosts of theinvading Saxon. The hours swept along, but Imber did not vary hisposture, did not by a hair's-breadth move a muscle; and Dickensenremembered the man who once sat upright on a sled in the main streetwhere men passed to and fro. They thought the man was resting, butlater, when they touched him, they found him stiff and cold, frozen todeath in the midst of the busy street. To undouble him, that he mightfit into a coffin, they had been forced to lug him to a fire and thawhim out a bit. Dickensen shivered at the recollection.Later on, Dickensen went out on the sidewalk to smoke a cigar and cooloff; and a little later Emily Travis happened along. Emily Travis wasdainty and delicate and rare, and whether in London or Klondike shegowned herself as befitted the daughter of a millionnaire miningengineer. Little Dickensen deposited his cigar on an outside windowledge where he could find it again, and lifted his hat.They chatted for ten minutes or so, when Emily Travis, glancing pastDickensen's shoulder, gave a startled little scream. Dickensen turnedabout to see, and was startled, too. Imber had crossed the streetand was standing there, a gaunt and hungry-looking shadow, his gazeriveted upon the girl."What do you want?" Little Dickensen demanded, tremulously plucky.Imber grunted and stalked up to Emily Travis. He looked her over,keenly and carefully, every square inch of her. Especially did heappear interested in her silky brown hair, and in the color of hercheek, faintly sprayed and soft, like the downy bloom of a butterflywing. He walked around her, surveying her with the calculating eye ofa man who studies the lines upon which a horse or a boat is builded.In the course of his circuit the pink shell of her ear came betweenhis eye and the westering sun, and he stopped to contemplate itsrosy transparency. Then he returned to her face and looked long andintently into her blue eyes. He grunted and laid a hand on her armmidway between the shoulder and elbow. With his other hand he liftedher forearm and doubled it back. Disgust and wonder showed in hisface, and he dropped her arm with a contemptuous grunt. Then hemuttered a few guttural syllables, turned his back upon her, andaddressed himself to Dickensen.Dickensen could not understand his speech, and Emily Travis laughed.Imber turned from one to the other, frowning, but both shook theirheads. He was about to go away, when she called out:"Oh, Jimmy! Come here!"Jimmy came from the other side of the street. He was a big, hulkingIndian clad in approved white-man style, with an Eldorado king'ssombrero on his head. He talked with Imber, haltingly, with throatyspasms. Jimmy was a Sitkan, possessed of no more than a passingknowledge of the interior dialects."Him Whitefish man," he said to Emily Travis. "Me savve um talk novery much. Him want to look see chief white man.""The Governor," suggested Dickensen.Jimmy talked some more with the Whitefish man, and his face went graveand puzzled."I t'ink um want Cap'n Alexander," he explained. "Him say um killwhite man, white woman, white boy, plenty kill um white people. Himwant to die.""Insane, I guess," said Dickensen."What you call dat?" queried Jimmy.Dickensen thrust a finger figuratively inside his head and imparted arotary motion thereto."Mebbe so, mebbe so," said Jimmy, returning to Imber, who stilldemanded the chief man of the white men.A mounted policeman (unmounted for Klondike service) joined the groupand heard Imber's wish repeated. He was a stalwart young fellow,broad-shouldered, deep-chested, legs cleanly built and stretched wideapart, and tall though Imber was, he towered above him by half a head.His eyes were cool, and gray, and steady, and he carried himself withthe peculiar confidence of power that is bred of blood andtradition. His splendid masculinity was emphasized by his excessiveboyishness,--he was a mere lad,--and his smooth cheek promised a blushas willingly as the cheek of a maid.Imber was drawn to him at once. The fire leaped into his eyes at sightof a sabre slash that scarred his cheek. He ran a withered hand downthe young fellow's leg and caressed the swelling thew. He smote thebroad chest with his knuckles, and pressed and prodded the thickmuscle-pads that covered the shoulders like a cuirass. The group hadbeen added to by curious passers-by--husky miners, mountaineers,and frontiersmen, sons of the long-legged and broad-shoulderedgenerations. Imber glanced from one to another, then he spoke aloud inthe Whitefish tongue."What did he say?" asked Dickensen."Him say um all the same one man, dat p'liceman," Jimmy interpreted.Little Dickensen was little, and what of Miss Travis, he felt sorryfor having asked the question.The policeman was sorry for him and stepped into the breach. "I fancythere may be something in his story. I'll take him up to the captainfor examination. Tell him to come along with me, Jimmy."Jimmy indulged in more throaty spasms, and Imber grunted and lookedsatisfied."But ask him what he said, Jimmy, and what he meant when he took holdof my arm."So spoke Emily Travis, and Jimmy put the question and received theanswer."Him say you no afraid," said Jimmy.Emily Travis looked pleased."Him say you no _skookum_, no strong, all the same very soft likelittle baby. Him break you, in um two hands, to little pieces. Himt'ink much funny, very strange, how you can be mother of men so big,so strong, like dat p'liceman."Emily Travers kept her eyes up and unfaltering, but her cheekswere sprayed with scarlet. Little Dickensen blushed and was quiteembarrassed. The policeman's face blazed with his boy's blood."Come along, you," he said gruffly, setting his shoulder to the crowdand forcing a way.Thus it was that Imber found his way to the Barracks, where he madefull and voluntary confession, and from the precincts of which henever emerged.Imber looked very tired. The fatigue of hopelessness and age wasin his face. His shoulders drooped depressingly, and his eyes werelack-lustre. His mop of hair should have been white, but sun andweatherbeat had burned and bitten it so that it hung limp and lifelessand colorless. He took no interest in what went on around him. Thecourtroom was jammed with the men of the creeks and trails, and therewas an ominous note in the rumble and grumble of their low-pitchedvoices, which came to his ears like the growl of the sea from deepcaverns.He sat close by a window, and his apathetic eyes rested now and againon the dreary scene without. The sky was overcast, and a gray drizzlewas falling. It was flood-time on the Yukon. The ice was gone, and theriver was up in the town. Back and forth on the main street, in canoesand poling-boats, passed the people that never rested. Often he sawthese boats turn aside from the street and enter the flooded squarethat marked the Barracks' parade-ground. Sometimes they disappearedbeneath him, and he heard them jar against the house-logs and theiroccupants scramble in through the window. After that came the slushof water against men's legs as they waded across the lower room andmounted the stairs. Then they appeared in the doorway, with doffedhats and dripping sea-boots, and added themselves to the waitingcrowd.And while they centred their looks on him, and in grim anticipationenjoyed the penalty he was to pay, Imber looked at them, and mused ontheir ways, and on their Law that never slept, but went on unceasing,in good times and bad, in flood and famine, through trouble and terrorand death, and which would go on unceasing, it seemed to him, to theend of time.A man rapped sharply on a table, and the conversation droned away intosilence. Imber looked at the man. He seemed one in authority, yetImber divined the square-browed man who sat by a desk farther backto be the one chief over them all and over the man who had rapped.Another man by the same table uprose and began to read aloud from manyfine sheets of paper. At the top of each sheet he cleared his throat,at the bottom moistened his fingers. Imber did not understand hisspeech, but the others did, and he knew that it made them angry.Sometimes it made them very angry, and once a man cursed him, insingle syllables, stinging and tense, till a man at the table rappedhim to silence.For an interminable period the man read. His monotonous, sing-songutterance lured Imber to dreaming, and he was dreaming deeply when theman ceased. A voice spoke to him in his own Whitefish tongue, and heroused up, without surprise, to look upon the face of his sister'sson, a young man who had wandered away years agone to make hisdwelling with the whites."Thou dost not remember me," he said by way of greeting."Nay," Imber answered. "Thou art Howkan who went away. Thy mother bedead.""She was an old woman," said Howkan.But Imber did not hear, and Howkan, with hand upon his shoulder,roused him again."I shall speak to thee what the man has spoken, which is the tale ofthe troubles thou hast done and which thou hast told, O fool, to theCaptain Alexander. And thou shalt understand and say if it be truetalk or talk not true. It is so commanded."Howkan had fallen among the mission folk and been taught by them toread and write. In his hands he held the many fine sheets from whichthe man had read aloud, and which had been taken down by a clerk whenImber first made confession, through the mouth of Jimmy, to CaptainAlexander. Howkan began to read. Imber listened for a space, when awonderment rose up in his face and he broke in abruptly."That be my talk, Howkan. Yet from thy lips it comes when thy earshave not heard."Howkan smirked with self-appreciation. His hair was parted in themiddle. "Nay, from the paper it comes, O Imber. Never have my earsheard. From the paper it comes, through my eyes, into my head, and outof my mouth to thee. Thus it comes.""Thus it comes? It be there in the paper?" Imber's voice sank inwhisperful awe as he crackled the sheets 'twixt thumb and finger andstared at the charactery scrawled thereon. "It be a great medicine,Howkan, and thou art a worker of wonders.""It be nothing, it be nothing," the young man responded carelesslyand pridefully. He read at hazard from the document: "_In that year,before the break of the ice, came an old man, and a boy who waslame of one foot. These also did I kill, and the old man made muchnoise--_""It be true," Imber interrupted breathlessly. "He made much noise andwould not die for a long time. But how dost thou know, Howkan? Thechief man of the white men told thee, mayhap? No one beheld me, andhim alone have I told."Howkan shook his head with impatience. "Have I not told thee it bethere in the paper, O fool?"Imber stared hard at the ink-scrawled surface. "As the hunter looksupon the snow and says, Here but yesterday there passed a rabbit; andhere by the willow scrub it stood and listened, and heard, and wasafraid; and here it turned upon its trail; and here it went with greatswiftness, leaping wide; and here, with greater swiftness and widerleapings, came a lynx; and here, where the claws cut deep into thesnow, the lynx made a very great leap; and here it struck, with therabbit under and rolling belly up; and here leads off the trail of thelynx alone, and there is no more rabbit,--as the hunter looks upon themarkings of the snow and says thus and so and here, dost thou, too,look upon the paper and say thus and so and here be the things oldImber hath done?""Even so," said Howkan. "And now do thou listen, and keep thy woman'stongue between thy teeth till thou art called upon for speech."Thereafter, and for a long time, Howkan read to him the confession,and Imber remained musing and silent At the end, he said:"It be my talk, and true talk, but I am grown old, Howkan, andforgotten things come back to me which were well for the head manthere to know. First, there was the man who came over the IceMountains, with cunning traps made of iron, who sought the beaver ofthe Whitefish. Him I slew. And there were three men seeking goldon the Whitefish long ago. Them also I slew, and left them to thewolverines. And at the Five Fingers there was a man with a raft andmuch meat."At the moments when Imber paused to remember, Howkan translated anda clerk reduced to writing. The courtroom listened stolidly to eachunadorned little tragedy, till Imber told of a red-haired man whoseeyes were crossed and whom he had killed with a remarkably long shot."Hell," said a man in the forefront of the onlookers. He said itsoulfully and sorrowfully. He was red-haired. "Hell," he repeated."That was my brother Bill." And at regular intervals throughout thesession, his solemn "Hell" was heard in the courtroom; nor did hiscomrades check him, nor did the man at the table rap him to order.Imber's head drooped once more, and his eyes went dull, as though afilm rose up and covered them from the world. And he dreamed as onlyage can dream upon the colossal futility of youth.Later, Howkan roused him again, saying: "Stand up, O Imber. It becommanded that thou tellest why you did these troubles, and slew thesepeople, and at the end journeyed here seeking the Law."Imber rose feebly to his feet and swayed back and forth. He began tospeak in a low and faintly rumbling voice, but Howkan interrupted him."This old man, he is damn crazy," he said in English to thesquare-browed man. "His talk is foolish and like that of a child.""We will hear his talk which is like that of a child," said thesquare-browed man. "And we will hear it, word for word, as he speaksit. Do you understand?"Howkan understood, and Imber's eyes flashed, for he had witnessed theplay between his sister's son and the man in authority. And then beganthe story, the epic of a bronze patriot which might well itselfbe wrought into bronze for the generations unborn. The crowd fellstrangely silent, and the square-browed judge leaned head on hand andpondered his soul and the soul of his race. Only was heard the deeptones of Imber, rhythmically alternating with the shrill voice ofthe interpreter, and now and again, like the bell of the Lord, thewondering and meditative "Hell" of the red-haired man."I am Imber of the Whitefish people." So ran the interpretation ofHowkan, whose inherent barbarism gripped hold of him, and who lost hismission culture and veneered civilization as he caught the savage ringand rhythm of old Imber's tale. "My father was Otsbaok, a strong man.The land was warm with sunshine and gladness when I was a boy. Thepeople did not hunger after strange things, nor hearken to new voices,and the ways of their fathers were their ways. The women found favorin the eyes of the young men, and the young men looked upon themwith content. Babes hung at the breasts of the women, and they wereheavy-hipped with increase of the tribe. Men were men in those days.In peace and plenty, and in war and famine, they were men."At that time there was more fish in the water than now, and more meatin the forest. Our dogs were wolves, warm with thick hides and hardto the frost and storm. And as with our dogs so with us, for we werelikewise hard to the frost and storm. And when the Pellys came intoour land we slew them and were slain. For we were men, we Whitefish,and our fathers and our fathers' fathers had fought against the Pellysand determined the bounds of the land."As I say, with our dogs, so with us. And one day came the first whiteman. He dragged himself, so, on hand and knee, in the snow. And hisskin was stretched tight, and his bones were sharp beneath. Never wassuch a man, we thought, and we wondered of what strange tribe he was,and of its land. And he was weak, most weak, like a little child, sothat we gave him a place by the fire, and warm furs to lie upon, andwe gave him food as little children are given food."And with him was a dog, large as three of our dogs, and very weak.The hair of this dog was short, and not warm, and the tail was frozenso that the end fell off. And this strange dog we fed, and bedded bythe fire, and fought from it our dogs, which else would have killedhim. And what of the moose meat and the sun-dried salmon, the man anddog took strength to themselves; and what of the strength they becamebig and unafraid. And the man spoke loud words and laughed at the oldmen and young men, and looked boldly upon the maidens. And the dogfought with our dogs, and for all of his short hair and softness slewthree of them in one day."When we asked the man concerning his people, he said, 'I have manybrothers,' and laughed in a way that was not good. And when he was inhis full strength he went away, and with him went Noda, daughter tothe chief. First, after that, was one of our bitches brought to pup.And never was there such a breed of dogs,--big-headed, thick-jawed,and short-haired, and helpless. Well do I remember my father, Otsbaok,a strong man. His face was black with anger at such helplessness, andhe took a stone, so, and so, and there was no more helplessness. Andtwo summers after that came Noda back to us with a man-child in thehollow of her arm."And that was the beginning. Came a second white man, withshort-haired dogs, which he left behind him when he went. And withhim went six of our strongest dogs, for which, in trade, he had givenKoo-So-Tee, my mother's brother, a wonderful pistol that fired withgreat swiftness six times. And Koo-So-Tee was very big, what of thepistol, and laughed at our bows and arrows. 'Woman's things,' hecalled them, and went forth against the bald-face grizzly, with thepistol in his hand. Now it be known that it is not good to huntthe bald-face with a pistol, but how were we to know? and how wasKoo-So-Tee to know? So he went against the bald-face, very brave, andfired the pistol with great swiftness six times; and the bald-face butgrunted and broke in his breast like it were an egg, and like honeyfrom a bee's nest dripped the brains of Koo-So-Tee upon the ground. Hewas a good hunter, and there was no one to bring meat to his squaw andchildren. And we were bitter, and we said, 'That which for the whitemen is well, is for us not well.' And this be true. There be manywhite men and fat, but their ways have made us few and lean."Came the third white man, with great wealth of all manner ofwonderful foods and things. And twenty of our strongest dogs he tookfrom us in trade. Also, what of presents and great promises, ten ofour young hunters did he take with him on a journey which fared noman knew where. It is said they died in the snow of the Ice Mountainswhere man has never been, or in the Hills of Silence which are beyondthe edge of the earth. Be that as it may, dogs and young hunters wereseen never again by the Whitefish people."And more white men came with the years, and ever, with pay andpresents, they led the young men away with them. And sometimes theyoung men came back with strange tales of dangers and toils in thelands beyond the Pellys, and sometimes they did not come back. And wesaid: 'If they be unafraid of life, these white men, it is becausethey have many lives; but we be few by the Whitefish, and the youngmen shall go away no more.' But the young men did go away; and theyoung women went also; and we were very wroth."It be true, we ate flour, and salt pork, and drank tea which was agreat delight; only, when we could not get tea, it was very bad and webecame short of speech and quick of anger. So we grew to hunger forthe things the white men brought in trade. Trade! trade! all the timewas it trade! One winter we sold our meat for clocks that would notgo, and watches with broken guts, and files worn smooth, and pistolswithout cartridges and worthless. And then came famine, and we werewithout meat, and two score died ere the break of spring."'Now are we grown weak,' we said; 'and the Pellys will fall upon us,and our bounds be overthrown.' But as it fared with us, so had itfared with the Pellys, and they were too weak to come against us."My father, Otsbaok, a strong man, was now old and very wise. And hespoke to the chief, saying: 'Behold, our dogs be worthless. No longerare they thick-furred and strong, and they die in the frost andharness. Let us go into the village and kill them, saving only thewolf ones, and these let us tie out in the night that they may matewith the wild wolves of the forest. Thus shall we have dogs warm andstrong again.'"And his word was harkened to, and we Whitefish became known for ourdogs, which were the best in the land. But known we were not forourselves. The best of our young men and women had gone away with thewhite men to wander on trail and river to far places. And the youngwomen came back old and broken, as Noda had come, or they came not atall. And the young men came back to sit by our fires for a time,full of ill speech and rough ways, drinking evil drinks and gamblingthrough long nights and days, with a great unrest always in theirhearts, till the call of the white men came to them and they went awayagain to the unknown places. And they were without honor and respect,jeering the old-time customs and laughing in the faces of chief andshamans."As I say, we were become a weak breed, we Whitefish. We sold our warmskins and furs for tobacco and whiskey and thin cotton things thatleft us shivering in the cold. And the coughing sickness came upon us,and men and women coughed and sweated through the long nights, andthe hunters on trail spat blood upon the snow. And now one, and nowanother, bled swiftly from the mouth and died. And the women bore fewchildren, and those they bore were weak and given to sickness. Andother sicknesses came to us from the white men, the like of which wehad never known and could not understand. Smallpox, likewise measles,have I heard these sicknesses named, and we died of them as die thesalmon in the still eddies when in the fall their eggs are spawned andthere is no longer need for them to live."And yet, and here be the strangeness of it, the white men come asthe breath of death; all their ways lead to death, their nostrilsare filled with it; and yet they do not die. Theirs the whiskey,and tobacco, and short-haired dogs; theirs the many sicknesses, thesmallpox and measles, the coughing and mouth-bleeding; theirs thewhite skin, and softness to the frost and storm; and theirs thepistols that shoot six times very swift and are worthless. And yetthey grow fat on their many ills, and prosper, and lay a heavy handover all the world and tread mightily upon its peoples. And theirwomen, too, are soft as little babes, most breakable and never broken,the mothers of men. And out of all this softness, and sickness, andweakness, come strength, and power, and authority. They be gods, ordevils, as the case may be. I do not know. What do I know, I,old Imber of the Whitefish? Only do I know that they are pastunderstanding, these white men, far-wanderers and fighters over theearth that they be."As I say, the meat in the forest became less and less. It be true,the white man's gun is most excellent and kills a long way off; but ofwhat worth the gun, when there is no meat to kill? When I was a boy onthe Whitefish there was moose on every hill, and each year came thecaribou uncountable. But now the hunter may take the trail ten daysand not one moose gladden his eyes, while the caribou uncountable comeno more at all. Small worth the gun, I say, killing a long way off,when there be nothing to kill."And I, Imber, pondered upon these things, watching the while theWhitefish, and the Pellys, and all the tribes of the land, perishingas perished the meat of the forest. Long I pondered. I talked with theshamans and the old men who were wise. I went apart that the sounds ofthe village might not disturb me, and I ate no meat so that my bellyshould not press upon me and make me slow of eye and ear. I sat longand sleepless in the forest, wide-eyed for the sign, my ears patientand keen for the word that was to come. And I wandered alone in theblackness of night to the river bank, where was wind-moaning andsobbing of water, and where I sought wisdom from the ghosts of oldshamans in the trees and dead and gone."And in the end, as in a vision, came to me the short-haired anddetestable dogs, and the way seemed plain. By the wisdom of Otsbaok,my father and a strong man, had the blood of our own wolf-dogs beenkept clean, wherefore had they remained warm of hide and strong inthe harness. So I returned to my village and made oration to the men.'This be a tribe, these white men,' I said. 'A very large tribe, anddoubtless there is no longer meat in their land, and they are comeamong us to make a new land for themselves. But they weaken us, and wedie. They are a very hungry folk. Already has our meat gone from us,and it were well, if we would live, that we deal by them as we havedealt by their dogs.'"And further oration I made, counselling fight. And the men of theWhitefish listened, and some said one thing, and some another, andsome spoke of other and worthless things, and no man made brave talkof deeds and war. But while the young men were weak as water andafraid, I watched that the old men sat silent, and that in their eyesfires came and went. And later, when the village slept and no oneknew, I drew the old men away into the forest and made more talk. Andnow we were agreed, and we remembered the good young days, and thefree land, and the times of plenty, and the gladness and sunshine; andwe called ourselves brothers, and swore great secrecy, and a mightyoath to cleanse the land of the evil breed that had come upon it. Itbe plain we were fools, but how were we to know, we old men of theWhitefish?"And to hearten the others, I did the first deed. I kept guard uponthe Yukon till the first canoe came down. In it were two white men,and when I stood upright upon the bank and raised my hand they changedtheir course and drove in to me. And as the man in the bow lifted hishead, so, that he might know wherefore I wanted him, my arrow sangthrough the air straight to his throat, and he knew. The second man,who held paddle in the stern, had his rifle half to his shoulder whenthe first of my three spear-casts smote him."'These be the first,' I said, when the old men had gathered to me.'Later we will bind together all the old men of all the tribes, andafter that the young men who remain strong, and the work will becomeeasy.'"And then the two dead white men we cast into the river. And of thecanoe, which was a very good canoe, we made a fire, and a fire, also,of the things within the canoe. But first we looked at the things, andthey were pouches of leather which we cut open with our knives. Andinside these pouches were many papers, like that from which thou hastread, O Howkan, with markings on them which we marvelled at and couldnot understand. Now, I am become wise, and I know them for the speechof men as thou hast told me."A whisper and buzz went around the courtroom when Howkan finishedinterpreting the affair of the canoe, and one man's voice spoke up:"That was the lost '91 mail, Peter James and Delaney bringing itin and last spoken at Le Barge by Matthews going out." The clerkscratched steadily away, and another paragraph was added to thehistory of the North."There be little more," Imber went on slowly. "It be there on thepaper, the things we did. We were old men, and we did not understand.Even I, Imber, do not now understand. Secretly we slew, and continuedto slay, for with our years we were crafty and we had learned theswiftness of going without haste. When white men came among us withblack looks and rough words, and took away six of the young men withirons binding them helpless, we knew we must slay wider and farther.And one by one we old men departed up river and down to the unknownlands. It was a brave thing. Old we were, and unafraid, but the fearof far places is a terrible fear to men who are old."So we slew, without haste and craftily. On the Chilcoot and in theDelta we slew, from the passes to the sea, wherever the white mencamped or broke their trails. It be true, they died, but it waswithout worth. Ever did they come over the mountains, ever did theygrow and grow, while we, being old, became less and less. I remember,by the Caribou Crossing, the camp of a white man. He was a very littlewhite man, and three of the old men came upon him in his sleep. Andthe next day I came upon the four of them. The white man alone stillbreathed, and there was breath in him to curse me once and well beforehe died."And so it went, now one old man, and now another. Sometimes the wordreached us long after of how they died, and sometimes it did not reachus. And the old men of the other tribes were weak and afraid, andwould not join with us. As I say, one by one, till I alone was left.I am Imber, of the Whitefish people. My father was Otsbaok, a strongman. There are no Whitefish now. Of the old men I am the last. Theyoung men and young women are gone away, some to live with the Pellys,some with the Salmons, and more with the white men. I am very old,and very tired, and it being vain fighting the Law, as thou sayest,Howkan, I am come seeking the Law.""O Imber, thou art indeed a fool," said Howkan.But Imber was dreaming. The square-browed judge likewise dreamed,and all his race rose up before him in a mighty phantasmagoria--hissteel-shod, mail-clad race, the lawgiver and world-maker among thefamilies of men. He saw it dawn red-flickering across the darkforests and sullen seas; he saw it blaze, bloody and red, to full andtriumphant noon; and down the shaded slope he saw the blood-red sandsdropping into night. And through it all he observed the Law, pitilessand potent, ever unswerving and ever ordaining, greater than the motesof men who fulfilled it or were crushed by it, even as it was greaterthan he, his heart speaking for softness.***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHILDREN OF THE FROST********** This file should be named 10736.txt or 10736.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/7/3/10736Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year.http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.

PUNCH,--The following is taken from a letter from theQuartermaster-General in India to the General Officers CommandingDivisions and Independent Brigades:--    "I am directed to point out that at present there appears to    be considerable diversity of opinion regarding the number of    buttons, and the method of placing the same on mattresses in    use in hospitals.    "I am therefore to request that in future all hospital mattresses    should be made up with fifty-three buttons placed in fifteen rows    of four and three alternately."This should convince your readers that even India has at last graspedthe idea of the War and is getting a move on.       *       *       *       *       *    "Mr. H.

Beersheba gone, and Gaza too!    And lo! the British lion,  After a pause to comb his mane,  Is grimly padding off again,    Tail up, _en route_ for Zion.  Yes, things are looking rather blue,    Just as in Mesopotamy;  My life-blood trickles in the sand;  My veins run dry; I cannot stand    Much more of this phlebotomy.  In vain for WILLIAM'S help I cry,    Sick as a mule with glanders;  Too busy--selfish swine--is he  With winning ground in Italy    And losing it in Flanders.  His missives urge me not to fly    But use the utmost fury  To hold these Christian dogs at bay  And for his sake to block the way    To his beloved Jewry.  "My feet," he wired, "have trod those scenes;    Within the walls of Salem  My sacred presence deigned to dwell,  And I should hate these hounds of hell    To be allowed to scale 'em.  "So do your best to give them beans    (You have some ammunition?),  And at a less congested date  I will arrive and consecrate    Another German mission."  That's how he wires, alternate days,    But sends no troops to trammel  The foe that follows as I bump  Across Judaea on the hump    Of my indifferent camel.  Well, I have tried all means and ways,    But seldom fail to foozle 'em;  And now if WILLIAM makes no sign  (This is his funeral more than mine)    The giaours can have Jerusalem.  O.S.       *       *       *       *       *THE SUGAR FIEND."I will have a cup of tea," I said to the waitress, "China ifpossible; and please don't forget the sugar.""Yes, and what will you eat with I it?" she asked."What you please," I replied; "it is all horrible."I do not take kindly to war-time teas. My idea of a tea is severalcups of the best China, with three large lumps of sugar in each, andhalf-a-dozen fancy-cakes with icing sugar all over them and cream inthe middle, and just a few cucumber sandwiches for the finish. (Thisdoes sound humorous, no doubt, but I seek no credit for it. Humourused to depend upon a sense of proportion. It now depends upon memory.The funniest man in England at the present moment is the man who hasthe most accurate memory for the things he was doing in the earlysummer of 1914).The loss of the cakes I could bear stoically enough if they wouldleave my tea alone, or rather if they would allow me a reasonableamount of sugar for it. However, we are an adaptable people and thereare ways in which even the sugar paper-dish menace can be met. My ownplan, here offered freely to all my fellow-sufferers, provides anadmirable epitome of War and Peace. The sugar allowance being abouthalf what it ought to be, I take half of the cup unsweetened, thustasting the bitterness of war, and then I put in the sugar and baskin the sunshine of peace.On this particular occasion peace was on the point of being declaredwhen I found my attention irresistibly compelled by the man sittingopposite to me, the only other occupant of my table. At first Ithought of asking him not to stare at me so rudely, and then I foundthat he was not looking at me but over my shoulder at some object atthe end of the room. I can resist the appeal of three hundred peoplegazing into the sky at the same moment, but the intense concentrationof this man was too much for me. I turned round. Seeing nothingunusual I turned back again, but it was too late. My sugar hadgone! No trace of it anywhere, except in the bubbles that winkedsuspiciously on the surface of the miscreant's tea.His face did not belong to any of the known criminal types. It was apale, dreamy, garden-suburb sort of face--a face you couldn't possiblygive in charge, except, perhaps, under the Military Service Acts."Do you know," I said to him, "that you have just committed one of themost terrible offences open to civilised mankind--a crime even worse(Heaven help me if I exaggerate) than trampling on an allotment?""Oh, I'm sorry!" he replied, waking from his dream. "Did you want thatsugar? You know, you seemed to be getting on very well without it."As I could not believe him to be beyond the reach of pity, I explainedmy method to him, describing as harrowingly as I could the joy ofthose first few moments after the declaration of peace. I suggested tohim that he might sometimes find it useful himself, if ever he shouldbe compelled to sit at an unoccupied table. ("_Touche_," he murmured,raising his hat). "And now," I concluded, "as I have told you mysystem, perhaps you will tell me yours--not for imitation, but foravoidance.""There is very little to tell," he replied sorrowfully, "but it istragic enough. All my life I have been fond of sugar. Before the warI took always nine lumps to a cup of tea. (It was my turn to raisemy hat.) By a severe course of self-repression I have reduced it toseven, but I cannot get below that. I have given up the attempt. Thereare a hundred cures for the drink habit; there is not one for thesugar habit. As I cannot repress the desire, I have had to put all myenergy into getting hold of sugar. I noticed some time ago that atthese restaurants they give the sugar allowance to all customers whoask for tea or coffee, although perhaps twenty per cent. of them donot take sugar at all. It is these people who supply me with the extrasugar I need. In your case it was an honest mistake. I always wait tosee if people are proposing to use their sugar before I appropriateit.""But if you only take from the willing," I inquired, "why do you notask their permission?""I suppose I have given you the right to ask me that question," hereplied with much dignity, "but it is painful to me to have to answerit. I have not yet sunk so low that I have to beg people for theircast-off sugar. I may come to it in the end, perhaps. At present the'earnest gaze' trick is generally sufficient, or, where it fails, akick on the shin. But I hate cruelty.""Physical cruelty," I suggested."No, any kind of cruelty. I have said that in your case I made amistake. If I could repair it I would.""Well," I said, "here's something you can do towards it, although it'slittle enough." And I handed him the ticket the waitress had writtenout for me. "And now I'll go and get a cup of tea somewhere.""One moment," he said, as I rose to go. "We may meet again.""Never!" I said firmly."Ah, but we may, I have a number of disguises. Let me suggestsomething that will make another mistake of this kind impossible.""I am not going to give up my plan," I said."No, don't," he answered; "but _why not drink the sugared halffirst?_"       *       *       *       *       *Extract from an official letter received "Somewhere in France":--    "It must be clearly understood that the numbers shown under the    heading, 'Awaiting Leave' will be the number of all ranks who have    not had leave to the United Kingdom since last arrival in this    country, whether such arrival was their last return from Leave,    or their last arrival in France."And the Authorities are still wondering why the "Awaiting Leave" listtallied so exactly with the daily strength.       *       *       *       *       *[Illustration: A GREAT INCENTIVE.

They seem to live by stealing each other's mules. Myline-guards tell me that stealthy figures leading shadowy donkeys arecrossing to and fro all night long through my lines. The respectiveC.O.'s, an Australian and an Irishman, drop in on us from time to timeand warn us against each other. I remain strictly neutral, and so farthey have respected my neutrality. I have taken steps toward this endby surrounding my horses with barbed wire and spring guns, tying bellson them and doubling the guard.Monk, the Australian, dropped in on us two or three days ago. "Thatdarn Sinn Feiner is the limit," said he; "lifted my best moke off melast night while I was up at the batteries. He'd pinch BALAAM'S ass."We murmured condolences, but Monk waived them aside. "Oh, it's quiteall right. I wasn't born yesterday, or the day before for that matter.I'll make that merry Fenian weep tears of blood before I've finished.Just you watch."O'Dwyer, the merry Fenian, called next day."Give us a dhrink, brother-officers," said he, "I'm wake widlaughter."We asked what had happened."Ye know that herrin'-gutted bush-ranger over yonder? He'd stale themilk out of your tea, he would, be the same token. Well, last night hegot vicious and took a crack at my lines. I had rayson to suspect he'dbe afther tryin' somethin' on, so I laid for him. I planted a certainmule where he _could_ stale it an' guarded the rest four deep. Begob,will ye believe me, but he fell into the thrap head-first--the poorsimple divil.""But he got your mule," said Albert Edward, perplexed."Shure an' he did, you bet he did--he got old Lyddite."Albert Edward and I were still puzzled."Very high explosive--hence name," O'Dwyer explained."Dear hearrts," he went on, "he's got my stunt mule, my familyassassin! That long-ear has twenty-three casualties to his credit,including a Brigadier. I have to twitch him to harness him, side-linehim to groom him, throw him to clip him, and dhrug him to get himshod. Perceive the jest now? Esteemed comrade Monk is afther pinchin'an infallable packet o' sudden death, an' he don't know it--yet.""What's the next move?" I inquired."I'm going to lave him there. Mind you I don't want to lose the oldmoke altogether, because, to tell the truth, I'm a biteen fond of himnow that I know his thricks, but I figure Mr. Monk will be a severelycured character inside a week, an' return the beastie himself withtears an' apologies on vellum so long."I met O'Dwyer again two days later on the mud track. He reined up hiscob and begged a cigarette."Been havin' the fun o' the worrld down at the dressin'-stationwatchin' Monk's casualties rollin' in," said he. "Terrible spectacle,'nough to make a sthrong man weep. Mutual friend Monk lookin' 'bout asgenial as a wet hen. This is goin' to be a wondherful lesson to him.See you later." He nudged his plump cob and ambled off, whistlingmerrily.But it was Monk we saw later. He wormed his long corpse into "_MonRepos_" and sat on Albert Edward's bed laughing like a tickled hyena."Funniest thing on earth," he spluttered. "A mule strayed into mylines t'other night and refused to leave. It was a rotten beast, aholy terror; it could kick a fly off its ears and bite a man in half.I don't mind admitting it played battledore and what's-'is-name withmy organisation for a day or two, but out of respect for O'Dwyer,blackguard though he is, I ...""Oh, so it was O'Dwyer's mule?" Albert Edward cut in innocently.Monk nodded hastily. "Yes, so it turned out. Well, out of respectfor O'Dwyer I looked after it as far as it would allow me, naturallyexpecting he'd come over and claim it--but he didn't. On the fourthday, after it had made a light breakfast off a bombardier's ear andkicked a gap in a farrier, I got absolutely fed up, turned the damncannibal loose and gave it a cut with a whip for godspeed. It madeoff due east, cavorting and snorting until it reached the tank-track;there it stopped and picked a bit of grass. Presently along comes atank, proceeding to the fray, and gives the mule a poke in the rear.The mule lashes out, catching the tank in the chest, and then goes onwith his grazing without looking round, leaving the tank for dead, asby all human standards it should have been, of course. But instead ofbeing dead the box of tricks ups and gives the donk another butt andmoves on. That roused the mule properly. He closed his eyes and laidinto the tank for dear life; you could hear it clanging a mile away."After delivering two dozen of the best, the moke turned round tosniff the cold corpse, but the corpse was still warm and smiling. Thenthe mule went mad and set about the tank in earnest. He jabbed it inthe eye, upper-cut it on the point, hooked it behind the ear, bangedits slats, planted his left on the mark and his right on the solarplexus, but still the tank sat up and took nourishment."Then the donkey let a roar out of him and closed with it; triedthe half-Nelson, the back heel, the scissors, the roll, and theflying-mare; tried Westmoreland and Cumberland style, collar andelbow, Cornish, Graeco-Roman, scratch-as-scratch-can and Ju-jitsu.Nothing doing. Then as a last despairing effort he tried to chargeit over on its back and rip the hide off it with his teeth."But the old tank gave a 'good-by ee' cough of its exhaust and rumbledoff as if nothing had happened, nothing at all. I have never seensuch a look of surprise on any living creature's face as was on thatdonk's. He sank down on his tail, gave a hissing gasp and rolled overstone dead. Broken heart.""Is that the end?" Albert Edward inquired."It is," said Monk; "and if you go outside and look half-right you'llsee the bereaved Mr. O'Dwyer, all got up in sack-cloth, cindersand crepe rosettes, mooning over the deceased like a dingo on anash-heap."

Private individualsalso, especially when returning home late at night, can do somethingin the way of supplying entertainment for nervous residents in theneighbourhood. Much is expected, too, of the large dairy companies,who, by their control of vast numbers of heavy milk-cans, are in apeculiarly favoured position. By the manipulation of these vessels ona stone floor a very complete imitation of a raid can be produced.A good deal, of course, can be done by any ordinary householder. "Ihave had great fun," one correspondent writes, "with a very deliberateand heavily-striking Dutch clock, which I have lately put against myparty-wall. My neighbour's family frequently jump up and run for thebasement. When they get used to the thing I shall give the other sidea turn."       *       *       *       *       *THE FIRE-DRILL.Once a month, as laid down in "Orders for Auxiliary Hospitals forOfficers," or some such document, we practise fire-drill. Thisconsists of escaping from upper windows by means of precariouscanvas chutes. The only people exempted from this ceremony are Mrs.Ropes--who watches with great delight from a safe distance--andSister, who stands sternly at the top to make sure (a) that thosepatients who don't want to go down do go down, and (b) that thosepatients who do want to go down don't go down more than once. Noexcuses are taken. The fixed ration is one slither per chute perperson.We had this month's rehearsal last Tuesday. The patients were putthrough it first, Major Stanley--to his great disgust--being chosento lead the way and set his juniors an example. He was told that itwas possible, by sticking out his elbows, to go down as slowly as heliked; but he must have done it wrong somehow, for he disappeared withstartling suddenness the instant he let go the window-sill, and almostsimultaneously his boots shot out at the other end and doubled Duttonthe butler up so badly that he had to be taken away and reinflated.Haynes, who came next, insisted on first making his dying speech fromthe window, for, as he pointed out to Sister, when people allowedthemselves to be inserted alive into machines of this type there wasevery likelihood of their reappearing at the other end in the form ofsausages. Seymour handed Sister a bulky package labelled "WILL" beforestarting, and most of us managed to be mildly humorous in some way orother.Mrs. Ropes, on the lawn, enjoyed it all immensely; and so did Ansell,who was standing beside her with an air of detachment. Sister's eagleeye singled him out."Come along, Mr. Ansell," she called. "I see you--your turn next. Noshirking.""I'm not in this, Sister," he answered loftily."Oh, indeed! And why not?""Because I sleep on the verandah. If there's a fire I simply get outof bed and step into the garden.""Oh, no, you don't," put in Seymour. "That would be entirely contraryto regulations. The official method of escaping from burning buildingsis down the official chute. In case of fire your correct procedurewill be to double smartly upstairs, commend your soul to Providence ina soldier-like manner, and toboggan smartly down."(Have I mentioned that Seymour is an Adjutant?)"That's right, Captain Seymour," said Sister from above. "Bring himup under escort if necessary."After the patients came Miss Ropes, and after her the domestic staff,beginning with the less valuable members and working up gradually toDutton and Cook. It was possible to trace the progress of the youngerand slighter maids by a swiftly-descending squeal, while that of themore portly was visible as a leisurely protuberance. At last Cookwas the only one left--Dutton was not feeling quite up to performingthe journey. She was a new cook, and very precious. She had all thegenerous proportions of her profession, and with them went a placidtemper and a great sense of personal dignity."Oh, Cook," said Miss Ropes, "_you_ needn't go down, you know, unlessyou want to."There are times when official regulations must be sacrificed todiplomacy. But Cook was in high good humour, and quite determined ondoughty deeds. Miss Ropes said no more.The task of getting a wide cook into a narrow canvas tube proved quiteunexpectedly difficult; and, when it was accomplished, so far fromsticking out her elbows as brakes, she had to press them close to hersides in order to move at all. With the aid of a friendly pressureapplied to the top of her head by Sister she got slowly under way. Thechute bulged portentously. The bulge travelled a few feet; then itstuck and became violently agitated. Sister clutched at the top of thechute, while Dutton hung manfully on to the other end."Don't struggle," said Sister in a stern professional voice. "Keepyour arms still, and you'll come down all right." A muffled screamingand a dangerously increased agitation of the chute was the only reply.Cook had quite lost her head and was having violent hysterics. Threeor four of us raced upstairs to aid Sister in keeping the top endof the apparatus from jerking free, while several more went to theassistance of the flustered Dutton.Cook ceased to struggle for a moment, but only through exhaustion;for when Sister seized the opportunity to repeat her advice a freshparoxysm came on, and everybody "stood to" at their posts again. MissRopes conceived the idea of attaching a cord to Cook's armpits andhauling her up again by main force. She dashed into the house, andfound a demoralised kitchen-maid calling incoherently for help downthe telephone.Meanwhile Cook had had her worst spasm. We hung grimly on to thechute, dismally confident that something would have to give way soon.Suddenly there was a rending sound; the seam of the canvas ripped openand a gaping slit appeared, through which Cook's freed arm flappedwildly. Then the arm disappeared as the body to which it was attachedgathered momentum; and when Miss Ropes appeared with a length of cordshe was just in time to see her retainer return to the world--alive,but practically inside out.As soon as Cook recovered her breath it was apparent that her temperwas no longer placid. Forgetting entirely that it was by her ownchoice that she had made the trip, she gave us all to understandthat she believed the whole incident to have been specially arrangedfor her humiliation. She gave notice on the spot, and staggeredindignantly to the house to pack her box, leaving her employer onceagain face to face with the Servant Problem.       *       *       *       *       *THE ARTISETTE.

OF A FORM MASTER WHO DREAMS THAT HE HAS CALLED ON THE WAR    CORRESPONDENT OF "THE DAILY MAIL" FOR A LITERAL TRANSLATION    OF THE CAESAR'S _DE BELLO GALLICO_."_Omnis Gallia in tres partes divisa est._" Is it fanciful to say ofthe three parts into which all Gaul is divided that by their coloursmay they be known, the blue, the brown and the ghastly, ghoulish,intolerable, bestial, but, thank God, passing, grey? Yes, thank God,the blight of greyness cannot last long; even now the scabrous plagueis being burnt up and swept back and overwhelmed by the resistlessflood, eager yet cautious, persistent yet fiery, of the blue and thebrown. Hideous, pitiable, soul-searing are the scars that it leaves inits mephitic wake, but the cleansing tide of the brown and the bluesweeps on, and the healing wand of time waves over them, and soon theshell-holes and the waste places and the abominations of desolationare covered with little flowers--or would be if it were Spring.The Spring! No one knows what depth of meaning lies in that littleword for our brave fellows, what intensity of hopes and fears andwell-nigh intolerable yearnings it awakens beneath the cheeryinsouciance of their exteriors; no one, that is, except me. They tellme about it as they pass back, privates and generals, war-hardenedveterans and boys of nineteen with the youth in their eyes not yetdrowned by the ever-increasing encroachments of the war-devil; allare alike in their cheerful determination to see this grim and bloodybusiness of fighting to an honourable end, and alike, too, in thattheir souls turn frankly, as might children's, for refreshment andrelief to the kindly breast and simple beauties of Mother Nature.The key-note of their attitude is given in the sentence, spokendreamily and as if in forgetfulness of my presence, by a Corporal ofthe R.G.A. as I cleaned his boots--it was an honour. "The blue--theblue--the blue--and the white!"He was gazing skywards. I could see nothing but grey clouds, but Iknew that his young eyes were keener than mine, that he had learnt tolook into the inmost heart of things in that baptism of fire, thattravail of freedom, where desolation blossoms and hell sprouts like aweed. Through the grey he could discern the triumph of the blue andthe white of peace, when the work of the brown shall be done. It wasan allegory. More he told me, too, in his simple country speech, sogood to hear in a foreign land: of the daisies in the yard at home,of the dandelions on the lawn, of his pet pig: things too sacred torepeat here. And he told me that the great event on the Front now isthe Autumn glory of the trees. Then he departed, and as he went hebroke into deep-throated, Homeric laughter, and I--I understood: hewas mocking Death. Even thus does laughter yap at the heels of thatdishonoured king out here.       *       *       *       *       *TO THE BOOD.A SODDET.

It seems to be another case of the Earl ofCHATHAM and Sir RICHAUD STRACHAN; and in the meantime the potatoes arerotting.Provided that no scarcity of gas for other purposes is causedthe Government see no objection to its use for the propulsion ofmotor-cars.

Various suggestions for enabling thenew-comers to assist at debates have been proposed. "Dug-outs" underthe existing benches, whence they could poke out their heads betweenthe legs of other Members, and "painters' cradles" depending from theceiling, or the galleries, are among the most popular.In the circumstances it is not surprising that the HOME SECRETARYstrenuously resisted the proposal of the London representatives togive another couple of Members to "the hub of the universe," as Mr.WATT, momentarily forgetting the claims of Glasgow, handsomely calledit. Among a number of minor concessions, Mr. THEODORE TAYLOR'S pleathat Batley should be associated with Morley "because they have hadmany a tussle at cricket" could not be resisted._Tuesday, November 6th._--A statement that the great War Savingsmeeting at the Albert Hall cost L3,500, chiefly for the expenses ofdelegates, shocked the thrifty conscience of Mr. HOGGE, who hoped Mr.BALDWIN would discourage the PRIME MINISTER'S meetings if they were soexpensive. Mr. BALDWIN did not condescend to answer him or he mighthave observed that the delegates in question were voluntary workerswho by their exertions had helped to raise over a hundred millions forthe prosecution of the War.Mr. TILLETT, the newly-elected Member for North Salford, took hisseat, and there was general cheering as, under the safe-conduct of twoamply-proportioned friends, Little Ben was introduced to Big Ben.[Illustration: THE NEW RECRUIT.

Butthat did not prevent Mr. LEES SMITH from making a long speech, on theassumption that by promising to help France to recover her ravishedprovinces we had improperly extended the objects of the war.

There are, however, one or two thingsabout him which even his best friends will admit make it hard for usat times to remember how much we really love him. Sometimes he seemsalmost too good to be true. Yet I have known wet horrible days in thetrenches when the sight of him coming smiling down the line, exudingefficiency and enthusiasm at every pore, has made his fellow-officerspositively dislike him.For, alas, he is one of those dear overzealous fellows whom in momentsof depression we stigmatise as "hearty." He has even been known tobe hearty at breakfast; to come trampling into the dug-out with thatblinking old smile on his face, expressing immense satisfaction withlife in general at the top of a peculiarly robust voice; to tread onhis captain's toes and slap his next-door neighbour heartily on theback, and then to explain to a swearing and choking audience howsplendidly he has slept, and what a topping day it is going to be.Never has Gilbert been known to spend a bad night; he is one of thosefortunate animals who can go to sleep standing and at five minutes'notice, and start snoring at once. If you try to sleep anywhere nearhim, you dream of finding yourself in Covent Garden station, trying toboard endless trains which roar through without stopping--that's thekind of snore it is.And now it is time I told my story.It happened many years ago, when the War was young and the Boschcomparatively aggressive; when our big guns fired once every otherSunday and we lived precarious lives in holes in the ground. OurBrigadier, a conscientious soldier of the old school, was dodginground our line of trenches, and had just reached the sector allottedto my company, which was also Gilbert's, when the distant buzz thatgenerally means an aeroplane overhead made itself distinctly heard."Can you spot him?" said the General to his Brigade-major; "one oftheirs, I suppose?"Now it is as much as a Brigade-Major's job is worth to confessignorance at such a crisis. So, after sweeping the skies fruitlesslywith his glasses and listening intelligently to the steady drone, hesaid, "Yes!" with as much conviction as possible."Heads down," said the General sharply, "and don't move. Pass itdown." And by way of example he sat heavily on my periscope and stayedgazing at the ground like a fakir lost in meditation.Meanwhile the message was passed along, and the trench became silentas the grave. I was informed a few days later that it reached theouter battalion of the next brigade later on in the morning, and waspopularly supposed to have reached Switzerland the same evening.For about five minutes the droning continued ("Having a good look atus," said the Brigade-major in a sepulchral whisper) and then suddenlyceased with what I can only describe as an appalling snort. Almostsimultaneously a tousled head was thrust out of a dug-out almostinto the great man's face, and Gilbert's cheerful roar was heard bya scandalised company."Had a topping sleep. What's the time, someone?"       *       *       *       *       *    "Best milch cows have been sold recently for L60 in the Isle    of Wight. At a meeting of the Cowes Council it was stated    that at Chichester cows had sold for L73 each."--_Times_.And now that the Isle of Wight milkers have held their indignationmeeting it is expected that the anomaly will be removed.       *       *       *       *       *[Illustration: ONE UP!]       *       *       *       *       *PETER, THE TEMPTER.Necessity does not make stranger bedfellows than some of the changesbrought about by War. Who, for example--and certainly not such a bornsun-worshipper as I--would ever have dreamt that a time would comewhen we in London and the Eastern counties would desire rain and windwith a passionate keenness once reserved solely for fine weather? Yetso it is. By reason of that foolish invention of flying we now, whenwe go to the window in the morning and lift the blind, are dashed anddarkly thoughtful if no sky of grey scudding misery meets our gaze."Please Heaven it pours!" we say. Just think of it--"Please Heaven itpours!" What a treachery! It may even come that we include prayers forstorms in the Liturgy.In default of bad weather we may have to Take Cover; and it is whenwe Take Cover that discoveries begin and long-postponed adventuresfructify. For years and years, for example, I had looked down thatsteep hill by the Tivoli site in the Strand into the yawning cavernthat opens there, and wondered about it. I had thought one day toexplore it, but had never done so, any more than I have yet proceededfurther towards a visit to the Roman Bath, also off the Strand, thanto threaten it.But I shall get to the Bath yet, because already, thanks to theintervention of the Hun, I have become intimately acquainted withLower Robert Street, and the next step is simple.In the ordinary way, short of desperate impulse and decision--unlessby some happy chance I had relinquished the burden of this pen andtaken happy service with one of the wine merchants who store theirtreasure there--I should never have entered Lower Robert Street atall, for it goes nowhere and runs under the earth, and it is dampand mouldy, and the only doors, leading to this vault and that,are locked. But for all these disabilities Lower Robert Street is,in Gotha and Zeppelin times, a very present help and refuge. Thereassemble, with more or less fortitude and philosophy, the denizensof the Adelphi, thankful indeed that the brothers Adam establishedtheir streets and terrace on so useful a foundation; and there twicerecently have I joined them. And an odd assembly we have made, rangingas we do from successful dramatists to needy journalists, with anactress or so to keep us manly.There for long hours have we waited until the "All clear" hassounded--or, at any rate, some have done so. As for myself, on thelast occasion, taking advantage of a lull in the uproar, I crept awayto bed, and, after falling into the sleep of exhaustion, had theironical experience of being rudely awakened by the reassuring buglesand my night again ruined.Having taken cover only in Lower Robert Street, which is open toall, I cannot with any personal knowledge speak of the camaraderieof private basements; but I suppose that that exists and is anotherof the War's byproducts. I take it that, in the event of a suddenalarm, no householder with a cellar would be so inhuman as torefuse admittance to a stranger, and already probably a myriadnew friendships and not a few engagements have resulted. Our owncamaraderie is admirable. The federation of the barrage breaks downevery obstacle; while a piece of shrapnel that one can display is morevaluable than any letter of introduction, no matter who wrote it.Hence we all talk; and sometimes we sing too--choruses of the moment,for the most part, in one of which the depth of our affection for ourmaternal relative is measured and regulated by the floridity of theroses growing on her porch.And yet, when at last friendliness is upon the town, there arepeople--and not only alien Hebrews either--who have been hurrying awayfrom London! When London has become more interesting than ever beforein its history there are people who leave it!Personally I mean to cling to the old city as long as it will cling tome; but even now across one's aching sight comes a "dream of pastimepremature" which shakes such resolves a little. Peter, for example,has been having a disturbing effect on me. Only now and then, ofcourse--when I am not quite myself; when the two and thirty (whatremains of them) are not so firmly gritted as they should be; wheneven London seems unworthy of devotion.But these moods pass. You will admit, though, that Peter has his lure.I read about him in the _Tavistock Gazette_, one of the few papers,I fancy, which does not belong to Lord NORTHCLIFFE; and this ishow the lyric (it is really a lyric, although it masquerades as anadvertisement) runs, not only in the paper but in my head: "To belet, by Tender" (this is not an oath but some odd legal or commercialterm) "as and from Lady Day all that nice little PASTURE FARM known asHIGHER CHURCH FARM, situate in the village of Peter Tavy." Now whatcould be more unlike London under the German invasion and all thatnasty little tunnel known as Lower Robert Street, than Peter Tavy?But I must not be tempted. I must stick it out here.       *       *       *       *       *LITERARY GOSSIP A LA MODE.The mystification practised by authors who have passed off as theirown work the compositions of others is familiar to all literarystudents. SHAKSPEARE'S assumption of borrowed plumes is of coursethe classic example. But another and more subtle problem is theinterchange of functions between two men of letters; and the theoryrecently advanced by the distinguished critic and occultist, Mr.Pullar Leggatt, deserves at least a respectful hearing.       *       *       *       *       *Briefly stated, it is that during his hermit existence at Putneythe late Mr. SWINBURNE effected an interchange of this sort with SirW. ROBERTSON NICOLL; the Editor of _The British Weekly_ devotinghimself to the composition of poems, while the poet assumed editorialcontrol of the famous newspaper. If the theory thus crudely statedsounds somewhat fantastic the arguments on which it is based areextraordinarily plausible if not convincing.       *       *       *       *       *To begin with, experts in anagrams will not fail to notice that thenames ALGERNON SWINBURNE and W. ROBERTSON NICOLL contain practicallythe same number of letters--absolutely the same if SWINBURNE is speltwithout an "e"--and that the forenames of both end in "-on," as doesalso the concluding syllable of WATTS-DUNTON. The fact that the Editorof _The British Weekly_ has never published any poems over his ownname only tends to confirm the theory, as the argument conclusivelyestablishes.       *       *       *       *       *For it is impossible to believe that so versatile a polymath shouldnot at some time or other have courted the Muse, and if so, under whatname could he have had a stronger motive for publishing his poems thanthat of SWINBURNE? So austere a theologian would naturally shrink fromrevealing his excursions into the realms of poesy, and under thisdisguise he was safe from detection. Lastly, while Sir W. ROBERTSONNICOLL has always championed the Kailyard School, SWINBURNE livedat The Pines. The connection is obvious; as thus: Kail, sea-kale,sea-coal, coke, coker-nut, walnut, dessert, pine-apple, pine.       *       *       *       *       *As regards SWINBURNE'S conduct of _The British Weekly_, it is enoughto point to such alliterative and melodious combinations as "RamblingRemarks" and "Claudius Clear." The theological attitude of the paperpresents difficulties which are not so easy to overcome, but Mr.Pullar Leggatt has promised to deal with this question later on.Meanwhile the diplomatic silence maintained by Sir W. ROBERTSON NICOLLand Mr. EDMUND GOSSE must not be interpreted as conveying either acomplete acceptance or a total rejection of this remarkable theory.       *       *       *       *       *[Illustration: _Wounded Tommy_.

If so, it is not myfault. This is history, please remember, not fiction. I wanted--I amobliged to say it--pyjamas for winter wear. I know all about pyjamasfor summer wear; what I wanted was pyjamas for winter wear, and Idecided that Agnes should make them. For years I have been trying toget proper pyjamas--by which I mean pyjamas properly made--but thehaberdasher always smiles depreciation and tells me that the goods heoffers me are what are always worn. Quite so; but what I say is thatout of bed and for the purpose of having your photograph taken Tradepyjamas are all right; but that in bed they commit untold offences. Ienter my bed clothed; I settle down in it half-naked. The jacket hasrun up to my arm-pits; my legs are bare to the knee; my arms to theelbows; the loosely buttoned front is ruckled up into a funnel, downwhich, whenever I move, the bedclothes like a bellows draw a chillblast of air on to that particular part of my chest which is designedfor catching colds. When I turn over in my dreams I wake to findmyself tied as with ropes. Slumber's chains have indeed bound me. I ama man in the clothing of a nightmare. The cold, cold sheets catch mein the most ticklesome delicacies of my back and make me jump again.Enough."Well," said Agnes, "if I am going to make your pyjamas you must tellme exactly what you want.""My pyjamas," I said, "shall be buttoned round the ankle and capaciousbelow the waist--there I ask a Turkish touch. The jacket shall bebuttoned at the wrists and baggy at the shoulder; at the chest itshall strap me across like an R.F.C. tunic, and it shall be securelyclipped to the trousers.""Why not have it all in one?""What!" I cried, "and parade hotel passages in search of the bathlooking like a clown out of a circus? No, thank you.""You must make me a pattern then," said Agnes, "or I shan't know whatto do."I can't make patterns, but I can, and I did, make plans of ground andfirst-floor levels, a section and back and front elevations, all to ascale of one inch to the foot exactly. I also made a full-size detailof a toggle-and-cinch gear linking the upper storey to the lower."I think," Agnes said, "you had better come to the shop and choose thematerial."I thought so too. I wanted something gaudy that would make me feelcheerful when I woke in the morning; but I also had another idea inmy mind. _Mangle-proof buttons_! Have the things been invented yet?The archbishop who attended to us deprecated the idea of india-rubberbuttons."What kind are you now using?" he asked solicitously."At present, on No. 2," I said, "I am using splinters ofmother-of-pearl. Last week, with No. 1, I used a steel ring hangingby its rim to a shred of linen, two safeties, and a hairpin found onthe floor."I chose a flannel with broad green and violet stripes, and very largebuttons of vitrified brick which I hoped might break the mangle. Thesebuttons were emerald in colour and gave me a new idea. _Trimmings_."I want to look right if the house catches fire," I told Agnes. "Greensateen collar to match the buttons--""And for the wristbands," said Agnes, catching my enthusiasm."And for the wristbands," I agreed; "but," I added, "not at theankles. That would make the other people in the street expect me todance to them, and I don't know how to."And now the good work is complete. Toggle and cinch perform theirproud functions, and I sleep undisturbed by Arctic nightmares, for Ihave substituted green ties for the stoneware buttons which reducedmy vitality by absorbing heat. My only trouble is my increasingreluctance to rise in the morning. I don't like changing out of mybeautiful things so early in the day. I am beginning to want breakfastin bed.       *       *       *       *       *AT THE DUMP.(_LINES TO THE N.C.O. IN CHARGE._)  Now is the hour of dusk and mist and midges,    Now the tired planes drone homeward through the haze,  And distant wood-fires wink behind the ridges,    And the first flare some timorous Hun betrays;  Now no shell circulates, but all men brood      Over their evening food;  The bats flit warily and owl and rat    With muffled cries their shadowy loves pursue,  And pleasant, Corporal, it is to chat    In this hushed moment with a man like you.  How strange a spectacle of human passions    Is yours all day beside the Arras road,  What mournful men concerned about their rations    When here at eve the limbers leave their load,  What twilight blasphemy, what horses' feet      Entangled with the meat,  What sudden hush when that machine-gun sweeps,    And--flat as possible for men so round--  The Quartermasters may be seen in heaps,    While you sit still and chuckle, I'll be bound!  Here all men halt awhile and tell their rumours;    Here the young runners come to cull your tales,  How Generals talked with you, in splendid humours,    And how the Worcestershires have gone to Wales;  Up yonder trench each lineward regiment swings,      Saying some shocking things;  And here at dark sad diggers stand in hordes    Waiting the late elusive Engineer,  While glowing pipes illume yon notice-boards,    That say, "No LIGHTS. YOU MUST NOT LOITER HERE."  And you sit ruminant and take no action,    But daylong watch the aeroplanes at play,  Or contemplate with secret satisfaction    Your fellow-men proceeding towards the fray;  Your sole solicitude when men report      There is a shovel short,  Or, numbering jealously your rusty store,    Some mouldering rocket, some wet bomb you miss  That was reserved for some ensuing war,    But on no grounds to be employed in this.  For Colonels flatter you, most firm of warders,    For sandbags suppliant, and do no good,  And high Staff officers and priests in orders    In vain beleaguer you for bits of wood,  While I, who have nor signature nor chit,      But badly want a bit,  I only talk to you of these high themes,    Nor stoop to join the sycophantic choir,  Seeing (I trust) my wicked batman, Jeames,    Has meanwhile pinched enough to light my fire.

PUNCH'S STAFF OF LEARNED CLERKS._)"In a few days," says the puff preliminary of _The Coming_ (CHATTOAND WINDUS), "you and all your friends will be reading and discussingthis most strange and prophetic novel." Perhaps. But what we shallbe saying about it depends largely, I suppose, upon our definitionof the term prophetic; also a little upon our feeling with regard togood taste and the permissible in fiction. My own contribution willbe a sincere regret that a writer as gifted as Mr. J.C. SNAITH shouldhave attempted the obviously impossible. His theme, symbolised by awrapper-design of three figures silhouetted against a golden sunrise,is a second advent of the Messiah, embodied in the person of a villagecarpenter named (with palpable significance) _John Smith_, whom localprejudice sends, not inexcusably, to a madhouse, where he dies, afterconverting the inmates and instituting a campaign of universal peace.Frankly, the chief interest of such a wildly fantastic idea lies inwatching just how far Mr. SNAITH can carry it without too flagrantoffence. That his treatment is both sincere and careful hardly lessensmy feeling that the whole attempt is one to be deplored. Humour of theintentional kind has, of course, no place in the author's scheme. Howremote is its banishment you may judge when I tell you that the Divinemessage is represented as given to mankind in the form of a wonderfulplay, which instantly achieves world-wide fame, being performed by nofewer than fifty companies in America alone. The problem (to name butone) of the resulting struggle between plenary inspiration and theconditions of a fit-up tour is only another proof of my contentionthat there are more things in heaven and earth than can be treatedin realistic fiction, and that Mr. SNAITH'S good intentions haveunfortunately betrayed him into selecting the least possible.       *       *       *       *       *If _Humphrey Thorncot_ and his sister _Edith_ had not bored oneanother and grown touchy--I judge by their reported conversations--ina house with green shutters in Chelsea, they would never have goneto St. Elizabeth, which is a Swiss resort, and would never have metthe East-Prussian family of the _von Ludwigs_ in the year before theWar. And _Humphrey_ would never have fallen (temporarily) in lovewith _Hulda von Ludwig_, nor would _Karl von Ludwig_ have fallen(permanently) in love with _Edith Thorncot_. The troubles and miseriesof this latter couple are related by Mr. HUGH SPENDER in _The Gulf_(COLLINS). Papa _von Ludwig_ objects so violently to all thislove-making that he eventually succumbs to a regular East-Prussianstroke of apoplexy which all but leads to a charge of parricideagainst _Karl_ by his base brother, _Wilhelm_. _Karl_ is really toogood for this world. He objects to atrocities and refuses at the riskof his own life to shoot innocent Belgian villagers. Being imprisoned,he escapes by means of a secret sliding panel and an undergroundpassage which leads him, not immediately, but after many vicissitudes,to America. There he is joined by his faithful _Edith_, who defies theGulf caused by the War, and marries him. Mr. SPENDER appears to havebeen in some doubt as to whether he should write the story of twosouls or the history of the first few weeks of the War. Eventuallyhe elects to do both, and his novel consequently suffers somewhat ingrip. He certainly paints a very vivid picture of events in the firstperiod of active operations. May I hint a doubt, by the way, whetherin 1913 a French Professor would have mentioned HINDENBURG as one ofGermany's most important men? Whatever he may have been in Germany,HINDENBURG was for the outside world a later discovery.       *       *       *       *       *_Further Memories_ (HUTCHINSON) is justly called by its publishersa "fascinating volume." The designation will not surprise those whoenjoyed the late Lord REDESDALE'S former book of recollections. Thepresent collection is a little haphazard (but none the worse forthat), its chapters ranging over such diverse subjects as Gardensand Trees, QUEEN VICTORIA, BUDDHA, and the Commune. Certainly notthe least interesting is that devoted to the story of the WallaceCollection, of which Lord REDESDALE was one of the trustees. Hisaccount of the origin and devolution of the famous treasures willinvest them with a new interest in the happy days when they shallagain be visible. Mr. EDMUND GOSSE contributes a foreword to thepresent volume, in which he draws a pathetic picture of the author,still unconquerably young, despite his years, facing the future withonly one fear, that of the unemployment to which his increasingdeafness, and the break-up of the world as it was before the War,seemed to be condemning him. _Further Memories_ was, we are told,undertaken as some sort of a safeguard against this menace ofstagnation. It was a measure for which we may all be glad, as we canshare Mr. GOSSE'S thanksgiving that the writer's death, coming whenit did, saved him, as he had wished, "from all consciousness ofdecrepitude."       *       *       *       *       *When an unstable young wife, getting tired of a pedantic husband inthe way so familiar to students of novels, goes off with a companionmore to her taste, anyone can foresee trouble, or what would there beto write about? When, further, her detestable lover, seeking changeand fearing the financial lash of his properly indignant parent,terminates the arrangement, even an observer of real life canguess that her return to her rightful lord and master must entaildisagreeables; but only a reader well brazened in modern fiction couldexpect Don Juan promptly to make love to and marry the husband'ssister without a word of apology to anyone. This kind of ratherunsavoury dabbling in problems best left to themselves generallyconcludes with the decease of most of the characters and a sortof clearing up, and to this rule, after many years and pages ofdiscomfort, MARY E. MANN'S new story, _The Victim_ (HODDER ANDSTOUGHTON), is no exception. Not a very attractive programme, but allthe same the volume has one or two redeeming features. For one thing,the sister is clearly and attractively drawn, and so is the picture onthe wrapper, though it represents no particular incident to be tracedin the pages of the volume which it adorns. Writing more strongly thanis perhaps her wont, Mrs. MANN has taken some trouble to emphasise thefact that in these cases of uncontrolled passion the major penaltyof guilt is borne not by the offenders themselves but by the firstgeneration succeeding. This does need saying occasionally, I suppose,and to that extent _The Victim_ redeems itself from the charge oftrivial unpleasantness.       *       *       *       *       *Mr. J. RATH has really discovered a new type of heroine, new at leastthis side the Atlantic. His farm-bred _Sadie_, a Buffalo shirt-packer,classifies men by the sizes of their shirts, has no use for anyswain with a chest measurement under forty, and eventually in a mostoriginal way finds her hero in _Mister 44_ (METHUEN), an enormousCanadian engineer and sportsman. She is no chicken herself and hasa passion to be free of the city and out in the great open. _Sadie_is more than big; she is beautiful, burnished-copper-haired, sincereand kind, and, though I think the author "gets this over" quite wellI liked her best before she found her man and her _Robinson Crusoe_adventures among the islands of Ontario, and was giving back chat tothe little foreman in the factory. Here she is a pure delight; andin these days, when a knowledge of the American language may come inhandy at any moment, this amiable romance may well be recommended asan attractive manual of first-aid in the matter.       *       *       *       *       *Without professing to be a student of Mrs. DIVER'S books I know enoughabout them to be worried by the commonplaceness of _Unconquered_(MURRAY). Like so many other authors she has succumbed to the lureof the War-novel. There may be a public for tales of this kind, butI have not yet read one that approaches artistic success. Here weare spared nothing. _Sir Mark Forsyth_ goes to France in the earlydays, is first of all reported "missing, believed killed," and thenofficially reported "killed." Of course he turns up again, but sucha physical wreck that the minx whom he was to have married breaksoff the engagement. Naturally the sweet girl, friend of _Mark's_childhood, undertakes to fill the gap. The minx, _Bel Alison_, is soscathingly drawn that from sheer perversity I found myself huntingfor one good point in her character; but without a find. On the otherhand, _Lady Forsyth_, _Mark's_ mother, and a quiet, capable man called_Macnair_, are admirably put before us. Yet at best there remainsthe conviction that the War is terribly real that these attempts toromance about it are almost bound to be as superficial as they aresuperfluous.       *       *       *       *       *[Illustration: DURING THE RAID. _Disappointed Player_.

I shall omit saying any Thing, My Lord, of the shiningQualities, which seem Hereditary in Your Lordship's Family, as well asof the Dignity and Importance of the Charge with which His Majesty hasbeen pleased to entrust Your Lordship's Most Noble Father. Neither willI presume to trouble Your Lordship with those Encomiums, which are mostdeservedly due to the Vertues, whereby Your Lordship has gained theAdmiration and Esteem of the Polite and Ingenious Persons of thisNation. Be pleased then, My Lord, to permit me to have the Honour ofsubscribing myself,My Lord,Your Lordship'sMost devoted, andMost humbleServant,_Andrew Mahon_.PREFACE.I thought it very suitable to my Business, when I met with so good anAuthor as Monsieur _L'Abbat_, on the Art of Fencing, to publish hisRules, which in general, will I believe be very useful, not only as theymay contribute to the Satisfaction of such Gentlemen as are alreadyProficients in the Art, and to the better Discipline of those who intendto become so, but also in regard that the Nicety and Exactness of hisRules, for the most Part, and their great Consistency with Reason, may,and will in all Probability, lay a regular and good Foundation forfuture Masters, who tho' accustom'd to any particular Method formerlypractised, may rather chuse to proceed upon the Authority of anexcellent Master, than upon a vain and mistaken Confidence of their ownPerfection, or upon an obstinate Refusal to submit to Rules founded on,and demonstrated by Reason.For my Part, though I had my Instructions from the late Mr. _HillaryTully_ of _London_, who was (and I think with great Reason) esteemed amost eminent Master in his Time, I thought I could not make too nice aScrutiny into my Profession, by comparing Notes with Monsieur _L'Abbat_,which improved me in some Points, and confirmed me and others, to my nosmall Satisfaction, being well persuaded, that, as a Professor of thisScience, it would have been an unpardonable Fault in me to deprive ourNations of such an Improvement, either through Prejudice to his, orPartiality to my own Opinion.Though I have already said that Mr. _L'Abbat's_ Rules are nice,reasonable, and demonstrative, yet I would not have it inferred fromthence, that he approves of them all, as really essential to the Art ofFencing; there being some which he does not approve of, and which hewould not have mentioned, had they not interfered with his profession,by the Practice and Recommendation of some Masters, who being morecapricious than knowing, were fonder of the shewy or superficial, thanof the solid Part of the Science.Volting, Passing, and Lowering the Body, are three things which Mr._L'Abbat_ disapproves of, in which Opinion I join; because the Swordbeing the Instrument of Defence, there can be no Safety when the properOpposition of the Blade is wanting, as it is in volting and lowering theBody, and in passing, by reason of the Weakness of the Situation, whichcannot produce a vigorous Action.Notwithstanding which, there is a modern Master, who as soon as he hadseen this Book, and the Attitudes representing volting, passing andlowering the Body, began and still continues teaching them to hisScholars, without considering how unsafe and dangerous they are, forwant of the proper Opposition of the Sword when within Measure.Of all Professions, that of Arms has in all Ages, since their Invention,been esteemed the noblest and most necessary; it being by them that theLaws preserve their Force, that our Dominions are defended from theEncroachments of our Enemies, and ill designing People kept in theSubjection due to their Sovereigns; and of all Arms, the Sword isprobably the most ancient: It is honourable and useful, and uponOccasion, causes a greater Acquisition of Glory than any other: It islikewise worn by Kings and Princes, as an Ornament to Majesty andGrandeur, and a Mark of their Courage, and distinguishes the Nobilityfrom the lower Rank of Men.It is the most useful, having the Advantage of Fire Arms, in that it isas well defensive as offensive, whereas they carry no Defence with them;and it is far preferable to Pikes and other long Weapons, not onlybecause it is more weildy and easy of Carriage, but also by reason ofthe Perfection to which Art has brought the Use of the Small Sword;there being no Exercise that conduces so much as Fencing, to strengthenand supple the Parts, and to give the Body an easy and gracefulAppearance.The Sword, since it's first Invention, has been used in differentManners: First, with a Shield or Buckler; Secondly, with a Helmet, andThirdly, with a Dagger, which is still used in _Spain_ and _Italy_. Mr._Patinotris_, who taught at _Rome_, introduced, and laid down Rules forthe Use of the Small Sword alone, which has since been much improved bythe _French_ and our Nations.As the Art of Fencing consists in attacking and defending with theSword, it is necessary that every Motion and Situation tend to these twoprincipal Points, _viz._ In offending to be defended, and in defendingto be in an immediate Condition to offend.There is no Guard but has it's Thrust, and no Thrust without it'sParade, no Parade without it's Feint, no Feint without it's oppositeTime or Motion, no opposite Time or Motion but has it's Counter, andthere is even a Counter to that Counter.Some injudicious Persons have objected to Mr. _L'abbat's_ Manner ofFencing, that it is too beautiful and nice, without observing that if itbe beautiful, it cannot be dangerous, Beauty consisting in Rule, andRule in the Safety of attacking and defending.In Fencing, there are five Figures of the Wrist, _viz._ _Prime_,_Seconde_, _Tierce_, _Quart_, and _Quinte_. The first is of very littleUse, and the last of none at all.Prime is the Figure that the Wrist is in, in drawing the Sword._Seconde_ and _Tierce_ require one and the same Figure of the Wrist,with this Difference only, that in _Seconde_, the Wrist must be raisedhigher, in order to oppose the Adversary's Sword; but in both theseThrusts the Thumb Nail must be turned directly down, and the Edges ofthe Blade of the Foil of an equal Height.Quart is the handsomest Figure in Fencing, the Thumb Nail and the Flatof the Foil being directly up, and the Wrist supported so as to coverthe Body below as well as above. In _Quinte_, the Wrist is more turnedand raised that in _Quart_, which uncovers the Body, and weakens thePoint, and therefore is not used by the skilful.Some Masters divide the Blade into three Parts, _viz._ the Fort, theFeeble, and the Middle. Others divide it into Four, _viz._ the Fort, theHalf Fort, the Feeble, and the Half Feeble; but to avoid Perplexity, Idivide it only into Fort and Feeble; tho' it may be divided into as manyParts as there are Degrees of Fort and Feeble to be found on the Blade.The Attitudes which are in the Book, are copied exactly from theOriginals; tho' I might perhaps have made some Alterations, in myOpinion, for the better, yet I chose rather to leave them as they are,than to run the Hazard of spoiling any of them: I have therefore leftthe same Bend in the Foils as Mr. _L'Abbat_ recommends, _and for whichhe makes an Apology in his Preface_.Nor have I, in any of the Attitudes, represented a Left-handed Figure,because by looking thro' the Paper on the blank Side, they will appearreversed, and consequently Left-handed.Monsieur _L'Abbat_ recommends the turning on the Edge of the Left-footin a Lunge, as may be seen by the Attitudes. This Method indeed wasformerly practised by all Masters, and would be very good, if theirScholars had not naturally run into an Error, by turning the Foot somuch as to bring the Ancle to the Ground, whereby the Foot became soweak as to make the Recovery difficult, for want of a sufficient Supportfrom the Left-foot, which, in recovering, bears the whole Weight of theBody: Therefore I would not advise the turning on the Edge of the Footto any but such as, by long Practice on the Flat, are able to judge ofthe Strength of their Situation, and consequently, will not turn theFoot more than is consistent therewith.It may sometimes be necessary to turn on the Edge, on such Groundwhereon the Flat would slip, and the Edge would not, if it were properlyturned; but even in this Case, by turning it too much it would have noHold of the Terrace, and therefore would be as dangerous as keeping iton the Flat.The chief Reason for turning on the Edge, is that the Length of theLunge is greater by about three Inches, which a Man who is a Judge ofMeasure need never have recourse to, because he will not push but whenhe knows he is within Reach.Some of the Subscribing Gentlemen will, perhaps, be surprized, when theyfind this Book published in my Name, after having taken Receipts, forthe first Moiety of their Subscription Money, in the Name of Mr._Campbell_, to whom I am obliged for his Assistance in the Translation,he being a better Master of the _French_ Tongue than I am. Indeed to thechief Reasons why they were not signed in my Name, are, First, because Iwas, at the Time of their being signed, a Stranger in this city, beingthen lately come from _England_. And secondly, lest I should meet withsuch Opposition as might perhaps have frustrated my Design of publishingthis book, I thought proper to conceal my being concerned in it, 'tillMr. _Campbell_ had shown the Translation to all the principal Masters inTown, and gained their Approbation much in Favour of it.THEART of FENCING;OR THEUSE of the SMALL-SWORD.CHAP. I._Of chusing and mounting a_ Blade.Courage and Skill being often of little Use without a good Weapon, Ithink it necessary, before I lay down Rules for using it, to shew how tochuse a good Blade, and how it ought to be mounted.The Length of the Blade ought to be proportionable to the Stature of thePerson who is to use it: The longest Sword, from Point to Pommel,should reach perpendicularly from the Ground to the Navel, and theshortest, to the Waste; being large in Proportion to its Length, and notextremely large, nor very small, as some People wear them; the overlarge Blades being unweildy, unless very hollow, which makes them weak,and the narrow ones being not sufficient to cover the Body enough.In Order to chuse a good Blade, three Things are to be observed: First,that the Blade have no Flaw in it, especially across, it being moredangerous so than Length-way. Secondly, That it be well tempered, whichyou'll know by bending it against a Wall or other Place; if it bend onlytowards the Point, 'tis faulty, but if it bend in a semicircular Manner,and the Blade spring back to its Straitness, 'tis a good Sign; If itremains bent it is a Fault, tho' not so great as if it did not bend atall; for a Blade that bends being of a soft Temper, seldom breaks; but astiff One being hard tempered is easily broke. The third Observation isto be made by breaking the Point, and if the Part broken be of a greyColour, the Steel is good; if it be white 'tis not: Or you may strikethe Blade with a Key or other Piece of Iron, and if he gives a clearSound, there is no hidden Fault in it. In bending a Blade you must notforce it, what I have said being sufficient to know it by, and besidesby forcing it, it may be so weakened in some Part as to break when itcomes to be used.It would not be amiss for a Man to see his Sword mounted, because theCutlers, to save themselves the Trouble of filing the inside of thehilts and pommel, to make the Holes wider, often file the Tongue[1] ofthe Blade too much, and fill up the Vacancies with Bits of Wood, bywhich Means the Sword is not firm in the Hand, and the tongue being thinand weak, is apt to break in Parrying or on a dry Beat, as has beenunhappily experienced. Care should also be taken that the End of theTongue be well riveted to the Extremity of the Pommel, lest the Gripshould fly off, which would be of very dangerous Consequence.Some Men chuse strait Blades, others will have them bending a littleupwards or downwards; some like them to bend a little in the Fort, andothers in the Feeble, which is commonly called _le Tour de Breteur_, orthe Bullie's Blade. The Shell should be proportionable in Bigness to theBlade, and of a Metal that will resist a Point, and the Handle fitted tothe Hand.Some like square Handles, and others chuse round Ones; the square arebetter and firmer in the Hand, but as this Difference depends on Fancy,as does also the Bow, which in some Cases may preserve the Hand, but maybe a Hindrance in inclosing, I shall leave it to the Decision of theFashions.CHAP. II._Of Guard._By Guard, is meant such a Situation of all the Parts of the Body asenables them to give their mutual Assistance to defend or attack. AGuard cannot be perfect without a good and graceful Disposition,proceeding from a natural Proportion of the Parts of the Body, and aneasy and vigorous Motion, which is to be acquired by Practice, and theInstruction of a good Master.[Illustration: Plate 1. The middling Guard.][Illustration: The straight Guard or flat Sword.]As In all bodily Excercises, a good Air, Freedom, Vigour, and a justDisposition of the Body and Limbs are necessary, so are they moreespecially in Fencing, the least Disorder in this Case being of theworst Consequence; and the Guard being the Center whence all the Vigourshould proceed, and which should communicate Strength and Agility toevery Part of the Body, if there be the least Irregularity in any onePart, there cannot be that Agreeableness, Power of Defence, Justness, orSwiftness that is requisite.In order to be well in Guard, it is absolutely necessary that the Feet,as the Foundation that conduces chiefly to communicate Freedom andStrength to the other Parts, be placed at such a Distance from eachother, and in such a lineal Manner as may be advantageous: The Distancemust be about two Foot from one Heel to the other; for if it weregreater, the Adversary, tho' of the same Stature, and with a Sword ofequal Length, would be within Measure when you would not, which would bea very considerable Fault, Measure being one of the principal Parts ofFencing, and if the Feet were nearer together, you would want Strength,which is also a great Fault, because a feeble Situation cannot producea vigorous Action.The Line must be taken from the hindmost Part of the Right Heel to theLeft Heel near the Ancle. The Point of the Right Foot must be oppositeto the Adversary's, turning out the Point of the Left Foot, and bendingthe Left Knee over the Point of the same Foot, keeping the Right Knee alittle bent, that it may have a Freedom of Motion.The Body must be upright, which gives it a better Air, greater Strength,and more Liberty to advance and retire, being supported almost equallyby the two Feet. Some Masters teach to keep the Body back in Favour ofMeasure, which cannot be broke by the Body when 'tis already drawn back,tho' it is often necessary, not only to avoid a Surprize, but also todeceive a Man of superior Swiftness who pushes a just Length: Therefore'tis much better to have the Liberty of retiring to avoid the Thrusts ofthe Adversary, or of extricating yourself by advancing towards him andpushing (as I shall observe in its proper Place) than to keep the Bodyin one Situation at a Distance, which being fixed, cannot deceive aPerson who knows any thing of Measure; moreover, such a Retention ofthe Body does not only hinder the breaking Measure with the Body, butalso the Left Leg is so oppressed with its whole Weight, that it wouldfind it difficult to retire upon Occasion.The Elbows must be almost on a Line, and of an equal Height, that oneShoulder may not be higher than the other, and that they may be bothturn'd alike; the Left Hand must be over against the Top of the Ear, theHilt of the Sword a little above the Hip, turning towards Half _Quart_,the Thumb extended, pressing the Middle of the Eye of the Hilt, keepingthe Fingers pretty close to the Handle, especially the little one, inorder to feel the Sword firmer and freer in the Hand.By feeling the Sword, is meant commanding the Fort and Feeble equallywith the Hand, in order to communicate to the more distant Part of theBlade, as well as to that which is nearer, the Motion and Action that isrequisite.The Hilt should be situated in the Center, that is to say, between theupper and lower Parts, and the Inside and Outside of the Body, in orderto be in a better Condition to defend whatever Part may be attacked.The Arm must not be strait nor too much bent, to preserve its Libertyand be cover'd. The Parts being thus placed, the Wrist and the Point ofthe Right Foot will be on a perpendicular Line.The Point of the Sword ought to be about the Height of, and on a Linewith the Adversary's Shoulder, that is, it must be more or less raised,according as he is taller or shorter: Some Masters raise it to one fixedHeight, which would be very well if all Men were of the same Stature;but if we consider the difference in Height of Persons, we shall find itevidently bad. 'Tis to be observed, that according to the Length orShortness of the Blade, the Line from the Shell to the Point is higheror lower, when the Height of the Point is fix'd.The Shoulder, the Bend of the Arm, the Hilt, the Point of the Sword, theHip, the Right Knee and the Point of the Right Foot must be on a Line.The Head should be upright and free without Stiffness or Affectation,the Face turned between full and profile, and not altogether full, asmany Masters will have it, that being a constrained and disagreeableFigure.[Illustration: 2d Plate. A Lunge in Quart.][Illustration: A Thrust in Quart.]The Sight should be fixed on the Adversary's, not only to observe hisMotions, but also to discover his Design, it being possible to guess atthe interior Design, by the exterior Action.It is necessary to appear animated with a brave Boldness, for nothingrequires a Man to exert himself more than Sword in Hand; and it is asdifficult to attain such an Air of Intrepidity without much Excercise,as it is to become perfectly expert.CHAP. III._Of Pushing Quart._To push _Quart_ within, besides the Precautions of placing yourself toAdvantage, and of pushing properly and swiftly, which is to be acquiredby Practice and nice Speculation, It is necessary that the Parts, inorder to assist each other in making the Thrust, should be so disposedand situated, as that the Wrist should draw with it the Bend of the Arm,the Shoulder, and the upper Part of the Fore-Part of the Body, at thesame time that the Left Hand and Arm should display or stretchthemselves out smartly, bending one of the Knees and extending theother, which gives more Vigour and Swiftness to the Thrust; and the Bodyfinding itself drawn forward by the swift Motion of the Wrist and otherParts, obliges the Right Foot to go forward in order to support it, andto give the Thrust a greater Length; the Left Foot should, at the sameInstant, turn on the Edge, without stirring from its Place; whilst theRight Foot coming smartly to the Ground, finishes the Figure, Extensionand Action of the Lunge. This is the Order and Disposition of the Partsin making the Thrust, which see in the second Plate. At the Instant whenthe Wrist moves forward, it must do three things, turn, support andoppose.To turn the Wrist in _Quart_, the Thumb Nail must be up, and the insideEdge equal in Height with the other, for if it were not so high, theThrust would not be so swift, for want of Motion enough, neither wouldthe Body be so well covered, because the Edge, instead of being directlyopposite to the Adversary's Sword, would fall off with a Slant; and ifit were higher, it would make a Quint Figure, which, by the excessiveTurn of the Wrist, would weaken the Thrust, and by the unequal Turn ofthe Edges would uncover the Body.The Wrist ought to be of a Height sufficient to cover the Body withoutcontracting the Arm, which cannot be fixed to a particular Height; for ashort Man against a tall one, should raise it as high as the Head, whichPeople of equal; Stature, or a tall Man against a short one, ought notto do.When the Opposition is accompanied with such a Turn and Support of theWrist as will cover the Body, it is good, but if the Wrist be carriedtoo far in, you not only lose Part of the Length of the Thrust, but alsouncover the Outside of the Body, which are two very great Faults.The Thrust must be made on the Inside of the Right Shoulder, in order totake the Feeble with your Fort, and that you may be covered, bearing onthe Adversary's Sword, by which Means, the Thrust will be well planted,and you less liable to receive one, which Advantages you lose by pushingotherwise.In order to make the Thrust perfect, it must have its proper Strengthand Support when planted: The Strength, is the Vigour with which theThrust is made, and the Support is the Consequence of the Motion of theWrist, turning and bearing upwards, which makes the Foil to bendaccordingly, fixing itself 'till you retire.The Foil may bend upwards in two Manners; the best Way for it to bend,is from the Middle towards the Button; the other Way is, when almost allthe Blade makes a Semi-circle. The first has a better Effect, the Feeblebeing stronger, the other makes a greater Show; but the Point beingfeeble, there is not the same Advantage in the Thrust.In all Thrusts, the Button should hit before the Right Foot comes to theGround, and the Left Hand and Arm be stretched out smartly, to help theBody forward, and give more Swiftness to the Thrust: The Left Handshould always be conformable to the Right, turning to _Quart_ or_Tierce_, according to the Thrust. The Left Hand and Arm should be on aLine with the Thigh, and their Height a little lower than the Shoulder.The Body must lean a little forward before, to give the Thrust a greaterLength; the Hips must not be so much bent as other Times; which weakensand shortens the Thrust, by the Distance which the lowering the Bodycauses from the Height of the Line which must come from the Shoulder;besides 'tis harder to recover, and you, by that Means, give theAdversary an Opportunity of taking your Feeble with his Fort, yourSituation being very low. The Front of the Body should be hid by turningthe two Shoulders equally on a Line.The Foot should go out strait; in order to preserve the Strength andSwiftness of the Thrust, it must have its proper Line and Distance. TheLine must be taken from the Inside of the Left Heel to the Point of theAdversary's Right Foot; If it turn inward or outward, the Button willnot go so far, the strait Line being the shortest; besides the Body wouldbe uncovered, for by carrying the Foot inwards, the Flank is exposed,and by carrying it outwards the Front of the Body, and the Body isthereby weakened; the Prop and the Body being obliged to form an Angleinstead of a strait Line, from the Heel of the Left Foot to the Point orButton of the Foil.In order to know the Distance of the Lunge, the Right Knee being bent,must form a perpendicular Line with the Point of the Foot; if the Footwere not so forward, the Heel would be off the Ground, and the Bodywould have less Strength, and if it were carried farther the Body couldnot easily bend it self, and consequently could not extend so far;moreover, it would want Strength, being at too great a Distance from theperpendicular Line of the Foot and Leg, which are its Support, and itsRecovery would be more difficult.The Foot should fall firm without lifting it too high, that the Soal ofthe Sandal, or Pump, may give a smart Sound, which not only looks betterand animates more, but also makes the Foot firm, and in a Condition toanswer the Swiftness of the Wrist.Care must be taken not to carry the Point of the Foot inward or outward,because the Knee bending accordingly, as part of the Thigh, goes out ofthe Line of the Sword, and consequently, of the Line of Defence, besides'tis very disagreeable to the Sight.The Feet sometimes slip in the Lunge, the Right Foot sliding forward, orthe Left backward; the first is occasioned by carrying out the Footbefore the Knee is bent, whereas when the Knee brings it forward, itmust fall flat and firm; the other proceeds from the Want of asufficient Support on the Left Foot.The Head should follow the Figure of the Body; when this is upright,that should be so to; when the Body leans, the Head must lean; when youpush within, you must look at your Adversary on the Outside of your Arm,which is done without turning the Head, by the Opposition of the Handonly.That every Thrust may carry with it it's due Extent and Strength, theOpposition of the Sword, the true placing of the Body, and a Facility ofrecovering; you are to observe that the two first are for Offence, andthe others for Defence.Every Thrust must have it's just Length, and carry with it a good Air, aregular Situation, Vigour, and a due Extension; _See the 2d. plate_._Of recovering in_ Guard.As soon as the Thrust is made, you must recover in _Guard_, which isdone either by retiring out of Measure, or only to the Place from whenceyou, pushed; if out of Measure, 'tis done by springing back, or bybringing the Right Foot back behind the Left, and the Left behind theRight; and if to the Place from whence you pushed, you must parry ifthere's a Thrust made; and if not, you must command the Feeble of theAdversary's Sword, in order to cover the Side on which it is, withoutgiving an Open on the other Side, which is done as you recover, bydrawing back the Body on the Left Foot; which should bring with it theRight Knee, drawing the Foot, with the Heel a little raised from theGround, to prevent any Accident that may happen by the Badness of theTerrace.By this Recovery, commanding the Adversary's Sword, you either get Lightif he not stir, or Time if he does, which instead of being dangerous, ashas formerly been thought, it is, by the Help of Art, becomeadvantageous.CHAP. IV._Of the Parade of Quart._To parry, signifies, in our Art, to cover when the Adversary pushes,that Part which he endeavors to offend; which is done it either by theOpposition of the Sword or of the Left Hand; but as I am now speakingof the Sword only, I must observe; that in order to parry well with it,you are to take notice of the Manner and Swiftness of your Adversary: Bythe Manner, is meant whether in _Quart_ or _Tierce_; with his Fort toyour Feeble, or with his Feeble to your Fort; and you are to observe theSwiftness of his Thrust, that you may regulate your Parade accordingly.[Illustration: 3rd. Plate. Parade of Quart.][Illustration: Parade of Quart opposing with the hand.]When a Thrust is made with the Fort to your Feeble, which is the bestway; you must, by raising and turning the Hand a little in _Quart_,raise the Point, which brings it nearer to you, and hinders theAdversary from gaining your Feeble, which being raised up is too farfrom him, and makes it easy for you to seize his Feeble. (Refer to the3d. Plate.)If the Thrust be made on the Fort or Middle of your Sword, you need onlyturn the Hand a little in _Quart_.If after the Adversary has pushed _Quart_, he pushes _Seconde_; you mustparry with the Fort, bringing it nearer to you, and for the greaterSafety, or to avoid other Thrusts, or the taking Time on your return,you must oppose with the left hand, which hinders him from hitting youas he meets your Thrust, and from parrying it, for want of having hisSword at Liberty. (Refer to the 7th Plate.)The same Opposition may be made on a Lunge in _Quart_, and to be moresafe in returning Thrust or Thrusts, you must close the Measure inparrying, which confounds the Enemy, who finds himself too near to havethe Use of his Sword: Your Sword, in parrying, must carry it's Pointlower and more inward than in the other Parades.If the Adversary makes a Thrust, with shortning or drawing back hisArm, or leaving his Body open; you must defend with the Left Hand, andlunge strait on him, unless you had rather parry with the Sword, makinguse of the Opposition of the Hand, and closing the Measure, as I justnow observed.You may also parry in disengaging,[2] drawing back the Body to the Left,in order to give the Hand Time and Facility to make the Parade.There are several other Parades, of which I shall treat in their properPlaces, confining myself now to the most essential.[Illustration: 4th. Plate. A Lunge in Tierce.][Illustration: Tierce Parryed.]CHAP. V._Of pushing_ Tierce _without_, or _on the Outside of the Sword_.In order to push _Tierce_ well, the Hand being gone first, taking theFeeble with the Fort, turning down the Nails, and the Wrist a littleoutwards, not too high or low; in order not to give Light above orbelow, the Body must bend more forward and inward than in _Quart_; theLeft Hand should extend itself in _Tierce_, because it ought, in allCases, to be conformable with the Right, except that it is lower. Whenyou push _Tierce_, you should look within your Sword: As to the Feet,they must be, in every Lunge, on the same Line, and at the sameDistance.The Rules I have laid down for recovering in _Quart_, will serve also in_Tierce_, but of the contrary Side._Parade_ of Tierce.To parry a Thrust made with the Fort to the Feeble, you must turn thewhole Hand, carrying it a little outwards, raising the Point, in orderto avoid the Adversary's taking your Feeble, and at the same time takeHis. _See the 4th_ Plate.If a Thrust be made on the Middle, or Fort of your Sword, you need onlyturn the Hand, carrying all the Blade equally outwards. Some Mastersteach to parry this Thrust with the Hand in _Quart_, which is verydangerous if the Enemy pushes _Quart_ over the Arm in the Fort, or_Quart_ within, in the Feeble, there being an Opening in one, as well asthe other Case; besides the Point is too far from the Line, to make aquick Return.To avoid the Return of a Thrust when you have pushed _Tierce_, and thatthe Adversary, in parrying, has gained to your Feeble; you must, byraising and opposing with the Fort, bring the Pommel of your Sword onhigh; so that the Point be downwards; whereby his Point will be nearyour Left Shoulder, and you, not only avoid being hit, but you may makea Thrust at the same time, by opposing with the Left Hand, and for thegreater Safety, you must return on the Blade, and push strait, withoutquitting it. _See the 5th_ Plate.[Illustration: 5th Plate. Parade of Tierce yeilding the Feeble.][Illustration: The same parade & opposition of the hand.]When a Thrust is made in _Tierce_ upon the Blade on the Feeble, or bydisengaging; tho' the first is more easily parryed, you must yeild theFeeble, opposing with the Fort, in order to guide the Adversary's Swordto the Place the most convenient for the Opposition of the Left Hand,and closing the Measure at the same time, you have an Opportunity,before he can recover, to hit him several times; which must be done byadvancing on him, as fast as he retires. _See the 5th_ Plate.You may also parry by disengaging, drawing the Body back. The Return iseasy, by pushing _Quart_; and to avoid a second Thrust from the Enemy atthe Time of your Return, you must oppose with the Left Hand. _See the5th_ Plate.CHAP. VI._Of pushing_ Seconde.In pushing under, the Hand must be turned in _Seconde_, as high as in_Quart_, and more within than in _Tierce_; the Body should be more bent,lower, and more forward than in thrusting _Tierce_, and the Left Handlower. _See the 6th_ Plate.Seconde ought not be pushed, but on the following Occasions: First, whenan Engagement, _Feint_ or _Half-Thrust_, is made without, that theAdversary at one of these Times parrys high. Secondly, when yourAdversary engages your Sword on the Outside, with his Hand raised high;or on the Inside, with his Feeble only; and thirdly, upon a Thrust orPass, within or without.The Recovery in Guard, should be in _Quart_ within the Arm, though mostMasters teach to recover on the Outside, which takes much more Time, andthough the _Seconde_ is independent on the Side, it is nearer to theInside than to the Outside; because the Adversary carries his Wrist tothe Outside, when he gives an Opportunity of making this Thrust;therefore you ought to return to his Sword in the shortest Time, inorder to be sooner on your Guard. If you examine this Parade, you willfind it is the only Means of recovering with Safety.What introduced the Manner of returning to the Sword on the Outside, wasthe false Method formerly used in parrying the _Seconde_ by beating onthe Blade; in _Tierce_, with the Point downwards; so that the Adversarynot being able to return but above, there was a Necessity for returningto the Sword on the Outside in order to defend; but the Parade andReturn being no longer the same, the Manner of returning to the Swordmust also be different.CHAP. VII._The Parades of_ Seconde._Seconde_ may be parried three Ways. First, according to the ancientManner I just described, which is done by a Semi-circle on the Inside,with the Hand in _Tierce_, the Point low, almost on a Line with theWrist; but the Greatness of the Motion does not only render itdifficult to parry the Thrust but still harder to parry the Feint of theThrust and come up again; besides the _Rispost_ is dangerous; because itrequires a long Time to raise the Point, which is almost as low as theGround, to the Body; in which Time, the Adversary has not only anOpportunity of parrying the Thrust, but also of hitting you whilst youare bringing up your Point.Secondly, _Seconde_ may be parryed by making a Half-circle on theOutside, the Wrist in _Quart_, as high as the Shoulder, the Armextended, and the Point very low. _See the 7th_ Plate. It is lessdangerous, and more easy for the _Rispost_ than the former, which mustbe made as soon as you have parryed, by pushing strait in _Quart_ whichthe Adversary having pushed under, can hardly avoid, but by yeilding,and battering the Sword. _See the 7th_ Plate.To this Manner of parrying _Seconde_, there is but one Opposite, whichis done by _feinting_ below, and as the Adversary is going to cross yourSword, in order to parry, you must disengage by a little Circle, withthe Hand in _Seconde_, which preventing the Enemy's Sword, gives anOpportunity of hitting him above, if the Wrist is lower than I haveobserved, or in _Flanconnade_, if the Wrist is high. A Man that parrysbelow, in order to avoid this _Feint_, must redouble his Circle to meetthe Blade. This Parade is best in recovering, after having pushed, notonly to avoid the strait or low _Rispost_, but also any Feint or Thrust.The third and best Parade, is made with your Fort to the Middle of theAdversary's Sword, the Wrist turned in _Quart_, but a little lower: The_Rispost_ of this Parade is very good, when you know how to bind theSword upon the _Rispost_; and it cannot be parryed without returning tothe Parade that I have here, before, described and which, I believe, ispeculiar to myself.This Parade is by so much the more adventageous, as the _Rispost_ iseasy the Sword being near the Adversary's Body, which makes it, moredifficult for him to avoid you; besides, by this Parade, you are inbetter Condition to parry, not only a Thrust below, but also any otherThrusts and Feints, the Sword being near the Situation of Guard.CHAP. VIII._Of_ Quart _under the Wrist_.This Thrust should not be made but instead of _Seconde_, that is to say,on an Engagement, Parade, or Lunge of the Adversary in _Quart_.The Wrist must not be so much turned up, nor so high as in _Quart_within; the Body should be more inward, and bending more forward. (Referto the 7th Plate.)In case the Adversary pushes _Quart_, in order to take the Time, youmust lunge the Foot strong inward, to throw the Body farther from theLine of the Adversary's Sword.In recovering from this Thrust, the Wrist must be in _Tierce_, and theSword without the Enemy's whilst the other Parts take their Situation.The Parade of this Thrust is made by a Half-circle of the Sword within,the Wrist raised in _Quart_, and the Point low. _See the 7th Plate_.[Illustration: _7th Plate. Thrust under the Wrist_.][Illustration: _It's Parade_.][Illustration: _8th. Plate. Flannconade.][Illustration: The Opposition of the Hand to the lowering the body_.]CHAP. IX._Of_ Flanconnade.This Thrust is to be made only in engaging or _risposting_ when theAdversary carries his Wrist too far inward, or drops the Feeble of hisSword, then you must press a little within, and with your Feeble on his,in order to lower it, and by that means get an Opening in his Flank.The Body, in this Thrust, is not so strait as in _Quart_ within, tho'the Arms are. _See the 8th_ Plate.It is necessary to oppose with the Left hand, in order to avoid a lowThrust on your engaging, pushing or _risposting_. This is the lastThrust of the Five which are to be made in our Art. The first us _Quart_within the Sword, the second _Tierce_ without the Sword, the third_Seconde_ under the Sword, the fourth _Quart_ under the Sword, and thefifth, _Flanconnade_; and there is not any Attack, Thrust, Feint, Timeor Rispost in this extensive Art, but what depends on one of these.The Recovery from _Flanconnade_, should be the same as from _Quart_within the Sword.Flanconnade is generally avoided by taking the Time in _Seconde_ withthe Body low; the Hand must oppose to shun the Thrust, and hit theAdversary at the same time. Instead of pushing at the Flank, you shouldpush within the Body. _See the 8th_ Plate.Besides the taking Time in _Seconde_, there is another very good Parade,very little practised in Schools; either because few Masters know it, orbecause it is more difficult to execute it justly. This Parade is madeby lowering the Adversary's Sword, bringing it under your's to theInside, and parrying a little lower on the Feeble of his Sword, you makeyour _Rispost_ where he intended his Thrust, that is to say in theFlank.CHAP. X._Of Parades_.There are two Sorts of Parades, the one by binding the Blade, the otherby a dry beat. The binding Parade is to be used when you are to_rispost_ in _Quart_ within, in _Tierce_ without, in _Seconde_ under, in_Flanconnade_, and in all _Feints_: And the Beat, giving a favourableOpportunity of _risposting_, is to be used when you _rispost_ to aThrust in _Seconde_; or when after having parryed a Thrust in _Quart_within, you see an Opening under the Wrist. To these two Thrusts, youmust _rispost_ almost as soon as the adversary pushes, quitting hisBlade for that Purpose, which is to be done only by a smart Motion,joining again immediately, in order to be in Defence if the Adversaryshould thrust.There are three Things more to be observed in parrying. First, that youare to parry all Thrusts with the inmost Edge, except in yeildingParades, which are made with the Flat. Secondly, that your Fort be tothe Middle, and your Middle to the Feeble of the Adversary's Sword.And thirdly, that your situation be as rear to the guard as possible, asto favour your riposte.The ripostes.In order to riposte well, you must observe the adversary's time andrecovery in guard. The time is to be taken in the thrusts of oppositionwhen he is recovering, and the other as soon as you have parryed. Thereare three ways of riposting on the adversary's recovery in guard: whenhe does not come enough to the sword, or not at all: the second, when hecomes too much, and the third, when his recovery and parade are just. Tothe first, you must riposte strait; to the second by disengaging, orcutting over or under, according as you see light; and to the last, bymaking a strait feint or Half-thrust, to oblige the adversary to come tothe parade, and then pushing where there is an opening, which is calledbaulking the parade.CHAP. XI._Of the demarches, or manner of advancing and retiring._Most of the Faults committed in making Thrusts when the Measure is to beclosed, proceed from the Disorder of the Body, occasioned by that of theFeet, so that for want of moving well, you are not only in danger ofbeing taken on your Time, but likewise you cannot execute your Thrustsneatly, justly, nor swiftly; the Body being disordered and weak. Thereare ten Demarches in Fencing; four in advancing, five in retiring, andone to turn your Adversary, or hinder him from turning you. The firstDemarche in advancing, is made by lifting and carrying your Left-footthe length of your Shoe before the right, keeping it turned as in guard,with the Knee bent, lifting up the Heel of the Right-foot, leaning thebody forward, which, on this occasion, gives it more strength and abetter air; then carrying the Right-foot about two foot before the left,in order to be in Guard, which is done by a smart Beat of theRight-foot.The same _Demarche_ in retiring, is made by lifting and carrying theRight foot the Length of the Shoe behind the Left, with the Knee alittle bent, then carrying the Left-foot on the Line, and to theDistance of Guard.The second _Demarche_ is called closing the Measure; which is done bylifting and advancing the Right-foot a bout a Foot with a Beat, drawingthe Left the same Length; because by drawing it more or less you wouldlose your Strength or your Measure, which few People have observed.There is such a _Demarche_ backward, which is called breaking Measure;which is done by lifting and carrying the Left-foot a Foot back, drawingor bringing back the Right in Proportion according as the Ground willpermit.If the Ground be uneven, or that you have a mind to surprize anunskilful Man by gaining Measure unperceived, or to oblige one, a littleexpert, to push at the time you advance your Body; you must, I say, ifyour Adversary is unskilful, bring the Left-foot more or less near theRight, as you are more or less out of Measure, which gains more Ground,and less visibly than the foregoing _Demarche_, and is more favourableto your Thrust: If your Adversary is a little expert, and pushes on thisyour advancing you must bring back the Left-foot to it's Place, and hewill be out of Measure, tho' by Means of his Lunge you will be well inMeasure, which is a great Advantage.The same _Demarche_ may be made in retiring, where the Ground is uneven,lifting the Right-foot, bringing it near the Left, and putting back theLeft in Guard.To make a Thrust in three Motions, being out of Measure, you must make adouble Beat, which is done by a small Beat of the Right-foot in the samePlace, beginning immediately with the same Foot to close the Measure.The three Ways of retiring which I have shewn, are done from theSituation in Guard. The two which are done after a Lunge are, first bylifting and bringing the Right-foot back from the Place of the Lungebehind the Left, and then carrying the Left behind the Right, in orderto be in Guard.The late Monsieur De Latouche, and Monsieur De Liancour, found thisdemarche better than the following one, tho' it is not so generallyused.The second Retreat after having pushed, is made by drawing back theRight-foot about the length of the Shoe, bending the Knees, in order tobe in a condition to chace or drive back the Left-foot with the Right,keeping the Hams very supple, the Body free, and the Sword before you;not only that you may spring the farther, but also to be in a betterPosture of defence. The Point of the Right-foot should come down first,leaning immediately after on the Heel; the Left-foot must fall on theLine at the distance, and in the Situation in Guard, as I beforeobserved, in order to be ready to take the Time, or to make a Riposte.The two Masters that I have quoted, condemned this Retreat very much,especially Monsieur De Latouche, who says in springing back, threemotions are necessary; first to draw back the Right-foot in guard,secondly to bend the Knee, and thirdly to chace or fly back. Any Master,will find that there should be but two motions, it being easy to bendthe Knees and draw back the Right-foot at the same Time.Besides, his rule for springing back is false; for by drawing theRight-foot back so far as in guard; you lose Time, the first Motionbeing too long, and the Feet being so close together, the Body has notsufficient Strength, and consequently cannot go far. From this it isplain that three Motions are not necessary for springing back, therebeing but two in all. He likewise says that the leaping back, requiressuch an effort, that you have not Power to parry; but Experiencesufficiently shows that you may easily parry and spring back. Indeed ona moving Sand, or slippery Ground, it is very difficult to leap back;and if we consider things rightly, we cannot find our purpose answeredat all times and places; and tho' the first Retreat that I recommended,and which these Gentlemen esteemed, is very good, yet if you arefollowed closely in retreating thus, as the two Steps do not place youat so great a Distance, by much, as the springing back, you may be putto a Nonplus by a redouble.When you know the just Length of your Adversary's Thrust, you may breakor steal out of measure, by leaning back the Body, without stirring theFoot.If in the Field, you have the Disadvantage of the Ground, the Wind, orthe Sun, or that in a School, you are exposed to too much Light, or,pushing with an awkard Man; in order to obviate these Inconveniencies,you must go round him, which may be done within or without according asyou have Room.The Turning must be done out of Measure, and with great Caution: When'tis within your Sword, you must begin with your Left-foot, carrying itto that Side, and then bring the Right-foot to it's proper Line andDistance; and if your Adversary turns on the Outside, you must carry theRight-foot to that Side, and the Left in Guard, as well to avoid hisThrusts, as to lay hold on every favourable Opportunity, in case heshould persist in his _Demarche_.You should never give Measure but to your Inferior: Giving Measure, iswhen the Body and Feet advance too much, or in Disorder; or advancingbefore you are well situated, although corrected in the _Demarche_, oradvancing when you are near enough, except you be much superior to theEnemy.The Measure should be given to oblige the Adversary to push; in orderto get an Opportunity of taking the Time, or of _risposting_.CHAP. XII._Of_ Disengagements.There is nothing more nice, or more necessary in Fencing, thanDisengagements; the nicest Motion, being the smoothest and finest, andthe most necessary, there being but few Thrusts where you ought not todisengage, and to several more than once; and there is no better Meansof avoiding the Advantage that a strong Man has when he presses on yourSword.If we confine ourselves, strictly, to the Meaning of Disengagements, weshall find it to be of three Sorts; which are, upon the Blade, over thePoint, and under the Wrist: But as this might be too intricate inLessons, and a Learner mistake one for another; none should be called aDisengagement, but that which is made on the Blade; and though theothers are, in effect, Disengagements, especially that over the Point,which is done closer than those under the Wrist, yet they aredistinguished from Disengagements, by calling them Cuts over the Point,and under the Wrist, according as they are used.In order to disengage and push from the Outside to the Inside, being inGuard towards half _Quart_; the Wrist must be raised a little at theTime that you lower the Point and raise it again, which should be doneas close as possible, by a smooth and quick Motion, that you may becovered and lose no Time, and be able to push with your Fort to theAdversary's Feeble.Some People, in pushing _Quart_ and _Tierce_, keep the Wrist in_Tierce_, in order to push _Quart_ the swifter, which is a Fault;because they accustom themselves to a Situation, which, when they cometo assault, is unsafe and dangerous, for want of being in the Guard ofDefence.In disengaging from the Inside to the Outside, the Wrist should turn alittle more towards _Quart_, than in the Guard which I have recommended:The Point should fall and rise and the same Instant, and the Hand shouldturn insensibly in _Tierce_, as the Thrust goes forward.Some Masters teach to hold the Sword in Guard between _Quart_ and_Tierce_, and to disengage in that Situation; whereby the threeAdvantages which the Disengagement in _Half-Quart_ gives you, are lost;that is to say, first, a good Air, secondly, the being covered with theFort of the Sword, and thirdly, the Swiftness of the Thrust; because theHand has not a sufficient Freedom of Motion.The knowing how to disengage barely is not sufficient; it is necessarythat you be acquainted with the Time, and with your Adversary's Play, inorder to disengage to Advantage. The Time is when the Adversary comes toyour Sword; and when your Adversary, depending on his Strength, comes toyour Blade, in order to guide his Thrust to your Body, is what is meantby his Play or Manner. You may indeed disengage without taking the Time,but with less Success.When the Adversary engages swift, 'tis good to keep your Point a littlelow, or distant from his; by which Means he requires more Time to engageyou, and gives you more to prevent him, unless you suffer him to touchyour Sword; which would not only make you lose the Time of hitting him,but would also expose you to receive a Thrust, it being certain thatwhen you go to the Blade on one Side, you cannot defend the Other; foryou cannot do two opposite Actions at one and the same Time; and by thesame Rule, if you miss the Time of disengaging, and disengage too late,you expose yourself to his Thrust; for you cannot, at the same time,quit his Blade and parry.Though it is necessary that every Fencer should understand theDisengagements, it is more especially so to tall and weak Men. To thefirst, that they may keep their Adversary at a Distance; which by Reasonof their Height, is an Advantage to them; and to the others in order toprevent closing; in which Case, their Weakness would be a Disadvantageto them.CHAP. XIII._Of_ Feints.Feints are much used in _Fencing_, whether it be by reason of theirNumber, their Ease, or the Success that attends them, gaining more Timeand Light than is to be got in plain Thrusts, there being no Thrust tobe given so well as after a Feint.The Number of Feints is so great, by reason of the many Guards andParades, that I should find it as difficult to describe them, as theReader would to comprehend them without Experience; so that I shallconfine myself to those from which the rest derive, which are, straitFeint, Feint, and double Feint.By strait feint, is meant a Motion or Feint to Thrust on the Side onwhich your Sword is, which is to be done on the Inside, the Wrist in_Quart_, a little higher than the Point which must be near theAdversary's Sword, that you may be covered, whilst you endeavour to getan Opening. This Motion should be attended with a little Beat of theRight-foot, keeping back the Body. If, at the Time you feint, yourAdversary does not stir, you must push _Quart_: if he parrys with hisFeeble, you must immediately disengage to _Tierce_; and if he parryshigh you must cut in _Quart_ under the Wrist.The Feint, to which I give no other Name, it being the most used, and todistinguish it from the others, is done by feinting from _Quart_ to_Tierce_, with a little beat of the Foot, keeping the Body back: theWrist must be raised in _Quart_, and the Button a little lower than thePommel, near the Adversary's Blade; by which means you are covered, andcan make your Thrust swifter. If the Adversary does not stir at theFeint, you must go on strait with the _Tierce_: if he parrys with hisFeeble, you must disengage and thrust _Quart_, and if he parrys with hisFort, you must push _Seconde_.Several masters teach to make this Feint from the inside to the outside,with the Wrist turned in _Tierce_; and indeed they are seemingly in theright; a Feint being a likeness of the beginning of a Thrust; and thatlikeness cannot be better shown than in the figure of the thrust: butthe smart motion of the point, causes the adversary to stir, the figureof the hand no way contributing thereto. You are to consider which isthe most proper, not only to make the adversary answer you, but also tomake the motion quicker. Monsieur De Latouche says, that from _Quart_ to_Quart_ there is no motion; but we have two instances to the contrary.First, that a Man of experience has his Wrist and the bend of his Armfree, so as to thrust strait in _Quart_, tho' in the same figure; andsecondly, if there be a motion preceding the Thrust, as in aDisengagement, or a cut under; this motion is sufficient to help theswiftness of the Feint, and of the Thrust: in short, the motion from_Quart_ to _Quart_, being quicker than feinting from _Quart_ to_Tierce_, and returning in _Quart_; it ought to have the preference,swiftness being the line of Fencing. The only Feints that should be madein _Tierce_, are those that are marked from below above to return below,and from above below to return above.The double Feint is in two motions, so that in order to push within theSword, you must be without; and making a little motion in _Quart_within, with a little beat of the Foot, you feint again without closingthe measure, keeping back the Body in order to be out of the adversary'sreach: if he parrys with his Fort, you must cut under in _Seconde_, andif he parrys with his Feeble, disengage to _Quart_ within.As there are in this Thrust three motions of the Sword, _viz._ the twoFeints and the Thrust; the Foot must make as many, in order to answerthe motions of the Hand.Some Masters teach to make the double Feint without stirring the Foot;and others teach to advance on the first Motion. In the first Case,being in the Adversary's Measure, you lose too much Time, which is verydangerous: And advancing on the first motion, is almost as dangerous askeeping the Foot firm, by putting yourself within the Adversary's Reach;besides the Manner is not so graceful as that which I recommend, inwhich you are not within his Reach 'till the second Motion; and this isattended with another Advantage; for by bearing with the Right-foot, theBody must of necessity be kept back, and consequently, farther from theSword of the Adversary, and in a better Condition to act.There are two other Ways of making these Thrusts: The one by an Intervalbetween the first and second Motions, joining or uniting the other two;and the latter between the second and third Motions, joining the twofirst. Though both these Methods are good, I prefer the latter, whichputs you in a better Condition, not only to avoid your Adversary'sThrust, but also to chuse your own; the Interval giving you a favourableOpportunity of doing both.There has been so much said of the Feints which I have described, withtheir Opposites, that I shall say no more of them, nor will I speak ofan infinite Number of other Feints, strait, single, and double, within,without, and under, in disengaging, or cutting over the Point, or underthe Wrist, in risposting, or redoubling Thrusts; all which, depend onthe three which I have described; in which, as in all Thrusts, the Bodymust be kept back, and the Fort of the Sword before you; by which Means,you are more out of Danger, and the Wrist is better prepared. Some Menmark Feints with the Head and Body, which is a very disagreeable Sight,and dangerous with Regard to Time.A Feint is the Likeness of the Beginning of a Thrust: It is made to putthe Adversary off his Guard, and to gain an Opening. In order to takeAdvantage of the Time and Light which you get by your Feint, you musttake care to avoid an Inconveniency into which many People fall, byuncovering themselves in endeavouring to uncover the Adversary.CHAP. XIV._Of cutting over the Point of the_ Sword.In order to cut over the Point, within from without, the Wrist must beturned towards _Tierce_, which gives it a swifter Motion. When yourPoint is over your Adversary's, you must turn the Wrist in _Quart_,pushing with your Fort to his Feeble: Though this is a regular Way ofcutting, what is most essential to perfect the Thrust is wanting, thatis to say, the Motion that should precede it, which is commonly aHalf-thrust or Feint, by which, two Advantages are gained: First youdiscompose your Adversary, and secondly, your Thrust is swifter, beingby so much the more vigorous, as the Motion previous thereto is so. Atthe Time you make a Half-thrust or Feint, you must make a little Beatwith the Foot, bearing back the Body to break your Adversary's Measure.The Cut from the Inside to the Outside, has commonly more Success thanthat from the Outside to the Inside, the Adversary going more readily tohis Parade on this Side than on the other. The Manner of cutting on theOutside, is by placing your Sword within, making a little Motion orstrait Feint, the Wrist in _Quart_, the Fort of the Sword before you, inorder to be covered, and your Point very near the Adversary's Sword; youmust beat a little with the Foot, bending the Body back a little, and asthe Adversary is going to parry with the Feeble, you must pass yourPoint quickly over his, pushing in _Tierce_, with your Fort to hisFeeble.Though all Thrusts have the same following Ones; the Cut has them moreeasy; it's Motion from above to below, disposing it better than theDisengagements, if the Thrust be from the Outside to the Inside, andthat the Adversary parrys with his Fort to your Feeble: Besides theRecovery in Guard, which is common after all Thrusts, you must, upon aParade with the Fort, if it be without stirring the Foot, or inadvancing, join: And if the Adversary makes this Parade in retiring, hegives you an Opportunity of cutting in _Quart_ under the Wrist, and onhis parrying with the Feeble, you must return in _Seconde_, bringingforward the Left-foot a little, in order to procure a Reprise or secondLunge.These two Reprises are to be made before you are acquainted with yourAdversary's Manner of parrying; but when you have discovered it, if itbe with his Fort, you must cut over and under the Wrist in _Quart_, andif with his Feeble, return in _Tierce_, that is to say, make an entireCircle. These Cuts are to be made in one or two Motions; in the firstyou are not to stop, but in the other, you make a short Interval by alittle Beat with the Foot.The Thrusts following the Cut from the Inside to the Outside, before youknow your Adversary's Parade, are made thus: If 'tis with the Fort, youmust return with a Cut in _Seconde_, under the Sword, advancing theLeft-foot a little; If he parrys with the Feeble, you must return bydisengaging to _Quart_ within, advancing the Left-foot, as before: SomePeople return a Cut in _Tierce_, in _Quart_, by another Cut over thePoint, of _Quart_ in _Tierce_, and so on the contrary Side.When you foresee the Parade, you may at once cut from the Inside to theOutside, and under in _Seconde_; or return within, according as theParade is made with the Fort or Feeble. You may also make theseRedoubles by a little Interval over the Sword, beating with the Foot.There are other Redoubles which are made by drawing back the Bodywithout stirring the Feet.See the Chapter of Reprises.The Cut may be made not only after a Half-thrust, or strait Feint, as Ihave said, but also after an Engagement, Lunge, or Pass, and inRisposting, which is the best and most used; because that is to be doneonly in recovering to Guard, or by bringing one Foot behind the other,or springing back; To the first you must Rispost with the Foot firm, andto the other by closing the Measure.CHAP. XV._Of the_ Reprise, _or redoubled Thrust_.The Term _Reprise_ signifies a succession of Thrusts without Interval,or with very little. It may be done in three Manners; First after havingpushed without recovering, Secondly, in recovering or being recovered;and Thirdly, when the Enemy steals Measure.The first and last of these three Reprises may be called Redoubles.The first Reprise is made after having pushed _Quart_, the Enemy havingparryed with his Feeble, you must return in _Seconde_, advancing theleft Foot a little to make the Action easier to the right Foot, and tho'it be not necessary to advance it unless the Enemy retires, it servesfor an Ornament, and to give more Vigour to the Thrust: But if as soonas the Enemy has parryed he Risposts, you must only redouble with theHand, the Body low without stirring the Feet, and join. If he Rispostsunder the Wrist in the Flank, you must either parry crossing his Swordas you recover, opposing with the left Hand, or return, as I said, withthe Hand in _Seconde_.Upon the Rispost of the Enemy, you may also redouble, volting strait, orcutting in the Flank according as he raises his Hand more or less in hisRispost, in order to facilitate your Volt; you must immediately afteryour Lunge follow a little with the left Foot.The second Reprise is made, after having pushed _Quarte_, when inrecovering to Guard the Enemy advances, without being covered, or thatsuffering the Superiority of your Sword, he gives you room to thrust in_Quarte_, if he disengages, you must go off in _Tierce_, if he forcesyour Sword with his Feeble, you must disengage to _Tierce_, and if withhis Fort cut _Quarte_ under the Wrist.In order to get time for this Redouble, you must make a half Thrust,immediately getting out of Measure, either with the Body Simply, or bythe first Demarche backwards, or by leaping a little back; if the Enemyadvances it will be either strait or making a Feint, or on your Sword;to the two first you must push strait _Quarte_, or _Seconde_, loweringthe Body or volting, and if he comes on your Sword you must disengageand push over in _Tierce_.The third Reprise is made when the Enemy upon your pushing _Quarte_breaks Measure without or with parrying; to the one you must redouble in_Quarte_, with your Fort to his Feeble, which is done after a straitThrust, Feint, Engagement, or Rispost; and if the Enemy parrys, you mustlikewise redouble forwards by a Disengagement, or a Cut under or overaccording to his Parade, or as Opportunity offers. To redouble forward,or make several Reprises following with ease, you must as often as youthrust follow with the left Foot._The_ Reprises _on the_ Outside.If you push in _Tierce_ and your Adversary parrys with the Fort, youmust redouble in _Seconde_, and if he parrys with the Feeble disengageto _Quarte_, advancing a little the left Foot that the Right may havethe Liberty of a second Motion.If the Enemy after parrying _Tierce_ shou'd Rispost strait or under, tothe first you may disengage and volt, and to the other volt strait,advancing the left Foot a little in Lunging, in order to have theLiberty of Volting, because you cannot easily do it when you areextended: It is more easy to take the Time opposing with the left Hand;and 'tis best of all to parry and thrust strait in _Quarte_; if afterhaving pushed _Tierce_, on your Recovery to Guard, you find you have theCommand of the Enemy's Sword, or that he advances uncovered, you, mustin these Cases push strait in _Tierce_ if he disengage you must take thetime and push _Quarte_, if he comes to your Sword with his Fort, youmust cut under in _Seconde_, if with his Feeble, disengage in _Quarte_,it is also good after having pushed _Tierce_ to recover with your Swordhigh, giving Light under, and if the Enemy pushes there, you must takethe Time opposing with the left Hand, or Parry and Rispost.It is good likewise for a Decoy to make a half Thrust and recover withthe Sword quite distant from you Body, and if the Enemy comes to yourSword, you must disengage and thrust at his Open, and if he makes atyour Body, you must volt or oppose with the Hand and thrust where youhave Light.The Reprises or Redoubles in advancing are made in _Tierce_ by the sameRules as those within are. That is to say, either strait, or bydisengaging or cutting over or under, according as the Enemy eitherlets you make your Thrust, or goes to his Parade.All these Redoubles may be made on a Rispost as well as on other Lunges.CHAP. XVI._Of passing_ Quarte _within the Sword._A Pass is contrary to a Volt as well in Figure as in it's Occasion, theleft Leg in the Figure passing foremost, and in a Volt behind, to helpthe Body to turn, and in it's occasion, the Pass being to be made as ina Lunge, taking the Time, or his Time, whereas the Volt cannot be madewithout a great deal of Time; yet the Pass is different from a Lunge,the one being made with the foremost Foot, and the Pass with thehindmost, which gives the Thrust a greater Length, more Strength andSwiftness, and a greater Facility of taking the Feeble with your Fort,the Body goes further, because the Center from which it departs in aLunge is in the left Foot, and in a Pass in the right Foot which is moreadvanced, and also because in passing you advance the Left Foot morethan you do the Right in Lunging, and the Parts being higher on a Passthan in a Lunge there is a greater Facility of taking the Feeble withyour Fort.[Illustration: 9th Plate. A Pass in Quart.][Illustration: The Lowering the Body on the Pass.]In a Pass in _Quarte_, the Hands and Arms must be displayed as in aLunge, not only in their Figure, but in the same Order, that is to say,the Hand must move first to bring on the Shoulder and the Body; whichshould lean more forward than in Lunging, at the Time that carrying theleft Foot about two Foot and an half, you find your Pass at it's fullExtention. As your Body is too much abandoned forward to recover itselfeasily, you must rush on your Enemy, seize the Guard of his Sword, andpresent him your Point, which is done by advancing the right Foot tosuch a Distance as to be out of the reach of his Leg whilst you advance,which otherwise might give him an Opportunity, by Tripping to throw youdown. As you advance the right Foot you must seize the Guard of hisSword, at the same time drawing back your Sword, keeping it high. Thenyou must carry your right Foot behind the Left to almost the Distance ofa Lunge, in Order to be strong, as well to avoid his pulling youforward, as to draw him to you.If the Enemy parrys the Pass with his Fort, you must only join,commanding his Sword with your Fort, 'till you have seized his Guardwith the left Hand, which must be done at the Time that you advance theright Foot, carrying your Sword from the Inside to the Out, then youmust bring the left Foot to the side of the right, and bring back theright presenting the Sword to the Enemy.If he parrys with his Feeble, you must, without stopping, either cutover his Point from within to without, or turn the Wrist in _Seconde_,lowering your Body, and bringing up the right Foot seize his Guard, thencarrying your Sword from within to without, you advance the left Foot tothe side of the right, and drawing back the right present your Sword.The easiest means to avoid and hit a Man who passes in _Quart_ withinare to parry dry and Rispost swiftly in the Flank, and if the Pass ismade straight along the Blade with the Fort to your Feeble, you must bylowering your Feeble, turn your Wrist in _Quarte_ carrying the Pointperpendicularly down, supporting the Wrist, without, and bringing yourSword round by the Outside of the Adversary's Shoulder, you find yourSword above his, with your Point to his Body. You may also upon the samePass lower the Body and push _Seconde_.[Illustration: 10th Plate. The Turning the Body on a Pass in Tierce.][Illustration: Pass in Seconde Volting the Body.]_To Pass in_ Tierce.In passing _Tierce_, as in a Lunge, the Wrist must draw the Shoulder andBody forward, bringing, as in a Pass in _Quarte_, the Left-foot abouttwo Feet and an Half before the Right, then advancing the Right foremostand out of the Reach of the Enemy's; you must seize the Guard of hisSword, and again advancing the Left-foot near the Right, you draw backthe Right and present the Point.The Counters or Opposites to this Pass, are the strait Rispost, or theRispost under, the taking Time, cutting _Seconde_ under, disengaging, orcounter disengaging and volting, but the surest is to loosen theRight-foot turning the Body half round to the right, opposing with theSword and presenting the Point to the Enemy, which hindering him fromhurting you, throws him on your Point if he abandons himself, and at thesame time you seize the Guard of his Sword. _See the 10th_ Plate._To Pass in_ Seconde.In passing _Seconde_, there must, as in a Lunge, be a preparatoryMotion, which is made by a Feint, or by an Engagement on the Blade tooblige the Enemy to parry high, in order to take that Time to passunder, which is done by advancing the Left-foot very much, with the Bodylower and more forward than in other Passes, and advancing theRight-foot, you seize the Enemy's Sword, bringing yours from under over,and advancing the Left-foot to the Side of the Right, you draw back theRight presenting the Point. You must take notice, that in a Pass in_Quarte_ with it's Joining, there are but three Steps, and that in thePasses in _Tierce_ and _Seconde_ there are four. The first, passing theLeft-foot before the Right; the second, advancing the Right to seize theSword; the third, bringing up the Left-foot a little, and the fourth,bringing back the Right, presenting the Point.In order to avoid, and to hit the Enemy on his Pass, besides parryingand pushing strait, as in the Thrust lunged in _Seconde_, in the 6thPlate, you may also make a strait Thrust, opposing with the Left-hand,or by volting, as is shewn in the Cut of the 10th Plate.Tho' a Pass carries along with it, as I have observed, a greaterExtension and Swiftness than a Lunge, yet as you cannot recover from it,it should be seldom practised, especially if you are not the strongest,or able in three attacks to hit twice, there being nothing moredisagreeable to the Sight than to see several Passes made withouthitting. But it is otherwise in Lunges, by reason of the Liberty ofrecovering and parrying.Passes were more used formerly than they are now, whether it was toendeavour to bring them to Perfection, or because it has been found thatthis Sort of Play was not so sure.CHAP. XVII._Of volting the Body._The Volting of the Body, which many People call _Quarting_, shou'd neverbe done but at times when you are abandoned, as in Case of Lunges or onan Engagement of Feint in Disorder, of when finding yourself sodisordered as not being able to parry, you must of necessity haverecourse to volting in order to avoid the Thrust; but to do it at animproper time, as some do, is very dangerous, by reason of the Facilityof parrying it, it being a Figure in Fencing which gives the leastStrength, Extention, of Swiftness to a Thrust; besides that presentingthe Flank and Small of the Back, the Adversary, in order to hit theseParts, has nothing to do but parry with his point a little within andlow.In volting you must begin with the Arms and Left-foot, by whoseAssistance you turn the body; the Hands shou'd turn in _Quarte_, theRight as in a Lunge or Pass, and the Left more without; you must at thesame time turn upon the Point of the Right-foot, bringing the Heeloutwards, and the Left-foot behind the Right, a little farther outwards,which gives the Body almost the Figure of a Left-handed Man; havingturned about a Quarter round, the Body in this Posture must necessarilybe in Disorder. _See the 10th Plate_.Having finished these Motions, if you find, for want of the Enemy'shaving suficiently abandoned himself, that you have not an Opportunityof Joining, you must without stirring the Body or Left-foot, returnwith your Sword on the Enemy's, and from his Sword to his Body, and fromthe Body to the Sword, as often as you shall see proper, which may beeasily done, your Thrusts being but of small Extension, as well byreason of the Action of the Enemy coming to you, as by the Advancementof the Volt; you should, at the same time, oppose with the Left-hand, toavoid the Thrusts that the Enemy might make upon the Time of yours; bythis means you may easily come to Guard again, or if he retires you maypush at him, the Left-foot by it's Advancement having given a greatAdvantage to your Thrust, and if instead of retiring, he has a mind tojoin, you must prevent him by seizing the Guard of his Sword, presentingyour Point to him.If in an Assault the Foil be entangled in the Shirt or elsewhere, orthat in Battle the Sword be too far entered, or that the Enemy lay holdon the Blade; in these Cases you must shift your Sword to the otherHand, which is done after the Volt, advancing your Right-foot, takinghold of your Blade with the Left-hand about four inches from the Guard,whilst with the Right you seize his Guard, and drawing back your Swordyou present him the Point.Tho' Volting is not best in Combat, yet it may on some Occasions benecessary, besides it is my Business to speak of them, at the same timeadvising that 'tis much better to make use of Parades and Risposts, thanof Time of what Sort soever.The Joining on a Volt is the same as on passing in _Quarte_.CHAP. XVIII._Of Joining or seizing the_ Sword.You may join after having parryed any Thrust or Pass whatever, as alsoafter having pushed, passed, or volted in whatever Figure, or onwhatever Side it may be, especially when the Enemy abandons himself, oryou abandon yourself: If the Enemy abandons himself by a Lunge or Pass;in case of the first, you must close the Measure in parrying, seizing atthe same time the Guard of his Sword with your Left-hand and carryingthe Right-foot back present him the Point; and in case of a Pass, youmust parry with your Feet firm, and seize his Guard, drawing back theRight-foot and presenting your Point in like Manner.[Illustration: 11th Plate The Seizing and presenting the Sword.][Illustration: Parrying and Disarming.]If you have pushed being too near, that your Right-foot slipped, orthat the Enemy in parrying closed Measure; if he parryed with his Feebleyou must redouble in _Seconde_ and join, and if with his Fort, you mustoppose his Sword with your's 'till with your Left-hand you have seizedthe Guard, advancing the Left-foot; this Motion being done, you passyour Sword over the Enemy's from within to without; and loosing theRight-foot present him your Point.Upon the Parade of _Tierce_ with the Fort, being near you must join,seizing the Guard, advancing the Left Leg, and drawing back the Right,and present the Point; or you may, before you join, cut under in_Seconde_; the first is surer at the Sword, and the other more beautifulin an Assault where a Thrust is more esteemed, than joining.If on a Pass or Lunge the Enemy shou'd attempt to join or seize yourSword, you must, in order to prevent him, change it from the Right-handto the Left, four Inches from the Guard, as I have already observed,seizing his with the Right-hand, and presenting him the Point, holdingit at such a Length as to hit him whilst he is unable to come near you.In Joining, if you cannot seize the Guard, you must the Blade, helpingwith your Elbow, turning the Hand to break the Blade, or take away thesword, which may be done if you are cunning and nervous, especially ifthe Enemy's Wrist is in _Quarte_, in which there is no Danger of hurtingyourself, because the Sword cannot slip thro', and consequently, can'tcut your Fingers, as has happened to some by their Imprudence; by thisMeans, you have time not only to secure yourself, but also to hit yourEnemy. Some People seize the Arm, but that is of no use, because theEnemy may change Hands and hit you.You may throw a Man down after having pushed, either upon the Pass of_Quarte_ or _Tierce_; if in _Quarte_, it is done after advancing theLeft-foot, crossing the Enemy's Sword with your Fort, and carrying yourRight-leg without his, at the same time pushing the Sword up from theInside to the Out, and carrying the Right Arm to his Neck, and the Leftto the Small of his Back: These three Actions must be done at the sametime. There has been so much said on this Head, with the Joiningwithout, that I shall say no more of it.The Joining in Passes within, without, and under, is the same as intheir Lunges.In whatever Manner you join you must present the Sword at a Distance, inorder to hinder the Enemy from seizing it, or putting it off with hisLeft Hand to throw himself in upon you: If the Enemy shou'd make aDifficulty of yeilding up his Sword, you must, in order to frustrate hisHopes of closing you, and to make him follow you, draw back theLeft-foot behind the Right, and the Right behind the Left, at such aDistance as to be strong, at the same time moving the Point of yourSword circularly; by this Means, you are in a Condition either of givingor taking his Life, which you would not be if he could close you, bywhich you would be oblig'd to kill him, or render the Advantage doubtfulby struggling.CHAP. XIX._Of engaging in_ Quarte _in a midling Guard._I Have hitherto treated of the Means whereby to make Thrusts, and inthis and the following Chapters, I will shew on what Occasion they areto be made use of. Tho' there is an infinite Number of Figures orPostures, and that every Posture may be in Guard, whether within, orwithout, _Prime_, _Seconde_, _Tierce_, or _Quarte_, they proceed fromthe Midling Guard, the Strait, the High, or the Low Guard, each of whichmay be attacked and defended within or without.Though there are many Means to disorder the Enemy by putting him out ofGuard in order to hit him on that Occasion, they all depend either upona Feint by the Side of his Sword to draw him on, or on a Motion of yourSword on his, to uncover him, taking his Sword from the Line of yourBody, and placing yours on a Line with his, which is called engaging.And there are several other Ways of coming to the Sword, which are theBeats, Crossings, Bindings, and Lashings; the Occasions of which, andthe Manners of using them, I shall shew in their proper Places. I beginwith engaging in the midling Guard, as the neatest, the most used, andthe best.To engage this Guard within, it must be done with the Edge on the sameSide, without going wide, in order to keep your Fort before you, andyour Point before the Enemy, carrying both Parts alike; the Engagementmust be made Feeble to Feeble, a little more to your Enemy's than yourown, because if it were with the Feeble to the Fort, the Enemy's Swordwould not be displaced, besides if he should push, you could not parry,being unable with your Feeble to resist his Fort; and if it were withthe Fort to the Feeble, you wou'd be in Danger of being hit under, wherethere would be an Opening; besides you would be oblig'd to advance much,which would be dangerous.On your Engagement, the Enemy may do Three things, either of which,produces several others. First, either he will let you engage, orsecondly, he will disengage, or thirdly, he will come to your Blade.If he lets you engage, you must push _Quarte_, or, by way ofPrecaution, make a Half-thrust, in order to see if he stirs, to retire,or to have recourse to his Parade, or to Time.If he does not stir, you must, as I said, push _Quarte_; if he retires,redouble your Thrust; if he parrys with his Fort cut _Quarte_ under theWrist; if with the Feeble, disengage, or cut over the Point in _Tierce_;and if upon the Half-thrust he takes the Time pushing strait, you mustparry and risposte, or take the Time in _Seconde_, with your Body low;if he takes the Time lowering his Body, you must parry and oppose withthe Left-hand, risposting in _Quarte_; if he takes the Time cuttingunder the Wrist, you must parry crossing the Sword in _Quarte_, opposingwith the Hand, in order to make your Rispost more safely; and if hevolts upon the Half-thrust, you must parry and risposte in_Flanconnade_, or take the Time, with, your Body low.If when you engage he disengages, it will be either, 1st, withoutDesign, or 2dly, to disengage and push _Tierce_ over, or 3dly, disengagebreaking Measure, or 4thly, disengage, and come to your Blade without,or 5thly disengage making a Feint, and pushing _Quarte_ or 6thly,disengage to take a Counter to your Time.1st. If he disengages with a Design only to disengage, you must on theTime push _Tierce_.2dly. If he disengages breaking Measure, you must redouble in _Tierce_,advancing.3dly. If he disengages and pushes without, you must parry and rispostequick where you have Light, or take Time against him, disengaging andvolting, or lowering the Body.4thly. If he disengages and comes to your Blade without; if 'tis withhis Fort, you must cut under in _Seconde_; and if with the Feeble, youmust Counter-disengage from without to within.5thly. If on the Engagement, he feint _Tierce_ in order to push_Quarte_, you must push or take the Time strait upon the Feint, or bylowering the Body on the Thrust.6thly. If he disengages giving Light, to take a Counter to your Thrust,whether by a Rispost or Time, you must make a False-time orHalf-thrust, and if he parrys, or takes the Time, in Case of the first,you must baulk his Parade; and if he takes the Time, you must takeanother upon him.If, upon the Engagement, he goes to your Blade with his Fort, you mustcut under his Wrist, and if with his Feeble, disengage and push withoutin _Tierce_.Though an Engagement may be made Blade to Blade, without Disengaging,that is Inside to Inside; better and more common to make it bydisengaging from the Outside to the Inside.CHAP. XX._Of engaging in_ Tierce _in the Midling Guard_.The Engagement without shou'd be made from your being placed within,Feeble to Feeble, for the same Reason as in _Quarte_, the Wrist shou'dbe turned in _Tierce_; in this Engagement as in _Quarte_, theAntagonist may do three things. 1st, let you engage him, 2d. ordisengage, 3d. or come to your Blade.If he lets you engage him, you must carry on your Thrust in _Tierce_, ormake a Half-Thrust, to see if he does not stir, if he retires, if heparrys, or if he takes the Time.If upon your Half-thrust he does not stir, you must thrust strait, if heretires, advance and redouble.If he parrys with his Fort, cut _Seconde_ under, if with his Feeble, youmust disengage or cut over the Point from _Tierce_ to _Quarte_, and ifupon the Half-thrust he takes the Time pushing strait, you must eitherparry and risposte, or make him Time, volting or lowering the Body.If he takes the Time in _Seconde_, lowering his Body, you must eitherparry him and thrust _Quarte_, or pushing _Quarte_, oppose with the Lefthand, or volt.If on your Engagement he disengages, 'tis as in _Quarte_, 1st eitherwithout Design, 2d. or to retire, 3d. or to take the Time pushing_Quarte_ or volting, 4th. or to come to your Blade, 5th. or to make aFeint; 6th. or to take a Counter to your Thrust.1st. If he disengage without Design, you must push strait in _Quarte_,or make a Half-thrust, and go on with the same.2d. If he disengages breaking Measure, you must come forward redoublingin _Quarte_.3d. If he disengages and pushes _Quarte_, which, on this Occasion, iscalled Counter-disengaging, you must either parry and risposte, or takethe Time lowering the Body, or volting.4th. If he disengages and comes to your Sword within, with his Fort, youmust cut _Quarte_ under the Wrist, and if with his Feeble, you mustCounter-disengage from the Inside to the Outside.5th. If he makes a Feint in order to return in _Tierce_, you must eitherparry or take the Time as I have said.6th. If he disengages giving Light, to take a Counter on your Thrust,whether by Rispost or Time, you must make a Feint, and if he parrys withhis Fort you must cut under in _Seconde_, if with his Feeble, you mustdisengage and push _Quarte_, if he takes the Time strait, you must lowerthe body, if he takes Time lowering his body, you must parry and pushstrait in _Quarte_, if he cuts in _Flank_, you must parry crossing theSword in _Quarte_, and if he volts, you must parry and risposte in_Flanconnade_.If on the Engagement without, he comes to your Sword with his Fort, youmust cut under in _Seconde_, if with his Feeble, disengage or cut overthe Point in _Quarte_._When you are engaged within the_ Sword.If the Enemy engage you within with his Fort, you must cut under theWrist, and if with his Feeble, disengage from within to without, of ifyou don't care to do that, make a Feint without; if on this Feint hegoes to the Parade with his Fort, you must push _Seconde_ under, and ifwith his Feeble, disengage in _Quarte_.When the Enemy engages to make you push, in order to parry and rispost,you must, as I have said, make a Half-thrust and retire giving Light,in order to take him by a Counter to his thrust, by a Parade, or byTime.You may on the same Engagement, remain engaged on purpose, in order tomake the Adversary path strait; and in this Case, you must parry andrisposte where he is uncovered, or take Time lowering the Body.If after having engaged you he shou'd make a Feint, you must, by goingto the Parade, give Light on purpose, and if he pushes, take him by aContrary.If he engages to make you disengage, in order to take the Time on yourDisengagement, you must disengage and give him a little Light, and if hepushes at it, take him by a Rispost, or a Time opposite to his.If you are engaged in _Tierce_ with the Fort, you must cut under theWrist in _Seconde_, and if with the Feeble, and the Hand in _Quarte_,disengage to _Quarte_ within, or, by Way of Caution, make a Half-thrust;if the Adversary goes to the Parade, you must push where you have Light,and if he takes the Time, parry and risposte, or take a Time to his.You may also upon an Engagement in _Tierce_, make a Feint below, and ifhe takes the Time, parry above and risposte below. This Thrust is verygood against a Man that's disorder'd, who coming to the Parade above,gives room to hit him below.CHAP. XXI._Of several Guards, and the Manner of attacking them_.Tho' all the Guards are Good when well defended, yet they are notequally good; because we ought not to look upon any thing as good, thatdoes not procure us some Advantage, and an ill placed Guard, instead ofbeing favourable, requires a great deal of Skill to be of any Use atall, being farther from a Posture of Defence, the midling Guard onlycarrying with it such a Disposition of the Point and Wrist as issufficient to defend the Inside, the Outside, the Upper and Lower Partsof the Body with the Sword: For as to the other Guards, whether Flat,High, or Low, or holding the Sword with both Hands, they leave somePart uncovered, either by reason of their Height, or their Line._To attack a strait Guard._No Man of Skill or Reason will give a considerable Open without aDesign, and as the People who hold such a Guard as I am going todescribe, have their several Designs, you must be cautious of them, inorder not only to make them useless to them, but advantageous toyourself.Some Men hold their Swords strait or flat,[3] whether 'tis because theyare more used to Disengagements than Parades, or to take Advantage ofthe Superiority of their Stature, or of the Length of their Sword, toavoid the Attacks and Engagements to which the other Guards are moreexposed; for you can hardly engage or feint on this Guard, the Pointbeing too low; so that to attack him, you must bind the Sword, which youmust do after placing yourself within his Sword, binding his Blade underyours, when he is out of Measure, to take, with more Ease, the Feeble ofhis Sword, crossing it with yours, raising your Hand in _Seconde_, andcarrying the Point low, whilst gaining Measure, you form a little Circlewith the two Points, and raising them up again, you push _Seconde_within, with the Body low.Tho' it be almost impossible for the Enemy to disengage, when you havebound his Sword as I have described, it may happen that if some of theCircumstances were wanting, he might disengage and push, which ought notto hinder you from making your Thrust; because your Sword may very wellhit him, passing under his, which cannot hurt you, because of theLowness of your Body.The Binding is easy to be parryed, by reason of the natural Tendency tofollow the Sword, which is done by raising and bringing your Fortnearer. These following have commonly more Success.The first is made after having bound the Sword, instead of pushing_Seconde_ within, you must, upon the Parade, disengage and push _Tierce_over: If the Adversary is quick enough in his Parade to shun this doubleMotion, you must have recourse to the third, binding the Sword in thelike Manner, and feinting above, return below.Tho' the Sword is seldom bound on the Outside, upon some Occasions andto some People it would not be amiss; it must be done with your Feebleto the Enemy's, with the Precautions necessary in binding within, by alittle Circle without, the Hand in _Quarte_, and if he does not stir, orif he disengages, you must push without, the Hand in _Quarte_. Thesefollowing are according to the Parade with the Fort or with the Feeble,pushing _Seconde_ under, or _Quarte_ within.As in all Thrusts the Hand must be easy and uniform, it must be more soin this than in the others, because the Binding cannot be made without avery close and smooth Motion.Though several Masters teach to disengage in order to bind the Sword, Iwould not have it done so for two Reasons: First, because thedisengaging gives Time to the Opponent, not only to thrust strait, butalso to disengage; and Secondly, because you cannot so easily bind theSword as when you are on the same Side.In binding the Blade, you must close the Measure; because a Man who issuperior to you, in Height, by the Length of his Sword, or by hisSituation, won't let his Inferior into Measure; in one or the otherCase, being at a proper Distance, you bind more easily on the Feeble.[Illustration: 12th Plate. Attack in the high Guard.][Illustration: Attack in the low Guard.]_To attack the high Guard._In this Guard, you must place yourself under, with the Hand in_Seconde_, covering the upper Part, in order to oblige the Enemy to gounder; which being the most distant Place from his Sword, procures youmore Time to avoid him. He may, on this Occasion, do three things: Letyou engage him, go under, or force your Sword.If he lets you engage him, 'tis either with a Design to parry, or totake the Time; wherefore, before you push, you must make a Half-thrustunder: If he parrys, it will be in one of the three Ways that I haveshewn in the Parade of _Seconde_, Chap. 8, where you may see all theirCounters.If upon the Half-thrust he takes the Time, you must parry and rispostebelow, or push strait, opposing with the Hand; you may also volt onthis Occasion, but it is better to parry.If he opposes with his Hand upon your Half-thrust, you must parry withyour Left-hand, and, pushing near his Left Shoulder, baulk his Hand.And if he volts on your Half-thrust, you must parry and risposte in theFlank.If on the Engagement he thrust under, you must parry and thrust strait,or take the Time, opposing with your Hand, and if instead of goingunder, he only feints there in order to return above; you must eitherparry the Feint and risposte under, or push on the time, as I have saidbefore.If he makes use of the same Thrust, pushing at the Time of your goingunder, you must make believe to push there, returning quickly to theParade above, and risposte under.And if he would draw you on in order to make this Rispost on you, youmust make a Half-thrust, keeping on your Parade below, to rispostestrait in _Quarte_.If upon your Engagement he forces your Sword, you must yeild theFeeble, opposing with the Fort and the Left-hand. _See the 5th_ Plate.To keep the Enemy from forcing your Sword, you must cross his Blade withyour Fort to his Feeble._To attack the low Guard._Those who hold a low Guard have a Design either to parry with the Swordor with the Hand, to lower the Body or to volt; therefore as in theother Guards you must make a false Time, or half Thrust, and if heparrys with the Sword, thrust where you see Light, if he parry with theHand, you must feign a strait Thrust in order to bring his Left-hand tothe Parade, at the same time raising your Point with a little Circle,pushing at the left Side with the Hand in _Seconde_, the Body low,whereby you baulk his Left-hand, and for the greater Safety, you mustoppose his Thrust with your Hand, endeavouring in your Risposts, todeceive his Sword and his Hand.If he waits for your Thrust in order to lower the Body or to volt, youmust make a Half-thrust to draw him on, and take one of the Counterswhich I have spoken of before.If the low Guard is within your Sword, you must attack it making aSemi-circle with the Point of the Sword down, lashing and crossing his,the Hand in _Quarte_, and to push without Danger, you must oppose withthe Left-hand: This Thrust is good against a Man that pushes at the sameTime.If the low Guard is without your Sword, you must lash in _Tierce_,crossing the Sword and push without.If the low Guard is neither within nor without, you must lash smartly in_Tierce_ and in _Quarte_, that is to say on his Outside and Inside,pushing _Quarte_ afterwards, opposing with the Left-hand: This Thrustpuzzles a Man who disengages quick, which in this Case is of no use.You may also engage this Guard placing yourself within, the Wrist in_Tierce_, and the Point low[4] closing the Enemy pretty near to obligehim to push above, and if he pushes there, you must parry and risposteabove, or under, according as you have Light.If instead of making a Thrust above, he makes a Feint there and pusheswithin, or under, you must push _Quarte_, opposing with the Left-hand,or else going to the Parade with the Sword to all Thrusts and Feintswithout, leave to the Left-hand the Defense of the Inside, and of theunder Part.And if instead of pushing, he waits for your Thrust to take the Timeupon it, you must press close upon him and push strait in _Quarte_, withthe Point low, opposing with the Left hand, in order to throw off hisSword, or push at his Arm, of which you are in Reach, though he is notin Measure of your Body.These Sorts of Guards are not so much practised, with Sword in Hand, asthe middling Guard, People being more careful of parrying with theSword, and a Man is in much better Condition to parry from the middlingGuard than from any other._To attack the Guard where the Sword is held in both Hands._Those who hold the Sword in both Hands, that is to say, the Handle inthe Right-hand, and the Blade about four Fingers Breadth in the Left,will either engage, or beat on your Sword, with great Force, or stick toa strong Parade, in order to uncover you the more, in Favour of theirThrust.But as they cannot keep this Situation without exposing their Body verymuch, which is often dangerous, as also a very unseemly Posture, thisGuard is therefore, with good Reason, condemned by most, if not all,experience'd Masters.If you have to do with one that holds this Guard, you must keep yourPoint a little low, and be always ready to change, in order to renderthe Strength which the Left-hand gives to the Right, useless, in hisengaging or beating.If he will not attack you, but waits for your Thrust in order to parryand risposte, you must make a Half-thrust, and recover quickly to yourParade, to avoid his Rispost; wherein, throwing back his Left-hand, andabandoning himself extremely, he is not in a Condition to avoid yourThrust after you have parryed his.You may also make a Home-thrust on him, by a single or double Feint,because these require two or three Parades; so that your Adversary beingunable to parry without throwing his Point a great way off, he cannotbring it back in time if you disorder him by a Feint.You may likewise catch him, by placing your Sword along his, with yourPoint a little raised, and sliding on a Defence along his Sword, push athis Left-hand or Arm, for he cannot, tho' he goes to his Parade, hinderyour Blade from sliding so as to hit him there, without running anyRisque, you being in Measure of his Hand and Arm, when he is out ofReach of your Body.You are to observe, that in all Guards with Sword in Hand, you must pushat the nearest and most uncovered Part; which in the Guards that I havedescribed is the Arm; therefore you must not abandon yourself to hitthe Body, but in risposting, or after having disordered, or engaged theEnemy as aforesaid.CHAP. XXII._Of Left-handed Men._Most People imagine that a Left-handed Man has, by Nature, the Advantageof a Right-handed Man in Fencing, whereas he has it only by Habit,exercising oftener with Right-handed Men than a Right-handed Man withhim, as well in Lessons as in Assaults, most Masters being Right-handed,as well as most of the Scholars, taking Lessons from the Right-hand, andpractising seldom with Left-handed Men, find themselves puzzled, nothingsurprizing more than what one is not used to, which is so true, that toembarrass a Left-handed Man, who has not fenced much, you must putanother against him; I say one that has not fenced much, because Rightor Left-handed Men who go to the School of a perfect Master, will betaught to use both Hands, by which Means, they will not be so muchsurprized when they meet with a Left-handed Man, as they would otherwisebe.When a Right and a Left-handed Man fence together, the Right handed Manshould push but seldom within, that being the Antagonist's strongestPart; and his weakest and outward, which should be kept covered, or in adefensive Condition, as the most liable to be attacked; the best Way isto push _Quarte_ without, Engagements, Feints under, and Thrusts above,and double Feints, finished above or under the Wrist in _Quarte_, Cutsover the Point without, and upon the Parade, with the Fort, or with theFeeble, redoubling _Quarte_ under the Wrist, or _Seconde_ over: Theseare chiefly the Thrusts which a Right-handed and a Left-handed Man maymake against each other, whether on an Attack, or in Defence, by Time orRisposts.Several Masters puzzle their Scholars by telling them that with aLeft-handed Man they must act quite contrary to what they do with aRight-handed, which appears to be false; because to a Right orLeft-handed Man you must push, opposing with the Sword, which is to bedone by pushing _Quarte_, when the Enemy is within your Sword, and_Tierce_, when he is without. All the Difference between a Right and aLeft-handed Man is, that two Right, or two Left-handed Men, are bothwithin or without, whereas a Right with a Left-handed Man, the one iswithin when the other is without, the one in _Quarte_, the other in_Tierce_.CHAP. XXIII._Of the Parade of the Hand._There are, in Fencing, three Parades with the Left-hand: The first, likethe Opposition that is from the Top to the Bottom; the second, with thePalm of the Hand without, towards the Right Shoulder, and the third,from the Bottom to the Top, with the Outside of the Hand: Of these threeParades, the first is the easiest, the most used, and the leastdangerous: They are condemned by able Men, as weakening those of theSword; wherefore it is wrong in a Master to shew them to a Scholar,before he has practised those of the Blade a good while, which beinglonger, can return to all feints, which the Left-hand cannot, it beingimpossible to parry with it except you be near, which is very dangerous,as well by reason of the Difficulty of meeting properly with the Sword,as of the Facility of deceiving the Hand, which in this Case has notTime to come to the Parade, because of it's small Distance; and besidesthe Facility of deceiving it, you need only push at the Arm, Sword inHand, in order to make it useless._Of the Opposition of the Hand._Many People make no Distinction between the Parade and Opposition of theHand, tho' there is a very great Difference, the Parade being made onlyagainst the Adversary's Thrust, and the Opposition to prevent afollowing Thrust after having parryed with the Sword, which is verynecessary in most Thrusts, especially in the Risposts which may be madeto your Thrust in _Seconde_.Besides the Opposition of the Hand, after having parryed with the Sword,you may oppose with it, taking the Time, that is to say, when the Enemypushes from above to below, as the motion of his sword is greater thanyour's, having only a strait line to push _Quarte_ on, whereas his fromabove to below, is crooked, so that pushing upon his time, he cannotavoid the thrust, and you may easily oppose his with the Left-hand,which is very different from the parade with the hand, to which you donot push 'till after you have parryed.CHAP. XXIV._Of the beat of the Foot, in closing the measure, or in the same place._Though it may seem to many people, that the beat of the Foot, in gainingmeasure, making appels, or alurements, engagements, or other Thrusts, israther ornamental than necessary; nevertheless, there is nothing putsthe Foot in a better condition to follow the swiftness of the Wrist, inmost of the actions of the Sword; nor can any thing contribute more tothe equal situation, and to the retention of the Body, qualities, whichkeeping you covered from the time of your combatant, procures you themeans, not only of taking advantage of his, but also of possessingfirmness, freedom, justness and swiftness. You are to observe two sortsof beating, the one with the Foot firm in the same place, the othergaining measure; the Beat with the Foot firm, is done in two ways, theone in appels, or alurements on the Blade, and the other in engagementsor Feints. That upon the allurement on the Blade, may be made by asingle beat of the Foot, but those who are pretty well advanced, maketwo without lifting the Foot but once, the first with the Point, and theother with the whole Foot: that on engagements or single Feints, shou'dhave but one beat, the thrust being to be made on the second motion. Thebeat of the Foot in marching or advancing, is also divided into twosorts, the one in Engagements or single Feints, and the other inEngagements and Feints following, or in double Feints; the manner ofengaging must be with a single beat gaining measure, and that ofengaging with a double Feint, must be done with a double beat, in orderto agree with the motion of the Wrist; and as in all, including thelunge, there must be three beats; you must, on the First Time or Feint,beat with the whole Foot in the same Place, at the second Motion of theWrist beat again with the foot getting Measure, and at the third Motionpush.You must observe, that between the first and second Motion, there is noInterval, but between the second and third there is, in order to seewhere the Enemy gives Light: This Interval must be shorter or longeraccording as your Disposition or Practice is more or less.CHAP. XXV._Of the Good Effects of a nice Discernment of the Eye._In Fencing, there is the Foreseen, and the Unforeseen; the Foreseen isthe Effect of the Understanding and of the Will, and the Unforeseen isthe Effect of the Discernment of the Eye, and of Custom; which beingupheld by this Quality, has no sooner discerned an Action or Opening ofthe Enemy, than all the Parts which are to act, display themselves tooppose or attack him, as if they depended on the Eye. To be convinced ofthis Truth, you may reflect on READING, wherein, as soon as the Eye hasdiscerned the Words, the pronouncing them follows as quick as in astudied Discourse; the Eye and Tongue being so disposed by Custom, as todo it without immediately reflecting. Indeed before they cou'd arrive tothis, the Understanding and the Will were necessary, which having beenunited for a certain Time, have communicated such a Habit to theseParts, as to make them act as it were of themselves.In order to acquire this Quality in Fencing, it is necessary that theMaster, in his Lessons, shou'd shew what Opportunities are to befavourably laid hold of, two opposite Actions at one and the same Time,That whilst he is uncovering some Part of his Body, he cannot, at thesame Instant, parry, because by the Parade, it must be covered; so thatby making them make their Thrusts, and other Motions, by the Discernmentof the Eye, they find themselves by Practice ready to oppose all theMotions of the Antagonist without the Assistance of the Will. ThisMethod is indeed a little more tedious in the Beginning, but itafterwards becomes shorter and more certain.If you have not had Practice enough to make the Discernment of the Eyethus habitual, you must observe what Motions your Action causes in theAdversary, by making a Half, or Home-thrust, in order to discoverwhether the Enemy has recourse to the Parade, or to the Time: If he goesto parry, you must observe his Manner, in order to make a Feintresembling the same Thrust, and to push at the Part where you observedhim to give the Light; and if he goes to the Time, you also make aFeint, preparing yourself for the parade and Rispost, or to take a Timecontrary to his.CHAP. XXVI._Of Time_.If we were to follow the exact Term of Time, every Thing that is done inFencing might be called so; for you shou'd never thrust but when youhave a favourable Opportunity of hitting, nor parry, but at the Timethat favours you to oppose the Enemy's Sword, not make an Engagement,nor a Feint, but to take the Time upon the Motion that your Actionoccasions in the Adversary.Time is the Duration of any Motion: It is called Time because it is themost favourable Opportunity of pushing, the Enemy being unable duringone Action to do a contrary one.It is divided into several Manners and Terms: The first is called theTime, the second, taking his Time, the third, Time to Time, the fourth,the same Time, and the fifth, false Time.1. Taking the Time, is making your Thrust by a judicious Discernment onthe Motion of the Enemy, taking him by a contrary one: You are to knowthat every Motion, of whatever Part it be, is called Time; for whichReason, I shall say nothing of Feints, Engagements, and Disengagements,upon which it may be taken; and that in three Manners, _viz._ strait,lowering the Body, or volting it, which you must know how to apply. In astrait Thrust the Time shou'd be taken by lowering and volting the Body,because the Thrust coming strait, if you were to push the same Way, youwould, by supporting the Wrist, make a _Contrast_; and by pushingcrooked, you would make a _Coup Fourres_, or an interchanged Thrust; butif the Thrust be in Two Times, or Motions, you may push on the first; Ifit be in three Motions, on the second. As to the volting and loweringthe Body, they may be used on all Motions, provided they be abandoned,and that the Enemy does not keep back his Body to draw you on.2. Taking his Time, is the most subtle Thing in Fencing, dependingprincipally on the Mind: The Manner of taking it proceeds from yourPlace or Situation, which gives you an opportunity of knowing the fortand the feeble of the enemy, so that feeling his blade with your's, youmay by a judicious custom, push at a proper instant, according as youfind the weakness of his sword; and though it may seem that the enemy,in the same guard, and at the same distance, can as easily parry; thatdoes not happen because of his different design to push, disengage, ormake a feint, by reason of the several operations of the mind whichfollow the will.3. The Time to Time, or the Counter to Time, is by several people,called Counter-time: this cannot in effect alter this necessary part ofthe art; it being but an impropriety in terms; when they say that makinga motion to bring the Enemy on, and when he is going to make a Thrust,the making a Counter; this is by consequence a Counter Time, like aCounter-disengagement, without observing that a Counter-time is nothingbut an ill timed Motion, which should upon all occasions be avoided: andif that argument were to take place, it might be said that there is nosuch thing in fencing as taking the Time, because it is to be done onlyby taking a Time contrary to that which is intended to be taken of you,which according to their Argument would be a Counter-time; whereas theTerm Time to Time, or counter to Time, sufficiently shews, that itrequires three Motions; since the taking the Time requires two, and thetaking it at the Time that he takes it, must require a third. Of thesethree Motions you are to make two: The first, in order to get one fromthe Enemy, that you may have an Advantage by your second, which is thethird Time; so that when he thinks to take the Time upon you, you takeit upon him, which, far from being a Counter-time, is a Time to his, orCounter to his Time.4. The same Time, depends on three Things: First, that both having aDesign to push, you both push by chance at once, without expecting itfrom each other: Secondly: That full of the Design to take the Time, andnot knowing it, you push upon the Enemy's Thrust, without foreseeing howto avoid it; and thirdly, when an Inferior or desperate Man, unable todefend himself, had rather run on your Thrust in endeavouring to hityou, than strive in vain to avoid it. These are not only the Occasionsof the same Time, but also of the _Coups Fourres_.It is to be observed, that Time, and the same Time, differ only intheir Figure, and not in their Occasion, as Monsieur _De la Touche_says, for to take the Time upon a Thrust, you must go off upon theLunge, as if it were on the same Time, except that the Figure of theBody shuns the Thrust, which in that of the same Time it does not do.5. False Time, is a Motion made by the Enemy to draw you on, in order totake a Time upon your's; therefore he that would take the Time, shou'ddistinguish whether the Motion made, is to disorder him, and take theAdvantage of his Parade, or to make him thrust, and take the Advantageof his Lunge; In Case of the first, it would be a Fault not to push; andin Case of the other, it would be amiss to push. Some Masters call thefalse Time, Half Time, which is wrong, every Motion being a Time, and asit is impossible to make a Half Motion, so 'tis impossible to make aHalf Time.The Difference of Time between the dexterous and awkard is, that thedexterous present and take the Time, and the others, give and lose it.CHAP. XXVII._Of Swiftness_.Swiftness is the Shortness of Time between the Beginning and End of aMotion: It proceeds from a regular and frequent Exercise, joined with agood Disposition; that is to say, Vigour and Suppleness, which formAgility.A great Swiftness cannot be acquired without long Practice and a goodDisposition, the one not being sufficient, without the other, to giveit: For the best natural Parts, without Practice, will be of very littleService to those who have the best Disposition; and the most regularPractice without the Assistance of Nature, will never make a Manperfectly Swift.Swiftness in Fencing, is so necessary, that without this Quality, it isvery difficult to defend, and impossible to offend: This Truth is sowell known, that every one is earnestly desirous of it, tho' most Peopleare ignorant of the Means necessary to acquire it.What contributes most to the becoming swift, besides, frequent Exerciseand a fine Disposition, is a perfect Situation of the Parts, theRetention of the Body, and the regular Motion of the Wrist: TheSituation requires this advantageous Point of all the Parts, tocommunicate Freedom and Vigour to the Action, that they may act withQuickness. In order to retain the Body, it is necessary that it bealways in it's perfect Situation, during the Motions previous to theThrust; and if the Thrust consist of one Time only, the Wrist mustbegin.As to the Motion of the Hand, it must not only be animated, but also theAction must not be wide, whether in Disengagements, Engagements, Feints,or Risposts; because if you would be soon at your Mark, it is notsufficient to go quick, but it is also necessary that the Action beclose.Many People have confounded the Swiftness of pushing with precipitate orconsecutive Thrusts, without considering that Precipitation is eitherwhen the Body moves before the Hand, or when an improper Motion is made;and the consecutive Thrusts, the pushing several Times without Interval,or when there is no Occasion; which may be done by one who is not swift;for Swiftness is only the Shortness of Time between the Beginning andEnd of an Action, as I have already said.Swiftness and Time are very justly called the Soul of Fencing, and allThrusts owe their Success to these Qualities; for you cannot hit but bySurprize, nor surprize but by Swiftness.There are three Ways of surprizing in Fencing: The first is theSituation of the Guard, taking his Time: The second, is doing an Actionto disorder the Enemy, in order to hit him, at that Time, where he isopen; and the third is when the Opponent attacks you, either by Feints,Engagements, or Lunges, you take him upon the Time. Tho' these threeSorts of Surprize require a certain Point of Swiftness, the first needsthe most, having no other Support; but the two others have the Advantageof having disorder'd the Enemy.Although Time, Swiftness, and the other Qualities are absolutelynecessary in Fencing, without their just Concurrence they are useless.In order to acquire which, the Wrist must be easy by Practice, that youmay hit where you see Light.CHAP. XXVIII._Of Measure_.Time, Swiftness, and Justness, without the Knowledge of Measure, wouldbe in vain, Thrusts from afar being of no Use, and from near, dangerous;and the other Motions shou'd also be at a certain Distance, in order notonly to be ready for the Time, but also to take Advantage of theDisorder of the Enemy. The Measure is taken from you to the Enemy, andfrom the Enemy to you: The first is easier known, as well because it isnaturally so, as by the Custom of your Lunge, which being, in regard ofyourself, always the same, makes it easier by Practice: The Measure fromthe Enemy to you is difficult, from the Difference in Persons whoseStature, Activity, or Swords, are not always alike; and tho' the Heightshou'd be the same, the Arms, Thighs and Legs are not proportionable;besides there are big Men that have short Arms, and little Men that havelong Arms. It is likewise so in regard to the Clift; some being longerin the Fork than others; and though two Men shou'd in that Particular bealike, if one of them has shorter Legs than the other, he will reachfarther, because his Thighs are longer, and in the Lunge, only one ofthe Legs contributes to it's Length, the other making a Line almostperpendicular, whereas the two Thighs making a strait Line, contributeequally to the Extention.The Difference in Suppleness, also makes a Difference in the Extention;a Man who has the Freedom of his Shoulders and Hips, going farther thanone that has them constrain'd. It may also happen that two Men of likeProportion and Freedom of Parts, may not have an equal Extention, bytheir being taught differently; some Masters teaching to keep the Bodyupright, the Wrist raised, or too much on one Side, and the Left-footfirst; whereas the Body shou'd lean a little forward, without raisingor carrying the Hand to one Side, farther than to keep the Bodycovered, and the Left-foot shou'd lye down on the Edge; this Situationgives a greater Length than the other.The different Lengths of Swords sometimes make it difficult to know theMeasure, and makes it impossible to fix it by Rule, as several Mastershave pretended: Some of them say that the Measure is just, when thePoints cross each other a Foot; others, with as little Reason, wou'dhave the Middle of your Blade touch the Point of the Adversary's; butwhat gives a true Knowledge of the Measure is frequent Exercise,accompanied with a good Judgment, pushing often _Quart_ and _Tierce_with different Foils, and being pushed at by different Persons.The Extention is taken from the Left-foot, which is the Centre, to theButton of the Foil.I did design, in this Place, to treat of Time, and of a regular Way ofpushing in Lessons, from the Beginning to the End of one Year, accordingto the Disposition of Scholars; but after I had finished it, I thoughtthat my Fellow-Brethren would perhaps take it ill that I shouldprescribe Lessons to their Scholars, by which, instead of gaining theirgood Opinion, I might incur the Accusation of being more busy thanknowing.CHAP. XXIX._Of the Necessity of some Qualities in a Master_.In order to teach well, it's necessary to have a perfect Idea of theMeans which conduce from the Beginning to the End of the Matterproposed, I mean to it's Perfection, or to what comes nearest it, if ourAge has not as yet arrived to it.In Fencing, as well as in other Exercises, there should be Judgment andKnowledge how to act and how to Teach: The first is the Effect of a longand good Theory; the second, of a good Theory, long Practice, and a goodDisposition; and the third, besides the Theory and Practice, is theEffect of a good Genius, or of a particular Talent.Qualities which shou'd be always united; so that the Genius may becapable of teaching properly to different Persons, the Application ofthe Rules which are acquired by Experience.It is as necessary in this Art that a Master's Motions shou'd beregular, and that he shou'd hold the Foil properly in his Hand, as it isfor a Writing Master to draw the Example well that he would have copied;so that the Scholar of the one, or of the other, may learn a betterMotion, or a finer Character. It is also proper that when a Scholarcommits a Fault, the Master shou'd shame him by imitating it, the seeingthe Fault making a greater Impression than the hearing of it.A Master in his Lesson shou'd give a Time to the Scholar to make himpush, in order to teach him to take the Enemy's Time. He shou'd likewisesometimes beat back his Body, and parry him from time to time, that hemay accustom him to be firm on his Legs, to oppose his Sword well, andto recover well: It is good sometimes to let him make several Thrustsfollowing, and then remaining firm all of a sudden, to shew him, that heshou'd always be ready to thrust when an Opportunity offers, and toretain himself when it does not offer.In order to make him take the Time well, and to form his Parade andRispost properly, the Time that the Master gives must have a Regard toRule, and sometimes to the Disorder of an unskilful Enemy, that he maybe equally fortifyed for both; and to form his Parade and Rispost theMaster must push in the Manner the most like to an Assault.Though most Masters give Lessons with shorter and stiffer Foils than areused in assaulting or playing loose, I esteem it better always to usethe same Foils that they may not be deceived in an Assault.A Master's Play shou'd be neat, subtle agreeable, and useful, as fit forCombat as for the School.The Art of Fencing being to make the most of a good or bad Disposition,when 'tis good 'tis capable of being made perfectly dexterous, and whenbad, the Defect of Nature is to be repaired by Art.By saying that 'tis no hard Matter to perfect such Men as are naturallyof a very good Disposition, is meant the bringing them to a certainPoint which they could almost arrive to of themselves, by Practice andSpeculation; but it is well known that it is the Business of a goodMaster to make his Scholar perfectly dexterous, and tho' he may have agood Disposition and long Exercise, if he is not well instructed, hecannot become dexterous, even tho' he shou'd execute with Agility, beingincapable of acquiring a Good without knowing and practising it.A good Disposition is seldom to be met with, for there is generally aMixture of bad Parts with the good. Some have a supple, light andvigorous Body, and with these Qualities a heavy or ill adjusted Hand;and others that have as good a Disposition as is desirable, have anarrow Genius, fearing to undertake any thing, or are hot andinconsiderate, which shews that it is only be a perfect Accord of theParts and Understanding that a Man can be perfectly dexterous.In short an able Master does not only shew the Fault, and whence itproceeds, but also the Danger to which it exposes, and the Means toleave it. A Master whose Play is regular, or who has the bestFoundation, may properly be said to be a good Master.CHAP. XXX._Rules for pushing and parrying at the Wall, and for making an Assault._Though 'tis absolutely necessary to begin by way of Lesson, and tocontinue in it a long Time, in order that Practice growing to a Habit,may give Liberty to the Parts to form themselves: nevertheless howeverwell you may take your Lessons, some other Means are necessary to makean Assault well, than those which the Master gives at his _Plastron_:This Rule must be supported by pushing and parrying at the Wall, and inthe Manner I am going to lay down.When you have laboured a certain Time at Lessons, you must push at aCushion which is fixed against the Wall for that Purpose, observing theGuard, and the Measure or Extention of the Thrust; and that the Handdisplay itself in _Quart_, not only according to the Rule, but first,adjusting and supporting the Thrust, and that all the Parts be placedin the most advantageous Situation for the Thrust and Recovery, whichshou'd be very regularly observed.After having lunged for some Days on the Cushion, to fix the Wrist andBody a little, you must push at a Scholar, who Being placed at the Wallwill parry your Thrusts; you shou'd be in Measure, and to see if it bejust, you must lunge in _Quart_, placing the Button softly on the Body,at the same time taking off your Hat, having taken the Measure you mustrecover in Guard, and place yourself on the Outside of his Sword inorder to disengage and push _Quart_, being more careful of pushingjustly than hitting; he that parrys shou'd from time to time drop hisFoil, which will shew whether he that pushes follows the Blade or theLine of the Body; having remain'd some Time upon the Lunge to form theSupport of the Wrist and the Posture of the Body you recover to Guard.When you lunge pretty well in _Quart_, you may disengage and push_Tierce_, and when the Thrust is pushed and parryed, you may recover andpush _Seconde_ under.When you have pushed for some Time in this Manner, you may practise toparry, putting yourself for that Purpose to the Wall, which furnishes abetter Parade than at large, where you are used to draw back the Bodywhich weakens it, whereas here you cannot, which makes the Paradestronger, having no Dependence but on the Foil; you shou'd chuse aScholar that pushes the most regularly, it being difficult without that,that a Beginner shou'd learn to parry justly.Most young Beginners endeavour to hit at any Rate, instead of practisingwhat would be beneficial to them, but instead of deceiving others theydeceive themselves, by practising less how to form themselves and pushaccording to Rule, than how to spoil their Bodies, and destroy theSolidity of the Principles: Some use themselves to push with the Wristonly, without the Foot, which is dangerous, by reason of the too greatMeasure; others with as little Reason, and as much Danger, placethemselves without binding the Blade, and thrust under the Wrist; in theone the Situation of the Guard is good for nothing, and in the otherthere is no Defence if the Adversary thrusts at that time: Othersdeceive by making a Time or Motion when they are placed, but the pushingat the Wall requires only the Justness and Swiftness of the Thrust;others put themselves very near baulking the Measure, which may be donefour Ways, tho' the Left-foot may be in it's proper Place, and kept firmin the Thrust; the first is done by marking or bringing forward thePoint of the Left-foot, keeping it a little in, then advancing the Heel,which gives more Measure; secondly, by keeping back the Body on a Lunge,you deceive the Measure and hit by abandoning it forward, which gives ita greater Extention, thirdly, by raising or carrying the Wrist too high,or too much to one Side, which shortning the Thrust, makes it believedthat you are out of Reach, but according to the Rule and Line you aretoo much in Reach; fourthly, some take Measure by holding the Thumb onthe Body of the Guard, and when they have a mind to hit they hold it onthe Middle of the Handle, with the Pommel in the Hand, which also givesa greater Length.When you have for some time used yourself to push and parry at the Wall,according to the Rules that I have laid down, you must, (tho' 'tis notthe Rule of Schools, especially when you push with Strangers,) you mustI say, when you push with a Scholar of your own Master, push and parry aThrust alternately, disengaging, and then do the same Feinting, andsometime after you shou'd make the other Thrusts, telling one anotheryour design, which makes you execute and parry them by Rule, especiallyif you reflect on the Motions and Postures of the Lunges and Parades.Being a little formed to this method, you may, being warned of theThrust, parry it, telling the Adversary where you intend your Riposte,which puts him in a condition to avoid it, and gives him room toredouble after his Parade, either strait or by a Feint, at which you arenot surprised, expecting by being forewarned the Thrust he is to make,which puts you easily on your Defence and Offence: by this manner ofExercise, you may not only improve faster, but with more art, the Eyeand Parts being insensibly disposed to follow the Rule, whereas withoutthis Method, the difference that there is between a lesson of assaultinga Man who forewarns you, helps you, and lets you hit him, and anotherwho endeavours to defend himself and hit you, is, that except thePractice of Lessons be very well taught by long exercise, you fall intoa Disorder which is often owing to the want of Art more than to anyDefect in Nature. The taking a Lesson well, and the Manner of Pushingand Parrying which I have just described, may be attained to by Practiceonly, but some other things are necessary to make an Assault well; forbesides the Turn of the Body, the Lightness, Suppleness and Vigour whichcompose the exteriour Part, you must be stout and prudent, qualities soessential, that without them you cannot act with a good Grace, nor tothe purpose. If you are apprehensive, besides, that you don't push home,or justly, fear making you keep back your Thrust, or follow the Blade,the least Motion of the Enemy disorders you, and puts you out of aCondition to hit him, and to avoid his Thrusts. Without Prudence, youcannot take the advantage of the situation, motions designs of theenemy, which changing very often, according to his Capacity and to theMeasure, demonstrates that an ill concerted Enterprise exposes more toDanger than it procures Advantage: in order to turn this Quality to anadvantage, you are to observe the Enemy's _fort_ and _feeble_, whetherhe attack or defend; if he attack it will be either by plain Thrustsstrait, or disengaged, or by Feints or Engagements, which may be opposedby Time, or Ripostes: if he keeps on his Defence, it is either to takethe Time or to Riposte. In case of the first; you shou'd, by halfThrusts, oblige him to push in order to take a Counter to his Time, andif he sticks to his Parade you must serve in what Manner, in order todisorder him by Feints, and push where he gives Light.It would fill a whole Volume to describe the Thrusts that may be made,according to the Difference of Persons, as well to surprise as to avoidbeing surprised; besides the many Repetitions wou'd be extremelypuzzling, for which Reason, I have, instead of them, laid down thefollowing Advices, which contain chiefly, what I cou'd not otherwisehave communicated without a long Treatise.Don't put yourself in Guard within the Reach of the Enemy.Make no wry Faces, or Motions that are disagreeable to the Sight.Be not affected, negligent, nor stiff.Don't flatter yourself in your Lessons, and still less in Assaults.Be not angry at receiving a Thrust, but take care to avoid it.Be not vain at the Thrusts you give, nor shew Contempt when you receivethem.Do not endeavour to give many Thrusts, running the Risque of receivingone.Don't think yourself expert, but that you may become so.When you present the Foils, give the Choice without pressing.If you are much inferiour, make no long Assaults.Do nothing that's useless, every Action shou'd tend to your Advantage.Lessons and Assaults are only valuable when the Application and Geniusmake them so.Too good an Opinion spoils many People, and too bad a one still more.A natural Disposition and Practice are necessary in Lessons, but inAssaults there must be a Genius besides.The Goodness of Lessons and of Assaults does not consist so much in theLength as in the Manner of them.When you have to do with one that's bold and forward, it is necessaryto seem apprehensive in order to get a favourable Opportunity.If you act against one that's fearful, attack him briskly to put him inDisorder.Before you applaud a Thrust given, examine if Chance had no Hand in it.Thrusts of Experience, and those of Chance are different, the first comeoften, the others seldom or never happen, you may depend on one, but noton the other.In Battle let Valour and Prudence go together, the Lyon's Courage withthe Fox's Craft.To be in Possession of what you know, you must be in Possession ofyourself.Undertake nothing but what your Strength and the Capacity of the Enemywill admit of in the Execution.The Beauty of an Assault appears in the Execution of the Design.Make no Thrust without considering the Advantage and the Danger of it.If the Eye and Wrist precede the Body, the Execution will be good.Be always cautious, Time lost cannot be regained.If you can hit without a Feint, make none, two Motions are moredangerous than one.To know what you risque, you must know what you are worth.If you would do well, acquire the agreeable and useful.Twenty good Qualities will not make you perfect, and one bad one willhinder your being so.Judge of a Thrust, rather by Reason than by it's Success; the one mayfail, but the other cannot.To parry well is much, but it is nothing when you can do more.Let your Guard, and your Play be always directly opposite to the Enemy.Practice is either a Good or an Evil; all consists in the Choice of it.When you think yourself skilful and dexterous, 'tis then you are not so.'Tis not enough that your Parts agree, they must also answer the Enemy'sMotions.The knowing a Good without practising it, turns to an Evil.Two skilful Men acting together, fight more with their Heads than withtheir Hands.If you are superiour to your Enemy, press him close, and if you areinferiour, break Measure to keep him moving.Endeavour both to discover the Enemy's Design, and to conceal your own.When the Eye and the Hand agree in the same instant, you are perfectlyright.Draw not your Sword, but to serve the King, preserve your Honour, ordefend your Life.CHAP. XXXI._Against several erroneous Opinions._Though there are People of a bad Taste in every Art or Science, thereare more in that of Fencing than in others, as well by Reason of thelittle Understanding of some Teachers, as of the little Practice of someLearners, who are not acting upon a good Foundation, or long enough, tohave a good idea of it, argue so weakly on this Exercise, that I thoughtit as much my Business to observe their Errors, as it is my Duty toinstruct those that I have the Honour to teach in the Theory of it: Bythis Means, I may furnish the One with juster Sentiments, and theOthers with the Means of preserving their Honour and Lives.I begin with those, who defer letting their Children learn 'till theyhave attained a certain Age, Growth and Strength. If these threeQualities would enable them to put this Art in Execution immediately, Iacknowledge that they ought not to begin 'till they possessed them; butit is by long Experience and Practice only, that they can becomeperfect; so that except they begin young, the Employments for which theyare designed, may not give them Time to arrive to it; besides, bybeginning in a tender Age, the Body is more easily brought to a goodAir, and an easy Disengagement; being more at Liberty, and less used toFaults, which it would naturally fall into for want of being cultivated.Others say that it is needless to learn when the Disposition is wanting,which is an Error; for a Body that is well disposed by Nature, canbetter dispense with the Want of Improvement, than those that she hastaken less care of; these requiring a constant Labour, to acquire whatthe others have almost of themselves; and tho' they cannot arrive to aperfect Agility, yet their Bodies will be better disposed to act, andtheir Lives not so much in Danger.Some assure you that the knowing how to Fence, makes a Man quarrelsome,and thereby exposes him to dangerous Consequences, without consideringit is a natural Brutality, Honour, or Danger, which obliges him toattack another, or defend himself, which he would do without havinglearned, with this Difference; that though he have the same Brutality orCourage, the Issue of the Battle is not the same; and if he haveOccasion to defend himself, would it not be better for him to be able todo it, than to leave his Life to an uncertain and dangerous Hazard.Others say that it is enough to learn one Exercise at a time; that aPlurality of different Lessons fatigues the Mind and the Body: But asone Science disposes the Mind for the others, they having a Sort of aCorrespondence one with another, so Exercises favour one another as wellin regard to the Posture of the Body, as to the Freedom of Motion;besides, that learning them one after another, as each Particular wouldtake up as much Time as all in general, this Length of Time would be toogreat for any one almost to succed in them.Many People say that with Sword in Hand the Rules of the School are notobserved, and that 'tis sufficient to have a good Heart: It is certainthat People who are subject to this Error, are not capable of followingthe Rules which are to be acquired only by putting a good Theory inPractice; which by frequent Use, disposes the Eye and the Part ofExecuting so well, that it is almost impossible to act otherwise: And asto the Practice of Schools and of the Sword, 'tis the same; for no oneought to do any thing with the Foil, but what he knows by Experience tobe without Risque, according to his Rules. In some Cases, it is true,what is esteemed good in one, is not in the other. For Example: Thrustswith the Foil are good only on the Body, and with the Sword they aregood every where; and that in an Assault with the Foil, the joining isreckoned as nothing, whereas in Battle 'tis the Seal of the Victory; butexcept in that, it should be alike in every Thing.Others say that if they had to do with experienced Men, they would notgive them Time to put themselves in Guard; as if a Man who is expertwere not always on his Guard, being more knowing, and better disposed,not only to place himself at once, by the Habit that all his Parts havecontrasted, but also to surprise, and to avoid being surprised, by theKnowledge he has of Time and Measure: On the contrary, an unskilfulPerson being ignorant of both, is easily catch'd; besides, that hisParts being unaccustomed to place themselves regularly, or at once, mustalways be in a continual Motion, vainly seeking their Place, by whichthey give the Time, and would lose it if it were given to them.Some, in Opposition to these, say that if they know how to keepthemselves in Guard 'tis sufficient. They are in the right if the Guardbe perfect, which is not to be acquired but by a Practice as long as isnecessary to make them perfectly dexterous, which is not their Meaning;they thinking that it is only the placing of the Parts, which isuseless, without Freedom and Vigour to manage them. These are Qualitieswhich when accompanied with a certain regular Air, and a good Grace,shew, as soon as a Man takes a Sword or Foil in his Hand, to what Pitchof Dexterity he is arrived.Some Men will tell you that they know enough to serve their Turn: Thosewho use this Expression, as well as those I have spoken of before,sufficiently shew that they have learnt but little or nothing. In Effectit is no hard Matter to judge of the different Degrees of Ability; sothat when a Man finds himself inferiour, he cannot properly say that heknows enough to serve his Turn; and a Man who is superiour, knows verywell that he is not perfect, and that if his good Disposition togetherwith his long Practice, has brought him very forward in the Art, othersmay know as much as he, and that therefore he is not so perfect as anunskilful Person may imagine.I have heard several People say that they did not care to be dexterous,nor to know the five Rules, provided they knew how to defend themselves,and to push and parry well; and really they are in the right, supposingthey could do that without practising what the most able Men haveinvented upon this Occasion.There are People that say, that with Sword in Hand, against an able Man,there is nothing to be done but push vigorously, to disorder him: I amapt to believe that this may succeed against a Man who is not wellform'd, or has not the Courage and Resolution that is necessary; but ifhe has enough to keep up his Spirit, this Attack will be advantageous tohim; because it cannot be done without giving him an Opportunity ofgetting the better; and besides, I have Reason to believe that thegreatest Part of those who talk in this Manner, would hardly attempt anable Man.It may be said that People have then fought in this Manner with Success;but as there is Difference in Persons, what succeeded with them againstunskilful People or Cowards, would have been dangerous against otherMen.I have met with People who were weak enough to believe that Knowledge inFencing takes away the Heart, saying, that seeing the Counters to everyThrust they form, by Means of that Knowledge, an Idea of evident Danger,which dissipating the Courage, and causing an Apprehension, hinders themfrom their Enterprise; when an unskilful Person blindly undertakes everything. It is true that there is great Blindness in this Way of pushing,as they say, and still more in their Understanding, to think that anable Man dares not undertake or venture when the Appearance of Successleads him to it; and that an ignorant Man shall venture when his Lossis almost certain. Is it reasonable to suppose, that a Man of naturalCourage shou'd lose it, because he is assured that he is more expertthan his Enemy, over whom, or perhaps his Equals, he always had theBetter in Assaults, by the Help of his Knowledge and Dexterity? This,far from intimidating him, seems to assure him of Success, which is dueto his habitual Practice. On the contrary, an awkard Man having seen, byhis Disadvantage in School Assaults, that he has no Room to hope inCombat, the dexterous Man possessing the Qualities which procureSuccess, and one who had never handled a Foil, will be as much puzzled,as if he had experience'd the Disadvantage of it.Others, with as little Reason, leave all to Chance, but the very Name issufficient to shew that it is not to be relye'd on.Some again say to what Purpose shall we learn to Fence, the KING hadforbid Duels: It is true that this great Prince, as august for his Pietyas for his Victories, was willing thereby to preserve the Blood of hisbravest Subjects, who expose'd it every Day to be shed through a falseNotion of Honour.But tho' he forbid Duels, he was so far from hindering the Practice ofthe Sword, that he has established several Academies for the perfect Useof it, not only for Defence, but also to qualify his Subjects to put theJustice of his Measures in Execution: And it must at last be agreed to,that a Man who wears a Sword, without knowing how to use it, runs asgreat a Hazard, and is full as ridiculous, as a Man who carries Booksabout him without knowing how to read.Many Men are of Opinion that a Man may naturally know enough to attackor defend himself, without the Assistance of Art: Man, tho' the onlyreasonable Creature, finds himself deprived of what irrational Creaturesnaturally possess; and he requires for his Improvement the Assistanceand Practice of others; the grand Art of War, and that of using theSword, which has been practised thro' so many Ages, still find newInventions; and it may be said, that as there is no Place, in whateverSituation by Nature, but requires Art to secure it's Defence; solikewise, whatever Disposition a Man possesses, he cannot be perfectwithout the Assistance of Rules and Practice.Some Men acknowledge that Skill is necessary in single Combat, but thatin a Crowd or Battle it is altogether useless: I own that on theseOccasions, it is less useful than in single Battle, by reason of thedifferent Accidents, as of Cannon, Musquets, and of other Arms; besides,a Man may be attacked by several at once: But if a Man cannot avoidbeing hit with a Ball, and sometimes with a Sword, he may, nevertheless,by the Disposition and Agility of the Parts, more easily defend andreturn a Thrust: Besides, being more able to hit with the Edge or Point,he may put more Enemies to flight, or keep them at a greater Distance.If the French Troops have always been victorious, Sword in Hand, a Partof the Glory is owing to the Skill of several Officers; and I'll ventureto say, that if they had all been as expert as they should have been,you might see, as well on Foot as on Horseback, in Battle as on aBreach, Actions that would be not only uncommon but prodigious. It mayperhaps be said, that our Enemies have some expert Officers among them;besides, that their Number is commonly less than in _France_, there isas great a Difference between their Dexterity and that of the _French_,as between their Masters and our's, from whom very few would havelearned if the War had no suspended our Academies.[5]I think it proper to finish this Chapter by confuting an Error ascommon, and more ridiculous, than the others; which is, of an infallibleThrust, which a great many People think that Masters reserve fordangerous Occasions, or to sell it at a dear Rate. This wonderful Thing,is called the secret Thrust. I don't know whether this Error proceededfrom those who have not learned, or from the Chimera of someself-conceited Masters, who have sold to ignorant Scholars, some Thrustsas infallible, of their own Contrivance, as ridiculous and dangerous asthe Simplicity of the Scholar and the Knavery of the Master are great.To discover the Error of this Opinion you must observe two Things:First, that in Fencing there are no more than five Thrusts or Places,which I have described in Page 27, shewing the Parade of each of them;and secondly, that there is no Motion without it's Opposite; so that asyou cannot push without a Motion, there is no Thrust without it'sCounter, and even several; for besides the different Positions of theBody, there is not only the Time to take, but also several Parades tofavour the Risposts, which plainly shews, that doing one of these Thingsproperly, this imaginary infallible Thrust, far from succeeding willexpose him that would make it.All the Secrets in the Thrusts that are given by an able Man, far frombeing an Effect of the Thrust, is only an Effect of the Occasion, andthe Swiftness; or rather of the judgment and Practice: By Means of theseQualities all Thrusts are secret ones, or they wou'd be worth nothing.All the Thrusts in Fencing are equally good, when they are madeaccording to Rule, with Swiftness, and on the Occasions proper to them;wherefore they ought not to be neglected whilst the Time of learningthem offers; not but you may stick closer to some Thrusts than toothers, either because you may be better disposed for them, or becauseyou are more used to them.I thought that after I had exposed the Errors of several Persons, Imight tell them, that it is contrary to the Rules of good Breeding, totalk of Things they do not understand; that oftentimes People, by theirfirst Appearance, have been thought to possess the Qualities of knowingMen, but have afterwards forfeited the good Opinion which they had atfirst imposed on others.FINIS._Thrusts of Emulation for Prizes, Wagers &c._All Thrusts from the Neckband to the Wastband are counted good._Coup Fourres_ or interchanged Thrusts are not counted on either side,except one of the Competitors has Recourse to it in order to make theThrusts equal, then the Thrust of the other is good, and not his.If one hits the Body and the other the Face or below the Wast at thesame Time; the Thrust on the Body is counted, but not the other.If a Man parrys with his Hand, and afterwards hit, his Thrust is notgood, because by parrying with the Hand, his Antagonist's Foil is lessat Liberty than if he had parryed with the Blade, and might be a Reasonwhy he could not parry and risposte.If a Man takes the Time, opposing with the Left-hand, and hits withoutreceiving, his Thrust is not good, because if he had not Opposed withthe Hand, both would have hit, the Opposition of the Hand serving onlyto avoid, but no way contributing to the Success of the Thrust.If in parrying, binding, or lashing the Foil, it Falls, and that theThrust is made without Interval, it is Good.Thrusts made with the Sword in both hands, or shifting from one Hand tothe other are not good.A Master is not to give judgment for his own Scholar.FOOTNOTES:[Footnote 1: The Iron at the End of the Blade that runs into theHandle.][Footnote 2: I am not of Opinion that the Body should be drawn back,except it be impossible to avoid the Thrust without doing it; allParades being best when the body is not disorder'd.][Footnote 3: See the 8th. Plate.][Footnote 4: See the 12th Plate.][Footnote 5: As in this Paragraph, Monsieur L'Abbat rather introduces anEncomium on his Country-men, than any thing essential to the Art ofFencing.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year.     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.

PUNCH'S HEBRIDEAN SALMON-FLY BOOK.STRANGE ADVENTURES OF A PEN-HOLDER.    (By Wullie White, Author of "They Taught Her to Death"    "A Pauper in Tulle," "My Cloudy Glare," "Green Pasterns in    Picalilli," "Ran Fast to Royston," &c., &c., &c.)["I now send you," writes this popular and delightful Author, "thelatest of the Novels in which I mingle delicate sentiment withHebridean or Highland scenery, and bring the wisdom of a Londoner tobear directly upon the unsophisticated innocence of a kilt-wearingpopulation. I am now republishing my books in a series. I'll takeshort odds about my salmon-flies as compared with anyone else's, andam prepared to back my sunsets and cloud-effects against the world. Notakers. I thought not. Here goes!"]CHAPTER I.[Illustration]I held it in my right hand, toying with it curiously, and not withoutpleasure. It was merely a long, wooden pen-holder, inky and inert toan unappreciative eye, but to me it was a bright magician, skilledin the painting of glowing pictures, a traveller in many climes, atried and trusted friend, who had led me safely through many strangeadventures and much uncouth dialect. "Old friend," I said, addressingit kindly, "shall you and I set out together on another journey? Wehave seen many countries, and the faces of many men, and yet, thoughwe are advancing in years, the time has not yet come for me to layyou down, as having no need of you. What say you--shall we start oncemore?" I hear a confused sound as of men who murmur together, andsay, "We have supped full of horrors, and have waded chin-deep inZulu blood; we have followed the Clergy of the Established Church intothe recesses of terrible crimes, and have endured them as they baredtheir too sensitive consciences to our gaze. We pine for simpler, andmore wholesome pleasures. Now," I continued, "if only Queen TITA andthe rest will help us, I think we can do something to satisfy thisclamour." For all answer, my pen-holder nestled lovingly in my hand.I placed my patent sunset-nib in its mouth, waved it twice, dipped itonce, and began.CHAPTER II.The weary day was at length sinking peacefully to rest behind thedistant hills. The packed and tumbled clouds lay heavily towards theWest, where a gaunt jagged tower of rock rose sheer into the sky.And lo! suddenly a broad shaft of blood-red light shot through thebrooding cumulus and rested gorgeously upon the landscape. On eachside of this a thin silvery veil of mist crept slowly up and hung inimpalpable folds. The Atlantic sand stretching away to the North shonewith the effulgence of burnished copper. And now brilliant flickersof coloured light, saffron, purple, green and rose danced over theheaven's startled face. The piled clouds opened and showed in theinterspace a lurid lake of blood tinged with the pale violet of anIrishwoman's eyes. Great pillars of flame sprang up rebelliously andspread over the burning horizon. Then a strange, soft, yellow andvaporous light raised its twelve bore breech-loading ejector to itsshoulder and shot across the Cryanlaughin hills, and the cattle shonered in the green pastures, and everything else glowed, and the wholeworld burned with the bewildering glare of a stout publican's nose ina London fog. And silence came down upon the everlasting hills whoseoutlines gleamed in a prismatic--"That will do," said a mysterious Voice, "the paint-box is exhausted!"CHAPTER III.I was shocked at this rude interruption."Sir!" I said, "I cannot see you, though I hear your voice. Will younot disclose yourself?""Nonsense, man," said the aggravating, but invisible one, "do notwaste time. Let us get on with the story. You know what comes next._Revenons a nos saumons._ Ha, Ha! spare the rod and spoil the book!"I was vexed, but I had to obey, and this was the result:The pools were full of gleaming curves of silver, each one belongingto a separate salmon of gigantic size fresh run from the sea. Thefoaming Black Water tumbled headlong over its rocks and down itsnarrow channel. DONALD, the big keeper, stood industriously upon thebank arranging flies. "I hef been told," he observed, "tat ta Englishwill be coming to Styornoway, and there will be no more Gaelic spoken.But perhaps it iss not true, for they will tell many lies. I am ateffle of a liar myself."And lo! as we watched, the grey sky seemed to be split in two by aninvisible wedge, and a purple gleam of light shot--"Stow that!" said the Voice, "I have allowed you to put in a patch ofGaelic, but I really cannot let you do any more sun-pictures. Try andthink that it is a close time for landscapes, and don't let the lightshoot again for a bit.""All right," I retorted, not without annoyance, "but you'll justhave to make up your mind to lose that salmon. It was a magnificentforty-pounder, and, if it hadn't been for your ridiculousinterruption, we should have landed him splendidly in another sixpages.""As you like," said the Voice.CHAPTER IV.And now our journey was drawing to a close. Out of the solemn hushof the purple mountains we had passed slowly southwards back to theroar and the turmoil of the London streets. And many friends hadsaid farewell to us. SHEILA with her low, sweet brow, her exquisitelycurved lips, and her soft blue eyes had held us enraptured, and wehad wept with COQUETTE, and fiercely cheered the WHAUP while he heldWATTIE by the heels, and made him say a sweer. And we had talkedwith MACLEOD and grown mournful with Madcap VIOLET, and had seen manyanother fresh and charming face, and had talked Gaelic with gusto anddiscrimination. And Queen TITA had sped with us, and we had adoredBELLE, and yet we cried for more. But now the dream-journey was past,and lo! suddenly the whole heaven was blazing with light, and a brightsaffron band lay across--"Steady there!" said the Voice. "Remember your promise!"THE END.       *       *       *       *       *SAINTS OR SINNERS?[BY SPECIAL WIRE.]MELBOURNE.--It is said, on good authority, that the favourite books ofthe interesting prisoner now in custody are, the _Pilgrim's Progress_,an Australian Summary of the _Newgate Calendar_, and the poetry ofthe late Dr. Watts. He has also expressed himself as pleased withMrs. Humphrey Ward's latest work of fiction, though he does not quiteapprove of the theological opinions of the writer.PARIS, _Tuesday_.--The supposed author of the dynamite outrages, isthe recipient of numerous presents in prison, sent him by male andfemale admirers, and persons anxious for his conversion and hisautograph. The edition of _Thomas a Kempis_, recently given him, is amost valuable antique copy; but he complains of the print as unsuitedto his eyesight.MELBOURNE. _Later_.--The Solicitor engaged on behalf of ourinteresting prisoner has requested the Government to allow acommission, consisting of the medical superintendents at Broadmore,Hanwell and Colney Hatch, with six other English experts in insanity,to come out to Australia to inquire into the mental condition ofthe prisoner. A telegram has also been despatched to Lord SALISBURYrequesting that the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE OF ENGLAND and an Old BaileyJury may be sent out to try the case; otherwise there will be "nochance of justice being done." The British PREMIER's reply has not yetbeen received. It is believed that he is consulting Mr. GOSCHEN aboutthe probable cost of such a step.MELBOURNE. _Latest_.--Through the instrumentality of an Officialconnected with the prison, I am enabled to send you some importantinformation concerning our prisoner which you may take as absolutelyauthentic. His breakfast this morning consisted of buttered toast,coffee, and poached eggs. He complained that the latter were notnew-laid, and became very excited. It has also transpired that he isstrangely in favour of Imperial Federation, and he has declared to hisgaolers that "The friendship between England and her Colonies oughtto be cemented." This expression of opinion has created a profoundsensation.       *       *       *       *       *THE POINT OF VIEW.(_AS PRIVATE TOMMY ATKINS PUTS IT TO HIS COMRADE BILL._)    [In the Report of Lord WANTAGE's Committee, it appears that    our Home Army costs seventeen and a-half millions per annum.    The Duke of CAMBRIDGE doubts if we could rapidly mobilise one    Army Corps. Sir EVELYN WOOD holds half the men under him at    Aldershot are not equal to doing a day's service, even in    England. The Duke of CONNAUGHT says half the battalions under    his command are no good for service, cannot even carry their    kits, and are not fit to march. Lord WOLSELEY, it is stated,    compares the British Army to a "squeezed lemon."]  "Squeezed lemon!" _That's_ encouraging!    Wish Wolseley knew 'ow much it's pleased us.  I'd like to arsk _one_ little thing:    I wonder who it is who's squeezed us?  The whole Report's a thing to cheer;    Makes us feel proud and pleased, oh! very!  And won't the bloomin' furrineer    Over our horacles make merry?  Costs seventeen millions and a arf,    And carn't go nowhere, nor do nothink!  That tots it up! They wouldn't charf,    Eh, BILL, these Big Wigs! What do _you_ think?  Therefore, we're just a useless lot.    After pipe-claying and stiff-starching,  We _might_ be good for stopping shot,    Only that we're not fit for marching!  We cannot carry our own kits!    I say, Bill, _ain't_ we awful duffers?  Not furrin foes, or Frenchy wits,    Could more completely give us snuffers.  CAMBRIDGE, CONNAUGHT, Sir EVELYN WOOD,    All of a mind, for once, about us!  What wonder Bungs dub us no good,    And lackeys, snobs, and street-boys flout us?  I see myself as others see;    A weedy, narrer-chested stripling,  Can't fight, can't march, can't 'ardly see!    And yet young Mister RUDYARD KIPLING  Don't picture hus as kiddies slack,    Wot can't go out without our nurses,  But ups and pats us on the back    In very pooty potry-verses.[1]  We're much obliged to 'im, I'm sure,    (Though potry ain't my fav'rit reading,)  He's civil, kind and not cock-sure;    Good sense goes sometimes with good-breeding.  So Tommy's best respects to _'im_,    At Aldershot we'd like to treat 'im.  Though if he bobs in Evelyn's swim,    He _might_ not know us _when_ we meet 'im!  But, Bill, if all this barney's _true_    Consarnin' "Our Poor Little Army,"  It must be nuts to Pollyvoo!    _He_ needn't feel a mite alarmy.  _Whose_ fault is it we cost a lot,    And, if war comes, _must_ fail, or fly it?  Well facts is facts, and bounce is rot;    But, blarm it, BILL,--_I'd like to try it!_  [Footnote 1: Mr. Kipling dedicates his "Barrack-Room Ballads"  to "TOMMY ATKINS" in these lines:--      I have made for you a song,      An' it may be right or wrong,    But only you can tell me if it's true;      I've tried for to explain.

Already the mere mention of the magical word    'May-Day' throws the _bourgeoisie_ into a state of nervous    trembling, and its cowardice only finds refuge in cynicism and    ferocity. But whether the wretch (the _bourgeoisie_) likes    it or not, the end draws nigh. Capitalist robbery is going    to perish in mud and shame.... The conscious proletariat    organises itself, and marches towards its emancipation.    You can have it all your own way presently; proletarians    of the whole world, serfs of the factory, the men of the    workshop, the office, and the shop, who are mercilessly    exploited and pitilessly assassinated....

Will you give them joy for their sorrow, sweet labour, and          satisfied sleep?  Sweet is the fragrance of flowers, and soft are the wings of the          dove,  And no goodlier gift is there given than the dower of brotherly          love;  But you, O May-Day Medusa, whose glance makes the heart turn cold,  Art a bitter Goddess to follow, a terrible Queen to behold.  We are sick of spouting--the words burn deep and chafe: we are fain,  To rest a little from clap-trap, and probe the wild promise of gain.  For new gods we know not of are acclaimed by all babbledom's breath,  And they promise us love-inspired life--by the red road of hatred          and death.  The gods, dethroned and deceased, cast forth--so the chatterers          say--  Are banished with Flora and Pan, and behold our new Queen of the          May!  New Queen, fresh crowned in the city, flower-drest, her          snake-sceptre a rod,  Her orb a decked dynamite bomb, which shall shatter all earth at          her nod;  But for us their newest device seems barren, and did they but dare  To bare the new Queen of the May, were she angel or demon _when_          bare?  Time and old gods are at strife; we dwell in the midst thereof,  And they are but foolish who curse, and they are but shallow who          scoff.  Let hate die out, take rest, poor workers, be all at peace;  Let the angry battle abate, and the barren bitterness cease!  Ah, pleasant and pastoral picture! Thrice welcome whoever shall          bring  The sunshine of love after Winter, the blossoms of joy with the          Spring!  Wilt THOU bring it, O new May Queen? If thou canst, come and rule          us, and take  The laurel, the palm, and the paean; all bondage but thine we would          break,  And welcome the branch and the dove. But we look, and we hold our          breath,  That is not the visage of Love, and beneath the piled blossoms          lurks--Death!  A Society all of Love and of Brotherhood! Beautiful dream!  But alas for this Promise of May! Do not Labour's Floralia seem  As flower-feasts fair to her followers? Look on the wreaths at her          feet,  Flung by enthusiast hands from the mine, and the mill, and the          street,  Piled flower-offerings, thine, Proletariat Queen of the May!  And what means the new Bona Dea? and what would her suppliants say?  Organised strength, solidarity, power to band and to strike,  Hope that is native to Spring,--and Hate, in all seasons alike;  Mutual trust of the many--and menace malign for the few.  Citizen, capitalist,--ah! the hours of _your_ empire seem few,  An empire ill-gendered, unjust, blindly selfish, and heartlessly          strong  For the crushing of famishing weakness, the rearing of          wealth-founded wrong.

PUNCH'S UP-TO-DATE POETRY FOR CHILDREN.NO. II.--"LITTLE JACK HORNER."[Illustration]          LITTLE JACK HORNER,          He sat in the corner,  And cried for his "Mummy!" and "Nuss!"          For, while eating his cake,          He had got by mistake  In a horrid piratical 'bus.          Now, some ten minutes back,          You'd have seen little JACK  From an Aerated Bread Shop emerge,          And proceed down the Strand--          Slice of cake in his hand--  In a crumb-covered suit of blue serge.          To be perfectly frank,          He was bound for the Bank,  For it chanced to be dividend day,          And he jumped on the 'bus,          After reasoning thus--  In his logical juvenile way:--          "Here's a 'bus passing by,          And I cannot see why  I should weary my infantile feet;          I've a copper to spare,          And the authorised fare  Is a penny to Liverpool Street."          As the 'bus cantered on,          Little cake-eating JOHN  In the corner contentedly sat,          And with that one and this          (Whether Mister or Miss)  Had a meteorological chat.          Came a bolt from the blue          When, collecting his due,  The conductor remarked, "Though I thank          That young cake-eating gent          For the penny he's sent,  It's a _tuppenny_ ride to the Bank!"          "You're a pirate!" sobbed JACK,          "And your colours are black!"  But he heard--as he struggled to speak--          The conductor observe,          With remarkable verve,  That he didn't want none of his cheek!          With a want of regard,          He demanded JACK's card.  And young HORNER was summoned next day,          When the poor little lad          Lost the battle, and had  All the costs in addition to pay.          Now the Moral is this:          Little Master and Miss,  Whom I'm writing these verses to please;          If your tiny feet ache,          Then a 'bus you may take,  _But be sure it's an L.G.O.C.'s!_       *       *       *       *       *A CURSORY OBSERVATION.From the _Figaro_ for Dimanche, April 17, we make this extract:--    "SPORTS ATHLETIQUES.--Le match international de foot ball    entre le Stade Francais et le Rosslyn Park foot ball Club de    Londres sera joue demain sur le terrain du Cursing Club de    France a Levallois.

PAYLEY,_)II.--DINING-OUT.I can quite understand that a young girl may not care much for themere material dinner. The palate is a pleasure of maturity. Thewoman of fifty probably includes a menu or two among her most sacredmemories; but the young girl is capable of dining on part of a cutlet,any pink sweetmeat, and some tea. But I must confess that I wassurprised at another objection to dining-out that a young girl, onlyat the end of her second season, once made to me. She said that shepositively could not stand any longer the conversation of the averageyoung man of Society. I asked her why, and she then asserted that thissort of young man confined himself to flat badinage and personal brag,which he was mistaken in believing to be veiled. What she said was,of course, perfectly true. Civilisation is responsible for the flatbadinage, for civilisation requires that conversation shall be lightand amusing, but can provide no remedy for slow wits; on the otherhand, the personal brag is a relic of the original man. The badinageis the young man's defect in art; the brag is his defect in nature.But I fail to see any objection to such conversation; on the contrary,it is charming because it _is_ so average; you know beforehand justwhat you will hear and just what you will say, and everything isconsequently made easy. The man puts on that kind of talk just ashe puts on his dress-coat; both are part of the evening uniform. Themotto of the perfect young man of Society is "I resemble." I pointedall this out to the young girl in question, and she retorted thatit was a pity that silence was a lost art. However, she continued todine-out and to take her part in the only possible conversation, andafter all Society rather encourages theoretical rebellion, providedthat it is accompanied by practical submission.[Illustration]From the point of view of sentiment, a dinner has less potentialitiesthan a dance; but the dinner may begin what the dance will end; youset light to the fuse in the dining-room, and the explosion takesplace six weeks afterwards in someone-else's conservatory. Nothingmuch can be done on the staircase; but, if you can decently pretendthat you have heard of the young man who is taking you in, he willprobably like it. If, after a few minutes, you decide that it isworth while to interest the young man, discourage his flat badinage,and encourage his personal brag. The only thing in which it is quitecertain that every man will be interested is, the interest someoneelse takes in him. Later on, he will probably be induced to illustratethe topic of conversation by telling you (if it would not bore you)of a little incident which happened to himself. The incident will beprettily coloured for dinner-table use, and he will make the storyprove a merit in himself, which he will take care to disclaim vainly.When he has finished, look very meditatively at your plate, as if yousaw visions in it, and then turn on him suddenly with wide eyes--withthe right kind of eyelashes, this is effective."I suppose you don't know it, Mr. BLANK," you tell him, "but really Ican't help saying it. You behaved splendidly--splendidly!"Droop the eyelashes quickly, and become meditative again. He willdeprecate your compliment a little incoherently."Not at all, not at all--Miss--er--ASTERISK--I really--assureyou--nothing more than any--er--other man would have done. Someother people at the time told me"--(_laughs nervously_)--"verymuch--er--what you have just said, but--er--personally,I--really--could never see it, or of course I wouldn't have mentionedit to you."Your rejoinder will depend a good deal on how far you mean to go, andhow much of that kind of thing you think you can stand. If you like,you can drop your handkerchief or your glove when you rise; it willplease him to pick it up for you, and he will feel, for a moment, asif he had saved your life.If you do not want to please the man, but only to show your ownsuperiority, it may perhaps be as well to remember that women arebetter than men, as a rule, in flat badinage. Men talk best when theyare by themselves, but they are liable to be painfully natural at suchtimes. I had some little difficulty in finding this out, but I thoughtit my duty to know, and--well, I _do_ know.The correspondence that I have received has not been altogetherpleasant. I have had one letter from ETHEL (aged thirteen) saying thatshe thinks me a mean sneak for prying into other people's Diaries.I can only reply that I was acting for the public good. I have hada sweet letter, however, from "AZALEA." She has been absolutelycompelled, by force of circumstances, to allow the distinct attentionsof three different men. She does not give the names of the men, onlydescriptions, but I should advise her to keep the dark one. She cansee the will at Somerset House. "JANE" writes to ask what is the bestcure for freckles. I do not answer questions of that kind. I havereplied to my other correspondents privately.       *       *       *       *       *REPULSING THE AMAZONS.(_SEE CARTOON, "ARMING THE AMAZONS," DEC. 5, 1891._)[Illustration]  Arming the Amazons against the Greeks?  That PRIAM SALISBURY tried some few short weeks  Before the present fray. FAWCETTA fair  Had prayed; the question then seemed "in the air,"  And PRIAM proffered then the Franchise-spear,  (A shadowy one, that gave no grounds for fear,)  To poor PENTHESILEA.                      Now, ah, now  ROLLITTUS moves, there's going to be a row,  And lo! the mingled ranks of Greece and Troy  Close 'gainst the Amazons. Her steed, a toy,  A hobby-horse, that any maid may mount,  Is not--just now--of any great account.  Her phantom spear will pierce no stout male mail;  But should ROLLITTUS _not_--(confound him!)--fail,  A female host, well armed, and _not_ on hobbies,  Might prove as dangerous as a batch of Bobbies.  The fair FAWCETTA then must be thrown over;  PENTHESILEA finds no hero-lover  In either host. PRIAM, abroad, is dumb.  Ah, maiden-hosts, man's love for you's a hum.  Each fears you--in the foeman's cohorts thrown,  But _neither side desires you in its own!_  The false GLADSTONIUS first, he whom you nourish,  A snake in your spare bosoms, dares to flourish  Fresh arms against you; potent, though polite,  He fain would bow you out of the big fight,  Civilly shelve you. "Don't kick up a row,  And--spoil my game! Another day, not now,  There's a _dear_ creature!" CHAMBERLAINIUS, too,  Hard as a nail, and squirmy as a screw,  Sides with the elder hero, just for once;  CHAPLINIUS also, active for the nonce  On the Greek side, makes up the Traitrous Three,  One from each faction! Ah! 'tis sad to see  PENTHESILEA, fierce male foes unite  In keeping female warriors from the fight;  Yet think, look round, and--you _may_ find they're right!       *       *       *       *       *NOTICE.--Rejected Communications or Contributions, whether MS.,Printed Matter, Drawings, or Pictures of any description, will in nocase be returned, not even when accompanied by a Stamped and AddressedEnvelope, Cover, or Wrapper.

His work in the dramatakes its place beside theirs in the novel. Obviously inferior as it is incertain ways, it yet sheds light on an important side of Russian life thatthey left practically untouched. Turgenev and Tolstoy were gentlemen bybirth, and wrote of the fortunes of the Russian nobility or of the peasantswhose villages bordered on the nobles' estates. Dostoyevsky, though not ofthis landed-proprietor school, still dealt with the nobility, albeit withits waifs and strays. None of these masters more than touched the Russianmerchants, that homespun moneyed class, crude and coarse, grasping andmean, without the idealism of their educated neighbors in the cities or thehomely charm of the peasants from whom they themselves sprang, yet giftedwith a rough force and determination not often found among the cultivatedaristocracy. This was the field that Ostrovsky made peculiarly his own.With this merchant class Ostrovsky was familiar from his childhood. Born in1823, he was the son of a lawyer doing business among the Moscow tradesmen.After finishing his course at the gymnasium and spending three years at theUniversity of Moscow, he entered the civil service in 1843 as an employeeof the Court of Conscience in Moscow, from which he transferred two yearslater to the Court of Commerce, where he continued until he was dischargedfrom the service in 1851. Hence both by his home life and by hisprofessional training he was brought into contact with types such asBolshov and Rizpolozhensky in "It's a Family Affair--We'll Settle ItOurselves."As a boy of seventeen Ostrovsky had already developed a passion for thetheatre. His literary career began in the year 1847, when he read toa group of Moscow men of letters his first experiments in dramaticcomposition. In this same year he printed one scene of "A Family Affair,"which appeared in complete form three years later, in 1850, and establishedits author's reputation as a dramatist of undoubted talent. Unfortunately,by its mordant but true picture of commercial morals, it aroused againsthim the most bitter feelings among the Moscow merchants. Discussion of theplay in the press was prohibited, and representation of it on the stagewas out of the question. It was reprinted only in 1859, and then, at theinstance of the censorship, in an altered form, in which a policeofficer appears at the end of the play as a _deus ex machina_, arrestsPodkhalyuzin, and announces that he will be sent to Siberia. In thismangled version the play was acted in 1861; in its original text it did notappear on the stage until 1881. Besides all this, the drama was the causeof the dismissal of Ostrovsky from the civil service, in 1851. The wholeepisode illustrates the difficulties under which the great writers ofRussia have constantly labored under a despotic government.Beginning with 1852 Ostrovsky gave his whole strength to literary work. Heis exceptional among Russian authors in devoting himself almost exclusivelyto the theatre. The latest edition of his works contains forty-eight pieceswritten entirely by him, and six produced in collaboration with otherauthors. It omits his translations from foreign dramatists, which were ofconsiderable importance, including, for example, a version of Shakespeare's"Taming of the Shrew."The plays of Ostrovsky are of varied character, including dramaticchronicles based on early Russian history, and a fairy drama, "LittleSnowdrop." His real strength lay, however, in the drama of manners, givingrealistic pictures of Russian life among the Russian city classes and theminor nobility. Here he was recognized, from the time of the appearance onthe stage of his first pieces, in 1853 and the following years, as withouta rival among Russian authors for the theatre. Of this realistic drama thepresent volume gives four characteristic examples.The tone of "Poverty Is No Crime" (1854), written only four years after "AFamily Affair," is in sharp contrast with that of its predecessor. In theearlier play Ostrovsky had adopted a satiric tone that proved him a worthydisciple of Gogol, the great founder of Russian realism. Not one lovablecharacter appears in that gloomy picture of merchant life in Moscow; eventhe old mother repels us by her stupidity more than she attracts us by herkindliness. No ray of light penetrates the "realm of darkness"--to borrowa famous phrase from a Russian critic--conjured up before us by the youngdramatist. In "Poverty Is No Crime" we see the other side of the medal.Ostrovsky had now been affected by the Slavophile school of writers andthinkers, who found in the traditions of Russian society treasures ofkindliness and love that they contrasted with the superficial glitter ofWestern civilization. Life in Russia is varied as elsewhere, and Ostrovskycould change his tone without doing violence to realistic truth. Thetradesmen had not wholly lost the patriarchal charm of their peasantfathers. A poor apprentice is the hero of "Poverty Is No Crime," and awealthy manufacturer the villain of the piece. Good-heartedness is thetouchstone by which Ostrovsky tries character, and this may be hiddenbeneath even a drunken and degraded exterior. The scapegrace, LyubimTortsov, has a sound Russian soul, and at the end of the play rouses hishard, grasping brother, who has been infatuated by a passion for apingforeign fashions, to his native Russian worth.Just as "Poverty Is No Crime" shows the influence of the Slavophilemovement, "A Protegee of the Mistress" (1859) was inspired by the greatliberal movement that bore fruit in the emancipation of the serfs in 1861.Ostrovsky here departed from town to a typical country manor, and produceda work kindred in spirit to Turgenev's "Sportsman's Sketches," or "Mumu."In a short play, instinct with simple poetry, he shows the sufferingbrought about by serfdom: the petty tyranny of the landed proprietor, whichis the more galling because it is practised with a full conviction ofvirtue on the part of the tyrant; and the crushed natures of the humancattle under his charge.     The master grim, the lowly serf that tills his lands;     With lordly pride the first sends forth commands,     The second cringes like a slave.                                        --_Nekrasov._Despite the unvarying success of his dramas on the stage, Ostrovsky for along time derived little financial benefit from them. Discouragement andoverwork wrecked his health, and were undoubtedly responsible for thegloomy tone of a series of plays written in the years following 1860, ofwhich "Sin and Sorrow Are Common to All" (1863) is a typical example. Herethe dramatist sketches a tragic incident arising from the conflict of twosocial classes, the petty tradesmen and the nobility. From the coarseenvironment of the first emerge honest, upright natures like Krasnov; fromthe superficial, dawdling culture of the second come weak-willed triflerslike Babayev. The sordid plot sweeps on to its inevitable conclusion withtrue tragic force.Towards the end of his life Ostrovsky gained the material prosperity thatwas his due. "There was no theatre in Russia in which his plays were notacted" (Skabichevsky). From 1874 to his death he was the president of theSociety of Russian Dramatic Authors. In 1885 he received the importantpost of artistic director of the Moscow government theatres; the harassingduties of the position proved too severe for his weak constitution, and hepassed away in the next year.As a dramatist, Ostrovsky is above all else a realist; no more thoroughlynatural dramas than his were ever composed. Yet as a master of realistictechnique he must not be compared with Ibsen, or even with many lessnoted men among modern dramatists. His plays have not the neat, conciseconstruction that we prize to-day. Pages of dialogue sometimes serve nopurpose except to make a trifle clearer the character of the actors, orperhaps slightly to heighten the impression of commonplace reality. Evenin "Sin and Sorrow" and "A Protegee" whole passages merely illustrate thebackground against which the plot is set rather than help forward theaction itself. Many plays, such as "A Family Affair," end with relativelyunimportant pieces of dialogue. Of others we are left to guess even theconclusion of the main action: will Nadya in "A Protegee" submit to herdegrading fate, or will she seek refuge in the pond?Ostrovsky rarely uses the drama to treat of great moral or social problems.He is not a revolutionary thinker or an opponent of existing society; hisideal, like that of his predecessor Gogol, is of honesty, kindliness,generosity, and loyalty in a broad, general way to the traditions of thepast. He attacks serfdom not as an isolated leader of a forlorn hope, butas an adherent of a great party of moderate reformers.Thus Ostrovsky's strength lies in a sedate, rather commonplace realism. Oneof the most national of authors, he loses much in translation.[1] His styleis racy, smacking of the street or the counting-house; he is one of thegreatest masters of the Russian vernacular. To translate his Moscow slanginto the equivalent dialect of New York would be merely to transferBroadway associations to the Ilyinka. A translator can only strive tobe colloquial and familiar, giving up the effort to render the varyingatmosphere of the different plays. And Ostrovsky's characters are asnatural as his language. Pig-headed merchants; apprentices, knavish orhonest as the case may be; young girls with a touch of poetry in theirnatures, who sober down into kindly housewives; tyrannical serf-owners andweak-willed sons of noble families: such is the material of which he buildshis entertaining, wholesome, mildly thoughtful dramas. Men and women liveand love, trade and cheat in Ostrovsky as they do in the world around us.Now and then a murder or a suicide appears in his pages as it does in thoseof the daily papers, but hardly more frequently. In him we can study thelife of Russia as he knew it, crude and coarse and at times cruel, yet fullof homely virtue and aspiration. Of his complex panorama the present volumegives a brief glimpse.[Footnote 1: Ostrovsky, it may be remarked, has been singularly neglectedby translators from the Russian. The only previous versions of completeplays in English known to the present writer are "The Storm." byConstance Garnett (London and Chicago, 1899, and since reprinted), and"Incompatibility of Temper" and "A Domestic Picture" (in "The Humour ofRussia," by E.L.

No, Liza, don't say that: what comparison could there be betweencountry and city life!LIZA. What is there so specially fine about city life?NADYA. Well, everything is different there; the people themselves, andeven the whole social order are entirely different. [_She sits down on abench_.] When I was in Petersburg with the mistress, one had only to takea look at the sort of people who came to see us, and at the way our roomswere decorated; besides, the mistress took me with her everywhere; we evenwent on the steamer to Peterhof, and to Tsarskoe Selo.LIZA. That was pretty fine, I suppose.NADYA. Yes indeed, it was so splendid that words can't describe it!Because, no matter how much I may tell you about it, if you haven't seen ityourself, you'll never understand. And when a young lady, the mistress'sniece, was visiting us, I used to chat with her the whole evening, andsometimes we even sat through the night.LIZA. What in the world did you talk about with her?NADYA. Well, naturally, for the most part about the ways of high society,about her dancing partners, and about the officers of the guard. And as shewas often at balls, she told me what they talked about there, and whom shehad liked best. Only how fine those young ladies are!LIZA. What do you mean?NADYA. They're very gay. And where did they learn all that? Afterwards welived a whole winter in Moscow. Seeing all this, my dear, you try to actlike a born lady yourself. Your very manners change, and you try to have away of talking of your own.LIZA. But why should we try to be fine ladies? Much good it does!NADYA. Much good, you say? Well, you see the ladies promised to marry meoff, so I am trying to educate myself, so that no one'll be ashamed to takeme. You know what sort of wives our officials have; well, what a lot theyare! And I understand life and society ten times better than they do. Now Ihave just one hope: to marry a good man, so I may be the mistress of my ownhousehold. You just watch then how I'll manage the house; it will be noworse at my house than at any fine lady's.LIZA. God grant your wish! But do you notice how the young master isrunning after you?NADYA. Much good it'll do him! Of course, he's a pretty fellow, you mighteven say, a beauty; only he has nothing to expect from me; because I amdecidedly not of that sort; and on the other hand, I'm trying now in everyway that there may be no scandal of any sort about me. I have but one thingin mind: to get married.LIZA. Even married life is sometimes no joy! You may get such a husbandthat ... God help you!NADYA. What a joy it would be to me to marry a really fine man! I, thankGod, am able to distinguish between people: who is good, who bad. That'seasy to see at once from their manners and conversation. But the mistressis so unreasonable in holding us in so strictly, and in keeping everlastingwatch over us! Indeed, it's insulting to me! I'm a girl that knows how totake care of herself without any watching.LIZA. It looks as if the master were coming.NADYA. Then let's go. [_They rise and go out._LEONID _comes in with a gun._SCENE IILEONID _and then_ POTAPYCHLEONID. Wait a bit! Hey, you, where are you going? Why are they alwaysrunning away from me? You can't catch them anyhow! [_He stands musing.Silence._A GIRL _sings behind the rail fence:_    "No man may hope to flee the sting       Of cruel affliction's pain;     New love within the heart may sing--       Regret still in its train."LEONID. [_Running up to the fence_] What a pretty girl you are!GIRL. Pretty, but not yours!LEONID. Come here!GIRL. Where?LEONID. To me in the garden.GIRL. Why go to you?LEONID. I'll go to town and buy you earrings.GIRL. You're only a kid!_She laughs loudly and goes out._ LEONID _stands with bowed head musing._POTAPYCH _enters in hunting-dress, with a gun._POTAPYCH. One can't keep up with you, sir; you have young legs.LEONID. [_All the while lost in thought_] All this, Potapych, will be mine.POTAPYCH. All yours, sir, and we shall all be yours.... Just as we servedthe old master, so we must serve you.... Because you're of the sameblood.... That's the right way. Of course, may God prolong your dearmamma's days....LEONID. Then I shan't enter the service, Potapych; I shall come directly tothe country, and here I shall live.POTAPYCH. You must enter the service, sir.LEONID. What's that you say? Much I must! They'll make me a copying clerk![_He sits down upon a bench._POTAPYCH. No, sir, why should you work yourself? That's not the way to dothings! They'll find a position for you--of the most gentlemanly, delicatesort; your clerks will work, but you'll be their chief, over all of them.And promotions will come to you of themselves.LEONID. Perhaps they will make me vice-governor, or elect me marshal of thenobility.POTAPYCH. It's not improbable.LEONID. Well, and when I'm vice-governor, shall you be afraid of me?POTAPYCH. Why should I be afraid? Let others cringe, but for us it's allthe same. You are our master: that's honor enough for us.LEONID. [_Not hearing_] Tell me, Potapych, have we many pretty girls here?POTAPYCH. Why, really, sir, if you think it over, why shouldn't there begirls? There are some on the estate, and among the house servants; only itmust be said that in these matters the household is very strictly run. Ourmistress, owing to her strict life and her piety, looks after that verycarefully. Now just take this: she herself marries off the protegees andhousemaids whom she likes. If a man pleases her, she marries the girl offto him, and even gives her a dowry, not a big one--needless to say. Thereare always two or three protegees on the place. The mistress takes a littlegirl from some one or other and brings her up; and when she is seventeenor eighteen years old, then, without any talk, she marries her off to someclerk or townsman, just as she takes a notion, and sometimes even to anobleman. Ah, yes, sir! Only what an existence for these protegees, sir!Misery!LEONID. But why?POTAPYCH. They have a hard time. The lady says: "I have found you aprospective husband, and now," she says, "the wedding will be on such andsuch a day, and that's an end to it; and don't one of you dare to argueabout it!" It's a case of get along with you to the man you're told to.Because, sir, I reason this way: who wants to see disobedience in a personhe's brought up? And sometimes it happens that the bride doesn't like thegroom, nor the groom the bride: then the lady falls into a great rage. Sheeven goes out of her head. She took a notion to marry one protegee to apetty shopkeeper in town; but he, an unpolished individual, was going toresist. "The bride doesn't please me," he said, "and, besides, I don't wantto get married yet." So the mistress complained at once to the town bailiffand to the priest: well, they brought the blockhead round.LEONID. You don't say.POTAPYCH. Yes, sir. And even if the mistress sees a girl at one of heracquaintances', she immediately looks up a husband for her. Our mistressreasons this way: that they are stupid; that if she doesn't look after themclosely now, they'll just waste their life and never amount to anything.That's the way, sir. Some people, because of their stupidity, hide girlsfrom the mistress, so that she may never set eyes on them; because if shedoes, it's all up with the girls.LEONID. And so she treats other people's girls the same way?POTAPYCH. Other people's, too. She extends her care to everybody. She hassuch a kind heart that she worries about everybody. She even gets angry ifthey do anything without her permission. And the way she looks after herprotegees is just a wonder. She dresses them as if they were her owndaughters. Sometimes she has them eat with her; and she doesn't make themdo any work. "Let everybody look," says the mistress, "and see how myprotegees live; I want every one to envy them," she says.LEONID. Well, now, that's fine, Potapych.POTAPYCH. And what a touching little sermon she reads them when they'remarried! "You," she says, "have lived with me in wealth and luxury, andhave had nothing to do; now you are marrying a poor man, and will live yourlife in poverty, and will work, and will do your duty. And now forget," shesays, "how you lived here, because not for you I did all this; I was merelydiverting myself, but you must never even think of such a life; alwaysremember your insignificance, and of what station you are." And all this sofeelingly that there are tears in her own eyes.LEONID. Well, now, that's fine.POTAPYCH. I don't know how to describe it, sir. Somehow they all get tiredof married life later; they mostly pine away.LEONID. Why do they pine away, Potapych?POTAPYCH. Must be they don't like it, if they pine away.LEONID. That's queer.POTAPYCH. The husbands mostly turn out ruffians.LEONID. Is that so?POTAPYCH. Everybody hopes to get one of our protegees, because the mistressright away becomes his patroness. Now in the case of these she marries togovernment clerks, there's a good living for the husband; because if theywant to drive him out of the court, or have done so, he goes at once toour mistress with a complaint, and she's a regular bulwark for him; she'llbother the governor himself. And then the government clerk can get drunk oranything else, and not be afraid of anybody, unless he is insubordinate orsteals a lot....LEONID. But, say, Potapych, why is it that the girls run away from me?POTAPYCH. How can they help running? They must run, sir!LEONID. Why must they?POTAPYCH. Hm! Why? Why, because, as you are still under age, the mistresswants to watch over you as she ought to; well, and she watches over them,too.LEONID. She watches us, ha, ha, ha!POTAPYCH. Yes, sir. That's the truth! She was talking about that. You're achild, just like a dove, but, well--the girls are foolish. [_Silence_] Whatnext, sir? It's your mamma's business to be strict, because she is a lady.But why should you mind her! You ought to act for yourself, as all younggentlemen do. You don't have to suffer because she's strict. Why should youlet others get ahead of you? That'd disgrace you.LEONID. Well, well, but I don't know how to talk to the girls.POTAPYCH. But what's the use of talking to them a long time? What about?What kind of sciences would you talk about with them? Much they understandsuch stuff! You're just the master, and that's all.LEONID. [_Glances to one side_] Who's this coming? That's NADYA, evidently.Ah, Potapych, how pretty she is!POTAPYCH. She is related to me, sir, my niece. Her father was set free bythe late master; he was employed in a confectioner's in Moscow. When hermother died, her mistress took and brought her up, and is awful fond ofher. And because her father is dead, why, now, she's an orphan. She's agood girl.LEONID. Looks as if they were coming this way.POTAPYCH. Well, let 'em.GAVRILOVNA _and_ NADYA _enter_.SCENE III_The same_, GAVRILOVNA _and_ NADYAGAVRILOVNA. How do you do, good master?LEONID. [_Bows_] How do you do?GAVRILOVNA. Well, master, I suppose you're bored in the country?LEONID. No, not at all.GAVRILOVNA. What, not bored yet! Why, you see it's like a monastery here;they look after you with a hundred eyes. Well, as for you, it goes withoutsaying, you're a young gentleman, you ought to have some amusement; but youcan't. It's no great joy to shoot ducks!                    [_She laughs._LEONID. [_Going up to_ GAVRILOVNA] Yes, yes, Gavrilovna.NADYA. [_To_ GAVRILOVNA] Let's go.GAVRILOVNA. Where do you want to go? Now, seeing that the mistress isn'tat home, you ought to have a little fun with the young master. That's whatyoung folks need. And what a clever girl she is, master! In talking, and ineverything.NADYA. Come, what's the use!GAVRILOVNA. Well, there's no harm in it! I was young once. I didn't runaway from the gentlemen, and you see they didn't eat me. Perhaps even hewon't bite you. Quit playing the prude, and stay here! But I'm going to getthe tea ready! Good-by, good master! [_She goes out._LEONID. Why did you not wish to remain with me?POTAPYCH. What's this, sir! You talk to her as if she were a young lady!Call her Nadya!LEONID. What are you afraid of, Nadya?NADYA _is silent._POTAPYCH. Talk! What are you keeping still for? And I'm going, sir; I mustget dressed for tea, too. [_He goes out._SCENE IVLEONID, NADYA, _and then_ LIZANADYA. Of course I'm a girl of humble position, but, indeed, even we do notwant anybody to speak evil of us. Pray consider yourself, after such talk,who would marry me?LEONID. Are you going to get married?NADYA. Yes, sir. Every girl hopes to get married some time.LEONID. But have you a suitor?NADYA. Not yet, sir.LEONID. [_Timidly_] If you have no suitor, then, maybe you're in love withsomebody?NADYA. You want to know a lot! Well, no, I needn't fib about it, I'm not inlove with anybody, sir.LEONID. [_With great joy_] Then love me!NADYA. It's impossible to force the heart, sir.LEONID. Why? Don't you like me?NADYA. Well, how could I help liking you? But I'm not your equal! What sortof love is that? Clean ruin! Here comes Liza running after me, I suppose.Good-by. Good luck to you! [_She goes away._LIZA _comes in._LIZA. Master, if you please! Your mamma has come.LEONID. Liza!LIZA. [_Approaching_] What is it, please?LEONID. [_He embraces_ LIZA; _she trembles with pleasure_] Why won't Nadyalove me?LIZA. [_Affectedly_] What are you talking about, master! Girls of our sortmust look out for themselves!LEONID. Look out for yourselves how?LIZA. [_Looks him in the face and smiles_] Why, everybody knows. What areyou talking like a child for?LEONID. [_Sadly_] What shall I do now? Indeed, I don't know. They all runaway from me.LIZA. But don't lose courage; just make love a little bit. Heavens, ourhearts aren't of stone!LEONID. But see here! I asked her: she said she didn't love me.LIZA. Well, if you aren't a queer one! Whoever asked girls right outwhether they were in love or not! Even if one of us girls was in love, shewouldn't say so.LEONID. Why?LIZA. Because she's bashful. Only let me go, sir! [_She gets free_] Theregoes the old fury!LEONID. Come out here into the garden after supper, when mamma goes to bed.LIZA. You don't lose any time!LEONID. Please come.LIZA. Well, we'll see later.

I'm a martyr in this world. [_She plucksa flower viciously and pulls off its petals_] I believe that if I had thepower I'd do this to all of you! I'd do this to all of you! I'd do this toall of you! You just wait, you young scamp! I'll catch you. My heart boils,it boils, it boils over! And now I must smirk before the mistress as if Iwere a fool. What a life! What a life!

Can they understand,heartless creatures, how great is your condescension to them?MADAM ULANBEKOV. It's all the same to me, my dear! One must do good for hisown sake, for his own soul. Then I stopped in to see the chief of police,and asked him to make NEGLIGENTOV head-clerk.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. But, my benefactress, is he worthy?MADAM ULANBEKOV. Don't interrupt! A strange man, our chief of police! Iask him, and he says: "There's no job!" I say to him: "You evidently don'tunderstand who's asking you?" "Well!" says he, "do you expect me to driveout a good man for your godson?" Churlish fellow! However, he promised!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. To think of his hesitating! I cannot understand howhe could even talk back to you. Here his ill-breeding shows up at once.Maybe NEGLIGENTOV, because of his life, isn't worth saying much about;nevertheless, the chief ought to do everything in the world for him foryour sake, no matter how worthless a scamp NEGLIGENTOV might be.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Don't you forget that he's my godson!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. And for that very reason, benefactress, I add: he isyour godson; well, and that's all there is to it; the chief of police oughtnot to listen to any kind of gossip. And, besides, what things they do say!They say that he's utterly worthless, that his uncle got him a court job,but he won't stay with it. He was gone a whole week, they say, somewhere orother about three miles down the highroad, near the tavern, fishing. Yes,and that he is a drunkard beyond his years. But whose business is it? Hemust be worthy of it, since you ask it.MADAM ULANBEKOV. I've never heard that. I've never seen him drunk; but Ispoke to the chief of police on his behalf, because he's my godson. I takehis mother's place.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. I know, benefactress, I know; every one knows thatif you take a notion, you, my benefactress, can make a man out of mud; butif you don't take a notion to do so, he'll fall into insignificance nomatter how brainy he may be. He's to blame himself, because he didn'tdeserve it!MADAM ULANBEKOV. I'm sure I never did any one any harm.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Harm? You, who because of your angelic heartwouldn't hurt even a fly! Of course all we mortals are not without sins;you have done many things; you can't please everybody. Indeed, to tell thetruth, my dear benefactress, there are people enough who complain aboutyou.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Who complains about me? What a lie!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. It's impossible for you to know everything, dearbenefactress. And it's not worth while for you, in your gentility, totrouble yourself about every low-lived person. And though they do complain,what's the use of paying attention; are they worth your notice? Since youdo so many good deeds for others, God will forgive you, our benefactress.MADAM ULANBEKOV. All the same, I want to know whom I have offended?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Well, there are some persons, benefactress.MADAM ULANBEKOV. [_Forcibly_] But who? Speak!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Don't be angry, benefactress! I spoke as I didbecause you yourself know how touchy people are nowadays--never satisfied.MADAM ULANBEKOV. You spoke as you did in order to cause me someunpleasantness.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. May my eyes burst if I did.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Well, I know you. You're never at rest in your own soulunless you're about to say something mean. You will please be more careful;otherwise you'll drive me out of patience one of these days; it'll be allthe worse for you. [_Silence_] Serve the tea.GAVRILOVNA. Right away, mistress._She pours out two cups_. POTAPYCH _hands them to_ MADAM ULANBEKOV _and to_VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Pour Grisha a cup, too; he went with me to-day, and he'stired out.GAVRILOVNA. Yes, mistress.[_She pours out a cup and hands it to_ GRISHA.GRISHA. Why didn't you put more milk in it? Are you stingy, eh?GAVRILOVNA. [_Adding milk_] As it is, you're fattened on milk, like a calf.GRISHA _takes the cup and goes out through the door into the garden._MADAM ULANBEKOV. I have thought of marrying NADYA to NEGLIGENTOV--witha decent settlement, of course. You say that he leads a bad life;consequently we must hasten the wedding. She is a girl of good principles,she'll hold him back, otherwise he'll ruin himself with his bachelorhabits. Bachelor life is very bad for young men.NADYA. [_To_ LIZA] Do you hear, Liza? What's this? My God!LIZA. You just have to listen, and you can't say a word.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. It's high time she was married, benefactress; whyshould she be hanging around here? And now your young son, the angel, hascome.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Oh, be still! What are you thinking up now? Why, he's onlya child!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. A child, benefactress! Well, there's nothing more tobe said; God gave you a son as a joy and a consolation. And we can neverfeast our eyes enough on him. It's just as if the sunshine had come intoour house. So good-natured, so merry, so gentle with every one! But he'salready running after the girls so; he never lets one pass; and they, sillythings, are tickled to death; they fairly snort with delight.MADAM ULANBEKOV. You're lying. He never has a chance to see the girlsanywhere, I think; all day long they are in their own side of the house,and, besides, they never go anywhere.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Ah, benefactress, there are no locks to keep a girlin, once she takes a notion to do something.MADAM ULANBEKOV. You hear, Gavrilovna! Look after my girls. You know Iwon't have any loose conduct. You tell them that so they'll know I mean it.[_To_ VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA] But no, there can't be anything like that.You're merely disturbing me with your silly notions. What a dirty tongueyou have! What business had you to chatter? And now I can't get the stuffout of my head! Keep watch, Gavrilovna!GAVRILOVNA. What's the use of listening to her, mistress?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. But really, benefactress, am I saying anything bad?Would I dare to think any harm about him, that little angel? Of coursehe's still a child, he wants to frisk a little; but here he hasn't anycompanions, so he plays with the girls.MADAM ULANBEKOV. There's poison on your tongue. [_She reflects_. POTAPYCH_takes the cups_. GAVRILOVNA _fills them and gives them back_. GRISHA_comes in from the garden, gives_ GAVRILOVNA _a push, and makes a sign withhis head that she is to pour him another cup_. GAVRILOVNA _does so_. GRISHA_goes out_] However, I must marry off Nadya.NADYA. [_Almost weeping_] Mistress, you have shown me such kindness thatI can't even express it. Forgive me for daring to speak to you now; but,because of your attitude towards me, I expected quite a different favorfrom you. In what respect have I displeased you now, mistress, that youwish to marry me to a drunkard?MADAM ULANBEKOV. My dear, it's not for you to argue about that; you're justa girl. You ought to rely in all things upon me, your patroness. I broughtyou up, and I am even bound to establish you in life. And again, you oughtnot to forget this: that he is my godson. Rather, you ought to be thankfulfor the honor. And now I tell you once and for all: I do not like it whenmy girls argue, I simply do not like it, and that's all there is to it.That's a thing I cannot permit anybody. I've been accustomed, from myyouth, to having people obey my every word; it's time you knew that! Andit's very strange to me, my dear, that you should presume to oppose me. Isee that I have spoiled you; and you at once get conceited. [NADYA _weeps._VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Benefactress, one must have feeling for his fellowcreature, one must have feeling. But what kind of feelings can such as theyhave, save ingratitude?MADAM ULANBEKOV. No one's talking to you! What are you mixing intoeverything for? [_To_ NADYA, _sternly_] What new tale is this? Stillcrying! Let's have no more tears! [NADYA _weeps_] I'm talking to you.[_Rising slightly_] Your tears mean absolutely nothing to me! When I makeup my mind to do a thing, I take a firm stand, and listen to no one onearth! [_She sits down_] And know, first of all, that your obstinacy willlead to nothing; you will simply anger me.NADYA. [_Weeping_] I'm an orphan, mistress! Your will must be obeyed!MADAM ULANBEKOV. Well, I should say! Of course it must; because I broughtyou up; that's equal to giving you life itself.LEONID _enters._SCENE III_The same and_ LEONIDLEONID. How are you, mamma?MADAM ULANBEKOV. How are you, my dear? Where have you been?LEONID. I went hunting with Potapych. I killed two ducks, mamma.MADAM ULANBEKOV. You don't spare your mother; the idea, going hunting inyour state of health! You'll fall sick again, God forbid! and then you'llsimply kill me! Ah, my God, how I have suffered with that child! [_Shemuses._GAVRILOVNA. Some tea, master?LEONID. No, thanks.MADAM ULANBEKOV. [_To_ VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA] When he was born, I was illa very long time. Then he was always sickly, and he grew up puny. How manytears have I shed over him! Sometimes I would just look at him, and mytears would flow; no, it will never be my lot to see him in the uniform ofthe guardsmen! But it was most distressing of all for me when his father,owing to the boy's poor health, was unable to send him to a militaryschool. How much it cost me to renounce the thought that he might become asoldier! For half a year I was ill. Just imagine to yourself, my dear, whenhe finishes his course, they will give him some rank or other, such as theygive to any priest's son clerking in a government office! Isn't itawful? In the military service, especially in the cavalry, all ranks arearistocratic; one knows at once that even a junker is from the nobility.But what is a provincial secretary, or a titular councillor! Any one canbe a titular councillor--even a merchant, a church-school graduate, alow-class townsman, if you please. You have only to study, then serveawhile. Why, one of the petty townsmen who is apt at learning will get arank higher than his! That's the way of the world! That's the way of theworld! Oh, dear! [_She turns away with a wave of her hand_] I don't like topass judgment on anything that is instituted by higher authority, and won'tpermit others to do so, but, nevertheless, I don't approve of this system.I shall always say loudly that it's unjust, unjust.LEONID. Why are Nadya's eyes red from crying?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. She hasn't been flogged for a long time.MADAM ULANBEKOV. That's none of your business, my dear. Nadya, go away,you're not needed here.[NADYA _goes out._]LEONID. Well, I know why: you want to marry her off.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Whether I do or not, my dear, is my own business.Furthermore, I do not like to have any one meddle in my arrangements.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. What a clever young man you are; you knoweverything, you get into everything!LEONID. Indeed, mamma dear, I don't mean to meddle in your arrangements.Only he's a drunkard.MADAM ULANBEKOV. And that, again, is none of your business. Leave that toyour mother's judgment.LEONID. I'm only sorry for her, mamma.MADAM ULANBEKOV. All very fine, my dear; but I should like to know fromwhom you heard that I'm going to marry NADYA. If one of the housemaidshas....LEONID. No, mamma, no.MADAM ULANBEKOV. How could you find out otherwise? How did that get out?[_To_ GAVRILOVNA] Find out without fail!LEONID. No, indeed, mamma; the man she's going to marry told me.MADAM ULANBEKOV. What sort of a man?LEONID. I don't know what sort! He said he was a clerk in a governmentoffice.... a peculiar surname: NEGLIGENTOV. What a funny fellow he is! Hesays he's your godson, and that he's afraid of nobody. He's dancing in thegarden now, drunk.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Drunk, in my house!LEONID. If you want, I'll invite him in. Potapych, call NEGLIGENTOV! Hesaid that you were at his uncle's to-day, and that you promised to give himNadya. Already he's reckoning, in anticipation, how much income he will getin the court, or "savings," as he says. What a funny fellow! He showed mehow they taught him at school. Do you want me to bring him in?_Enter_ POTAPYCH _and_ NEGLIGENTOV.SCENE IV_The same,_ NEGLIGENTOV _and_ POTAPYCHMADAM ULANBEKOV. Oh, oh, how disgusting! Don't come near me!NEGLIGENTOV. I'm sent from uncle to thank you for your bounty.LEONID. He says, mamma, that they taught him a good deal, only it wasimpossible for him to learn anything.NEGLIGENTOV. Impossible; from my birth I had no aptitude for the sciences.I received from fifty to a hundred birch rods nearly every day, but theydidn't quicken my understanding.LEONID. Oh, mamma, how amusingly he tells about the way he learned! Here,just listen. Well, and how did you learn Latin?NEGLIGENTOV. Turpissime!MADAM ULANBEKOV. [_Shrugging her shoulders_] What in the world is that?NEGLIGENTOV. Most abominably.LEONID. No, wait a bit; and what did the teacher do with you?NEGLIGENTOV. [_Bursts out laughing_] It made you laugh. Once, after a crueltorture, he commanded two students to fasten me by the neck with a belt,and to lead me through the market-place as a laughing-stock.MADAM ULANBEKOV. How is it they took you into the civil service if younever learned anything?NEGLIGENTOV. Through the mediation of influential people.LEONID. And did they expel you from school?NEGLIGENTOV. They didn't expel me; but they excluded me because I grew toomuch.LEONID. Grew too much?NEGLIGENTOV. Well, as I, during all this teaching and grilling, remainingin the lower grades, was getting on in years, and grew more than the otherfellows of my class, of course I was excluded because I was too big. Isuffered all the more from the venality of those at the head. Our rectorliked gifts; and a week before the examinations, he sent us all to ourparents for presents. According to the number of these presents, we werepromoted to the higher classes.LEONID. What was your conduct like?NEGLIGENTOV. Reprehensible.MADAM ULANBEKOV. What in the world! Good heavens! Go away, my dear sir, goaway!LEONID. Oh, mamma, he's comical; wait a bit before driving him out. Dance,NEGLIGENTOV!NEGLIGENTOV. [_Dances and sings_]"I shall go, shall go to mow Upon the meadow green."GRISHA _bursts out laughing._MADAM ULANBEKOV. Stop, stop! [NEGLIGENTOV _ceases_. _To_ GRISHA] What areyou laughing at?GRISHA. The member dances very comically.MADAM ULANBEKOV. What do you mean, "member"?GRISHA. Why, he himself tells us all that he is a member in the court, nota copy-clerk. And so they call him the member.NEGLIGENTOV. I call myself the member, although falsely, but expresslyfor the respect of the court menials, and in order to escape scoffing andinsult.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Be gone, and don't you ever dare to show yourself to me!NEGLIGENTOV. Uncle says that I fell into loose living because of mybachelor life, and that I may get mired in it unless you show me yourfavor.MADAM ULANBEKOV. No, no, never!NEGLIGENTOV. [_On his knees_] Uncle told me to beg you with tears, becauseI am a lost man, subject to many vices, and, without your favor, I shallnot be tolerated in the civil service.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Tell your uncle that I shall always be your benefactress;but don't you even think about a wife! Be gone, be gone!NEGLIGENTOV. I thank you for not deserting me! [_To_ GRISHA] Ask themistress to let you go to the fair, and catch up with me! [_He goes out_.SCENE V_The same, except_ NEGLIGENTOVMADAM ULANBEKOV. How easy it is to be mistaken in people! You take painsfor them, work your head off, and they don't even feel it. I should havebeen glad to establish that boy in life, but he crawls into the housedrunk. Now, if he's a prey to that weakness, he ought, at least, to try tohide it from me. Let him drink where he will, but don't let me see it!I should know, at least, that he respected me. What clownishness! Whatimpudence! Whom will he be afraid of, pray tell, if not of me?LEONID. Oh, what a comical fellow! Don't be angry with me, mamma. When Ifound out that you wanted to marry NADYA to him, I felt sorry for her. Andyou're so good to everybody! [_He kisses her hand_] I didn't want you to doanything unjust.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Such people fairly drive you into sin. [_Kissing him_] Youhave a beautiful soul, my dear! [_To_ VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA] Indeed, I havealways thought that God himself sometimes speaks with the lips of babes.Liza! Go tell Nadezhda not to cry, that I have turned out NEGLIGENTOV.LIZA. Yes, ma'am. [_She goes out_.GRISHA. [_Approaches, swaggering, and stops in a free and easy pose_]Mistress!MADAM ULANBEKOV. What's the matter with you?GRISHA. Let me go down-town; to-day's a holiday there.MADAM ULANBEKOV. What do you want to go for? To stare at the drunkards?GRISHA. [_Clasping his hands behind him_] Please, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. No, most certainly not!GRISHA. Please do, mistress.MADAM ULANBEKOV. I tell you, positively, no! One's morals are just spoiledat these fairs. Your greedy ears will take in all kinds of nastiness!You're still a boy; that's no place for you!GRISHA. No, but please let me, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. You stay right here! Put that nonsense out of your head!GRISHA. Well, I declare! I slave, and slave, and can't ever go anywhere!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Oh me, oh my! Oh me, oh my! How spoiled you are! Howspoiled you are!MADAM ULANBEKOV. What are you cackling about? Keep still!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. But how can I keep still, benefactress? Such lack offeeling! Such ingratitude! It pierces the heart.MADAM ULANBEKOV. I command you to keep still, and you must keep still!GRISHA. Please let me, ma'am!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. As if the mistress didn't love you, as if she didn'tfondle you, more, if anything, than her own son!MADAM ULANBEKOV. [_Stamping her foot_] Shhh!.... I'll turn you out!GRISHA. I want awfully to go to the fair; please let me, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Well, go along then! but come back early!GRISHA. Yes, ma'am.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Kiss the dear lady's hand, you blockhead!GRISHA. What are you trying to teach me for? I know my own business. [_Hekisses the mistress's hand and goes out._MADAM ULANBEKOV. As for you, my dear, if I ever hear anything like thisagain, I'll have them drive you off the place with brooms._She goes out._ VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA _remains standing in a stupor._SCENE VI_The same, except_ MADAM ULANBEKOV; _then_ LIZALEONID. Well, you caught it, didn't you? And you deserved it, too!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. I'll have my turn yet.LIZA _enters._LIZA. [_Quietly to_ LEONID] Nadya sent me to say that we'll come to thegarden.LEONID. Give her a kiss from me.GAVRILOVNA. God give you health, master, for taking our part. Any wretchcan insult us; but there's no one to take our part. You'll get a richreward for that in the next world.LEONID. I'm always ready to help you. [_He goes out to the right, with acaper._GAVRILOVNA. Thanks, my dear! [_She goes out with_ LIZA, _to the left_.SCENE VIIVASILISA PEREGRINOVNA _and_ POTAPYCHVASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Why don't you insult me? They all insult me, whydon't you? You heard how she herself wanted to flog me; "I'll have them doit with brooms," she said. May her words choke her!POTAPYCH. What, I!.... I insult anybody! But as to the gentlefolkthere ... I don't know, but perhaps they have to.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Do you see what's going on in this house! Do yousee? Do you understand it, or don't you? Just now when I began to talkabout Grisha, you heard how she began to roar? You heard how she began tohiss?POTAPYCH. What's that to me? I, by the mistress's kindness, in heremploy....I shall carry out all her orders.... What business is it of mine?I don't want to know anything that isn't my business.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. But did you see how Nadya and Liza--thehussies!--looked at me? Did you see how the snakes looked? Ha! I must lookafter them, I must! [POTAPYCH, _with a wave of his hand, goes out_] Bah!you! you old blockhead! What people! What people! There's no one to whom Ican talk, and relieve my heart. [_She goes out_.III_Part of the garden; to the rear, a pond, on the shore of which is a boat.Starry night. A choral song is heard in the far distance. For a while thestage is empty._SCENE I_Enter_ NADYA _and_ LIZALIZA. Oh, Nadya, what's this we're doing? When the mistress hears of this,it'll be your last day on earth.NADYA. If you're afraid, take yourself home.LIZA. No, I'll wait for you. But all the same, my girl, it's awful, nomatter what you say! Lord preserve us when she finds it out.NADYA. Always singing the same tune! If you fear the wolf, keep out of thewoods.LIZA. But what has happened to you? Before, you didn't talk like this. Youused to hide yourself; and now you go to him of your own accord.NADYA. Yes, before I ran away from him; now I don't want to. [_She standsmusing_] Now I myself don't know what has suddenly happened within me! Justwhen the mistress said, a short while ago, that I shouldn't dare to argue,but marry the man she said to marry, just then my whole heart revolted."Oh, Lord, what a life for me!" I thought. [_She weeps_] What's the use inmy living purely, guarding myself not merely from every word, but even fromevery look? Even so, evil seized upon me. "Why," I thought, "should I guardmyself?" I don't want to! I don't want to! It was just as if my heart diedwithin me. It seemed that if she said another word, I should die on thespot.LIZA. What are you saying! Why, I really thought you were coming to themaster as a joke.NADYA. As a joke! I can't bear an insult! I cannot. [_Silence_] Oh, Liza,if life were better, I shouldn't have come into the garden at night. Youknow how it used to be, when I would think about myself--I suppose it musthave come into your head, too--that here you are, an honest girl; you livelike a bird, suddenly you're fascinated by some man, he makes love to you,comes to see you often, kisses you.... You're abashed before him, yet happyto see him. That's the way it always is. Although you may not be rich;although it may be you have to sit with your lover in the servants' room;yet it is as if you were a queen, just as if every day were a holiday foryou. Then they marry you, and all congratulate you. Well, then, no matterhow hard married life may be, perhaps there may be lots of work, in spiteof that you live as if in paradise; just as if you were proud of something.LIZA. Naturally, my girl.NADYA. But when they say to you: "Pack off to this drunkard, and don't youdare argue, and don't you dare cry over yourself!".... Oh, Liza!.... Andthen you think how that horrid man will make fun of you, will bully you,show his authority, will begin to ruin your life, all for nothing! You growold by his side without having a chance to live. [_She weeps_] It breaksyour heart even to tell about it! [_Waving her hand_] And so, indeed, theyoung master is better.LIZA. Oh, Nadya; it would be better if you hadn't spoken, and I hadn'tlistened!NADYA. Stop, Liza! Why are you playing the prude with me? What would you doyourself if the master fell in love with you?LIZA. [_Stammering_] Well, how should I know? Of course, what shall Isay.... the old Nick is strong.NADYA. There you are!.... [_Silence_] Here is what I wanted to say to you,Liza. What a strange inspiration has come over me! When such thoughts cameinto my head, and, Liza, when I began to think about the master--then howdear he became to me!.... so dear, that, really, I can't tell.... Before,when he ran after me, I didn't care; but now it's just as if something drewme to him.LIZA. Oh, my girl! Just think of it; surely this is fate!NADYA. And such a spirit came into me, I am afraid of nothing! I feel as ifyou could cut me to pieces, and still I'd not change my mind. And why thisis so, I don't know. [_Silence_] I could hardly wait till night! It seemsas if I could fly to him on wings! The one thing that I have in mindis that, at any rate, I am not a pretty girl for nothing; I shall havesomething by which to remember my youth. [_Musingly_] I thought to myself:"What a young man, how handsome! Am I, silly girl that I am, worth hisloving me?" May I be choked here, in this lonely spot, if he does not.LIZA. What's this, Nadya? You seem beside yourself.NADYA. And I really am beside myself. While she spoiled me, caressed me,then I thought that I was a person like other people; and my thoughts aboutlife were entirely different. But when she began to command me, like adoll; when I saw that I was to have no will of my own, and no protection,then, Liza, despair fell upon me. What became of my fear, of my shame--Idon't know. "Only one day, but mine!" I thought; "then come what may, Idon't care to inquire. Marry me off to a herdsman, lock me in a castle withthirty locks!.... it's all the same to me!"LIZA. I think the master's coming.LEONID _enters from the opposite side, in a cloak._NADYA. Well, Liza, isn't he handsome, ha?LIZA. Oh, stop! You're either sick or half out of your head!SCENE II_The_ same _and_ LEONIDLEONID. [_Approaching_] I was thinking you would deceive me by not coming.NADYA. Why did you think so?LEONID. Well, you see, you said you didn't love me.NADYA. No matter what girls say, don't you believe them. How could one helploving such a handsome fellow?LEONID. [_Surprised_] Why, Nadya! He takes her hand, for a short time holdsit, then kisses it.NADYA. [_In fright withdrawing her hand_] Oh! why did you do that? Dear,kind master! Aren't you ashamed?LEONID. I love you ever so much, Nadya!NADYA. You love me? Well, then, you might give me a kiss!LEONID. May I, Nadya? Will you let me?NADYA. What's the harm in it?LEONID. [_Turning about_] Oh, and you, Liza, here....LIZA. I'm going, I'm going ... I shan't meddle.LEONID. [_Confused_] I didn't mean that. Where did you get that idea?LIZA. Oh, don't dodge. We know, too....[_She goes out behind the shrubs._LEONID. And so you will let me kiss you? [_He kisses her timidly_] No, no,let me kiss your hand.NADYA. [_Hides her hand_] No, no, how could you! What do you mean....LEONID. Why not? I'll tell you what, you are the most precious thing onearth to me.NADYA. Is that really so?LEONID. You see, no one ever loved me before.NADYA. Aren't you fooling?LEONID. No, truly!.... Truly, no one has ever loved me. Honest to God....NADYA. Don't swear; I believe you without it.LEONID. Let's go sit down on the bench.NADYA. Yes, let's. [_They sit down._LEONID. Why do you tremble so?NADYA. Am I trembling?LEONID. You are.NADYA. Then, it must be that I feel a bit chilly.LEONID. Just let me wrap you up. He covers her with one side of his cloak,embracing her as he holds it around her. She takes his hand and holds it.NADYA. And now let's sit this way and talk.LEONID. What are we going to talk about? I shall say only one thing to you:I love you.NADYA. You will say it, and I shall listen.LEONID. You'll get tired of one and the same thing.NADYA. Maybe you'll get tired of it; I never shall.LEONID. Then let me speak. I love you, little Nadya. [_He rises and kissesher._NADYA. Why do you do that? Just sit quietly, as we said we would.LEONID. Shall we sit like this, with our hands folded?NADYA. [_Laughing_] Like that. Hear, a nightingale is singing in thethicket. Sit down and listen. How nice it is to listen!LEONID. Like this?NADYA. Yes, as we sit together. It seems as if I could sit here all my lifeand listen. What could be better, what more could one want?....LEONID. Nadya, dear, that would really be a bore.NADYA. What fellows you men are! You get sick of things in no time. ButI, you see, am ready to sit out the whole night, to look at you, withoutlowering my eyes. It seems as if I should forget the whole world!_Tears start in her eyes, she bends her head, and then looks at_ LEONID_fixedly and musingly._LEONID. Now it would be nice to go rowing; it is warm, the moon is shining.NADYA. [_Absently and almost mechanically_] What is it, sir?LEONID. To go rowing; I should row you out to the little island. It is sopleasant there, on the island. Well, let's go. [_He takes her by the hand._NADYA. [_In a revery_] Where, sir?LEONID. Where, where? I told you; didn't you hear me?NADYA. Oh, forgive me, dearest master. I was thinking and didn't hearanything. Dearest master, forgive me![_She lays her head upon his shoulder._LEONID. I say, let's go to the island.NADYA. [_Nestling up to him_] Oh, wherever you please! Even to the end ofthe world! If only with you.... Take me wherever you want.LEONID. Nadya, you are so good, so sweet, that it seems as if I must burstout crying, just to look at you. [_They approach the boat_] Good-by, Liza.LIZA. [_Coming from the bushes, she makes a warning gesture_] Look out,you two! [LEONID _and_ NADYA _sit down in the boat and move away_] There,they've gone! And I must wait here for them! This is awful, simply awful!At night, in the garden, and all alone, too! What a fix for me--afraid ofeverything, and.... [_She glances about her_] Heavens, this is deadly! Ifthere were only somebody here, it would be all right, I'd have somebody totalk to. Holy Saints! Somebody's coming! [_She looks_] Oh, all right; justour old folks from the fair. [_She hides herself._SCENE III_Enter_ POTAPYCH _in an overcoat and a broad-brimmed hat, and with a cane,somewhat tipsy;_ GAVRILOVNA _in an old-fashioned bonnet. They sit down onthe bench._POTAPYCH. No, Gavrilovna, not that ... don't say that!... Our lady is so... such a kind mistress!... Here, we asked if we could go to the fair, andshe said to go along.... But what they say about her ... that I don't know:it's not my business, and so I don't know anything about it.GAVRILOVNA. Why _not_ let us go, Potapych? You and I are not youngsters; weshan't be spoiled!POTAPYCH. You can't let the young folks go, because you must have modelsfor everything, Gavrilovna. Whatever models a person has in front of him,he may, very likely ... most probably....GAVRILOVNA. Well, why did she let Grisha go? She said she wouldn't; well,and then she ought not to have done it.POTAPYCH. Vasilisa Peregrinovna stirred me up a lot on Grisha's accounta while ago ... she stirred me up a lot, but I don't know. It's not mybusiness, so I don't know anything about it.GAVRILOVNA. What's this you were saying about models? It would be betterfor her to show a better example herself! As it is, she only keepsshouting: "Watch, I tell you, watch the girls!" But what's the use ofwatching them? Are they all babies? Every person has his own brains in hishead. Let every one think for himself. All you need to do is to look outfor the five-year-olds, that they don't spoil something or other. What alife for a girl! There's nothing worse on earth! But the mistress doesn'twant to consider whether a girl gets much fun out of life. Well, _does_ sheget much? Say!POTAPYCH. [_Sighs_] A dog's life.GAVRILOVNA. It surely is! Consequently one ought to pity them and notinsult them at every step. As it is, it's simply awful! Nobody trusts themat all; it's just as if they weren't human beings. Just let a girl poke hernose out, and the guards are on the job!POTAPYCH. But you can't.GAVRILOVNA. Can't what? You can do everything. That'll do, Potapych! You'reused to saying over other people's words like a magpie; but just think foryourself.POTAPYCH. But I don't know ... I don't know anything.GAVRILOVNA. You won't gain anything through severity. You may tell 'em, ifyou please, that they'll be hung for such-and-such; they'll go and do itanyway. Where there's the greatest strictness, there's the most sin. Youought to reason like a human being. No matter if our masters pay money fortheir wits while we have only what we're born with, we have our own way ofthinking, all the same. It's all right to lay down the law strictly; butdon't always punish a fellow who makes a slip; let him off now and then.Some bad comes from spoiling people; but now and then you can't help goingwrong.POTAPYCH. Now, if you ask me ... what can I answer to that? How can Ianswer you?GAVRILOVNA. Well, how?POTAPYCH. Just this: I don't know anything about it, because it isn't mybusiness ... it's the mistress's business.GAVRILOVNA. Bah, you old idiot! You've lost your wits in your old age.POTAPYCH. Why should I ... I, thanks to the lady's kindness, now in heremploy ... I carry out all her orders ... but I don't know.GAVRILOVNA. Well, let's go home. She may have thought up something or otherabout even you and me.[_They go out._]SCENE IVLIZA. [_Enters_] Alone again! Where are those precious darlings of mine? Isuppose they've forgotten about me! But, then, why should they rememberme? Saints alive, it'll soon be daylight. This night is shorter than asparrow's beak. How can we go home then? How brave that Nadya is!_Enter_ VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA.SCENE VLIZA _and_ VASILISA PEREGRINOVNAVASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. What are you doing there, dearest?LIZA. Can't you see? I'm taking a stroll.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. I see! How can I help it? But what kind of anight-walk is this?LIZA. Well, when can we go walking? We work all day and wait on the gentry,and we go walking at night. But I am surprised at you! Don't you walkenough daytimes that you still want to wander around at night and scarepeople, just like....VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Just like what?... Well, say it, say it!LIZA. What? Oh, nothing.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. No, you said, "Just like" ... well, say it now; justlike who?LIZA. I said what I said.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. No, don't you dare sneak out of it! Come, speak up!LIZA. Why did you stick to it? All right, I'll tell you: like a spook.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. What, what! Like a spook!... How do you dare, youdirty hussy, ha? What's this! You want to push me alive into the grave! ButI'll find your lover here, and take you to the mistress. Then we'll seewhat song you'll sing.LIZA. I haven't any lover! There's no use in your looking. Search the wholegarden if you want to! And even if I had, it's none of your business! It'sshameful for you even to speak of it. You ought not even to know about it:you're an old maid. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Sing on, sing on, my dear; you sing very finely onthe wing; but you'll perch pretty soon! You're not going to roam about atnight for nothing. I know your tricks. I'll show you all up! I'm so madnow, that even if you bow down to my feet, I'll not forgive you.LIZA. Just wait! I see myself bowing before you! Don't count on it!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. No, now I'm going to look around every bush.LIZA. Do it!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA _looks about on both sides, then approaches thepond._VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Ha, what's this? Do tell, what tricks they're up to!In the boat! Hugging each other! How tender that is! Just like a picture!You ought to have thought to take a guitar along and sing love-songs!...They're kissing each other! Very good! Delightful! Again! Excellent! Whatcould be better? Phew, what an abomination! It's disgusting to look at!Well, my dears, you will remember me. _Now_ I have nothing to say to you._To-morrow_ I shall! [_She goes out._LIZA. What devil brought her here? You can't clear up the mess now!LEONID _and_ NADYA _reach the shore and disembark from the boat._SCENE VILIZA, NADYA, _and_ LEONIDLIZA. What have you done, what have you done!...NADYA. [_Not listening to her, softly to_ LEONID] You will come to-morrow?LEONID. I will.LIZA. What's the matter, don't you hear?NADYA. If I can't come, I'll send a note somehow or other.LEONID. Good!NADYA. Well, good-by. [_They kiss._LIZA. [_Loudly_] Nadya!NADYA. [_Goes up to_ LIZA. LEONID _sits down upon the bench_] What's thematter?LIZA. Vasilisa Peregrinovna saw you rowing on the pond.NADYA. Well, deuce take her!LIZA. My dear girl, don't carry your head too high!LEONID. Nadya! [NADYA _goes to him_] Oh, Nadya, what a vile,good-for-nothing fellow I am!NADYA. What do you mean?LEONID. Little Nadya! [_He whispers in her ear._NADYA. [_Shakes her head_] Oh, my precious darling, why did that come intoyour head? I'm not sorry for this, but you are. How kind you are! Now,good-by! It's high time. I shouldn't leave you, but I can't help it; I'mnot my own mistress.LEONID. Good-by, then!_Slowly, as if unwillingly, they separate._ NADYA _returns, overtakes_LEONID _and gazes into his eyes._NADYA. Do you love me?LEONID. I do love you, indeed I do![_They kiss and go out in different directions._IVSame room as in second pictureSCENE I[1][Footnote 1: The whole scene in a whisper.]POTAPYCH _is leaning against the door-jamb, his hand to his head._ VASILISAPEREGRINOVNA _enters quietly._VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Result of yesterday evening, I suppose, my friend?POTAPYCH. Wha-a-t?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Your head aches.POTAPYCH. Did you put up the money?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. You haven't any money for anything else; but youhave for such things.POTAPYCH. Well, anyhow, it ain't your business.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Of course, Potapych, you're an old man, whyshouldn't you take a drink once in a while?POTAPYCH. Sure, I guess I work for it.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Just so, Potapych!POTAPYCH. I'm tired of being lectured by you!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. I wish you well, Potapych.POTAPYCH. No need for it! [_Silence_] But you keep upsetting the mistressso! If you'd only put in a word for us when she's in a good humor; but youjust look for the wrong time, in order to complain of us.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. What do you say, Potapych? God preserve me!POTAPYCH. What's that! No matter how much you swear, I know you! Forinstance, why are you coming to the mistress now?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. To wish the benefactress good morning.POTAPYCH. You'd better not come.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Why so?POTAPYCH. It must be she got out the wrong side of bed; she's out of sorts.[VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA _rubs her hands with pleasure_] Here now, I see thatyou're happy; you're dying for some deviltry or other. Phew! Lord forgiveus! What a disposition!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. You are saying insulting words to me, Potapych,insulting to my very heart. When did I ever say anything about you to themistress?POTAPYCH. If not about me, then about somebody else.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. But that's my business.POTAPYCH. Your spite's always getting in its work.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Not spite, not spite, my friend! You're mistaken! Ihave just been so insulted that it's impossible to live in this world afterit. I shall die, but I shall not forget.MADAM ULANBEKOV _enters._ POTAPYCH _goes out._SCENE IIMADAM ULANBEKOV _and_ VASILISA PEREGRINOVNAVASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. [_Kissing both of_ MADAM ULANBEKOV'S _hands_] Youhave risen early, benefactress. You must have an awful lot of things onyour mind.MADAM ULANBEKOV. [_Sitting down_] I didn't sleep much. I had a bad dream.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. What, a dream, benefactress? The dream may beterrible, but God is merciful. Not the dream, but what is going on inreality, disturbs you, benefactress. I see that; I've seen it a long time.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Bah, what is it to me what's going on?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Why, benefactress, don't we know that your son, dearlittle soul! is struck with every creature he meets?MADAM ULANBEKOV. You make me tired.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. I'm so sorry for you, benefactress! Don't look forany consolation in this life! You scatter benefactions upon every one; buthow do they repay you? The world is full of lust.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Go away!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. [_Weeping_] I can't keep back my tears when I lookat you! My heart bleeds that they don't respect you, that they don'trespect you even in your own house! In your honorable house, in such piouspremises as these, to do such things!MADAM ULANBEKOV. [_Frowning_] You silly crow! You want to croak aboutsomething or other. Well, croak away!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Benefactress, I'm afraid it might upset you.MADAM ULANBEKOV. You've upset me already. Talk!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. [_Glances about in all directions and sits down ona stool at the feet of_ MADAM ULANBEKOV] Yesterday, benefactress, I wasending my evening prayer to the Heavenly Creator, and went out to stroll inthe garden, and to occupy myself for the night with pious meditations.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Well!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. And what did I see there, benefactress! How my legsheld me up, I don't know! That Liza of yours was running through the busheswith a depraved look; it must be she was seeking her lovers. Our master,the little angel! was rowing in the boat on the pond, and Nadya, also witha depraved expression, was clinging to him with her arms about his neck,and was kissing him. And it was easy to see that he, because of his purity,was trying to thrust her away; but she kept clasping him about the neck,kissing and tempting him.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Are you lying?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. You may quarter me, benefactress.MADAM ULANBEKOV. It's enough if there is one grain of truth in your words.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. It's all true, benefactress.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Fiddlesticks! not all--it can't be! You always make upmore than half. But where were the servants?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. All of them, benefactress, were more or less drunk.No sooner had you gone to bed, than they all went to the fair and gottipsy. Gavrilovna, Potapych, all were drunk. What an example to the young!MADAM ULANBEKOV. This must be looked into thoroughly. Of course, Ishouldn't have expected the least mischief of Leonid. Quiet lads like him!Well, if he'd been a soldier, it would be pardonable; but as it is....[_She muses._VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. And furthermore, benefactress, so far Grisha hasn'tcome back from the fair.MADAM ULANBEKOV. How's that? He didn't sleep at home?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. He did not, benefactress!MADAM ULANBEKOV. You lie, you lie, you lie! I'll drive you off the place!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. May I die in my tracks!MADAM ULANBEKOV. [_Sinking back in her chair_] You want to kill me.[_Raising herself from the chair_] You simply want to kill me. [_She rings.Enter_ POTAPYCH] Where's Grisha?POTAPYCH. Just came, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Send him here! [POTAPYCH _goes out_] This certainly beatsall!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. You'll not find anybody more devoted than I,benefactress; only I am unhappy in one respect: that my dispositiondispleases you._Enter_ GRISHA, _his hair tousled and dishevelled._SCENE III_The same, and_ GRISHAMADAM ULANBEKOV. Where've you been?GRISHA. [_Now opens, now closes his eyes, not sure of his tongue, andunsteady on his legs_] At the fair, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Just come from it? [GRISHA _is silent_] Why don't youtalk? [_Silence_] Am I going to get a word out of you, or not?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Answer the mistress.GRISHA. What's that to you?MADAM ULANBEKOV. Answer me! Where have you been all this time?GRISHA. I've done wrong, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. I'm not asking you whether you've done wrong or not; I'masking you where you were!GRISHA. [_Looks at the ceiling with a vacant stare_] Why, where should Ibe? The idea! The same place as usual!MADAM ULANBEKOV. Well, where's that?GRISHA. I just informed you that I was there all the time, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. You'll drive me out of patience! Where's there?GRISHA. But, really, ma'am! Your will in everything, ma'am. What did I,ma'am.... I've done wrong, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Good Lord! You're still drunk, I guess.GRISHA. Not a bit, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Nonsense! I can see.GRISHA. But, really, ma'am! One can say anything about a man.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Bah, you disgraceful scamp! He still denies it! This isawful! This is awful! Now, speak up, where've you been?GRISHA. Why, really, ma'am! I just informed you, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Were you at the fair all night?GRISHA. I just informed you so, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. How did you dare, when I let you go for only a short time?GRISHA. Well, really, ma'am! I did want to go home, but they wouldn't letme, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Who wouldn't let you go?GRISHA. My friends wouldn't, ma'am.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Who are these friends of yours?GRISHA. Why, really, ma'am! Government office clerks.MADAM ULANBEKOV. Great heavens! Clerks! Do you understand what kind ofpeople they are?GRISHA. Who, ma'am, clerks? Understand what about them, ma'am?MADAM ULANBEKOV. And you prowled about with them all night! It would havebeen better if you hadn't told me, nasty scamp that you are! I know howthey act! They'll teach you all sorts of things! What does this mean?Be-gone! And don't you dare show yourself before my eyes!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Ask forgiveness, you blockhead! Kiss the dear lady'shand!GRISHA _waves his hand impatiently and goes out._MADAM ULANBEKOV. What an affliction! It'll simply make me ill! Already Ifeel my spasms are beginning. What a worthless scamp! He went out just asif he had no responsibilities! And without a sign of repentance!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Ah, benefactress, you see he's still a child; he didit just out of stupidity.MADAM ULANBEKOV. No, he needs a good....VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. What do you say, benefactress? He's still a regularbooby! What can you expect of him! He'll get wiser, then it will bealtogether different.MADAM ULANBEKOV. What offends me most is ingratitude! It seems to me heought to feel what I am doing for him. I'm positively sick. Go for thedoctor!VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Calm yourself, benefactress; as if that rabble wereworth your getting upset over!MADAM ULANBEKOV. Hand me the smelling-salts.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. [_Hands her them_] Snap your fingers at them, that'sall. Now, if only those girls....MADAM ULANBEKOV. Oh, here's another affliction! Now I certainly can'tcollect my thoughts; I'm completely distracted, and now she begins on thegirls! I shall take to my bed at any moment.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Lust, benefactress, is beyond all endurance.MADAM ULANBEKOV. No, they needn't expect any mercy from me. As it is, Iforgive one, then another, and so the whole crowd is spoiled. [_She rings;enter_ POTAPYCH] Call Nadezhda, and come here yourself! [POTAPYCH _goesout_] That's what it is to be a woman. If I were a man, would they dare beso willful?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. They don't give a fig for you, benefactress, not afig. They aren't a little bit afraid of you!MADAM ULANBEKOV. They're going to find out pretty quick whether I amount toanything._Enter_ POTAPYCH _and_ NADYA. GAVRILOVNA _and_ LIZA _look through thedoor_.SCENE IV_The same_, POTAPYCH _and_ NADYAMADAM ULANBEKOV. Nadezhda! Vasilisa PEREGRINOVNA says she saw you in thegarden last night with the master. Is that so? [NADYA _is silent_] You'resilent, that means it's true. Well, now, you can thank yourself. I'm not aconniver at loose conduct, and I won't endure it in my house. I can't turnyou out as a vagabond, that would weigh upon my conscience. I am obligedto marry you off. [_To_ POTAPYCH] Send to town and tell NEGLIGENTOV that Ishall marry Nadya to him; and let the wedding be just as soon as possible.[_She rises from her chair and is about to leave_].NADYA. [_Falling at her feet_] Whatever you wish, only not marriage withhim!MADAM ULANBEKOV. Fiddlesticks! What I have once said is sacred. And whatdo you mean by this scene? Can't you see that I'm not well? To keep onplaguing me! Potapych! She has no father; you be a father to her instead;and impress upon her in fatherly fashion the baseness of her conduct, andthe fact that she must obey my commands.POTAPYCH. You listen, Nadezhda, to what the mistress commands! Because whenshe intrusts you to me, it means that I must show my authority over you. Ifyou command it, mistress, I can at once, in your presence, give her somemoral instruction with my own hand! Here, if you dare to say one tiny wordto the contrary, I'll drag you off by the hair, no matter what any onesays.[_He raises his hand threateningly._]NADYA. Oh!... [_She crouches._]MADAM ULANBEKOV. Don't strike her! What disgusting scenes!POTAPYCH. But, mistress! You can't get results by talking! Besides, if I'mher father, that's the regular thing! That's the law, and according tothat, since she is rebelling against you now, I ought to give you thatsatisfaction.NADYA. [_Weeping_] Mistress, don't ruin me!MADAM ULANBEKOV. Oh, my God! You don't spare me at all. Tears, squabblings!Send for the doctor at once! How many times have I got to say it? It'syour own fault, you've nobody to blame for your tears. Potapych! get thisbusiness over with! I don't like to repeat the same thing ten times over._She goes out,_ GAVRILOVNA _after her. Silence_. GAVRILOVNA _returns_.GAVRILOVNA. She's gone to bed, and banged the door behind her.POTAPYCH. [_At the window_] Antoshka! Antoshka! Post boy! Saddle the horseand ride to town for the doctor. Oh, you! Lord!NADYA. [_Rising from her knees_] Don't you think it's a sin for you toabuse me, Potapych? What have I ever done to you?POTAPYCH. What do I care? What do I care about you? When the mistressreally wants something, I have to try to please her in every way; because Iwas born her servant.NADYA. If she had commanded you to kill me, would you have done it?POTAPYCH. That's not my affair, I can't argue about that.GAVRILOVNA. That's enough, Nadya, don't cry! God doesn't abandon orphans.NADYA _falls upon_ GAVRILOVNA'S _bosom_.LIZA. [_To_ VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA] Well, is your heart content now?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Wait, my dear, your turn will come.LEONID _enters_.SCENE V_The same and_ LEONIDLEONID. What's this? What has happened?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. You made all the trouble yourself, and then ask whathas happened.LEONID. What trouble did I make? What are you continually thinking up?VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Now, don't pretend! The whole truth has come out.You've been having a little fun. What of it? At your age, why shouldn't youhave?LIZA. She's reported the whole thing to the mistress. The mistress got soangry that it was awful! And now, sir, she is going to marry Nadya to thatgovernment clerk.LEONID. Are you sure?NADYA. The thing's settled, dearest master! I have to answer for lastevening's sport.LEONID. Is mamma very angry?GAVRILOVNA. No one dares go near her.LEONID. But how can that be? Isn't it possible to talk her over somehow orother?GAVRILOVNA. Just go and try. No, she won't come out of her room now forfive days; and she won't let any one at all see her there.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Do you want to talk your mamma over?LEONID. Yes.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Do you want me to tell you how?LEONID. Please be so kind, Vasilisa Peregrinovna.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Well, permit me. Our benefactress is very much hurtat Grisha, because he didn't spend the night at home: he came in drunk, anddidn't even ask forgiveness nor kiss her hand. It was this vexation thatmade her sick. And then this Nadezhda happened to come her way when shewas angry. Now our benefactress won't even come out of her room, and won'tallow any one to go to her, so long as that stubborn Grisha doesn't begforgiveness.GAVRILOVNA. How contrarily everything happened! Grisha will keep up hischaracter, too. Although he is a blockhead, he has some sense. Now he'llflop down on the hay and he'll lie there on his belly for four days.POTAPYCH. Somebody ought to take Uncle Gerasim's club and dress him downfrom top to toe.VASILISA PEREGRINOVNA. Now, our dear master, wouldn't you like to gopresent your compliments to him, in order that he might hurry up and askyour mamma's forgiveness?LEONID. [_Upon reflection_] That would be too great an honor for him. Butsee here, Gavrilovna, is mamma actually very angry?GAVRILOVNA. So angry, sir, that it's terrible!LEONID. Well, what's to be done now!NADYA. Why are you bothering? You see, there's nothing you can do: betterleave me! Now you'll soon go away to Petersburg; you will be happy: whyshould you think about such trifles, or disturb yourself?LEONID. Why, you see, I'm sorry for you!NADYA. Don't be sorry, if you please! I ran to my own destruction of my ownfree will, like a mad girl, without once stopping to think.LEONID. What are you planning to do now?NADYA. That's my business.LEONID. But, you see, it's going to be very hard for you.NADYA. What business is it of yours? It will be all the happier for you.LEONID. But why do you talk like this?NADYA. Because you're still a boy!... Leave me!LEONID. But, you see, he's such a drunken, vile fellow.NADYA. Oh, my God! It would be better for you to go off somewhere: out ofmy sight.LEONID. Yes, really, it would be better for me to spend a week with ourneighbors.NADYA. For God's sake, do!LEONID. But Nadya, if it should be awfully hard for you to live with yourhusband, what then?NADYA. [_Weeping_] Oh, leave me alone! Be good enough to leave me alone![_Sobbing_] I beg only one thing of you: leave me, for God's sake! [_Shesobs_.GAVRILOVNA _and_ LIZA. [_Motioning with their hands_] Go away! Go away!LEONID. Why do you drive me out? I guess I'm sorry enough for her! I keepthinking somehow or other, that it may still be possible to help her insome way.NADYA. [_With desperation_] I don't want any helpers or defenders! I don'twant them!

In the left wall a window, and beside thewindow a table. Near the table a chair; near the right wall a desk and awooden stool. Beside the bed a guitar; on the table and desk are books andpapers_.SCENE IMITYA _is walking back and forth in the room_. EGORUSHKA _is seated on thestool reading_ "Bova Korolevich."EGORUSHKA. [_Reads_] "My sovereign father, glorious and brave king, KiribitVerzoulovich, I do not possess the courage to marry him now. Because when Iwas young I was wooed by King Gvidon."MITYA. Well, Egorushka, is any one at home?EGORUSHKA. [_Putting his finger on the place where he is reading in ordernot to make a mistake_] Nobody; they've all gone driving. There's onlyGordey Karpych at home. [_Reads_] "Whereupon Kiribit Verzoulovich said tohis daughter"--[_Again marking the place_]--only he's in such a rage, it'sawful! I cleared out--he keeps on cursing. [_Reads_] "Then the beautifulMilitrisa Kirbityevna called her servant Licharda to her."MITYA. With whom was he angry?EGORUSHKA. With my uncle, with Lyubim KARPYCH. On the second day of theholidays Uncle Lyubim KARPYCH dined with us; at dinner he got drunk andbegan to play the fool; it was awfully funny. I always get the giggles. Icouldn't stand it, and then I burst out laughing, and they were all lookingat me. Uncle Gordey KARPYCH took it as a great insult to himself and verybad manners, and he was furious with him and turned him out. Uncle LyubimKarpych made a great row, and out of revenge went and stood with thebeggars by the church door. Uncle Gordey Karpych said: "He has put me toshame," he said, "in the eyes of the whole town." And now he gets angrywith everybody who comes near him, no matter who they are. [_Reads_] "Withthe intention of advancing toward our town."MITYA. [_Looking out of the window_] Here they come, I think. Yes, it's so.Pelageya Egorovna, Lyubov Gordeyevna, and guests with them.EGORUSHKA. [_Concealing his story in his pocket_] I'll run up-stairs.                                                        [_Goes out_.SCENE IIMITYA aloneMITYA. Oh, Lord, what misery! Everybody in the streets is having a holiday,and everybody in the houses too, and you have to sit between four walls! Iam a stranger to all, no relations, no friends!--And then besides!--O well!I'd better get to work; perhaps this wretchedness will pass off. [_Seatshimself at the desk and muses, then begins to sing_.    "Her beauty I cannot describe!    Dark eyebrows, with languishing eyes."Yes, with languishing eyes. And yesterday when she came from mass, in hersable coat, and her little handkerchief on her head, like this--ah!--Ireally think such beauty was never seen before! [_Muses, then sings_.    "Where, O where was this beauty born!"My work all goes out of my head! I'm always thinking of her! My heart istormented with sorrow. O misery most miserable!_Covers his face with his hands and sits silent. Enter_ PELAGEYA EGOROVNA,_dressed in winter clothes; she stops in the doorway._SCENE IIIMITYA and PELAGEYA EGOROVNAPELAGEYA EGOROVNA. Mitya, Mitya dear!MITYA. What do you want?PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. Come up to us later on in the evening, my dear, and playwith the girls. We're going to sing songs.MITYA. Thank you exceedingly, I shall make it my first duty.PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. Why are you always sitting alone in the office? It's notvery cheerful! You'll come, won't you? Gordey Karpych won't be at home.MITYA. Good, I shall come without fail.PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. He's going off again, you see; he's going off there tothat friend of his--what's his name?MITYA. To Afrikan Savvich?PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. Yes, yes! He's quite gone on him! Lord forgive him!MITYA. Take a seat, Pelageya Egorovna. [_Fetches a chair_.PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. Oh, I have no time. Well, yes, I'll sit down a bit.[_Sits down_] Now just think, what a misfortune! Really, they've becomesuch friends that it beats everything! Yes, that's what it's come to! Andwhy? What's the use of it all? Tell me that, pray. Isn't Afrikan Savvich acoarse, drunken fellow? Isn't he?MITYA. Perhaps Gordey Karpych has some business with Afrikan Savvich.PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. What sort of business! He has no business at all. Yousee Afrikan Savvich is always drinking with that Englishman. He has anEnglishman as director of his factory, and they drink together! But he'sno fit company for my husband. But can you reason with him? Just think howproud he is! He says to me: "There isn't a soul here to speak to; all," hesays, "are rabble, all, you see, are just so many peasants, and they livelike peasants. But that man, you see, is from Moscow--lives mostly inMoscow--and he's rich." And whatever has happened to him? Well, you see, itwas all of a sudden, my dear boy, all of a sudden! He used to have so muchsense. Well, we lived, of course not luxuriously, but all the same prettyfairly decently; and then last year he went for a trip, and he caught itfrom some one. He caught it, he caught it, they have told me so--caught allthese tricks. Now he doesn't care for any of our Russian ways. He keepsharping on this: "I want to be up to date, I want to be in the fashion.Yes, yes! Put on a cap," he says! What an idea to get! Am I going to try tocharm any one in my old age and make myself look lovely? Bah! You just tryto do anything with him. He never drank before--really he didn't--but nowhe drinks with this Afrikan. It must be that drink has turned his brain[_points to her head_] and muddled him.... [_Silence_] I think now that thedevil has got hold of him! Why can't he have some sense! If he were a youngfellow! For a young fellow to dress up and all that is all right; but yousee he's nearly sixty, my dear, nearly sixty! Really! "Your fashionableup-to-date things," says I, "change every day; our Russian things havelived from time immemorial! The old folks weren't any stupider than we."But can you reason with him, my dear, with his violent character?MITYA. What is there to say? He's a harsh man.PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. Lyubov is just at the right age now; we ought to besettling her, but he keeps dinning it in: "There's no one her equal, no!no!" But there is! But he says there isn't. How hard all this is for amother's heart.MITYA. Perhaps Gordey Karpych wishes to marry Lyubov Gordeyevna in Moscow.PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. Who knows what he has in his mind? He looks like a wildbeast, and never says a word, as if I were not a mother. Yes, truly, Inever say anything to him; I don't dare; all you can do is to speak withsome outsider about your grief, and weep, and relieve your heart; that'sall. [_Rises_] You'll come, Mitya?MITYA. I'll come, ma'am.GUSLIN _comes in_.SCENE IVThe _same and_ GUSLINPELAGEYA EGOROVNA. Here's another fine lad! Come up-stairs to us, Yasha,and sing songs with the girls; you're good at that; and bring along yourguitar.GUSLIN. Thank you, ma'am: I don't think of that as work; I must say it's apleasure.PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. Well, good-by! I'm going to take a nap for half an hour.GUSLIN _and_ MITYA. Good-by.PELAGEYA EGOROVNA _goes out_; MITYA _seats himself dejectedly at thetable_; GUSLIN _seats himself on the bed and takes up the guitar_.SCENE VMITYA _and_ YASHA GUSLINGUSLIN. What a crowd there was at the fair! Your people were there. Whyweren't you?MITYA. Because I felt so awfully miserable.GUSLIN. What's the matter? What are you unhappy about?MITYA. How can I help being unhappy? Thoughts like these keep coming intomy head: what sort of man am I in the world? My mother is old and poornow, and I must keep her--and how? My salary is small; I get nothing butabuse and insults from Gordey Karpych; he keeps reproaching me with mypoverty, as if I were to blame--and he doesn't increase my salary. I'dlook for another place, but where can one find one without friends? And,yes, I will confess to you that I won't go to another place.GOSLIN. Why won't you go? There at the Razlyulyayevs' it's very nice--thepeople are rich and kind.MITYA. No, Yasha, that doesn't suit me! I'll bear anything from GordeyKarpych, I'll stand poverty, but I won't go away. That's my destiny!GUSLIN. Why so?MITYA. [_Rises_] Well, I have a reason for this. It is, Yasha, because Ihave another sorrow--but nobody knows about it. I haven't spoken to any oneabout my sorrow.GUSLIN. Tell me about it.MITYA. [_Waving his hand_] What for?GUSLIN. Yes, tell me; don't put on airs!MITYA. Whether I tell you or not, you can't help me!GUSLIN. How do you know?MITYA. [_Walking toward_ GUSLIN] Nobody can help me--I am a lost man! I'vefallen wildly in love with Lyubov Gordeyevna.GUSLIN. What's the matter with you, Mitya? Whatever do you mean?MITYA. Well, anyhow, it's a fact.GUSLIN. You'd better put it out of your head, Mitya. Nothing can ever comeof that, so there's no use thinking about it.MITYA. Though I know all this, one cannot control one's heart. "To love ismost easy, one cannot forget." [_He speaks with violent gestures_] "I lovethe beautiful girl more than family, more than race; but evil people forbidme, and they bid me cease."GUSLIN. Yes, indeed; but you must stop it! Now Anna Ivanovna is my equal;she has no money, and I haven't a kopek--and even so uncle forbids me tomarry. It's no use for you to think of doing so. You'll get it into yourhead and then it'll be still harder for you.MITYA. [_Declaiming_] "What of all things is most cruel? The most cruelthing is love." [_Walking about the room_.] Yasha, have you read Koltsov?GUSLIN. Yes, why?MITYA. How he describes all these feelings!GUSLIN. He does describe them exactly.MITYA. Exactly, to perfection. [_Walking about the room_] Yasha!GUSLIN. What?MITYA. I myself have composed a song.GUSLIN. You?MITYA. Yes.GUSLIN. Let's make up a tune for it, and we'll sing it.MITYA. Good! Here, take this [_gives him a paper_] and I'll write alittle--I have some work: most likely Gordey Karpych will be asking meabout it. [_Sits and writes_.GUSLIN _takes the guitar and begins to pick out a tune_. RAZLYULYAYEV_comes in with an accordion_.SCENE VI_The same and_ RAZLYULYAYEVRAZLYULYAYEV. Hello, boys! [_Plays on the accordion and begins to dance_.GUSLIN. What a fool! What did you buy that accordion for?RAZLYULYAYEV. Why, I bought it to play on, of course--this way. [_Plays_.GUSLIN. Well, that's fine music, I must say! Stop, I tell you!RAZLYULYAYEV. What! Do you think I'll stop? I'll stop when I want to.--Whatairs! Haven't I got any money? [_Slapping his pocket_] It chinks! If we goon a spree--then it's some spree!    "One mountain is high,    And another is low;    One darling is far,    And another is near."Mitya! [_Strikes_ MITYA _on the shoulder_] Mitya, why are you sittingstill?MITYA. I have some work to do. [_Continues to work_.RAZLYULYAYEV. Mitya! Say, Mitya, I'm on a spree, my boy! Really, I am. Oh,come on! [_Sings, "One mountain is high," etc_.] Mitya! Say, Mitya, I'mgoing on a spree for the whole holiday season--then I'll set to work,upon my word I will! Haven't I got any money? There it is! And I'm notdrunk.--Oh, no, such a spree!--so jolly!MITYA. Well, go on a spree as much as you like.RAZLYULYAYEV. And after the holidays I shall marry!--Upon my word I shallmarry! I'll get a rich girl.GUSLIN. Now, then, listen; how does this sound?RAZLYULYAYEV. Sing it, sing it! I'll listen.GUSLIN. [_Sings_]    "Is naught so hard and evil    As to be fatherless;    Than slavery more grievous    And sharper than distress.    All in the world make holiday,    But lonely you must pine.    Your mind is wild and drunken,    But it came not from the wine.    Youth shall not do your pleasure,    Beauty no healing bear.    Your sweetheart does not comb your locks,    But your harsh stepdame, Care."_During all this time_ RAZLYULYAYEV _stands as if rooted to the ground, andlistens with emotion; when the song is finished all are silent_.RAZLYULYAYEV. Good! Very good! It's awfully sad; it takes hold of one'sheart. [_Sighs_] Ah, Yasha! play something cheerful; that's enough of thisstuff--to-day's a holiday. [_Sings_.    "Who does not love a hussar!    Life without love would be sad!"Play the tune, Yasha.GUSLIN _plays the tune_.MITYA. That's enough of your fooling. Come, now, let's sit down in a circleand sing in a low tone.RAZLYULYAYEV. All right. [_They sit down_.GUSLIN. [_Begins to sing_; MITYA _and_ RAZLYULYAYEV _join in_]    "Now my young, my young lads,    You my friends...."_Enter_ GORDEY KARPYCH; _all stand up and stop singing_.SCENE VII_The same and_ GORDEY KARPYCHGORDEY KARPYCH. What's all this screeching! Bawling like so many peasants![_To_ MITYA] And you here! You're not living here in a peasant's hut! Whata dram-shop! See that this sort of thing doesn't go on in the future![_Goes to the table and inspects the papers_] Why are these papers allscattered about?MITYA. I was looking over the accounts, sir. GORDEY KARPYCH. [_Takes thebook by Koltsov, and the copy-book with verses_] And this, too, what's thisrubbish?MITYA. I was copying these poems of Koltsov's to pass the time away, sinceit's a holiday. GORDEY KARPYCH. You are sentimental for a poor lad!MITYA. I just study for my own education, in order to understand things.GORDEY KARPYCH. Education! Do you know what education is?--And yet youkeep on talking! You ought to get yourself a new coat! For when you comeup-stairs to us and there are guests, it's a disgrace! What do you do withyour money?MITYA. I send it to my mother because she is old and has nowhere to getany.GORDEY KARPYCH. Send it to your mother! You ought to educate yourselffirst; God knows what your mother needs! She wasn't brought up in luxury;most likely she used to look after the cows herself.MITYA. It's better that I should suffer than that my mother should be inany want at all.GORDEY KARPYCH. This is simply disgusting! If you don't know yourself howto observe decency, then sit in your hovel! If you haven't anything towear, then don't have any fancies! You write verses, you wish to educateyourself--and you go about looking like a factory hand! Does educationconsist in this, in singing idiotic songs? You idiot! [_Through his teethand looking askance at_ MITYA] Fool! [_Is silent_] Don't you dare to showyourself in that suit up-stairs. Listen, I tell you! [_To_ RAZLYULYAYEV]And you too! Your father, to all appearances, rakes up money with a shovel,and you go about in this Russian smock.RAZLYULYAYEV. What do you say! It's new--French goods--I ordered it fromMoscow--from an acquaintance--twenty rubles a yard! Do you think I oughtto go about in a bob-tailed coat, like Franz Fedorych at the apothecary's!Why, they all tease him there!--the deuce of a coat! What's the use ofmaking people laugh! GORDEY KARPYCH. Much you know! It's hopeless to expectanything of you! You yourself are an idiot, and your father hasn't muchmore sense--he always goes about in dirty old clothes. You live likeignorant fools, and like fools you will die.RAZLYULYAYEV. That's enough!GORDEY KARPYCH. What?RAZLYULYAYEV. That's enough, I say!GORDEY KARPYCH. Clown! You don't even know how to talk straight! It'ssimply waste of words to speak to you--like shooting peas against awall--to waste words on such as you, fools! [_Goes out_.SCENE VIII_The same without_ TORTSOVRAZLYULYAYEV. Just look! How savage! What a rage he's in! Oh, we're awfullyscared of you--you bet we are!MITYA. [_To_ GUSLIN] There, that's the sort of life I lead! That's the sortof thing I have to put up with!RAZLYULYAYEV. It'll drive you to drink--upon my word, it'll drive you todrink! But you'd better stop thinking about it. [_Sings_.

GordeyKarpych has gone out, and Pelageya Egorovna has gone to lie down, so now weare free! Be as jolly as you please!MITYA. I humbly beg you to sit down._They sit down_; MITYA _seats himself opposite_ LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA;RAZLYULYAYEV _walks about_.ANNA IVANOVNA. It grew dull sitting silent cracking nuts. "Come on, girls,"said I, "and see the boys," and that suited the girls.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. What stories you do make up! We never thought of cominghere--that was your idea.ANNA IVANOVNA. Much you didn't! You were the first! Everybody knows, if aperson wants a thing, then he thinks about it; the boys of the girls, andthe girls of the boys.RAZLYULYAYEV. Ha, ha, ha! Anna Ivanovna, you have said it exactly.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Not a bit of it!MASHA. [_To_ LIZA] Oh, how embarrassing!LIZA. Anna Ivanovna, you are just saying what isn't true.ANNA IVANOVNA. Oh, you modest thing! I'd like to say a word--but itwouldn't be nice before the boys!--I've been a girl myself. I know allabout it.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. There are girls and girls!MASHA. Oh, how embarrassing!LIZA. What you say sounds very strange to us, and, I must say, it'sdisconcerting.RAZLYULYAYEV. Ha, ha, ha!ANNA IVANOVNA. What were we talking about just now up-stairs? Do you wantme to tell? Shall I tell them? Well, have you calmed down now?RAZLYULYAYEV. Ha, ha, ha!ANNA IVANOVNA. What are _you_ opening your mouth for? It wasn't aboutyou--don't you worry.RAZLYULYAYEV. Even if it wasn't about me, still it may be there is some onewho thinks about me. I know what I know! [_Dances to a tune_.

What do you say!--Really?GUSLIN. It's really true.ANNA IVANOVNA. Well, then, all right; keep quiet! [_They talk in awhisper_.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. You, Mitya, will you come to us later on in the evening?MITYA. I will.RAZLYULYAYEV. And I'm coming; I'm good at dancing. [_Stands with armsakimbo_] Girls! do fall in love with me, one of you!MASHA. You ought to be ashamed of yourself! What's that you're saying?RAZLYULYAYEV. Why such airs! I say, fall in love with me,somebody--yes--for my simplicity.LIZA. People don't talk like that to girls. You ought to wait till they dofall in love with you.RAZLYULYAYEV. Yes, much I'll get from you by waiting! [_Dances_    "Who does not love a hussar!"LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. [_Looking at_ MITYA] It may be somebody loves somebodyand won't tell! He must guess himself.LIZA. How can any girl in the world say that!MASHA. I know it!ANNA IVANOVNA. [_Goes up to them and looks now at_ LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA _andnow at_ MITYA _and sings_:    "Already it is seen    If somebody loves somebody--    Opposite the beloved one she seats herself    Heavily sighing."MITYA. Who does that apply to?ANNA IVANOVNA. We know to whom.RAZLYULYAYEV. Stay, girls, I'll sing you a song.ANNA IVANOVNA. Sing, sing!RAZLYULYAYEV. [_Sings slowly_]    "A bear was flying through the sky."ANNA IVANOVNA. Don't you know anything worse than that!LIZA. We might think you were making fun of us.RAZLYULYAYEV. If this isn't good enough I'll sing you another, for I'm ajolly fellow. [_Sings_.    "Beat! Beat! upon the board.     Moscow! Moscow! that's the word.     Moscow's got it in his head     That Kolomna he will wed.     Tula laughs with all his heart.     But with the dowry will not part.     Buckwheat is tuppence. It's twenty for oats.

What weather!MASHA. This doesn't concern us.LIZA. We don't trade in flour.ANNA IVANOVNA. What are you interrupting for! Just guess this riddle.What's this: round--but not a girl; with a tail--but not a mouse?[1][Footnote 1: A turnip.]RAZLYULYAYEV. That's a hard one!ANNA IVANOVNA. Indeed it is!--You just think it over! Now, girls, comealong! [_The girls rise and get ready to go_] Come along, boys!GUSLIN _and_ RAZLYULYAYEV _get ready_.MITYA. But I'll come later. I'll put things to rights here first.ANNA IVANOVNA.

[_Hands her a chair_] Be seated, Lyubov Gordeyevna, and talk to mefor just a moment. I'm very glad to see you in my room.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Why are you glad? I don't understand.MITYA. Oh, why!--It is very pleasant for me to see on your side suchconsideration; it is above my deserts to receive it from you. This is thesecond time I have had the good fortune--LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. There's nothing in that! I came here, sat awhile, andwent away again. That means nothing. Maybe I'll go away again at once.MITYA. Oh, no! Don't go!--Why should you! [_Takes the paper out of hispocket_] Permit me to present to you my work, the best I can do--from myheart.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. What is this?MITYA. I made these verses just for you.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA.

Read it.MITYA. Directly._Seats himself at the table, and takes the paper_: LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA_approaches very near to him_.    "In the meadow no grasses wither,    And never a flower doth fade;    However a fair lad fadeth    That once was a lusty blade.    He loved a handsome damsel;    For that his grief is great,    And heavy his misfortune,    For she came of high estate.    The lad's heart is breaking,    But vain his grief must be,    Because he loved a damsel    Above his own degree.    When all the night is darkened    The sun may not appear;    And so the pretty maiden.    She may not be his dear."LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. [_Sitting and reflecting for some time_] Give it here.[_Takes the paper and hides it, then rises_] Now I will write somethingfor you.MITYA. You!LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Only I don't know how to do it in verse, but--just plainRussian.MITYA. I shall regard such a kindness from you as a great happiness tomyself.

[_Shewrites_; MITYA _tries to look_] Only don't you look, or I'll stop writingand tear it up.MITYA. I won't look. But kindly condescend to permit me to reply, in so faras I am able, and to write some verses for you on a second occasion.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. [_Laying down the pen_] Write if you wish--only I'veinked all my fingers; if I'd only known, I'd better not have written.MITYA. May I have it?LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Well, take it; only don't dare to read it while I'mhere, but after, when I've gone._Folds together the paper and gives it to him; he conceals it in hispocket_.MITYA.

Oh, it's I, niece! What? You got a fright? Clear out, nevermind! I'm not the man to tell tales. I'll put it in a box, and think itover after, all in my spare time.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Good-by.

Warm yourself up, Lyubim Karpych.LYUBIM KARPYCH. You will not drive me away, Mitya? If you do, I'll freezein the yard--I'll freeze like a dog.MITYA. How could I? What are you saying?LYUBIM KARPYCH. You see, Mitya, my brother turned me out. As long as I hada little money, I strolled about in warm places; now I have no money, andthey won't let me come in anywhere. All I had was two francs and some-oddcentimes! Not a great capital! It wouldn't build a stone house! It wouldn'tbuy a village! What could one do with such a capital? Where put it? Nottake it to a bank! So then I took this capital and drank it up!--squanderedit!--That's the way of it!MITYA. Why do you drink, Lyubim Karpych? That makes you your own enemy.LYUBIM KARPYCH. Why do I drink? From stupidity! Yes, from my own stupidity.Why did you think I drank?MITYA. You'd better stop it.LYUBIM KARPYCH. It's impossible to stop; I've got started on this track.MITYA. What track?LYUBIM KARPYCH. Ah, well, listen--you're a kind soul--what this track was.Only, you listen, take note of it. I was left when my father died, justa kid, tall as a bean pole, a little fool of twenty. The wind whistledthrough my head like an empty garret! My brother and I divided up things:he took the factory himself, and gave me my share in money, draftsand promissory notes. Well, now, how he divided with me is not ourbusiness--God be his judge! Well, then I went to Moscow to get money on thedrafts. I had to go! One must see people and show oneself, and learn goodmanners. Then again, I was such a handsome young man, and I'd never seenthe world, or spent the night in a private house. I felt I must tryeverything! First thing, I got myself dressed like a dandy. "Know ourpeople!" says I. That is, I played the fool to a rarity! Of course, Istarted to visit all the taverns: "_Schpeelen sie polka_! Give us a bottleoff the ice!" I got together enough friends to fill a pond! I went to thetheatres--MITYA. Well, Lyubim Karpych, it must be very nice in the theatre.LYUBIM KARPYCH. I kept going to see the tragedies; I liked them very much,only I didn't see anything decently, and I didn't understand anythingbecause I was nearly always drunk. [_Rises_] "Drink beneath the dagger ofProkop Lyapunov." [_Sits down_] By this sort of life I soon squandered allmy money; what was left I intrusted to my friend Afrikan Korshunov, on hisoath and word of honor; with him I had drunk and gone on sprees, he wasresponsible for all my folly, he was the chief mixer of the mash! He fooledme and showed me up, and I was stuck like a crab on a sand bank. I hadnothing to drink, and I was thirsty--what was to be done? Where could I goto drown my misery? I sold my clothes, all my fashionable things; got payin bank-notes, and changed them for silver, the silver for copper, and theneverything went and all was over.MITYA. How did you live, Lyubim Karpych?LYUBIM KARPYCH. How did I live? May God never give such a life to a Tatar!I lived in roomy lodgings, between heaven and earth, with no walls and noceiling. I was ashamed to see people. I hid from the world; and yet youhave to go out into God's world, for you have nothing to eat. You go alongthe street, and everybody looks at you.--Every one had seen what a life Iused to lead, how I rattled through the town in a first-class cab, and nowwent about tattered and torn and unshaven. They shook their heads and awaythey went. Shame, shame, shame! [_Sits and hangs his head_] There is a goodbusiness--a trade which pays--to steal. But this business didn't suit me--Ihad a conscience, and again I was afraid: no one approves of this business.MITYA. That's a last resort.LYUBIM KARPYCH. They say in other countries they pay you thalers andthalers for this, but in our country good people punch your head for it.No, my boy, to steal is abominable! That's an old trick, we'll have to giveit up! But, you see, hunger isn't a kind old aunty, and you have to dosomething! I began to go about the town as a buffoon, to get money, a kopekat a time, to make a fool of myself, to tell funny stories, and play allsorts of tricks. Often you shiver from early morn till night in the townstreets; you hide somewhere behind the corner away from people, and waitfor merchants. When one comes--especially if he is rather rich--you jumpout and do some trick, and one gives you five kopeks, and another ten:with that you take breath for a day and so exist.MITYA. It would have been better, Lyubim Karpych, to go to your brother,than to live like that.LYUBIM KARPYCH. It was impossible; I'd been drawn in. Oh, Mitya, you getinto this groove, and it isn't easy to get out again. Don't interrupt!You'll have a chance later. Well, then, listen! I caught cold in thetown--it was winter; I stood in the cold, smartly dressed, in this coat!I was blowing on my fingers and jumping from foot to foot. Good peoplecarried me to the hospital. When I began to get better and come to mysenses, my drunken spell was over. Dread came over me! Horror seized me!How had I lived? What had I done? I began to feel melancholy; yes, suchmelancholy that it seemed better to die. And so I decided that when I gotquite well, I would go on a pilgrimage, then go to my brother, and let himtake me as a porter. This I did. I threw myself plump at his feet! "Be afather to me!" says I, "I have lived abominably--now I wish to reform." Anddo you know how my brother received me! He was ashamed, you see, that hehad such a brother. "But you help me out," I said to him, "correct me, bekind to me, and I will be a man." "Not at all," says he, "where can I putyou when important guests, rich merchants, and gentry come to see me?You'll be the death of me," says he! "With my feelings and intellect," sayshe, "I ought not to have been born in this family at all. See how I live,"says he; "who'd ever guess that our father was a peasant! For me," sayshe, "this disgrace is enough, and then you must come and obtrude yourselfagain." He overwhelmed me as with thunder! After these words I went frombad to worse. "Oh, well," I thought, "deuce take him! He is very thickhere. [_Points to his forehead_] He needs a lesson, the fool. Riches are nouse to fools like us; they spoil us. You need to know how to manage money."[_Dozes off_] Mitya, I'll lie down here; I want to take a nap.MITYA. Do lie down, Lyubim Karpych.LYUBIM KARPYCH. Mitya, don't give me any money--that is, don't give memuch; just give me a little. I'll take a nap here, and then go and warmmyself a little, you understand! I only need a little--no, no! Don't befoolish!MITYA. [_Taking out money_] Here, take as much as you need.LYUBIM KARPYCH. I need ten kopeks. This is all silver; I don't need silver.Give me two kopeks more, that will be just right. [MITYA _gives them_]That's enough. You have a good heart, Mitya! [_Lies down_] My brotherdoesn't know how to appreciate you. Yes, I'll play a joke on him! For foolsriches are an evil! Give money to a sensible man, and he'll do somethingwith it. I walked about Moscow, I saw everything, everything!--I've beenthrough a long course of study! You'd better not give money to a fool;he'll only go smash! Foh, foh, foh, brr! just like brother and like me, thebrute! [_In a voice half asleep_] Mitya, I will come and spend the nightwith you.MITYA. Come on. The office is empty now--it's a holiday.LYUBIM KARPYCH. Oh, but I'll play a funny joke on brother. [_Falls asleep_.MITYA. [_Walks towards the door and takes the letter out of his pocket_]What can she have written? I'm frightened!--My hands tremble!--Well, whatis to be will be! I'll read it. [_Reads_] "And I love you. Lyubov Tortsov."[_Clutches his head and runs out_.ACT II_Guest-room in the house of_ TORTSOV. _Against the rear wall a sofa, infront of the sofa a round table and six armchairs, three on each side;in the left corner a door; on each wall a mirror, and under them littletables. A door in each side wall, and a door in the rear wall in thecorner. On the stage it is dark; from the left door comes a light._SCENE ILYUBOV GORDEYEVNA _and_ ANNA IVANOVNA _enter through the lighted door._ANNA IVANOVNA. Why don't they come, our fine lads? Shall we go and fetchthem?LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. No, you'd better not. Well, yes, if you like, fetchthem. [_Embraces her_] Fetch them, Annushka.ANNA IVANOVNA. Well, evidently you aren't happy without him!LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Oh, Annushka, if you only knew how I love him!ANNA IVANOVNA. Love him, then, my dear, but don't lose your wits. Don't lethim go too far, or you may be sorry for it. Be sure you find out first whatsort of a fellow he is.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. He's a good lad!--I love him very much; he's so quiet,and he's an orphan.ANNA IVANOVNA. Well, if he's good, then love him; you ought to know best.I just said that! Many a girl comes to grief because of them. It's easy toget into trouble, if you don't use your sense.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. What is our love? Like a blade of grass in the field; itblooms out of season--and it fades.ANNA IVANOVNA. Wait a moment! Some one's coming, I think. Isn't it he? I'llgo and you wait, perhaps it's he! Have a good talk with him. [_She goesout._MITYA _enters._SCENE IILYUBOV GORDEYEVNA _and_ MITYALYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Who's there?MITYA. It's I, Mitya.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Why were you so long in coming?MITYA. I was detained. [_Approaches_] Lyubov Gordeyevna, are you alone?LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Yes, what of it?MITYA. Lyubov Gordeyevna, how do you wish me to understand your letter?Do you mean it, or is it a joke? [LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA _is silent_] Tell me,Lyubov Gordeyevna! I am now in such perplexity that I cannot express it toyou. My position in your house is known to you; subordinate to everybody,and I may say utterly despised by Gordey Karpych. I've had only onefeeling, that for you, and if I receive ridicule from you, then it wouldhave been better for me never to have lived in this world. You may trustme! I am telling you the truth.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. No, Mitya dear, what I wrote to you was the truth, andnot a joke. And you, do you love me?MITYA. Indeed, Lyubov Gordeyevna, I do not know how to express to you whatI feel. But at least let me assure you that I have a heart in my breast,and not a stone. You can see my love from everything.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. But I thought that you loved Anna Ivanovna.MITYA. That is not true!LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Really, they told me so.MITYA. If this were true, then what sort of a man should I be after actingas I have? Could I declare with words what my heart does not feel! I thinksuch a thing would be dishonorable! I may not be worth your regard, but I'mnot the man to deceive you.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. It is impossible to believe you men; all men in theworld are deceivers.MITYA. Let them be deceivers, but I am not.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. How can one know! Perhaps you also are deceiving me andwant to play a joke on me!MITYA. It would be easier for me to die in this place than to hear suchwords from you! [_Turns away._LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. No, Mitya, I didn't mean it. I know that you love me. Ionly wanted to tease you. [MITYA _is silent_] Mitya dear! Mitya! Why areyou silent? Are you angry with me? I tell you I was only joking! Mitya!Yes! Now, then, say something. [_Takes his hand._MITYA. Oh, Lyubov Gordeyevna, I'm not in a joking humor! I'm not that sortof man.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Don't be angry.MITYA. If you love me, then stop these jokes! They are not in place. Oh,it's all the same to me now! [_Embraces her_] Maybe they can take you fromme by force, but I won't give you up of my free will. I love you more thanmy life!LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. [_Returning his embrace_] Mitya dear, what shall we donow?MITYA. What shall we do? We didn't fall in love with each other just to saygood-by!LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Well, but what if they promise me to some one else?MITYA. Look here, Lyubov, one word! To-morrow we must go together to GordeyKarpych, and throw ourselves at his feet. We'll say so and so--whatever youplease, but we can't live without each other. Yes, if you love me, thenforget your pride!LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. What pride, Mitya? Is this a time for pride! Mitya dear,don't be angry with me; don't remember my past words. It was only girlishfoolishness; I'm sorry that I did it! I shouldn't have joked with you; Ishould have caressed you, my poor boy. [_Throws her arms round his neck_]Oh, but, if father doesn't consent to our happiness--what then?MITYA. Who can tell beforehand? It will be as God wills. I don't know howit is with you, but for me life is not life without you! [_Is silent_.LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA. Some one's coming! Go away quietly, dearest, and I'llcome later.MITYA _goes out quietly_. ARINA _comes in with a candle_; LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA_goes to meet her_.SCENE IIIARINA, LYUBOV GORDEYEVNA, _and afterwards_ EGORUSHKAARINA. Well, you! You frightened me enough! What are you doing here? Yourmother is looking for you there, and here you are! Why are you wanderingabout in the dark! Oh, you modest maiden! Fairy princess. [LYUBOVGORDEYEVNA _goes out_] Well, really, wasn't some one there with her?[_Looks into the corner_] But I'm a silly old woman, I suspected some one![_Lights the candles_] Oh, deary me, some trouble will be sure to come inmy old age. [EGORUSHKA _enters_] Go along, Egorushka, and call the girls infrom the neighbors; tell them Pelageya Egorovna told you to invite them tocome and sing songs.EGORUSHKA. Oh! how are you, Arina, my dear?ARINA. What are you so happy about, silly?EGORUSHKA. Why shouldn't I be happy? It's such fun! Ha, ha, ha! [_Jumpsabout._ARINA. And maybe the mummers are coming; the young people wanted to dressup.EGORUSHKA. Oh, I shall die! Oh, Lord, I shall die!ARINA. What's the matter with you, you scamp?EGORUSHKA. Oh, I shall die of laughing! Oh, granny, I've got such giggles!ARINA. Dress up yourself.EGORUSHKA. I will, I will! Oh, Lord! Oh, Oh, Oh.ARINA. Now you run along quickly and fetch the girls.EGORUSHKA. In a second! [_Goes out._PELAGEYA EGOROVNA _comes in._SCENE IVARINA _and_ PELAGEYA EGOROVNAPELAGEYA EGOROVNA. Arinushka, did you send for the girls?ARINA. I did, my dear.PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. That's right. Let them have a song with our folks,and cheer up Lyubov and the guests. This is the time for them to enjoythemselves--while they're young. You know what a girl's life is--behindbolts and bars, never seeing the world! Now's their holiday!--Yes, let 'emhave a good time!ARINA. Yes, to be sure, to be sure! Why shouldn't they?PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. Bring in some Madeira, Arinushka, the oldest we have;and gingerbread for the young people, and sweets--whatever you choose!Attend to it yourself, but don't forget the Madeira.ARINA. I understand, I understand; there'll be enough of everything.Directly, my dear, directly!PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. And a snack for the young men.ARINA. Everything, everything will be all right. Don't you worry yourself;you join the guests. I'll do everything with pleasure. [_Goes out._PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. [_Going to the door_] Girls, boys, come here!

"Just imagine, mother!" I said, "he doesn't know how to talkproperly, and he even uses such words that it's absolutely impolite."RAZLYULYAYEV. Do you mean me?LIZA. We aren't talking about you; it's no business of yours. [_Shecontinues_] "But why, mother, must I love him?" [_Speaks in a whisper._PELAGEYA EGOROVNA. Yes, my friend, I love the good old ways. Yes, our goodold Russian ways. But there! my husband doesn't care for them! What can youdo about it? That's his character. But I love them, I'm naturally jolly;yes, I love to give a person a bite and to get them to sing songs to me!Yes, I take after my family. Our family are all jolly, and love singing.FIRST GUEST. When I look round, my dear Pelageya Egorovna, there isn't thegayety that there used to be when we were young.SECOND GUEST. No, no.PELAGEYA EGOROVNA.

When you weave garlands,    Weave me some too;    When you go to the river,    Take me with you.    When you throw in the garlands,    Throw also my wreath;    The others will float,    When mine sinks beneath.
