 visis_: it was not the _esse_ but the _videri_, not the actual existenceof a difference, but the possibility of that difference being infalliblyperceived by human sense, that the Academic denied. _Cernimus_: i.e. the_probably_ true and false. _Probandi species_: a phenomenal appearancewhich belongs to, or properly leads to qualified approval.    Sec.Sec.112--115. Summary. If I had to deal with a Peripatetic, whose    definitions are not so exacting, my course would be easier; I should    not much oppose him even if he maintained that the wise man sometimes    _opines_ (112). The definitions of the real Old Academy are more    reasonable than those of Antiochus. How, holding the opinions he does,    can he profess to belong to the Old Academy? (113) I cannot tolerate    your assumption that it is possible to keep an elaborate dogmatic    system like yours free from mistakes (114). You wish me to join your    school. What am I to do then with my dear friend Diodotus, who thinks    so poorly of Antiochus? Let us consider however what system not I, but    the _sapiens_ is to adopt (115).Sec.112. _Campis ... exsultare ... oratio_: expressions like this are commonin Cic., e.g. _D.F._ I. 54, _De Off._ I. 61, _Orat._ 26; cf. also Aug._Cont. Ac._ III. 5 _ne in quaestionis campis tua eqitaret oratio_. _CumPeripatetico_: nothing that Cic. states here is at discord with what isknown of the tenets of the later Peripatetics; cf. esp. Sext. _A.M._ VII.216--226. All that Cic. says is that he could accept the Peripateticformula, putting upon it his own meaning of course. Doubtless a Peripateticwould have wondered how a sceptic _could_ accept his formulae; but thespectacle of men of the most irreconcilable opinions clinging on to thesame formulae is common enough to prevent us from being surprised atCicero's acceptance. I have already suggested (n. on 18) that we have herea trace of Philo's teaching, as distinct from that of Carneades. I seeabsolutely no reason for the very severe remarks of Madvig on _D.F._ V. 76,a passage which very closely resembles ours. _Dumeta_: same use in _N.D._I. 68, Aug. _Cont. Ac._ II. 6; the _spinae_ of the Stoics are oftenmentioned, e.g. _D.F._ IV. 6. _E vero ... a falso_: note the change ofprep. _Adhiberet_: the MSS. are confused here, and go Halm reads _adderet_,and Bait. follows, while Kayser proposes _adhaereret_, which is indeednearer the MSS.; cf. however I. 39 _adhiberet_. _Accessionem_: for this cf.18 and 77. _Simpliciter_: the opposite of _subtiliter_; cf._simpliciter--subtilitas_ in I. 6. _Ne Carneade quidem_: cf. 59, 67, 78,148.Sec.113. _Sed qui his minor est_: given by Halm as the em. of Io. Clericus forMSS. _sed mihi minores_. Guietus gave _sed his minores_, Durand _sedminutior_, while Halm suggests _sed minutiores_. I conj. _nimio minares_,which would be much nearer the MSS.; cf. Lucr. I. 734 _inferiores partibusegregie multis multoque minores_. _Tale verum_: _visum_ omitted as in_D.F._ V. 76. _Incognito_: cf. 133. _Amavi hominem_: cf. Introd. p. 6. _Itaiudico, politissimum_; it is a mistake to suppose this sentence incomplete,like Halm, who wishes to add _eum esse_, or like Bait., who with Kayserprints _esse_ after _politissimum_. Cf. 108 _ita scribenti, exanclatum_,and the examples given from Cic. by Madv. on _D.F._ II. 13. _Horumneutrum_: cf. 77 _nemo_. _Utrumque verum_: Cic. of course only accepts thepropositions as Arcesilas did; see 77.Sec.114. _Illud ferre_: cf. 136. _Constituas_: this verb is often used inconnection with the ethical _finis_; cf. 129 and I. 19. _Idemque etiam_:Krebs and Allgayer (_Antibarbarus_, ed. 4) deny that the expression _idemetiam_ is Latin. One good MS. here has _atque etiam_, which Dav. reads; cf.however _Orat._ 117. _Artificium_: = _ars_, as in 30. _Nusquam labar_: cf.138 _ne labar_. _Subadroganter_: cf. 126.Sec.115. _Qui sibi cum oratoribus ... rexisse_: so Cic. vary often speaks ofthe Peripatetics, as in _D.F._ IV. 5, V. 7. _Sustinuero_: cf. 70. _Tambonos_: Cic. often speaks of them and of Epicurus in this patronising way;see e.g. _T.D._ II. 44, III. 50, _D.F._ I. 25, II. 81. For the Epicureanfriendships cf. esp. _D.F._ I. 65. _Diodoto_: cf. Introd. p. 2. _Nolumus_:Halm and Bait., give _nolimus_; so fine a line divides the subjunctive fromthe indicative in clauses like these that the choice often depends on mereindividual taste. _De sapiente loquamur_: n. on 66.    Sec.Sec.116--128. Summary. Of the three parts of philosophy take Physics    first. Would your _sapiens_ swear to the truth of any geometrical    result whatever? (116) Let us see which one of actual physical systems    the _sapiens_ we are seeking will select (117). He must choose _one_    teacher from among the conflicting schools of Thales, Anaximander,    Anaximenos, Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, Leucippus, Democritus, Empedocles,    Heraclitus, Melissus, Plato and Pythagoras. The remaining teachers,    great men though they be, he must reject (118). Whatever system he    selects he must know absolutely; if the Stoic, he must believe as    strongly in the Stoic theology as he does in the sunlight. If he holds    this, Aristotle will pronounce him mad; you, however, Lucullus, must    defend the Stoics and spurn Aristotle from you, while you will not    allow me even to doubt (119). How much better to be free, as I am and    not compelled to find an answer to all the riddles of the universe!    (120) Nothing can exist, say you, apart from the deity. Strato,    however, says he does not need the deity to construct the universe. His    mode of construction again differs from that of Democritus. I see some    good in Strato, yet I will not assent absolutely either to his system    or to yours (121). All these matters lie far beyond our ken. We know    nothing of our bodies, which we can dissect, while we have not the    advantage of being able to dissect the constitution of things or of the    earth to see whether she is firmly fixed or hovers in mid air (122).    Xenophanes, Hicetas, Plato and Epicurus tell strange things of the    heavenly bodies. How much better to side with Socrates and Aristo, who    hold that nothing can be known about them! (123) Who knows the nature    of mind? Numberless opinions clash, as do those of Dicaearchus, Plato    and Xenocrates. Our _sapiens_ will be unable to decide (124). If you    say it is better to choose any system rather than none, I choose    Democritus. You at once upbraid me for believing such monstrous    falsehoods (125). The Stoics differ among themselves about physical    subjects, why will they not allow me to differ from them? (126) Not    that I deprecate the study of Physics, for moral good results from it    (127). Our _sapiens_ will be delighted if he attains to anything which    seems to resemble truth. Before I proceed to Ethics, I note your    weakness in placing all perceptions on the same level. You must be    prepared to asseverate no less strongly that the sun is eighteen times    as large as the earth, than that yon statue is six feet high. When you    admit that all things can be perceived no more and no less clearly than    the size of the sun, I am almost content (128).Sec.116. _Tres partes_: cf. I. 19. _Et a vobismet_: "and especially by you".The threefold division was peculiarly Stoic, though used by other schools,cf. Sext. _P.H._ II. 13 (on the same subject) [Greek: hoi Stoikoi kai alloitines]. For other modes of dividing philosophy see Sext. _A.M._ VII. 2. _Atillud ante_: this is my em. for the MSS. _velut illud ante_, which probablyarose from a marginal variant "_vel ut_" taking the place of _at_; cf. asimilar break in 40 _sed prius_, also in 128 _at paulum ante_. Such breaksoften occur in Cic., as in _Orator_ 87 _sed nunc aliud_, also _T.D._ IV. 47_repenam fortasse, sed illud ante._ For _velut_ Halm writes _vel_ (whichBait. takes), Dav. _verum_. _Inflatus tumore_: cf. _De Off._ I. 91 _inflatiopinionibus._ Bentl. read _errore_. _Cogere_: this word like [Greek:anankazein] and [Greek: biazesthai] often means simply to argueirresistibly. _Initia_: as in 118, bases of proof, themselves naturallyincapable of proof, so [Greek: archai] in Gk. _Digitum_: cf. 58, 143._Punctum esse_ etc.: [Greek: semeion estin ou meros outhen] (Sext. _P.H._III. 39), [Greek: stigme] = [Greek: to ameres] (_A.M._ IX. 283, 377)._Extremitatem_: = [Greek: epiphaneian]. _Libramentum_: so this word is usedby Pliny (see Forc.) for the slope of a hill. _Nulla crassitudo_: in Sext.the [Greek: epiphaneia] is usually described not negatively as here, butpositively as [Greek: mekos meta platous] (_P.H._ III. 39), [Greek: peras](_extremitas_) [Greek: somatos duo echon diastaseis, mekos kai platos](_A.M._ III. 77). _Liniamentum ... carentem_: a difficult passage. Note (1)that the line is defined in Greek as [Greek: mekos aplates]. (Sext. asabove), (2) that Cic. has by preference described the point and surfacenegatively. This latter fact seems to me strong against the introduction of_longitudinem_ which Ursinus, Dav., Orelli, Baiter and others propose byconjecture. If anything is to be introduced, I would rather add _etcrassitudine_ before _carentem_, comparing I. 27 _sine ulla specie etcarentem omni illa qualitate_. I have merely bracketed _carentem_, though Ifeel Halm's remark that a verb is wanted in this clause as in the othertwo, he suggests _quod sit sine_. Hermann takes _esse_ after _punctum_ asstrongly predicative ("there _is_ a point," etc.), then adds _similiter_after _liniamentum_ and ejects _sine ulla_. Observe the awkwardness ofhaving the _line_ treated of after the _superficies_, which has inducedsome edd. to transpose. For _liniamentum_ = _lineam_ cf. _De Or._ I. 187._Si adigam_: the fine em. of Manut. for _si adiiciamus_ of MSS. Theconstruction _adigere aliquem ius iurandum_ will be found in Caes. _Bell.Civ._ I. 76, II. 18, qu. by Dav., cf. also Virg. _Aen._ III. 56 _quid nonmortalia pectora cogis auri sacra fames?_ _Sapientem nec prius_: this isthe "_egregia lectio_" of three of Halm's MSS. Before Halm _sapientemne_was read, thus was destroyed the whole point of the sentence, which is_not_ that the _sapiens_ will swear to the size of the sun after he hasseen Archimedes go through his calculations, _but_ that the _sapiens_,however true he admits the bases of proof to be which Archimedes uses, will_not_ swear to the truth of the elaborate conclusions which that geometerrears upon them. Cicero is arguing as in 128 against the absurdity ofattaching one and the same degree of certainty to the simplest and the mostcomplex truths, and tries to condemn the Stoic _sapiens_ out of his ownmouth, cf. esp. _nec ille iurare posset_ in 123. _Multis partibus_: forthis expression see Munro on Lucr. I. 734, for the sense cf. 82, 123, 126,128. _Deum_: see 126.Sec.117. _Vim_: = [Greek: ananken], cf. _cogere_ in 116. _Ne ille_: thisasseverative _ne_ is thus always closely joined with pronouns in Cic._Sententiam eliget et_: MSS. have (by _dittographia_ of _m_, _eli_) added_melius_ after _sententiam_, and have also dropped _et_. Dav. wished toread _elegerit_, comparing the beginning of 119. _Insipiens eliget_: cf.115 _quale est a non sapiente explicari sapientiam?_ and 9 _statuere quisit sapiens vel maxime videtur esse sapientis_. _Infinitae quaestiones_:[Greek: theseis], general propositions, opposed to _finitae quaestiones_,limited propositions, Gk. [Greek: hypotheseis]. Quintal III. 5, 5 gives asan ex. of the former _An uxor ducenda_, of the latter _An Catoni ducenda_.These _quaestiones_ are very often alluded to by Cic. as in _D.F._ I. 12,IV. 6, _De Or._ I. 138, II. 65--67, _Topica_ 79, _Orat._ 46, cf. alsoQuint. X. 5, II. _E quibus omnia constant_: this sounds like Lucretius,_omnia_ = [Greek: to pan].Sec.118. For these _physici_ the student must in general be referred to R. andP., Schwegler, and Grote's _Plato_ Vol. I. A more complete enumeration ofschools will be found in Sext. _P.H._ III. 30 sq. Our passage is imitatedby Aug _De Civ. Dei_ XVIII. 37. _Concessisse primas_: Cic. always considersThales to be _sapientissimus e septem_ (_De Leg._ II. 26). Hence Marklandon Cic. _Ad Brutum_ II. 15, 3 argued that that letter cannot be genuine,since in it the supremacy among the seven is assigned to Solon._Infinitatem naturae_: [Greek: to apeiron], _naturae_ here = [Greek:ousias]. _Definita_: this is opposed to _infinita_ in _Topica_ 79, so_definire_ is used for _finire_ in _Orat._ 65, where Jahn qu. _Verr._ IV.115. _Similis inter se_: an attempt to translate [Greek: homoiomereias]._Eas primum_, etc.: cf. the exordium of Anaxagoras given from Diog. II. 6in R. and P. 29 [Greek: panta chremata en homou eita nous elthon autadiekosmese]. _Xenophanes ... deum_: Eleaticism was in the hands of Xenoph.mainly theological. _Neque natum unquam_: cf. _neque ortum unquam_ in 119._Parmenides ignem_: cf. Arist. _Met. A._ 5 qu. R. and P. 94. He onlyhypothetically allowed the existence of the phenomenal world, after whichhe made two [Greek: archai, thermon kai psychron touton de to men kata mento hon thermon tattei, thateron de kata to me on]. _Heraclitus_: n. on I.39. _Melissus_: see Simplicius qu. R. and P. 101, and esp. [Greek: to eonaiei ara en te kai estai]. _Plato_: n. on I. 27. _Discedent_: a word oftenused of those vanquished in a fight, cf. Hor. _Sat._ I. 7, 17.Sec.119. _Sic animo ... sensibus_: knowledge according to the Stoics washomogeneous throughout, no one thing could be more or less known thananother. _Nunc lucere_: cf. 98, also 128 _non enim magis adsentiuntur_,etc. _Mundum sapientem_: for this Stoic doctrine see _N.D._ I. 84, II. 32,etc. _Fabricata sit_: see 87 n. _Solem_: 126. _Animalis intellegentia_:reason is the essence of the universe with the Stoics, cf. Zeller 138--9,also 28, 29 of Book I. _Permanet_: the deity is to the Stoic [Greek: pneumaendiekon di holou tou kosmou] (Plut. _De Plac. Phil._ I. 7 qu. R. and P.375), _spiritus per omnia maxima ac minima aequali intentione diffusus._(Seneca, _Consol. ad Helvid._ 8, 3 qu. Zeller 147). _Deflagret_: the Stoicsconsidered the [Greek: kosmos phthartos], cf. Diog. VII. 141, Zeller156--7. _Fateri_: cf. _tam vera quam falsa cernimus_ in 111. _Flumenaureum_: Plut. _Vita Cic._ 24 alludes to this ([Greek: hoti chrysioupotamos eie reontos]). This is the constant judgment of Cic. aboutAristotle's style. Grote, _Aristot._ Vol I. p. 43, quotes _Topica_ 3, _DeOr._ I. 49, _Brut._ 121, _N.D._ II. 93, _De Inv._ II. 6, _D.F._ I. 14, _AdAtt._ II. 1, and discusses the difficulty of applying this criticism to theworks of Aristotle which we possess. _Nulla vis_: cf. I. 28. _Exsistere_:Walker conj. _efficere_, "_recte ut videtur_" says Halm. Bait. adopts it._Ornatus_: = [Greek: kosmos].Sec.120. _Libertas ... non esse_: a remarkable construction. For the Academicliberty see Introd. p. 18. _Quod tibi est_: after these words Halm putsmerely a comma, and inserting _respondere_ makes _cur deus_, etc. part ofthe same sentence. Bait. follows. _Nostra causa_: Cic. always writes _mea,tua, vestra, nostra causa_, not _mei, tui, nostri, vestri_, just as hewrites _sua sponte_, but not _sponte alicuius_. For the Stoic opinion thatmen are the chief care of Providence, see _N.D._ I. 23, II. 37, _D.F._ III.67, _Ac._ I. 29 etc., also Zeller. The difficulties surrounding the opinionare treated of in Zeller 175, _N.D._ II. 91--127. They supply in Sext._P.H._ I. 32, III. 9--12 an example of the refutation of [Greek: nooumena]by means of [Greek: nooumena]. _Tam multa ac_: MSS. om. _ac_, which Iinsert. Lactantius qu. the passage without _perniciosa_. _Myrmecides_: anactual Athenian artist, famed for minute work in ivory, and especially fora chariot which a fly covered with its wings, and a ship which the wings ofa bee concealed. See Plin. _Nat. Hist._ VII. 21, XXXVI. 5.Sec.121. _Posse_: n. on I. 29. _Strato_: R. and P. 331. _Sed cum_: _sed_ oftenmarks a very slight contrast, there is no need to read _et_, as Halm._Asperis ... corporibus_: cf. fragm. 28 of the _Ac. Post._, also _N.D._ I.66. _Somnia_: so _N.D._ I. 18 _miracula non disserentium philosophorum sedsomniantium_, _ib._ I. 42 _non philosophorum iudicia sed delirantiumsomnia_, also _ib._ I. 66 _flagitia Democriti_. _Docentis_: giving _proof_._Optantis_: Guietus humorously conj. _potantis,_ Durand _oscitantis_ (cf._N.D._ I. 72), others _opinantis_. That the text is sound however may beseen from _T.D._ II. 30 _optare hoc quidem est non docere_, _De Fato_ 46,_N.D._ I. 19 _optata magis quam inventa_, _ib._ III. 12 _doceas oportet necproferas_; cf. also _Orat._ 59 _vocis bonitas optanda est, non est enim innobis_, i.e. a good voice is a thing to be prayed for, and not to be got byexertion. There is a similar Greek proverb, [Greek: euche mallon ealetheia], in Sext. _P.H._ VIII. 353. _Magno opere_: Hermann wishes to read_onere_. The phrase _magnum onus_ is indeed common (cf. _De Or._ I. 116),but _magnum opus_, in the sense of "a great task," is equally so, cf._T.D._ III. 79, 84, _Orat._ 75. _Modo hoc modo illud_: 134.Sec.122. _Latent ista_: see n. on fragm. 29 of the _Ac. Post._; for _latent_cf. I. 45. Aug. _Cont. Ac._ II. 12, III. 1 imitates this passage._Circumfusa_: cf. I. 44, and 46 of this book. _Medici_: cf. _T.D._ I. 46_Viderentur_: a genuine passive, cf. 25, 39, 81. _Empirici_: a school ofphysicians so called. _Ut ... mutentur_: exactly the same answer was maderecently to Prof. Huxley's speculations on protoplasm; he was said to haveassumed that the living protoplasm would have the same properties as thedead. _Media pendeat_: cf. _N.D._ II. 98, _De Or._ III. 178.Sec.123. _Habitari ait_: for this edd. qu. Lactant. _Inst._ III. 23, 12._Portenta_: "monstrosities these," cf. _D.F._ IV. 70. _Iurare_: cf. 116._Neque ego_, etc.: see fragm. 30 of _Ac. Post._ [Greek: Antipodas]: thisdoctrine appears in Philolaus (see Plut. _Plac. Phil._ III. 11 qu. R. andP. 75), who give the name of [Greek: antichthon] to the opposite side ofthe world. Diog. VIII. 26 (with which passage cf. Stob. _Phys._ XV. 7)mentions the theory as Pythagorean, but in another passage (III. 24) saysthat Plato first invented the name. The word [Greek: antipous] seems tooccur first in Plat. _Tim._ 63 A. The existence of [Greek: antipodes]; wasof course bound up with the doctrine that the universe or the world is aglobe (which is held by Plat. in the _Tim._ and by the Stoics, see Stob._Phys._ XV. 6, Diog. VII. 140), hence the early Christian writers attackthe two ideas together as unscriptural. Cf. esp Aug. _De Civ. Dei_ XVI. 9._Hicetas_: he was followed by Heraclides Ponticus and some Pythagoreans.Sext. _A.M._ X. 174 speaks of the followers of Aristarchus themathematician as holding the same doctrine. It seems also to be found inPhilolaus, see R. and P. 75. _Theophrastus_: who wrote much on the historyof philosophy, see R. and P. 328. _Platonem_: the words of Plato (_Tim._ 40B) are [Greek: gen de trophon men hemeteran, eillomenen de peri ton diapantos polon tetamenon]. _Quid tu, Epicure_: the connection is that Cic.,having given the crotchets of other philosophers about [Greek: physike],proceeds to give the peculiar crotchet of Epic. _Putas solem ... tantum_: ahard passage. _Egone? ne bis_ is the em. of Lamb. for MSS. _egone vobis_,and is approved by Madv., who thus explains it (_Em._ 185) "_cuminterrogatum esset num tantulum (quasi pedalem 82) solem esse putaret,Epic. non praecise definit (tantum enim esse censebat quantus videretur velpaulo aut maiorem aut minorem) sed latius circumscribit, ne bis quidemtantum esse, sed inter pedalem magnitudinem et bipedalem_". (_D.F._ I. 20)This explanation though not quite satisfactory is the best yet given.Epicurus' absurdity is by Cic. brought into strong relief by stating theoutside limit to which Epic. was prepared to go in estimating the sun'ssize, i.e. twice the apparent size. _Ne ... quidem_ may possibly appearstrange, cf. however _ne maiorem quidem_ in 82. _Aristo Chius_: for thisdoctrine of his see R. and P. 358.Sec.124. _Quid sit animus_: an enumeration of the different ancient theoriesis given in _T.D._ I. 18--22, and by Sext. _A.M._ VII. 113, who also speaksin _P.H._ II. 31 of the [Greek: polle kai anenytos mache] concerning thesoul. In _P.H._ II. 57 he says [Greek: Gorgias oude dianoian einai phesi]._Dicaearcho_: _T.D._ I. 21. _Tres partis_: in Plato's _Republic_. _Ignis_:Zeno's opinion, _T.D._ I. 19. _Animam_: _ib._ I. 19. _Sanguis_: Empodocles,as in _T.D._ I. 19 where his famous line [Greek: haima gar anthropoisperikardion esti noema] is translated, see R. and P. 124. _Ut Xenocrates_:some edd. read _Xenocrati_, but cf. I. 44, _D.F._ II. 18, _T.D._ III. 76._Numerus_: so Bentl. for _mens_ of MSS., cf. I. 39, _T.D._ I. 20, 41. Anexplanation of this Pythagorean doctrine of Xenocrates is given in R. andP. 244. _Quod intellegi_ etc.: so in _T.D._ I. 41 _quod subtiliter magisquam dilucide dicitur_. _Momenta_ n. on I. 45.Sec.125. _Verecundius_: cf. 114 _subadroganter_. _Vincam animum_: a commonphrase in Cic., cf. _Philipp._ XII. 21. _Queru potissimum? quem?_: Inrepeated questions of this kind Cic. usually puts the corresponding case of_quisnam_, not _quis_, in the second question, as in _Verr._ IV. 5. Themutation of Augustine _Contra Ac._ III. 33 makes it probable that _quemnam_was the original reading here. Zumpt on _Verr._ qu. Quint. IX. 2, 61, Plin._Epist._ I. 20, who both mention this trick of style, and laud it for itslikeness to impromptu. _Nobilitatis_: this is to be explained by referringto 73--75 (_imitari numquam nisi clarum, nisi nobilem_), where Cic.protests against being compared to a demagogue, and claims to follow thearistocracy of philosophy. The attempts of the commentators to show thatDemocr. was literally an aristocrat have failed. _Convicio_: cf. 34._Completa et conferta_: n. on I. 27. _Quod movebitur ... cedat_: this isthe theory of motion disproved by Lucr. I. 370 sq., cf. also _N.D._ II. 83.Halm writes _quo quid_ for _quod_ (with Christ), and inserts _corpus_before _cedat_, Baiter following him. The text is sound. Trans. "whateverbody is pushed, gives way." _Tam sit mirabilis_: n. on I. 25._Innumerabilis_: 55. _Supra infra_: n. on 92. _Ut nos nunc simus_, etc.: n.on fragm. 13 of _Ac. Post._ _Disputantis_: 55. _Animo videre_: cf. 22._Imagines_: [Greek: eidola], which Catius translated (_Ad Fam._ XV. 16) by_spectra_, Zeller 432. _Tu vero_: etc. this is all part of the personal_convicium_ supposed to be directly addressed to Cic. by the Antiocheans,and beginning at _Tune aut inane_ above. _Commenticiis_: a favourite wordof Cic., cf. _De Div._ II. 113.Sec.126. _Quae tu_: elliptic for _ut comprobem quae tu comprobas_ cf. 125._Impudenter_: 115. _Atque haud scio_: _atque_ here = [Greek: kaitoi], "andyet," n. on 5 _ac vereor_. _Invidiam_: cf. 144. _Cum his_: i.e. _aliis cumhis_. _Summus deus_: "the highest form of the deity" who was of course onein the Stoic system. Ether is the finest fire, and [Greek: pyr technikon]is one of the definitions of the Stoic deity, cf. I. 29, Zeller 161 sq._Solem_: as of course being the chief seat of fire. _Solis autem ... negocredere_: Faber first gave _ac monet_ for MSS. _admonens_, which Halmretains, Manut. then restored to its place _permensi refertis_, which MSS.have after _nego_. _Hic_, which MSS. have after _decempeda_, Madv. turnsinto _hunc_, while _hoc_, which stands immediately after _nego_, he ejects(_Em._ 187). _Ergo_ after _vos_ is of course analeptic. Halm departssomewhat from this arrangement. _Leniter_: Halm and Hermann _leviter_; theformer reads _inverecundior_ after Morgenstern, for what reason it isdifficult to see.Sec.127. _Pabulum_: similar language in _D.F._ II. 46. _Consideratiocontemplatioque_: Cic. is fond of this combination, as _De Off._ I. 153;cf.

Madv. _Opusc._ II. 282 takes _occurit_, explaining it as aperfect, and giving numerous exx. of this sequence of tenses, cf. alsoWesenb. on _T.D._ IV. 35.Sec.128. _Agi secum_: cf. _nobiscum ageret_ in 80. _Simile veri_: cf. 66._Notionem_: = _cognitionem_, [Greek: epistemen]. _At paulum_: MSS. _et_Halm _sed._; cf. _at illud ante_ in 116. _Si quae_: Halm and many edd. have_se, quae_. But the _se_ comes in very awkwardly, and is not needed beforethe infinitive. Madv. indeed (_Em._ 114), after producing many exx. of thereflexive pronoun omitted, says that he doubts about this passage because_considero_ does not belong to the class of verbs with which this usage isfound, but he produces many instances with _puto_, which surely stands onthe same level. _Non magis_: so in 119 _nec magis approbabit nunc lucere_,etc. The sunlight was the stock example of a most completely cognisablephenomenon; hence the Academics showed their hostility to absoluteknowledge by refusing [Greek: ton helion homologein einai katalepton](Galen _De Opt.

What contention is there among philosophers about    the ethical standard! I pass by many abandoned systems like that of    Herillus but consider the discrepancies between Xenophanes, Parmenides,    Zeno of Elea, Euclides, Menedemus, Aristo, Pyrrho, Aristippus,    Epicurus, Callipho, Hieronymus, Diodorus, Polemo, Antiochus, Carneades    (129-131). If I desire to follow the Stoics, Antiochus will not allow    me, while if I follow Polemo, the Stoics are irate (132). I must be    careful not to assent to the unknown, which is a dogma common to both    you, Lucullus, and myself (133). Zeno thinks virtue gives happiness.    "Yes," says Antiochus, "but not the greatest possible." How am I to    choose among such conflicting theories? (134) Nor can I accept those    points in which Antiochus and Zeno agree. For instance, they regard    emotion as harmful, which the ancients thought natural and useful    (135). How absurd are the Stoic Paradoxes! (136) Albinus joking said to    Carneades "You do not think me a praetor because I am not a _sapiens_."    "That," said Carneades, "is Diogenes' view, not mine" (137). Chrysippus    thinks only three ethical systems can with plausibility be defended    (138). I gravitate then towards one of them, that of pleasure. Virtue    calls me back, nor will she even allow me to join pleasure to herself    (139). When I hear the several pleadings of pleasure and virtue, I    cannot avoid being moved by both, and so I find it impossible to choose    (141, 142).Sec.129. _Quod coeperam_: in 128 at _veniamus nunc ad boni maique notionem_._Constituendi_: n. on 114. _Bonorum summa_: cf. _D.F._ V. 21 and Madv. _Estigitur_: so in _De Div._ II. 8, _igitur_ comes fourth word in the clause;this is not uncommon in Cic., as in Lucretius. _Omitto_: MSS. _et omitto_,but cf. Madv. _Em._ 201 _certe contra Ciceronis usum est 'et omitto' prosimplici 'omitto,' in initio huius modi orationis ubi universae sententiaeexempla subiciuntur per figuram omissionis_. _Relicta_: cf. 130 _abiectos_.Cic. generally classes Herillus (or Erillus as Madv. on _D.F._ II. 35spells the name), Pyrrho and Aristo together as authors of explodedsystems, cf. _D.F._ II. 43, _De Off._ I. 6, _T.D._ V. 85. _Ut Herillum_.MSS. have either _Erillum_ or _et illum_, one would expect _ut Herilli_._Cognitione et scientia_: double translation of [Greek: episteme]. For the_finis_ of Herillus see Madv. on _D.F._ II. 43. _Megaricorum_:_Xenophanes_. Cic considers the Eleatic and Megarian schools to be soclosely related as to have, like the schools of Democritus and Epicurus, acontinuous history. The Megarian system was indeed an ethical developmentof Eleatic doctrine. Zeller, _Socrates_ 211. _Unum et simile_: for this seeZell. _Socr._ 222 sq, with footnotes, R. and P. 174 sq. _Simile_ oughtperhaps to be _sui simile_ as in _Tim._ c. 7, already quoted on I. 30, seemy note there and cf. I. 35. _Menedemo_: see Zeller _Socr._ 238, R. and P.182. The _Erctrian_ school was closely connected with the Megarian. _Fuit_:= _natus est_, as often. _Herilli_: so Madv. for _ulli_ of MSS.Sec.130. _Aristonem_: this is Aristo of Chios, not Aristo of Ceos, who was aPeripatetic; for the difference see R. and P. 332, and for the doctrines ofAristo the Chian _ib._ 358, Zeller 58 sq. _In mediis_: cf. I. 36, 37._Momenta_ = _aestimationes_, [Greek: axiai] in 36, where _momenti_ is usedin a different way. _Pyrrho autem_: one would expect Pyrrhoni as Dav.conj., but in 124 there is just the same change from _Pyrrhoni_ to_Xenocrates_. [Greek: Apatheia]: Diog. IX. 108 affirms this as well as[Greek: praiotes] to be a name for the sceptic [Greek: telos], but the namescarcely occurs if at all in Sext. who generally uses [Greek: ataraxia],but occasionally [Greek: metriopatheia]; cf. Zeller 496, R. and P. 338.[Greek: Apatheia] was also a Stoic term. _Diu multumque_: n. on I. 4.Sec.131. _Nec tamen consentiens_: cf. R. and P. 352 where the differencesbetween the two schools are clearly drawn out, also Zeller 447, 448._Callipho_: as the genitive is _Calliphontis_, Cic. ought according to ruleto write _Calliphon_ in the nom; for this see Madv. on _D.F._ II. 19, whoalso gives the chief authorities concerning this philosopher. _Hieronymus_:mentioned _D.F._ II. 19, 35, 41, V. 14, in which last place Cic. says ofhim _quem iam cur Peripateticum appellem nescio_. _Diodorus_: see Madv. on_D.F._ II. 19. _Honeste vivere_, etc.: in _D.F._ IV. 14 the _finis_ ofPolemo is stated to be _secundum naturam vivere_, and three Stoicinterpretations of it are given, the last of which resembles the presentpassage--_omnibus aut maximis rebus iis quae secundum naturam sint fruentemvivere_. This interpretation Antiochus adopted, and from him it isattributed to the _vetus Academia_ in I. 22, where the words _aut omnia autmaxima_, seem to correspond to words used by Polemo; cf. Clemens Alex. qu.by Madv. on _D.F._ IV. 15. See n. below on Carneades. _Antiochus probat_:the germs of many Stoic and Antiochean doctrines were to be found inPolemo; see I. 34, n. _Eiusque amici_: Bentl. _aemuli_, but Halm refers to_D.F._ II. 44. The later Peripatetics were to a great degree Stoicised._Nunc_: Halm _huc_ after Jo. Scala. _Carneades_: this _finis_ is given in_D.F._ II. 35 (_frui principiis naturalibus_), II. 42 (_Carneadeum illudquod is non tam ut probaret protulit, quam ut Stoicis quibuscum bellumgerebat opponeret_), V. 20 (_fruendi rebus iis, quas primas secundumnaturam esse diximus, Carneades non ille quidem auctor sed defensordisserendi causa fuit_), _T.D._ V. 84 (_naturae primus aut omnibus autmaximis frui, ut Carneades contra Stoicos disserebat_). The _finis_therefore, thus stated, is not different from that of Polemo, but it isclear that Carneades intended it to be different, as he did not include_virtus_ in it (see _D.F._ II. 38, 42, V. 22) while Polemo did (I. 22). Seemore on 139. _Zeno_: cf. _D.F._ IV. 15 _Inventor et princeps_: sameexpression in _T.D._ I. 48, _De Or._ I. 91, _De Inv._ II. 6; _inv._ =[Greek: oikistes].Sec.132. _Quemlibet_: cf. 125, 126. _Prope singularem_: cf. _T.D._ I. 22_Aristoteles longe omnibus--Platonem semper excipio--praestans_; also_D.F._ V. 7, _De Leg._ I. 15. _Per ipsum Antiochum_: a similar line ofargument is taken in Sext. _P.H._ I. 88, II. 32, etc. _Terminis ...possessione_: there is a similar play on the legal words _finis terminuspossessio_ in _De Leg._ I. 55, 56, a noteworthy passage. _Omnis ratio_etc.: this is the constant language of the later Greek philosophy; cf. Aug._De Civ. Dei_ XIX. 1 _neque enim existimat_ (Varro) _ullam philosophiaesectam esse dicendam, quae non eo distat a ceteris, quod diversos habeatfines bonorum et malorum_, etc. _Si Polemoneus_: i.e. _sapiens fuerit_._Peccat_: a Stoic term turned on the Stoics, see I. 37. _Academicos et_:MSS. om. _et_ as in I. 16, and _que_ in 52 of this book. _Dicenda_: for theomission of the verb with the gerundive (which occurs chiefly in emphaticclauses) cf. I. 7, and Madv. on _D.F._ I. 43, who how ever unduly limitsthe usage. _Hic igitur ... prudentior_: MSS. generally have _assentiens_,but one good one (Halm's E) has _assentientes_. I venture to read_adsentietur_, thinking that the last two letters were first dropt, as in26 (_tenetur_) and that then _adsentiet_, under the attraction of the _s_following, passed into _adsentiens_, as in 147 _intellegat se_ passed into_intelligentes_. _N_, I may remark, is frequently inserted in MSS. (as inI. 7 _appellant_, 16 _disputant_, 24 _efficerentur_), and all the changesinvolved in my conj. are of frequent occurrence. I also read _sin, inquam_(_sc. adsentietur_) for _si numquam_ of MSS. The question _uter estprudentior_ is intended to press home the dilemma in which Cicero hasplaced the supposed _sapiens_. All the other emendations I have seen aretoo unsatisfactory to be enumerated.Sec.133. _Non posse ... esse_: this seems to me sound; Bait. however reads_non esse illa probanda sap._ after Lamb., who also conj. _non posse illaprobata esse_. _Paria_: _D.F._ III. 48, _Paradoxa_ 20 sq., Zeller 250._Praecide_: [Greek: syntomos] or [Greek: synelon eipe], cf. _Cat. Mai._ 57,_Ad Att._ VIII. 4, X. 16. _Inquit_: n. on 79. _Quid quod quae_: so Guietuswith the approval of Madv. (_Em._ 203) reads for MSS. _quid quae_ or _quidquaeque_, Halm and Bait., follow Moser in writing _Quid? si quae_ removingthe stop at _paria_, and make _in utramque partem_ follow _dicantur_, onOrelli's suggestion. When several relative pronouns come together the MSS.often omit one. _Dicebas_: in 27. _Incognito_: 133.Sec.134. _Etiam_: = "yes," Madv. _Gram._ 454. _Non beatissimam_: I. 22, n._Deus ille_: i.e. more than man (of Aristotle's [Greek: e theos etherion]), if he can do without other advantages. For the omission of _est_after the emphatic _ille_ cf. 59, n. _Theophrasto_, etc.: n. on I. 33, 35._Dicente_: before this Halm after Lamb., followed by Bait., inserts_contra_, the need for which I fail to see. _Et hic_: i.e. Antiochus. _Nesibi constet_: Cic. argues in _T.D._ V. that there cannot be degrees inhappiness. _Tum hoc ... tum illud_: cf. 121. _Iacere_: 79. _In hisdiscrepant_: I. 42 _in his constitit_.Sec.135. _Moveri_: [Greek: kineisthai], 29. _Laetitia efferri_: I. 38._Probabilia_: the removal of passion and delight is easier than that offear and pain. _Sapiensne ... deleta sit_: see Madv. _D.F._ p. 806, ed. 2,who is severe upon the reading of Orelli (still kept by Klotz), _nontimeat? nec si patria deleatur? non doleat? nec, si deleta sit?_ whichinvolves the use of _nec_ for _ne ... quidem_. I have followed the readingof Madv. in his _Em._, not the one he gives (after Davies) in _D.F._ _nepatria deleatur_, which Halm takes, as does Baiter. Mine is rather nearerthe MSS. _Decreta_: some MSS. _durata_; Halm conj. _dictata_._Mediocritates_: [Greek: mesopetes], as in Aristotle; cf. _T.D._ III. 11,22, 74. _Permotione_: [Greek: kinesei]. _Naturalem ... modum_: so _T.D._III. 74. _Crantoris_: sc. _librum_, for the omission of which see n. on I.13; add Quint. IX. 4, 18, where Spalding wished to read _in Herodoti_,supplying _libro_. _Aureolus ... libellus_: it is not often that twodiminutives come together in Cic., and the usage is rather colloquial; cf._T.D._ III. 2, _N.D._ III. 43, also for _aureolus_ 119 _flumen aureum_._Panaetius_: he had addressed to Tubero a work _de dolore_; see _D.F._ IV.23. _Cotem_: _T.D._ IV. 43, 48, Seneca _De Ira_ III. 3, where the saying isattributed to Aristotle (_iram calcar esse virtutis_). _Dicebant_: for therepetition of this word cf. 146, I. 33.Sec.136. _Sunt enim Socratica_: the Socratic origin of the Stoic paradoxes isaffirmed in _Parad._ 4, _T.D._ III. 10. _Mirabilia_: Cic. generallytranslates [Greek: paradoxa] by _admirabilia_ as in _D.F._ IV. 74, or_admiranda_, under which title he seems to have published a work differentfrom the _Paradoxa_, which we possess: see Bait., and Halm's ed. of thePhil. works (1861), p. 994. _Quasi_: = almost, [Greek: hos epos eipein]._Voltis_: cf. the Antiochean opinion in I. 18, 22. _Solos reges_: for allthis see Zeller 253 sq. _Solos divites_: [Greek: hoti monos ho sophosplousios], _Parad._ VI. _Liberum_: _Parad._ V. [Greek: hoti monos ho sophoseleutheros kai pas aphron doulos]. _Furiosus_: _Parad._ IV. [Greek: hotipas aphron mainetai].Sec.137. _Tam sunt defendenda_: cf. 8, 120. _Bono modo_: a colloquial andPlautine expression; see Forc. _Ad senatum starent_: "were in waiting onthe senate;" cf. such phrases as _stare ad cyathum_, etc. _Carneade_: thevocative is _Carneades_ in _De Div._ I. 23. _Huic Stoico_: i.e. _Diogeni_;cf. _D.F._ II. 24. Halm brackets _Stoico_, and after him Bait. _Sequivolebat_: "professed to follow;" cf. _D.F._ V. 13 _Strato physicum sevoluit_ "gave himself out to be a physical philosopher:" also Madv. on_D.F._ II. 102. _Ille noster_: Dav. _vester_, as in 143 _noster Antiochus_.But in both places Cic. speaks as a friend of Antiochus; cf. 113._Balbutiens_: "giving an uncertain sound;" cf. _De Div._ I. 5, _T.D._ V.75.Sec.138. _Mihi veremini_: cf. Caes. _Bell. Gall_. V. 9 _veritus navibus_. Halmand Bait. follow Christ's conj. _verenti_, removing the stop at _voltis_._Opinationem_: the [Greek: oiesin] of Sext., e.g. _P.H._ III. 280. _Quodminime voltis_: cf. I. 18. _De finibus_: not "concerning," but "from among"the different _fines_; otherwise _fine_ would have been written. Cf. I. 4_si qui de nostris._ _Circumcidit et amputat_: these two verbs often cometogether, as in _D.F._ I. 44; cf. also _D.F._ III. 31. _Si vacemus omnimolestia_: which Epicurus held to be the highest pleasure. _Cum honestate_:Callipho in 131. _Prima naturae commoda_: Cic. here as in _D.F._ IV. 59, V.58 confuses the Stoic [Greek: prota kata physin] with [Greek: ta tousomatos agatha kai ta ektos] of the Peripatetics, for which see I. 19. Moreon the subject in Madvig's fourth Excursus to the _D.F._ _Relinquit_:Orelli _relinqui_ against the MSS.Sec.139. _Polemonis ... finibus_: all these were composite _fines_. _Adhuc_: Ineed scarcely point out that this goes with _habeo_ and not with_probabilius_; _adhuc_ for _etiam_ with the comparative does not occur tillthe silver writers. _Labor eo_: cf. Horace's _nunc in Aristippi furtimpraecepta relabor_, also _D.F._ V. 6 _rapior illuc: revocat autemAntiochus_. _Reprehendit manu_: _M.D.F._ II. 3. _Pecudum_: I. 6, _Parad._14 _voluptatem esse summum bonum, quae mihi vox pecudum videtur esse nonhominum_; similar expressions occur with a reference to Epicurus in _DeOff._ I. 105, _Lael._ 20, 32. _T.D._ V. 73, _D.F._ II. 18; cf. alsoAristoph. _Plut._ 922 [Greek: probatiou bion legeis] and [Greek: boskematonbios] in Aristotle. The meaning of _pecus_ is well shown in _T.D._ I. 69._Iungit deo_: Zeller 176 sq. _Animum solum_: the same criticism is appliedto Zeno's _finis_ in _D.F._ IV. 17, 25. _Ut ... sequar_: for the repeated_ut_ see _D.F._ V. 10, Madv. _Gram._ 480, obs. 2. Bait. brackets the second_ut_ with Lamb. _Carneades ... defensitabat_: this is quite a differentview from that in 131; yet another of Carneades is given in _T.D._ V. 83._Istum finem_: MSS. _ipsum_; the two words are often confused, as in I. 2._Ipsa veritas_: MSS. _severitas_, a frequent error; cf. _In Verr. Act._ I.3, III. 162, _De Leg._ I. 4, also Madv. on _D.F._ IV. 55. _Obversetur_:Halm takes the conj. of Lamb., _adversetur_. The MSS. reading givesexcellent sense; cf. _T.D._ II. 52 _obversentur honestae species viro_.Bait. follows Halm. _Tu ... copulabis_: this is the feigned expostulationof _veritas_ (cf. 34 _convicio veritatis_), for which style see 125.Sec.140. _Voluptas cum honestate_: this whole expression is in apposition to_par_, so that _cum_ must not be taken closely with _depugnet_; cf. Hor._Sat._ I. 7, 19 _Rupili et Persi par pugnat uti non compositum melius_ (sc._par_) _cum Bitho Bacchius_. _Si sequare, ruunt_: for constr. cf. I. 7._Communitas_: for Stoic philanthropy see Zeller 297. _Nulla potest nisierit_: Madv. _D.F._ III. 70 "_in hac coniunctione--hoc fieri non potestnisi--fere semper coniunctivus subicitur praesentis--futuri et perfectiindicativus ponitur_." _Gratuita_: "disinterested." _Ne intellegi quidem_:n. on I. 7, cf. also _T.D._ V. 73, 119. _Gloriosum in vulgus_: cf. _D.F._II. 44 _populus cum illis facit_ (i.e. _Epicureis_). _Normam ... regulam_:n. on _Ac. Post._ fragm. 8. _Praescriptionem_: I. 23, n.Sec.141. _Adquiescis_: MSS. are confused here, Halm reads _adsciscis_,comparing 138. Add _D.F._ I. 23 (_sciscat et probet_), III. 17(_adsciscendas esse_), III. 70 (_adscisci et probari_) Bait. follows Halm._Ratum ... fixum_: cf. 27 and n. on _Ac. Post._ fragm. 17. _Falso_: like_incognito_ in 133. _Nullo discrimine_: for this see the explanation of_nihil interesse_ in 40, n. _Iudicia_: [Greek: kriteria] as usual.    Sec.Sec.142--146. Summary. To pass to Dialectic, note how Protagoras, the    Cyrenaics, Epicurus, and Plato disagree (142). Does Antiochus follow    any of these? Why, he never even follows the _vetus Academia_, and    never stirs a step from Chrysippus. Dialecticians themselves cannot    agree about the very elements of their art (143). Why then, Lucullus,    do you rouse the mob against me like a seditious tribune by telling    them I do away with the arts altogether? When you have got the crowd    together, I will point out to them that according to Zeno all of them    are slaves, exiles, and lunatics, and that you yourself, not being    _sapiens_, know nothing whatever (144). This last point Zeno used to    illustrate by action Yet his whole school cannot point to any actual    _sapiens_ (145). Now as there is no knowledge there can be no art. How    would Zeuxis and Polycletus like this conclusion? They would prefer    mine, to which our ancestors bear testimony.Sec.142. _Venio iam_: Dialectic had been already dealt with in 91--98 here itis merely considered with a view to the choice of the supposed _sapiens_,as was Ethical Science in 129--141 and Physics in 116--128. With theenumeration of conflicting schools here given compare the one Sextus givesin _A.M._ VII. 48 sq. _Protagorae_: R. and P. 132 sq. _Qui putet_: so MSS.,Halm and Bait. _putat_ after Lamb. Trans. "inasmuch as he thinks"._Permotiones intimas_: cf. 20 _tactus interior_, also 76. _Epicuri_: nn. on19, 79, 80. _Iudicium_: [Greek: kriterion] as usual. _Rerum notitiis_:[Greek: prolepsesi], Zeller 403 sq. _Constituit_: note the constr. with_in_, like _ponere in_. _Cogitationis_: cf. I. 30. Several MSS. have_cognitionis_, the two words are frequently confused. See Wesenberg _Fm._to _T.D._ III. p. 17, who says, _multo tamen saepius "cogitatio" pro"cognitio" substituitur quam contra_, also _M.D.F_ III. 21.Sec.143. _Ne maiorum quidem suorum_: sc. _aliquid probat_. For _maiorum_ cf.80. Here Plato is almost excluded from the so-called _vetus Academia_, cf.I. 33. _Libri_: titles of some are preserved in Diog. Laert. IV. 11--14._Nihil politius_: cf. 119, n. _Pedem nusquam_: for the ellipse cf. 58, 116,_Pro Deiot._ 42 and _pedem latum_ in Plaut. _Abutimur_: this verb in therhetorical writers means to use words in metaphorical or unnatural senses,see Quint. X. 1, 12. This is probably the meaning here; "do we use the nameAcademic in a non natural fashion?" _Si dies est lucet_: a better trans of[Greek: ei phos estin, hemera estin] than was given in 96, where see n._Aliter Philoni_: not Philo of Larissa, but a noted dialectician, pupil ofDiodorus the Megarian, mentioned also in 75. The dispute between Diodorusand Philo is mentioned in Sext. _A.M._ VIII. 115--117 with the same purposeas here, see also Zeller 39. _Antipater_: the Stoic of Tarsus, whosucceeded Diogenes Babylonius in the headship of the school. _Archidemus_:several times mentioned with Antipater in Diog., as VII. 68, 84._Opiniosissimi_: so the MSS. I cannot think that the word is wrong, thoughall edd. condemn it. Halm is certainly mistaken in saying that a laudatoryepithet such as _ingeniosissimi_ is necessary. I believe that the word_opiniosissimi_ (an adj. not elsewhere used by Cic.) was manufactured onthe spur of the moment, in order to ridicule these two philosophers, whoare playfully described as men full of _opinio_ or [Greek: doxa]--just theimputation which, as Stoics, they would most repel. Hermann's_spinosissimi_ is ingenious, and if an em. were needed, would not be soutterly improbable as Halm thinks.Sec.144. _In contionem vocas_: a retort, having reference to 14, cf. also 63,72. For these _contiones_ see Lange, _Romische Alterthumer_ II. 663, ed 2.They were called by and held under the presidency of magistrates, all ofwhom had the right to summon them, the right of the tribune being underfewer restrictions than the right of the others. _Occludi tabernas_ inorder of course that the artisans might all be at the meeting, for this seeLiv. III. 27, IV. 31, IX. 7, and compare the cry "to your tents, O Israel"in the Bible. _Artificia_: n. on 30. _Tolli_: n. on 26. _Ut opificesconcitentur_: cf. _Pro Flacc._ 18 _opifices et tabernarios quid neqoti estconcitare?_ _Expromam_: Cic. was probably thinking of the use to which hehimself had put these Stoic paradoxes in _Pro Murena_ 61, a use of which hehalf confesses himself ashamed in _D.F._ IV. 74. _Exsules_ etc.: 136.Sec.145. _Scire negatis_: cf. Sext. _A.M._ VII. 153, who says that even[Greek: katalepsis] when it arises in the mind of a [Greek: phaulos] ismere [Greek: doxa] and not [Greek: episteme]; also _P.H._ II. 83, where itis said that the [Greek: phaulos] is capable of [Greek: to alethes] but notof [Greek: aletheia], which the [Greek: sophos] alone has. _Visum ...adsensus_: the Stoics as we saw (II. 38, etc.) analysed sensations into twoparts; with the Academic and other schools each sensation was an ultimateunanalysable unit, a [Greek: psilon pathos]. For this symbolic action ofZeno cf. _D.F._ II. 18, _Orat._ 113, Sextus _A.M._ II. 7, Quint. II. 20, 7,Zeller 84. _Contraxerat_: so Halm who qu. Plin. _Nat. Hist._ XI. 26, 94_digitum contrahens aut remittens_; Orelli _construxerat_; MSS. mostly_contexerat_. _Quod ante non fuerat_: [Greek: katalambanein] however isfrequent in Plato in the sense "to seize firmly with the mind."_Adverterat_: the best MSS. give merely _adverat_, but on the margin_admoverat_ which Halm takes, and after him Bait.; one good MS. has_adverterat_. _Ne ipsi quidem_: even Socrates, Antisthenes and Diogeneswere not [Greek: sophoi] according to the Stoics, but merely were [Greek:en prokopei]; see Diog. VII. 91, Zeller 257, and cf. Plut. _Sto. Rep._ 1056(qu. by P. Valentia p. 295, ed Orelli) [Greek: esti de outos] (i.e. [Greek:ho sophos]) [Greek: oudamou ges oude gegone]. _Nec tu_: sc. _scis_; Goer.has a strange note here.Sec.146. _Illa_: cf. _illa invidiosa_ above (144). _Dicebas_: in 22. _Refero_:"retort," as in Ovid. _Metam._ I. 758 _pudet haec opprobria nobis Et dicipotuisse et non potuisse referri_; cf. also _par pari referre dicto_. _Nenobis quidem_: "_nor_ would they be angry;" cf. n. on. I. 5. _Arbitrari_:the original meaning of this was "to be a bystander," or "to be aneye-witness," see Corssen I. 238. _Ea non ut_: MSS. have _ut ea non aut_.Halm reads _ut ea non_ merely, but I prefer the reading I have givenbecause of Cicero's fondness for making the _ut_ follow closely on thenegative: for this see Madv. _Gram._ 465 _b_, obs.Sec.147. _Obscuritate_: cf. I. 44, n. on I. 15. _Plus uno_: 115. _Iacere_: cf.79. _Plagas_: cf. n. on 112.Sec.148. _Ad patris revolvor sententiam_: for this see Introd. 50, and for theexpression 18. _Opinaturum_: see 59, 67, 78, 112. _Intellegat se_: MSS._intellegentes_, cf. n. on 132. _Qua re_: so Manut. for _per_ of MSS.[Greek: Epochen] _illam omnium rerum_: an odd expression; cf. _actio rerum_in 62. _Non probans_: so Madv. _Em._ 204 for MSS. _comprobans_. Dav. conj._improbans_ and is followed by Bait. I am not sure that the MSS. reading iswrong. The difficulty is essentially the same as that involved in 104,which should be closely compared. A contrast is drawn between a theoreticaldogma and a practical belief. The dogma is that _assent_ (meaning absoluteassent) is not to be given to phenomena. This dogma Catulus might welldescribe himself as formally approving (_comprobans_). The _practice_ is togive assent (meaning modified assent). There is the same contrast in 104between _placere_ and _tenere_. I may note that the word _alteri_ (cf._altero_ in 104) need not imply that the dogma and the practice areirreconcilable; a misconception on this point has considerably confirmededd. in their introduction of the negative. _Nec eam admodum_: cf. _nonrepugnarem_ in 112. _Tollendum_: many edd. have gone far astray ininterpreting this passage. The word is used with a double reference to_adsensus_ and _ancora_; in the first way we have had _tollere_ used ascore of times in this book; with regard to the second meaning, cf. Caes._Bell. Gall._ IV. 23, _Bell. Civ._ I. 31, where _tollere_ is used ofweighing anchor, and Varro _De Re Rust._ III. 17, 1, where it occurs in thesense "to get on," "to proceed," without any reference to the sea. (Theexx. are from Forc.) This passage I believe and this alone is referred toin _Ad Att._ XIII. 21, 3. If my conjecture is correct, Cic. tried at firstto manage a joke by using the word _inhibendum_, which had also a nauticalsignification, but finding that he had mistaken the meaning of the word,substituted _tollendum_.[1] _De Leg._ II.

I have therefore arranged thatthose who would like to make this exchange, on depositing a perfectand undamaged copy of the first or second Edition with any agent of theClarendon Press, shall be entitled to receive a copy of a new Edition athalf-price.PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.The Text which has been mostly followed in this Translation of Plato isthe latest 8vo. edition of Stallbaum; the principal deviations are notedat the bottom of the page.I have to acknowledge many obligations to old friends and pupils. Theseare:--Mr. John Purves, Fellow of Balliol College, with whom I haverevised about half of the entire Translation; the Rev. ProfessorCampbell, of St. Andrews, who has helped me in the revision of severalparts of the work, especially of the Theaetetus, Sophist, and Politicus;Mr. Robinson Ellis, Fellow of Trinity College, and Mr. Alfred Robinson,Fellow of New College, who read with me the Cratylus and the Gorgias;Mr. Paravicini, Student of Christ Church, who assisted me in theSymposium; Mr. Raper, Fellow of Queen's College, Mr. Monro, Fellow ofOriel College, and Mr. Shadwell, Student of Christ Church, who gave mesimilar assistance in the Laws. Dr. Greenhill, of Hastings, has alsokindly sent me remarks on the physiological part of the Timaeus, which Ihave inserted as corrections under the head of errata at the end of theIntroduction. The degree of accuracy which I have been enabled to attainis in great measure due to these gentlemen, and I heartily thank themfor the pains and time which they have bestowed on my work.I have further to explain how far I have received help from otherlabourers in the same field. The books which I have found of mostuse are Steinhart and Muller's German Translation of Plato withIntroductions; Zeller's 'Philosophie der Griechen,' and 'PlatonischeStudien;' Susemihl's 'Genetische Entwickelung der PaltonischenPhilosophie;' Hermann's 'Geschichte der Platonischen Philosophie;'Bonitz, 'Platonische Studien;' Stallbaum's Notes and Introductions;Professor Campbell's editions of the 'Theaetetus,' the 'Sophist,' andthe 'Politicus;' Professor Thompson's 'Phaedrus;' Th. Martin's 'Etudessur le Timee;' Mr. Poste's edition and translation of the 'Philebus;'the Translation of the 'Republic,' by Messrs. Davies and Vaughan, andthe Translation of the 'Gorgias,' by Mr. Cope.I have also derived much assistance from the great work of Mr. Grote,which contains excellent analyses of the Dialogues, and is rich inoriginal thoughts and observations. I agree with him in rejecting asfutile the attempt of Schleiermacher and others to arrange the Dialoguesof Plato into a harmonious whole. Any such arrangement appears to me notonly to be unsupported by evidence, but to involve an anachronism inthe history of philosophy. There is a common spirit in the writings ofPlato, but not a unity of design in the whole, nor perhaps a perfectunity in any single Dialogue. The hypothesis of a general plan whichis worked out in the successive Dialogues is an after-thought of thecritics who have attributed a system to writings belonging to an agewhen system had not as yet taken possession of philosophy.If Mr. Grote should do me the honour to read any portion of this workhe will probably remark that I have endeavoured to approach Plato from apoint of view which is opposed to his own. The aim of the Introductionsin these volumes has been to represent Plato as the father of Idealism,who is not to be measured by the standard of utilitarianism or anyother modern philosophical system. He is the poet or maker of ideas,satisfying the wants of his own age, providing the instrumentsof thought for future generations. He is no dreamer, but a greatphilosophical genius struggling with the unequal conditions of lightand knowledge under which he is living. He may be illustrated by thewritings of moderns, but he must be interpreted by his own, and by hisplace in the history of philosophy. We are not concerned to determinewhat is the residuum of truth which remains for ourselves. His truth maynot be our truth, and nevertheless may have an extraordinary value andinterest for us.I cannot agree with Mr. Grote in admitting as genuine all thewritings commonly attributed to Plato in antiquity, any more than withSchaarschmidt and some other German critics who reject nearly half ofthem. The German critics, to whom I refer, proceed chiefly on groundsof internal evidence; they appear to me to lay too much stress on thevariety of doctrine and style, which must be equally acknowledged as afact, even in the Dialogues regarded by Schaarschmidt as genuine, e.g.in the Phaedrus, or Symposium, when compared with the Laws. Hewho admits works so different in style and matter to have been thecomposition of the same author, need have no difficulty in admittingthe Sophist or the Politicus. (The negative argument adduced by the sameschool of critics, which is based on the silence of Aristotle, is notworthy of much consideration. For why should Aristotle, because he hasquoted several Dialogues of Plato, have quoted them all? Something mustbe allowed to chance, and to the nature of the subjects treated of inthem.) On the other hand, Mr. Grote trusts mainly to the AlexandrianCanon. But I hardly think that we are justified in attributing muchweight to the authority of the Alexandrian librarians in an age whenthere was no regular publication of books, and every temptation to forgethem; and in which the writings of a school were naturally attributed tothe founder of the school. And even without intentional fraud, there wasan inclination to believe rather than to enquire. Would Mr. Grote acceptas genuine all the writings which he finds in the lists of learnedancients attributed to Hippocrates, to Xenophon, to Aristotle? TheAlexandrian Canon of the Platonic writings is deprived of credit by theadmission of the Epistles, which are not only unworthy of Plato, and inseveral passages plagiarized from him, but flagrantly at variance withhistorical fact. It will be seen also that I do not agree with Mr.Grote's views about the Sophists; nor with the low estimate which he hasformed of Plato's Laws; nor with his opinion respecting Plato's doctrineof the rotation of the earth. But I 'am not going to lay hands on myfather Parmenides' (Soph.), who will, I hope, forgive me for differingfrom him on these points. I cannot close this Preface without expressingmy deep respect for his noble and gentle character, and the greatservices which he has rendered to Greek Literature.Balliol College, January, 1871.PREFACE TO THE SECOND AND THIRD EDITIONS.In publishing a Second Edition (1875) of the Dialogues of Plato inEnglish, I had to acknowledge the assistance of several friends: ofthe Rev. G.G. Bradley, Master of University College, now Dean ofWestminster, who sent me some valuable remarks on the Phaedo; of Dr.Greenhill, who had again revised a portion of the Timaeus; of Mr. R.L.Nettleship, Fellow and Tutor of Balliol College, to whom I was indebtedfor an excellent criticism of the Parmenides; and, above all, of theRev. Professor Campbell of St. Andrews, and Mr. Paravicini, late Studentof Christ Church and Tutor of Balliol College, with whom I had read overthe greater part of the translation. I was also indebted to Mr. EvelynAbbott, Fellow and Tutor of Balliol College, for a complete and accurateindex.In this, the Third Edition, I am under very great obligations to Mr.Matthew Knight, who has not only favoured me with valuable suggestionsthroughout the work, but has largely extended the Index (from 61 to 175pages) and translated the Eryxias and Second Alcibiades; and to MrFrank Fletcher, of Balliol College, my Secretary. I am also considerablyindebted to Mr. J.W. Mackail, late Fellow of Balliol College, who readover the Republic in the Second Edition and noted several inaccuracies.In both editions the Introductions to the Dialogues have been enlarged,and essays on subjects having an affinity to the Platonic Dialogues havebeen introduced into several of them. The analyses have been corrected,and innumerable alterations have been made in the Text. There have beenadded also, in the Third Edition, headings to the pages and a marginalanalysis to the text of each dialogue.At the end of a long task, the translator may without impropriety pointout the difficulties which he has had to encounter. These have been fargreater than he would have anticipated; nor is he at all sanguine thathe has succeeded in overcoming them. Experience has made him feel that atranslation, like a picture, is dependent for its effect on very minutetouches; and that it is a work of infinite pains, to be returned to inmany moods and viewed in different lights.I. An English translation ought to be idiomatic and interesting, notonly to the scholar, but to the unlearned reader. Its object should notsimply be to render the words of one language into the words of anotheror to preserve the construction and order of the original;--this is theambition of a schoolboy, who wishes to show that he has made a good useof his Dictionary and Grammar; but is quite unworthy of the translator,who seeks to produce on his reader an impression similar or nearlysimilar to that produced by the original. To him the feeling should bemore important than the exact word. He should remember Dryden's quaintadmonition not to 'lacquey by the side of his author, but to mount upbehind him.' (Dedication to the Aeneis.) He must carry in his mind acomprehensive view of the whole work, of what has preceded and of whatis to follow,--as well as of the meaning of particular passages. Hisversion should be based, in the first instance, on an intimate knowledgeof the text; but the precise order and arrangement of the words may beleft to fade out of sight, when the translation begins to take shape. Hemust form a general idea of the two languages, and reduce the one to theterms of the other. His work should be rhythmical and varied, theright admixture of words and syllables, and even of letters, should becarefully attended to; above all, it should be equable in style. Theremust also be quantity, which is necessary in prose as well as in verse:clauses, sentences, paragraphs, must be in due proportion. Metre andeven rhyme may be rarely admitted; though neither is a legitimateelement of prose writing, they may help to lighten a cumbrousexpression (Symp.). The translation should retain as far as possiblethe characteristic qualities of the ancient writer--his freedom, grace,simplicity, stateliness, weight, precision; or the best part of him willbe lost to the English reader. It should read as an original work, andshould also be the most faithful transcript which can be made of thelanguage from which the translation is taken, consistently with thefirst requirement of all, that it be English. Further, the translationbeing English, it should also be perfectly intelligible in itselfwithout reference to the Greek, the English being really the more lucidand exact of the two languages. In some respects it may be maintainedthat ordinary English writing, such as the newspaper article, issuperior to Plato: at any rate it is couched in language which is veryrarely obscure. On the other hand, the greatest writers of Greece,Thucydides, Plato, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Pindar, Demosthenes, aregenerally those which are found to be most difficult and to diverge mostwidely from the English idiom. The translator will often have to convertthe more abstract Greek into the more concrete English, or vice versa,and he ought not to force upon one language the character of another.In some cases, where the order is confused, the expression feeble, theemphasis misplaced, or the sense somewhat faulty, he will not strive inhis rendering to reproduce these characteristics, but will re-write thepassage as his author would have written it at first, had he not been'nodding'; and he will not hesitate to supply anything which, owing tothe genius of the language or some accident of composition, isomitted in the Greek, but is necessary to make the English clear andconsecutive.It is difficult to harmonize all these conflicting elements. In atranslation of Plato what may be termed the interests of the Greekand English are often at war with one another. In framing the Englishsentence we are insensibly diverted from the exact meaning of the Greek;when we return to the Greek we are apt to cramp and overlay the English.We substitute, we compromise, we give and take, we add a little hereand leave out a little there. The translator may sometimes be allowed tosacrifice minute accuracy for the sake of clearness and sense. But he isnot therefore at liberty to omit words and turns of expression which theEnglish language is quite capable of supplying. He must be patient andself-controlled; he must not be easily run away with. Let him neverallow the attraction of a favourite expression, or a sonorous cadence,to overpower his better judgment, or think much of an ornament which isout of keeping with the general character of his work. He must ever becasting his eyes upwards from the copy to the original, and down againfrom the original to the copy (Rep.). His calling is not held in muchhonour by the world of scholars; yet he himself may be excusedfor thinking it a kind of glory to have lived so many years in thecompanionship of one of the greatest of human intelligences, and insome degree, more perhaps than others, to have had the privilege ofunderstanding him (Sir Joshua Reynolds' Lectures: Disc. xv.).There are fundamental differences in Greek and English, of which somemay be managed while others remain intractable. (1). The structure ofthe Greek language is partly adversative and alternative, and partlyinferential; that is to say, the members of a sentence are eitheropposed to one another, or one of them expresses the cause or effector condition or reason of another. The two tendencies may be called thehorizontal and perpendicular lines of the language; and the oppositionor inference is often much more one of words than of ideas. But modernlanguages have rubbed off this adversative and inferential form: theyhave fewer links of connection, there is less mortar in the interstices,and they are content to place sentences side by side, leaving theirrelation to one another to be gathered from their position or fromthe context. The difficulty of preserving the effect of the Greekis increased by the want of adversative and inferential particles inEnglish, and by the nice sense of tautology which characterizes allmodern languages. We cannot have two 'buts' or two 'fors' in the samesentence where the Greek repeats (Greek). There is a similar want ofparticles expressing the various gradations of objective and subjectivethought--(Greek) and the like, which are so thickly scattered over theGreek page. Further, we can only realize to a very imperfect degreethe common distinction between (Greek), and the combination of thetwo suggests a subtle shade of negation which cannot be expressedin English. And while English is more dependent than Greek upon theapposition of clauses and sentences, yet there is a difficulty in usingthis form of construction owing to the want of case endings. For thesame reason there cannot be an equal variety in the order of words or anequal nicety of emphasis in English as in Greek.(2) The formation of the sentence and of the paragraph greatly differsin Greek and English. The lines by which they are divided are generallymuch more marked in modern languages than in ancient. Both sentencesand paragraphs are more precise and definite--they do not run intoone another. They are also more regularly developed from within.The sentence marks another step in an argument or a narrative or astatement; in reading a paragraph we silently turn over the page andarrive at some new view or aspect of the subject. Whereas in Plato weare not always certain where a sentence begins and ends; and paragraphsare few and far between. The language is distributed in a different way,and less articulated than in English. For it was long before the trueuse of the period was attained by the classical writers both in poetryor prose; it was (Greek). The balance of sentences and the introductionof paragraphs at suitable intervals must not be neglected if the harmonyof the English language is to be preserved. And still a caution has tobe added on the other side, that we must avoid giving it a numerical ormechanical character.(3) This, however, is not one of the greatest difficulties of thetranslator; much greater is that which arises from the restrictionof the use of the genders. Men and women in English are masculineand feminine, and there is a similar distinction of sex in the wordsdenoting animals; but all things else, whether outward objects orabstract ideas, are relegated to the class of neuters. Hardly in someflight of poetry do we ever endue any of them with the characteristicsof a sentient being, and then only by speaking of them in the femininegender. The virtues may be pictured in female forms, but they are not sodescribed in language; a ship is humorously supposed to be the sailor'sbride; more doubtful are the personifications of church and country asfemales. Now the genius of the Greek language is the opposite ofthis.
