ouple of small boxes as his arms flailed. Nuts and bolts scattered on the floor. Joe backed into another box and sat down hard on it."What-?" exclaimed Vly, turning."What was that?" cried Joe. "Something jumped across the corridor. I think it went into this recess here." He pointed to an opening between a few stacked boxes."One of my koalangs," answered Montezuma. "I've got four of them here. There are a few more in the living quarters. Good company. They can startle you, though, and they can make an awful mess. More than once I've threatened to make stew out of 'em and eat 'em for dinner." The Starmen looked at one another, wondering if he was joking. His next action showed that he was."Come on, Howard," said Montezuma gently, bending over and calling into the dark place where the koalang had hidden. "They won't hurt you. I know you're not used to company, but no one's gonna hurt you. Come on out. That's it, come on." He reached in gently and drew a small creature out of the darkness. It had a small furry face with large, frightened eyes, and snuggled up against the miner. Its fur was caramel and white. He folded it into his chest and covered it gently with both hands. He crooned to it lovingly for a moment or two, then said, "That's right. You're okay. Go play." Then he added with mock fierceness, "Just stay out of the paint!" He set it down and turned back to the door at the end of the corridor."In here," he directed, leading the way into the room beyond.4: Sabbath GeorgeTHE ROOM was smaller than the Starmen had anticipated. Its small size was accentuated by being packed to the ceiling with a variety of items. Hand tools identical to those used by rock hounds for centuries lay on tables and on shelves. Stacks of paper, most of which showed signs of being bound by hand, covered much of the remaining space. On one shelf was a large, clear sphere on an ornately shaped stand. The eyes of all three Starmen were drawn to it."Have a seat," offered their host.There were three chairs. Montezuma sat in one placed before a desk and swiveled to face his visitors. Zip and Joe took the other chairs and Mark sat on a short stack of crates filled with rock samples. A thick book rested on a table in the center of the room. Mark glanced at the title, turning his head slightly to do so. It was The Flying Carpet, by Richard Halliburton. There was a bookmark about halfway through the book.The asteroid miner leaned forward. "What about George?" he asked.Zip filled him in. Montezuma Vly paid close attention. His eyes never wavered from Zip's face as he spoke. When Zip was finished, Vly nodded."Mm hmm," he murmured. "This could be bad for George. I'll tell you where to find him. I expect that you'll be able to keep him out of the clutches of the space vultures. You've got an enemy to be reckoned with in this Zimbardo psychopath, but I believe you can handle him.""You seem to know a lot about our recent exploits, Mr. Vly," said Joe, conversationally."I'm not the complete recluse people think, Mr. Taylor. People have a lot of wrong ideas about me. I don't want to be listed in the Register of Peoples, and I don't want people butting into my business or telling me how to live, but I keep up with the news. If I hadn't recognized you, you wouldn't have been allowed to land on my asteroid. You're not wearing Starman's red, you know.""We're grateful to you, Mr. Vly," nodded Zip."May I ask-" began Mark, then hesitated."Yes, you may ask. Go on."Mark turned his head toward the sphere. "The sphere...""Oh yes. It's pure crystal, all right."The Starmen gasped. "Pure...crystal...?" stammered Mark. "Why, there can't be a larger one in the Solar System! It's priceless!""Next largest was in the Smithsonian Institution, a little more than twelve inches in diameter. This one's sixteen and three-quarters inches. Found it myself on Adamant-that's the parent asteroid from which this sliver I live on was busted off a few millennia ago." Mark knew he was referring to what he had called a "worthless chunk" before they landed.Vly went on. "Shaped it myself in those old machines you saw coming in here. Had to redesign some of 'em to fit a crystal this size, but we did it.""It looks flawless!" breathed Joe."Looks it, but isn't. Its flaws are its greatest treasure. Watch this; you haven't seen anything yet." Vly picked up a small cutting tool with a laser guide at the end. He turned off the lights and then pointed the laser at the crystal sphere. The beam struck the surface and then scattered throughout the interior of the globe, igniting sparks of spectacular glory. Mark could feel tears come into his eyes from the unearthly beauty the light created. Many dozens of flakes, invisible to the naked eye, were revealed when the laser beam pierced the near-perfect sphere. They exploded in glorious colors-gold, orange, deep red, flaming yellow, silver; even a few brilliant green, deep blue, and violet sparks traced across the inner world.The Starmen were speechless. They couldn't take their eyes off the resplendent glory of the sphere under the laser light. "Beautiful, isn't it?" asked Vly, gently. There was no need to answer."Where do the colors come from?" asked Mark. "Laser light has only one wavelength, so it can't be refracting in there.""The crystal's impurities are almost invisible to the unaided eye," answered Vly, "but the laser hits the impurities and causes secondary emissions of light of all sorts of color-the more impurities, the more colors. It lights up better than a fire opal."As he moved the laser beam slowly around the globe, the interior lights changed-first one, then another "flaw" taking the light and surging into radiance.All too soon, he switched off the laser and turned the room lights back on. It was almost as if a spell had been broken."C'mon," he said. "I'll show you just where George is on the chart." He moved back down the hall, the Starmen following. When they were back in the room they had first entered, Vly reached up into a recess where there were several rolled sheets of paper. "Move aside," he said quietly, pushing a reluctant koalang over and pulling out a large roll. He unrolled it over a rock polisher and gestured for the Starmen to take the corners. It was a map of a portion of the asteroid belt."Here's where we are," said Vly, pointing to a spot on the map, "and here's where George is." His finger swept across the map to where a tiny dot had been placed. "It's a mining operation of moderate size called Z25. He runs it there with a fair-sized crew-maybe a dozen men." There were equations, sketches, and notes scribbled all over the sheet."I'm sorry, Mr. Vly," said Mark, "but I don't follow you. I'm used to plotting coordinates and thinking in three dimensions.""See these figures?" asked Vly. "They're your coordinates. It is a three-dimensional map, in a manner of speaking. If it weren't, I couldn't get around. I'll write down what you need. But you'll find George on that little plunk of a rock. He's been there several months now and won't be hard to find, once I point it out to you. I just spoke to him a few hours ago and I'll get ahold of him again and tell him you'll be coming." He began to write some notes down for Mark."Must take a lot of power to run your operation here, Mr. Vly," observed Mark while he waited for Montezuma to finish writing. "Don't you have to conserve energy?""Haven't had to conserve energy since I developed a new process for drawing energy directly from the sun.""But out here the solar radiation is so weak. You can't get much energy from solar panels, no matter how efficient-certainly not enough to run your machines without some sort of supplement.""I don't use solar panels any more, Mr. Seaton. I mine energy from the sun directly with an entirely new process. I can pull in and store about four gigawatts. Gives me all I need and plenty left over.""Four gigawatts?""Four gigawatts. That's a four with nine zeroes after it."Mark almost shouted. "I know how much it is! Mr. Vly! You amaze me! There's nothing like that anywhere else in the Solar System! Nobody has anything like that, nobody! Not even Starlight Enterprise! You could make a fortune if you sell your design!!""Really?" said Mr. Vly, lifting his eyebrows slightly, handing him the sheet with his notes on it. "Excuse me a moment while I write that down, so the next time I want to turn my whole life over to lawyers and businessmen I'll know just what to do.""But, but..." Mark spluttered. Joe laughed and Zip smiled."Thank you, Mr. Vly," said Zip, extending his hand. "It has been a remarkable visit, and we appreciate very much your letting us drop in."Montezuma shook Zip's hand. "Wait a minute, Starmen. Let me give you something to help you while away the long hours in space." He turned and rummaged through a box, then scanned a shelf behind him. After a moment he pulled out a gold disc in a flat, clear container."Take this," he said, handing it to Zip. "It's a recording of the entire works of Johann Sebastian Bach. That's more than 1,200 compositions. The music is so complex that some of its mysteries weren't even discovered until the computer age. Lily made this disk. She's an expert in the music of the Renaissance. Does research all the time." "Lily?""Lily and I have been partners out here for over twenty years. Us and the koalangs."Zip put the disk into his pocket. "Thank you, sir. Best wishes to you.""You too. An occasional visit once in a while is welcome, especially when people respect my way of life. Most don't understand. I think you three do. Just protect George. He's a good friend, and they're hard to find."About 56 hours later, the Vigilant Warrior came into the proximity of Z25. Joe eased the ship through a scattering of moderate-sized asteroids and then came into a space where there were relatively few chunks of stone and iron moving through space. On the far side of the open area was an asteroid nearly twenty miles long and half as wide."There it is," announced Joe. "Z25."Zip gave a nod to Mark, and Mark opened communications."Vigilant Warrior calling Z25. We have arrived in your area and seek permission to land.""You made good time, friends," came a voice instantly. "Come on in and welcome."The Starmen had spoken to St. George once during their journey from Montezuma's Castle, but only briefly. The communications were encrypted, but even the encryption could be a tipoff to an enemy who might be listening in.As they made their final approach, the Starmen had a good view of Z25's horizon near the time of local sunset. The surface was dark because of the oblique illumination, but several boulders caught the sunlight and appeared as bright sentinels on the landscape. The brightest of the boulders, just to the upper right of a deeply shadowed crater in the foreground, marked the landing area. A cluster of artificial structures was visible nearby, and several spaceships were parked in an informal array. A dome covered the buildings, and reflected the sun in a burst of brightness. Mark had a quick memory of dewdrops in the garden of his home on Earth when he was a child. He recalled thinking that each dewdrop held a small sun.In moments the Starmen were sitting in George St. George's study. He was a man in his middle-fifties, of average height and weight, with a full head of wavy blond hair. It was obvious that he cut his own hair, but long practice had made him skilled at it. Though his eyes were ice-blue, he exuded warmth. He had a ready smile. The Starmen were sitting in a makeshift room under a temporary atmosphere dome on an isolated asteroid, but St. George's courtliness and genuine respect for his visitors made them feel as if they were in a manor house. On his desk lay a thick book with the title Commentary on the Letter to the Romans, and several sheets of paper and a pen were set beside it where he had obviously been doing some study."I hope you men won't mind waiting for refreshments. It's almost dinnertime and the crew will be coming up for a meal in about half an hour. Of course, you'll join us, won't you?""Thank you Mr. St. George," responded Zip. "We'd be pleased to meet your men and see your operation.""Monty tells me you three are real ripstavers, and he doesn't say that very often about anybody. You must have impressed him!" St. George was full of smiles."May we sit down, Mr. St. George? Our business is rather urgent!" Zip continued."Of course, of course. Please forgive me! We don't get visitors of any kind out here and I'm just not used to entertaining. Please forgive me!" St. George rushed busily setting out chairs, bringing in two from a room next door. "And please call me George."Once they were settled, Zip began to tell George about the pirates and Zimbardo's likely determination to find and eliminate the one man who knew where the pirates' asteroid could be found. Before he got too far into the story, George lifted a hand and smiled. "Yes, yes, I know," he said. "Monty told me all about it." The Starmen leaped out of their chairs, absolutely stunned. Before they had left Montezuma's Castle Zip had impressed upon Vly how vital it was for St. George's safety that they not communicate until his friend was safe. Zip had begged him to send just a quick, encrypted message that Z25 was to expect three visitors who had Vly's seal of approval-no more."George!" gasped Joe. "That message could have been intercepted by the pirates! They must be looking for you!""We told Vly not to communicate with you! It could mean your life!" continued Mark, suddenly heartsick with anxiety.George chuckled. "Don't worry, Starmen! The pirates already tried to find me through Monty, but the greegles protected him, and the pirates'll never find me without cooperation from Monty-which they'll never get. There's really no need to worry. We're completely safe here. We'll have dinner, you'll stay here to sleep, I'll show you around the operation, and you can go back to Ceres."The Starmen were speechless for a moment. Joe's eyes nervously scanned the room and Mark stared at George with his mouth agape. Then Zip spoke."What are greegles, George?"George chuckled again. "You haven't heard of this 'asteroid miner's legend'? Most people think it's in a class with leprechauns and mermaids, the story of the greegles, but it's all true. The greegles are the inhabitants of the asteroids. Don't know if they're alive or not. They're made of metal-some kind of metal-or maybe they just wear a metal suit. They're about a foot high. Now, don't stare at me like that; you're looking thoroughly obflisticated, probably thinking I've been out in the vacuum too long, but I've seen them! They're little and they're old, very old, but they're powerful! No one can beat them! Usually no one ever sees them and they don't have any need to interfere with human beings. They don't mind it too much, though, if a solitary asteroid miner sees them once in a while.""And wh-, what do they have to do with Montezuma?" asked Zip, keeping his voice steady."Why, a short time after you left the Castle, about five ships tried to land on the Castle by force-pirates, for sure. No doubt they wanted to force Monty to tell 'em where I am. But Monty knows how to contact the greegles. There's a lot of greegles on Adamant." George chuckled again."Those poor fellows-the pirates, that is! When the pirates told Monty they were going to land whether he wanted them to or not, why, he just called the greegles for help. They cut four of the ships into pieces in a matter of seconds, leaving the crew floating in their spacesuits. Then they grabbed them with some sort of invisible grappling beam or something and herded them toward the fifth ship. That ship gathered them in and took off."Now George laughed out loud. "They got the message real fast! Go away and don't come back! And they scrammed! Never even set foot on Montezuma's Castle. Monty will make good use of the floating space junk the pirates left. Serves 'em right!"Just then a gentle buzz sounded. "That's the call for dinner, friends. Come meet the others!"Almost immediately another sound came through the communications system-an urgent clangor. St. George's face became taut and a look of surprise and anxiety came over his features."What's that?" asked Zip."It's the alarm," St. George whispered. "It's never sounded before." The alarm abruptly shut off and an excited, panic-stricken voice came through the intercom."Five ships approaching! Coming in fast! They're commanding all hands to come to the landing field and threatening to destroy the whole operation if we don't cooperate! They've already started to destroy the base!"5: The Destruction of Z25JOE dashed from the room and sped down the hallway to the control center of the mining base. Each strike of a laser beam colored the interior of the buildings with ruby red as the attackers' targets were vaporized, and the flashes were coming with disturbing frequency. He hurled himself into the tiny office where a frantic young man sat at a console."We're going to die!" cried the young man. Joe looked through the large window and saw five ships hovering over the base. Their laser cannons were rapidly destroying the outlying parts of the mining base. There were no defensive weapons. Joe glanced at the radar screen and his hair stood up as he saw that the screen showed nothing. To the surveillance system, the ships were invisible. The technician was babbling in abject, helpless fear, but Joe's pulse leaped when he realized that the frightened young man might be right. They could all be dead at any moment. The man fled the room crying.Joe looked out the window again and saw that laser cannons had begun to destroy the ships. Through the horrifying, rapidly expanding concentric vapor shells, he saw the Vigilant Warrior crumpling into a heap. The other ships were either completely destroyed or well on the way."What is this? Who are they?" exclaimed Mark. He, Zip, and George had followed Joe to the control center and were watching the laser beams sweep the landing field. The ships were being indiscriminately reduced to molten slag."Their laser beams are immensely powerful, and they're operating at full capacity," observed Zip, grimly. Just then the lights went out and every apparatus in the control center went dark."They found and destroyed the power plant," whispered George, the tenseness evident in his voice. "But they're not touching the inhabited parts of the base."Suddenly Zip turned to their host. "George!" he said urgently. "Do any of your crew know that we are Starmen?" George turned a distracted face to Zip and stared as if he wasn't comprehending what Zip had said."Do any of your crew know that we are Starmen?" Zip repeated carefully."I-I don't know. I didn't tell anybody, I think, but I didn't keep it a secret.""Look! Gather them all together and tell them not to say anything about us to these invaders! Our safety may depend on it, as well as any chance we all have of eventually escaping!""Ah-all right," George stammered.Since the power was out, there was no way to make an announcement through the communication system, but the rest of the crew was assembling anyway. The refectory was located not far from the control center and the men were coming together there, so the Starmen and George went to join them.In a moment, there were about a dozen men in the room. Some sat on the benches, others stood. There was palpable fear in the room, as if they knew that sudden, violent death was near.Zip asked George, "Is this everyone?" George took a quick glance around the room."I, I think so, yes."Zip took charge. "Men, listen to me. We're about to be taken captive. I don't think anything worse will happen to us, or it would have happened by now. My friends and I have come to visit Sabbath George. Just got here from Ceres and sure didn't expect this!"George took over. He was showing more confidence now. Alone of the Z25 crew, he had never shown fear, just shock. "We'll just wait right here, men, and see what's next. I don't know who these attackers are or what they want, but don't volunteer any information of any kind. You hear me? No information of any kind, beyond the most basic."The men were silent and collapsed in on themselves. They were afraid, but the panic seemed to have diminished somewhat. Outside, the five ships had landed and about twenty space-suited men had emerged. With weapons in hand, they were approaching the dome. The leader gestured to several of them, who spread out around the dome. The others remained at the main airlock and waited. Their feet were spread in an attitude of defiant power."They want the airlock open, Mr. St. George," said the young man who had fled from the control center. His voice was dry and squeaky.George said, "Can't open it. No controls. Those fools destroyed the power center. If they're coming in, you'll have to get your spacesuits on because the atmosphere is going to disappear. Make it quick before they blow the airlock by force." The men scattered. George and the Starmen went to the airlock and looked at the invaders from the inside of the dome. George said to the Starmen, "Of course, there's a backup power system, but I don't feel a compelling need to make it any easier for these strangers."When the leader saw that there were people coming, he kicked the airlock savagely and aimed his weapon at the mechanism. As was customary, the helmets were lined up on a rack on shelves just inside the airlock. George put on his helmet and the Starmen put on theirs. The rest of the mining crew began to show up with their suits on and found their helmets. When all were suited up and the intercoms were on, George told the mining crew to stand aside. Then he told the leader of the invaders that he could enter.The man fired a stupendously powerful beam at the airlock that melted it like ice in a furnace. In seconds, the air inside the dome whooshed out into the vacuum of space."Get into the ship," growled the leader of the invaders, indicating the closest of the five spaceships. "No one is going to be hurt, but I'm not guaranteeing that that situation will last. I'm not a patient man and I don't like wasting time.""What about our belongings?" asked George."You won't need them. Move to the ship. Now." The voice was even and quiet but as hard as iron. Zip started the procession. He slumped down as if completely disheartened and walked like a prisoner, his eyes pointed to the ground. The others followed. The invaders kept them surrounded as they walked the short distance to the pilot ship. Several invaders entered first and then kept watch on the prisoners as they ascended the ladder into the staging area. Once the asteroid miners were aboard, the other invaders entered their ships.When the door was sealed, the invaders removed their helmets. The miners followed suit. The leader took a quick inventory of the prisoners, and then settled his gaze on George."You are George St. George," he said in a tone that knew he was stating a fact. "My name is Lather. You and your men are now prisoners of Lurton Zimbardo. I am taking you to him. As long as I've got you, I don't care about anything or anyone else. Don't make any trouble and I won't see any need to put anyone off the ship. It doesn't make any difference to me whether any of your men is in deep space or my guest room, but it might make a difference to you-and them."Without turning his head, Lather addressed one of his crew. "Blaze, see that this base is melted into the bedrock.""Yes sir," said the man addressed and left the room.Lather addressed another of his crew. "Spelford, escort the prisoners to their quarters."Spelford lifted his weapon and nodded in the direction they were to go. The prisoners went, under the guard of several armed men.They were taken to a room set up to accommodate up to twenty passengers. There were niches with beds in them, and couches for use during acceleration."Prepare for lift-off," ordered Spelford. The prisoners sat down and strapped themselves in. Spelford and his men left, locking the door behind them. In a moment the warning signal for lift-off was given. The ship raised itself gently from the surface of the asteroid. The fierce glare of destructive laser strikes came through the quartz window for nearly a minute, and the prisoners knew that the living quarters of Z25 were being systematically destroyed."They're ramsquaddling the whole operation," said Sabbath George in a voice that sounded almost matter-of-fact. "Never had anything like this happen before. This is a first."When the glow ceased, the ships accelerated. The Starmen and their companions felt themselves pressed into the chairs.The five invisible ships had been gone for over an hour, but the man in the shadow still did not move. He was on a neighboring chunk of floating iron, just a mile or two in diameter with a very slow rotation. St. George's asteroid would vanish below his horizon in a few minutes. The man pulled the telescope up to his face plate once again and scanned the area that had been the base on Z25. There had been no movement of any kind since the ships had rayed the site. He took a few more pictures for his files. The metal and quartz plating-all signs of human presence-had been completely destroyed, melted into the rock of the asteroid. The brilliant orange of superheated rock had quickly cooled in the near-absolute zero of airless space."Guess it's okay to go now," he thought. "Those space buzzards are not detail men-just grab and destroy without even looking around. Lucky for me."The man went over to a small asteroid cruiser, built for speed in touring the Asteroid Belt. Stepping in, he sealed the airlock and pulled out a small recorder. He tuned in a complicated code and began to speak."Steve Cliff, reporting in to Oritz Konig on Mars Base." Steve went on to give the date, time, and location, and a brief but thorough report of what he had seen, from the time the Starmen landed on Z25 to the time the pirates' five ships had disappeared. He added to the file the pictures he had taken, and concluded, "Now returning to Yellow City. If you have anything else you'd like me to do, Oritz, contact me there. I don't have to tell you I'm pretty fond o' those boys and I was more'n delighted to keep an eye on 'em for you on this trip. Sorry this report isn't any better. I'll stop in and see Sim before I continue my trip back to Earth, just in case you leave a message for me there."Having finished the recording, he put it into a small projectile with an automatic timer to release and send the message in three hours. Then he lifted off the small asteroid and headed toward Ceres. A few minutes after liftoff, he fired the projectile. When it sent its message, Steve Cliff would be far away and no one could trace the message back to his ship. On top of that, the message was encrypted and designed to travel on the microwaves similar to those in the background of space. It was highly unlikely that this message would make anyone curious. After the message had been sent, the projectile would break down into its component parts and scatter them into the infinity of space.The ships had stopped accelerating and the prisoners could talk easily."You don't seem too upset, George," suggested Mark."Naw," said George. "'Course I'm sorry to lose my stuff back there, and I'm sorry for the men, but most of our stuff is somewhere else. This was a temporary base and the mine wasn't producing too well anyway. Hardly worth our time. Besides, I've learned to be content just about wherever I am. I've been around the asteroids a lot and I've learned to depend on a Resource outside myself whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be brought low, and I know what it is to have plenty. I've been thoroughly initiated into the human lot with all its ups and downs-fullness and hunger, plenty and want. Makes little difference to me. Wherever I am, whatever happens, I'm confident. And I'm a man of prayer.""I'm sure sorry about your friend Montezuma," said Zip sympathetically."What do you mean?""Why, these ships must be the same five that attacked him. They couldn't have found you without getting the information from Vly. So it's a good guess that they destroyed his base the way they did yours.""Nothing of the sort!" said St. George heatedly. "I told you that those ships were defeated and their crew sent back to wherever they came from with their tail between their legs!""But this story about the 'greegles'-" contributed Joe."The greegles sliced those ships up like salami!" insisted St. George. "These ships we're on are a different lot! And besides, Monty would never have told anybody how to find me-not by force or threat, anyway!""We're sorry, George," apologized Zip. "I didn't mean to upset you or cast any doubt on Montezuma Vly. You're right-he's not the type to give in to any threat. I must be mistaken.""You're forgiven," said St. George. He went off to see how his men were doing."Zip!" whispered Joe urgently. "You don't really believe that story about the 'greegles.' These have to be the same ships!""I think it's more important not to upset George. We don't know the whole story.""But greegles!""What about the greegles?" asked Mark, with a slight edge of defensiveness in his tone. "Did it seem to either of you that Vly would betray a friend to save himself? And did you see any sign of advanced weaponry at Montezuma's Castle?""What are you saying, Mark?" asked Joe."I'm saying that we shouldn't discount an old tale just because it sounds foolish or superstitious. George knew we were coming. He couldn't have known unless Montezuma sent him a message, even though we warned him against doing so. If he sent George a message, he wasn't taken over by the pirates. These aren't the same ships. These are another part of Zimbardo's fleet sent out to find George St. George. They must have tracked him down through the message Vly sent-not because they landed on the Castle and threatened him."Zip looked deeply thoughtful. Joe looked incredulous."Mark, you can't be serious!""It's not a matter of being serious or not, Joe; it's a matter of being open-minded.""George described it himself! He's been out in the vacuum too long.""I don't think George strikes me as an unbalanced man. Unusual, for sure. But not unbalanced. Not unbalanced at all." Mark looked over his shoulder. George had his arms around two of his men and was talking to them in a low voice. The rest of them were gathered around, paying close attention to what he was saying. Already the atmosphere was one of peace. No one seemed afraid now.Through the window beyond, a portion of the vast arm of the Milky Way spread out in its eternal beauty. The Starmen were silently wondering the same things: How long would it be before they met Lurton Zimbardo? Would he recognize them? Why did he want St. George alive?6: Battle LinesTHE PIRATES' ASTEROID swung in a smooth, private orbit about a thousand miles beyond the farthest extremity of the Asteroid Belt. Lurton Zimbardo was in his private sanctum, a well-equipped workroom with precision astronomical equipment, sky charts, and an enormous inventory of computer files. As he turned his telescanner toward the Inner Planets, he saw the spread of the Belt before him.Countless celestial bodies moved in an incredibly slow pattern like a stately dance. Reflected sunlight glinted from oblique surfaces into the light-gathering lenses of the telescanner. When the occasional crystalline surface or frozen lake on a passing asteroid caught the radiance just right, an intense but transitory sparkling brilliance was generated, and created a pattern of astonishing beauty on the scanner's computer screen.Zimbardo entered a few more bits of data into the criteria of his search pattern and then said, "Enter." Within seconds several asteroids were marked in his files. He brought their profiles up one by one.M253.SHAPE: OBLONG.MAXIMUM LENGTH: 0.683 MILES.MAXIMUM WIDTH: 0.307 MILES.COMPOSITION: 90.568% IRON, 6.443% TIN, 0.752%ICE, 2.237% TRACE ELEMENTS; CLICK HERE FOR DETAILS.Other information was provided, including the asteroid's precise location and its speed of motion and rotation. Zimbardo hesitated a moment, then said, "Delete." He went on to the next entry.M3366.SHAPE: ALMOST PERFECT SPHERE; VARIATION <5%.MEAN DIAMETER, 0.057 MILES.The other information was provided. Zimbardo smiled. "Ah-nearly solid iron and about 100 yards exactly!" he thought to himself. "That makes five." He told the computer to save that file, then opened the intercom."Gene," he said."Yes sir," came the immediate response."Contact Mr. Crass and tell him I want M3366.""Right away, sir." "Then call the five lieutenants up to my study at once, please. Get Kimball, Lorry, and Jenner also. Once you've called them, come up yourself." Gene nodded and activated the personal contact codes of the men Zimbardo wanted to see.A quarter of an hour later, the ten men were in the lounge in Zimbardo's quarters. He was playing host, and pouring out a dark golden sherry wine into luxurious spun glass goblets.One of the men lifted up the goblet so the illumination reflected from it, highlighting subtle rainbow whorls in the surface. He swirled his wine before he sipped it."Very nice, Lurton, and the glass here is pretty top stuff.""The wine came from Earth but the glassware came with the asteroid, Jeff. This place has so much in it that I haven't found a hundredth of what it contains, but all of it is high quality."The men relaxed in the comfortable chairs. The chairs automatically adjusted to the body weight and shape of whoever sat in them. Soft, almost imperceptible music was playing in the background. A light fragrance in the air eased tensions and sharpened minds for thought. Zimbardo had nothing to do with creating this atmosphere-these features came on automatically whenever anyone entered the room."Petty soft life you got here, Zimbardo," sighed the man named Lorry, easing himself down into his chair. "I'm not used to this kind of comfort.""No, Lorry, I guess not. You don't find too many easy chairs aboard the kind of ships you pilot when you're transporting the Banjoman's flilox to his customers in the Belt. But when our plan succeeds, you'll be able to buy all the soft chairs you want. Let's get down to business."Zimbardo stood before the assembled company. Behind him, taking up most of the wall, was a map of a large portion of Mars. "As I was saying when we met in the hangar assembly room yesterday, it is simply a matter of choosing an appropriate target to convince them we have the capability. What should our target be? Well here, gentlemen, are the five major atmospheric generation plants on Mars." He turned to the map and pointed out five places-two in the northern hemisphere, two near the equator, and one in the southern hemisphere. "Each is valued at two billion solars and would take several years to replace. The damage won't bankrupt the government, but the expense is far from negligible! Even more importantly, when they are destroyed, Starlight Enterprise's terraformation project will suffer a severe setback-possibly as much as three to four years. Now, data gathered from analysis has shown that these plants can be removed very easily by the proposal we have suggested. Mr. Crass, do you have anything to add?""No, Mr. Zimbardo. I've checked the specs on the asteroids you've selected and I've checked progress with what Stubb is doing. If he has the propulsion units ready in ten days, we can deliver our first package to Mars in precisely two weeks."A muscular man in short sleeves spoke up. Since no one else wore short sleeves, everyone suspected that he wore his sleeves short to show off his biceps. "Lurton-what about the ships that went to interrogate Vly? We know five took off, and yesterday I only saw one return. No one else wants to ask about it, but I'm asking. If I'm going to risk my men and my ships on this venture of yours, I want to know what's involved."As the man was speaking, Gene lowered his head and kept his eyes on the floor."All right, Captain Kimball. It's a fair question. You're right. Five went out and only one returned. None of the men was lost-the returning ship brought them all back. But four of the ships were destroyed before they could land on Montezuma's Castle." Zimbardo's five lieutenants were already aware of the setback. The visitors, Jeff Jenner and Lorry, were stunned. Kimball grunted, as if a suspicion had been confirmed."Well?" he pressed, his face hard and demanding."Gene," said Zimbardo, turning away. He didn't like to deliver news of defeat."The pilots of the ships tell essentially the same story," began Gene. "They came directly to Montezuma's asteroid, opened communications, and insisted that they were going to land. There was no response. But within seconds some kind of energy beam came forth from Adamant, the neighboring asteroid, and sliced the four ships into small sections. It was clear that there was no intention to kill any personnel-only to destroy the ships. The crews were left floating in space. Forces of some kind we are not familiar with pulled them into the proximity of the remaining ship, where they were taken aboard. Clearly, against forces like that we are helpless. The ship returned immediately. The men are badly shaken."Kimball grunted again. "And Vly?"Zimbardo answered. "They never talked to him. But we don't need him. A short time after this incident he radioed to St. George and we intercepted the beam. We'd been looking for it. Vly probably assumed that with the destruction of our landing party he was safe and so was St. George. But his call went directly to asteroid Z25. It was encrypted so we couldn't read it, but we didn't have to know what the message was to know where it went. Our other five ships were two days away from the location. They went directly there and picked up all the miners, including St. George, in a very neat operation."The intercom buzzed. "Mr. Zimbardo?""Yes, what is it?" he responded with obvious irritation."Sorry to bother you, sir, but you asked to be informed as soon as the ships returned. The Silver Cloud and its four companion ships are expected to dock in approximately 45 minutes.""Very good!" Zimbardo's initial irritation was instantly dispelled. "Tell Mr. Lather to put the prisoners into the cell block. I will deal with them later." The intercom went off and Zimbardo turned back to the gathering. "As you heard, St. George will be on the asteroid within the hour."There were nods around the table. Many questions were asked about the destruction of the four ships near Montezuma's Castle, but there were no answers. The issue was left unresolved; Zimbardo, however, was not saying everything he suspected. He was frightened, but determined that no one would know it. He had heard of the legend of the greegles and took it more seriously than anyone would ever suspect.Richard Starlight's spacious office was located near the top of the highest tower on the Moon, the giant SE headquarters building located forty miles north of Amundsen City. Accessible only by two express elevators, his office covered nearly an entire floor of the tower-more than 3,000 square feet. Its walls were treated glass, harder than any metal alloy and impervious to the constant rain of micro-meteorites, with clarity which was nearly perfect. The office was the equivalent of 121 stories above ground level, and only an observation deck and various antennae were above it. The lunar landscape was visible for miles in every direction. The pass which marked the entrance to the Field of Obsolescence was barely visible ten miles away just a little east of north.What he called his "office" was really a combination laboratory, resource library, work and communications center, and lounge. In one corner was a huge table, made of artificial material but, apart from chemical analysis, not distinguishable from highly polished mahogany. Its chairs matched its reflective sheen. Table and chairs rested on an intricately patterned carpet that measured at least twenty by twenty-five feet. Patterns in cerulean blue, silver, and gray, with flecks of green and violet beautifully complemented the lunar gray visible through the windows. Not far from the table was an immense, detailed globe of the Earth, about four feet in diameter and perfectly balanced. Equally detailed globes of the Moon and Mars on the same scale were nearby. In another corner were globes of Mercury and Venus and a few other celestial bodies."I'm sorry to put an end to the festivities this way, gentlemen," said Richard Starlight to the assembly. Around the table were the President of the United States and three of his advisors, among whom were Commander John Lewis of Space Command. Richard's second-in-command, John "Rock" Rwakatare, head engineer of the Advanced Design Department of SE was also present, as were Allen Foster, Keith Seaton, and Charlie Taylor, the fathers of the three Starmen. Robert Nolan, founder of Nolan Mining Enterprises and a friend and colleague of Richard Starlight, and his second-in-command Beowulf Denn filled out the number.On two viewscreens were stationary images of Oritz Konig on Mars, and Steve Cliff en route to the Moon from the Asteroid Belt. The time delay for Konig was a little more than fifteen minutes, and for Cliff was about 22 minutes, so they could not actively participate in the discussion. Both, however, had vital reports to make and Richard was prepared to present them by videotape at the right time.Richard continued. "We all expected that our three Starmen would be back with us in two days for the Reception of Honor. That will have to be postponed. Most of you know at least something of the reason why, but this urgent meeting was called to make sure that everyone is brought up to date and, more importantly, to take counsel on a course of action."Richard summed up what had been learned about the pirates after the liberation of Mars up to the point of the Starmen's departure from Oritz Konig's office."Our conclusion is that, although we have 542 men in custody in Eagle City, including their captain Troy Putnam, several dozen pirates are still free. It would have taken a large facility to prepare the ships and house the men used in the assault on Mars, and it is virtually certain that a sufficient force for maintaining this operation was left at their base. We believe that this was probably a minimal number, but there may have been pirates in other locations in the Asteroid Belt or elsewhere. Moreover, as you know, one ship managed to escape from Mars during the liberation. Oritz Konig, now on special assignment at Mars Base, will make a report on what we've learned about Putnam's chief assistant, Lurton Zimbardo."By pre-recorded videotape, SE's Chief of Security presented a brief report, similar to that which he had given to the Starmen.At its conclusion, Richard continued. "Since the ship that escaped headed recklessly at its highest velocity toward a certain area of the Belt, we can reasonably assume that the pirates' base is situated on an asteroid not far from that area."Nolan asked, "Why were the ships from Space Command not able to find this asteroid, or any trace of the pirates?" Robert Nolan was a man of early middle age, slight of build, with thinning hair. He was noted for his analytical mind and incisive decisions. His hard work over a twenty-year span had built a small company into an influential corporation, and his achievements had brought him respect throughout the Inner Planetary system."This is what we are gathered here to reveal," Richard answered. "I'm afraid the news is quite disturbing. Steve Cliff will give us his report."By videotape, Steve Cliff reported what he had seen in the area of Z25. He concluded, "So it is obvious that the pirates have a very effective radar bender. Their ships are, in effect, invisible to our standard radar detection systems." When Steve's report was over, Richard added, "Steve Cliff was immensely helpful when we sent the two Starmen to Mars. He did us another favor by following them as far as Z25 when he preferred to return to Earth. He is on his way back to Earth now. Oritz asked him to keep an eye on the Starmen for their own safety, and as you can tell from his report it was a very good thing indeed that he did!"The men at the table looked grim. The fathers of the Starmen wore especially troubled expressions."Our battle with the pirates is not yet over, I'm afraid," continued Richard Starlight. "Their radar bender is nearly perfect. The notion of developing a technique that makes an object invisible to radar is not new, of course, but in spite of several decades of effort even Starlight Enterprise has not been able to achieve the high level of effectiveness Zimbardo's men have available to them. From these observations we draw two disquieting conclusions."First, we learned from the pirates we captured on Mars that their base is probably invisible to radar; it can't be seen with normal methods. It's likely that the pirates have outfitted all their ships with the device that makes objects invisible to radar, not just the five Steve Cliff observed. If so, their ships can be anywhere without the possibility of any of our bases or centers of civilization being aware of them until they become visible to the eye. Since all our computers track ships and contribute toward strategic battle decisions based on radar data, it is almost impossible to guard against such pirate raids as Zimbardo's men are now able to carry out-and have already done on Z25." Richard sighed."Second, and most alarming of all, it is almost impossible for the pirates to have invented the radar bender on their own. We had surmised this shortly after our first conversations with the captive pirates on Mars, but since then our computer has estimated the chance that they did so to be approximately 0.0001%. That kind of technology is beyond any earthly scientific capability. It is much more likely that they got it from some alien civilization-a highly advanced alien civilization."We don't have any solid information other than that, so we can only guess what level of connection there may be between any such hypothetical civilization and the pirates. At any rate, where the radar bender came from, other devices might come too-military devices against which Earth has no defense. And we have no idea when we will learn the pirates' next move, and we don't know where the Starmen are now."The room was silent. Everyone was stunned. When Mars was liberated they had thought that the conflict was at an end. Now they saw that their situation was more desperate than they thought possible.After a moment, Robert Nolan spoke up. His eyes were wide and his voice was high-pitched. "Wh-, what can we do? Can't we find these pirates? Can't we just send out ships and comb the entire area of the Belt where they disappeared? Can't we...?"Keith Seaton broke in. "Robert, believe me, if there were anything we could do, anything we could think of that wouldn't be the equivalent of running around in circles, we'd be doing it! The Starmen are our sons! Richard informed us last night that they were captured, and we've done just about nothing else but try to think of something we can do."Allen Foster joined in. His voice was level and determined, clearly being controlled with supreme effort. "It is impossible to do a random search of the Asteroid Belt-even if we restrict our search to the section where the hidden base must lie. We've done the math. We may as well be looking for a black marble hidden at night anywhere in North America.""And invisible ships!" Nolan gasped. "The Solar System has no defense against anything like that. Why, they could come in anywhere and invade! They'd be invincible! We couldn't even see what hit us!"Commander Lewis spoke up. "And an alien civilization! They could have science beyond what we can imagine. Earth doesn't stand a chance against an enemy like that!" The men were scared.After a moment when no one else addressed the gathering, the President spoke. "Our position is essentially the same as it was when Mars was still in the control of the pirates. Our strength does not lie in superior science or in superior numbers. Troy Putnam recently placed his trust in superior strength and technology; the unsoundness of such a hope is shown by his fall. David fought Goliath and won because his trust was in the right place. Zimbardo might have weapons and other technology of which we cannot even conceive and he might do great damage, but he is still in the wrong. Evil might have its day, but in the end it will always fall; the forces of light will overcome it as it decays from within. With that faith and that assurance, we can make our plans. Does anyone have a suggestion as to how we can meet this crisis?"Allen Foster spoke again. "There are two issues here: finding and rescuing the Starmen and their companions, and defending our civilization from the pirates. For the first, well, we're very hopeful that they are still alive because they were taken aboard the pirates' ship before the base on Z25 was destroyed. They are resourceful young men-they are Starmen, after all."For the second, any solution I'm afraid will be long-term. We'll have to develop a detector that uses a process other than radar-perhaps something based on gravity or light absorption. But you can appreciate the obvious fact, I'm sure, that inventing such machinery will probably take a very long time. No, I think that our course now must be entirely defensive. We are, at least, forewarned. But I'm sure that the pirates will be making the next move before we can do anything about it." 7: Prisoners on the Pirates' Asteroid"WHAT'S the word for 'walk'?" asked Mark."Gentrikian," answered Zip automatically."That makes forty-seven points for you," said Joe. "I need fifteen more just to catch up. C'mon Mark, give me an easy one-help me out.""Okay. Do you want English to Titanian or Titanian to English?""Titanian to English. That's easier.""K'intrishian." Joe thought for a moment. Languages seemed to come easily to Mark-he could absorb concepts and find mental hooks to hang them on with no noticeable effort at all. Joe found languages far more difficult. He preferred engine diagrams and flow charts."I don't know!" The lean pilot blasted, exasperated. The Starmen, like the crew from Z25, were passing time as they entered the third day of their captivity aboard the Silver Cloud. Mark was teaching Zip and Joe some of the Titanian vocabulary he'd been working on for two years."This one should be easy for you, Joe, even if it isn't 'sleep' or 'eat.' The answer is just about all we've been able to do on this trip so far.""Well, sleeping and eating is all we've done!""'K'intrishian' means 'wait.'"Joe grinned. "We've certainly been doing a lot of that on this outing! The past couple of weeks have seemed about pointless! Just about all we've been doing is bouncing from place to place! We blasted off from Eagle City to the Asteroid Belt and then went right back to Mars. Then back to Ceres in the Asteroid Belt. Then to Montezuma's Castle and on to Z25, and we complete our mission just in time to get captured by the enemy! Now we're being taken to this 'secret asteroid' where Lurton Zimbardo has his base and I'll bet anything we're going right back to where we started-where we lost track of that ship we were chasing into the Belt!"An announcement came through the intercom. "Prepare for deceleration in two minutes."The Starmen looked at one another, then at the crew of Z25. St. George was already walking toward his acceleration couch. Each of them could feel his heart suddenly beating a little faster. They strapped themselves into their couches. Zip looked out of the window but saw nothing out of the ordinary.A moment later, the rockets on the Silver Cloud ignited and the ship began to slow. About half an hour later, the had slowed to a crawl and the view of the stars disappeared. It became apparent to the prisoners that they had entered a tunnel. After a few seconds, the ship touched down and secured itself to the landing pad. The prisoners waited. No one spoke.Minutes passed, then the door to their quarters opened. Spelford stood in the opening, with several other men behind him. All were armed."Time to go," Spelford announced. The prisoners were escorted single file through the ship and down the access ladder to the floor of the landing pad. They were under observation at all times by armed men in front of them and behind.Joe reached the bottom of the ladder and turned to look around. To his right was an enormous clear wall which sealed off the landing area from the immense tunnel through which the ships had come. In front of him and to his left was a complex of charcoal-dark structures, lined with silver trim and glinting with many panels of glass. The entire area was powerfully lit by dozens of sources hundreds of feet above him. He was both impressed and intimidated at the same time.As soon as the prisoners had debarked from the Silver Cloud, Spelford began giving orders."Move. This way. Stay in single file."The line crossed the field and passed through a second airlock. Leaving the field behind, they entered a large manufacturing area. Several dozen men were working feverishly at massive tables and work centers. Sparks from welding areas were visible in the back parts of the area. Flashing lights from many desks lit up the faces of men with intent gazes, whose attention was fixed on close work on numerous small circuit boards. A few workers glanced curiously at the line of prisoners, but they didn't waste time on a thorough investigation of the newcomers.Spelford and his detail escorted the prisoners through an immense double door, down a wide passageway, and into a large elevator. The elevator could accommodate fifty men easily. When all were inside, Spelford tapped a number into the control pad and the elevator began to descend. It stopped in seconds and the door opened into an area where several corridors came together. Two small elevator doors flanked the one from which the men emerged. The procession entered a dimly-lit corridor that extended for about a hundred yards. Many doors were set into the walls, but none was open.Spelford led the way down the corridor. After covering about two-thirds of the distance, he stopped and slid open a plain, dark portal set into the right side of the passage. He glanced into the room beyond, then stepped back and said, "In here." The prisoners entered, and the door closed behind the last one.George St. George broke the silence. "We're not going to be able to absquatulate from these pirate yaps very easily, that's for sure. Guess we'll have to make the most of our stay here."Zip strode into the center of the room and looked around. Indirect lighting provided plenty of illumination. "Clearly a dormitory of some sort," he observed to no one in particular. Bunk-style beds were spaced around the walls. Through another door was a resting area with tables and chairs. In another room were washing facilities. On one side of the main room was a large window which overlooked the landing area and primary work center of the asteroid.Joe and Mark strode over to the window and looked out. "The rotation of the asteroid provides the equivalent of gravity," observed Joe. "About what we're used to on the Moon-about one-sixth Earth. What do you think, Mark?""Feels like a little less to me," answered Mark. "We'll have to step up our exercises if we're going to maintain muscle tone.""Nothing fancy, but everything we need," said one of St. George's men after a quick look around the rooms."For a long stay, maybe," said another."'K'intrishian' means 'wait,' if I remember correctly, Mark," said Joe."That's thirty-three points for you," responded the tall Starman.Time passed. From the window in the wall of the asteroid, the three Starmen looked down and saw a buzz of activity. About two dozen ships were docked on the field, and workers were still hovering around tables in the work center."Here comes another one," said Joe, as a spacecraft passed into view from the large tunnel that led to the outside."How many is that since we've been here?" asked Mark. "Six?""Yes, six in less than twenty-four hours," stated Zip.The Starmen chafed under the burden of their powerlessness. They had already scoured the rooms carefully and found no sign of weakness they could exploit. Their food was delivered through an automated shaft that they could find no way of using as an escape route. They had neither seen nor spoken to anyone since Spelford had brought them to their prison.Once again Zip looked out the window. "This place is amazing! This could not have been anticipated by anyone! It must have been quite a shock when you found this asteroid, George.""Oh yes, I was awestruck, completely, absolutely electrified! Imagine stepping into a remnant of an astounding civilization like this. When I found it, it was abandoned. It seemed as if no one had been in it for probably thousands of years.""Tell us everything you know about this place," ordered Zip, looking intently at the asteroid miner and drawing him over to the nearest table. Zip gently eased the miner into a chair, then turned another chair around and sat in it, folding his arms over its back and facing George. The asteroid miner told the Starmen the story of his discovery of the asteroid and how Troy Putnam had learned about it. They had already heard a brief version of the story from Oritz Konig back at Mars Base."Of course, I didn't know this Putnam was a bad egg at the time. He just seemed like a friendly, curious spaceman to me.""What about the asteroid?" pressed Joe. "What have you figured out about the race that built it?""As I said, the asteroid was abandoned when I ran across it, but whoever built it couldn't have been too different from us. Same body type, same size, that's obvious. Look around you-beds, chairs, everything, just the way we'd make them. Their language was quite different, though. Took me a long time to learn how to use some of their stuff.""How'd you learn your way around here?""When I first came upon the asteroid, the airlock was open. A huge orifice, made for spaceships, as you can tell. I came through and landed. Went through one of the airlocks into the building portion here, where we are now, and just explored. Trial and error. It's not too difficult to get the basics down-opening and closing doors, and all that. Then figuring out the right mix of atmosphere. I had plenty of time. I got access to the first four or five stories, but I'm pretty certain the place is much bigger than that. At first, I couldn't get any further than the first few stories, but after a while I found my way around a couple of deeper sections.""And then?""What do you mean, 'and then'? I got bored with it and moved on. I'm a miner, not an explorer or a settler or a scientist. There's nothing here but iron. I told a few people about it but nobody much believed me or cared until this Troy Putnam fellow I met in Yellow City. He's the only person who got excited about it, so when he asked me to bring him here, I did it, as I said. Why not? He paid my expenses for the trip, and a little more besides for my time. He was impressed with the place, as was I. Then I went looking for uranium and he went back to Ceres. Never saw him again."Zip pursed his lips, and his brow furrowed under his red hair-a common expression for the leader of the Starman team. "This has to explain why Zimbardo was looking for you," he said. "No one outside the pirates knows as much as you about his asteroid. That didn't seem to bother Troy Putnam, but Zimbardo must consider you a threat. But I can't understand why he has taken us prisoner. Zimbardo has no heart of mercy whatever. I would have expected him just to silence you for good. Obviously he is preparing this place for some new and big enterprise and is probably occupied, but now I think we'll be hearing from him before too long. Before that happens, I think we'd better be gone.""Escape? You talking about escape, Zip? From here?" asked Joe with amazement.Zip addressed St. George. "Tell us everything you know about how this asteroid works. Leave out no detail whatever. Everything you can remember. Joe and Mark, pay close attention! We have to come up with a plan!"A full day had passed since Richard Starlight had called the special meeting in his office in the towers of Starlight Enterprise. Now he sat silent and alone in one of the chairs around the great table. Suddenly he spun the chair around and stared through the clear wall in front of him. His gaze went far past the lunar mountains into the distant sky where Mars was just rising, a tiny red point.The President had issued his commands earlier that morning. A secret communication had been issued to the commanding officers of all the bases of Space Command. A similar message had been sent to the heads of large commercial enterprises such as Starlight Enterprise and Nolan Mining Enterprise, as well as the local authorities of population centers in the Asteroid Belt and on Mars. The communication had provided what information was known about the threat that the pirates manifested. It ordered Space Command and urged the private parties to keep the information secret so as to avoid panic and to prevent the pirates from learning that their sheathing apparatus had been observed in action, and advised all parties to prepare for any attack the pirates may launch. They were put on high alert for visual attack and to be ready for instant defensive response. In Amundsen City, Keith Seaton sat at his desk, scanning the Asteroid Belt with his telescope. His strong build filled the chair in which he sat. "There's Ceres," he said quietly as the image of the Belt's largest asteroid came up on the screen. Charlie Taylor and Allen Foster, who were sitting next to him, nodded. The fathers of the three Starmen weren't conversing much that night, but all were greatly comforted by each other's presence.On Ceres, Sim Sala Bim received the encrypted message on tight beam, and felt immense sadness come over him as he read it. "Where are those three young Starmen now?" he wondered.In the laboratories of Starlight Enterprise's main center on the Moon, scientists were working around the clock to devise a method by which their ships could track distant objects by sight instead of radar. Additionally, under a very rare Presidential command, technicians were working frantically under Earth's pre-eminent astrophysicist, Stephen Hoshino, trying to devise an advanced means of detecting a ship that was invisible to radar.The Inner Planetary system was waiting for a strike which its defenders knew would surely come-but not when, where, or how. 8: The Starmen Strike!ALMOST an hour had gone by since George St. George had begun to tell the three Starmen what he knew of the asteroid. Zip, Mark, and Joe had listened intently, plying the asteroid miner with detailed questions as he continued his narrative. At last, no one had anything else to say."No more questions?" Zip asked. Both Joe and Mark shook their heads. Their energy level had gone up appreciably since they had sat down with George. They had become spirited, now that they were determined to find a plan of escape."All right, then. It seems to me that this may be easier than we thought," stated Zip."You have an idea already?" asked Joe, with a slight turn of his head."It seems obvious that this asteroid was not intended to house prisoners. This room we're in is not a cell block-it's a dormitory.""Right," said Mark. "Therefore the locking mechanism is not original to the asteroid's design. Is that where you're going, Zip?"Zip smiled. "Keep going," he nodded."Whoever made this asteroid was far in advance of our science and it'll probably be a long time before we, or anyone else, learn how to alter their design. But the locking mechanism was most likely put in by the pirates, probably on short notice. It can't be too sophisticated a system. Again, since this is a dormitory and not a cell, the wiring is probably on this side of the door rather than in the hallway. Let's find where the pirates rewired the door. Whatever they can do, we can undo."The Starmen leaped up and began to investigate the door and the walls near it very carefully. Now that they had some idea of what they were looking for, they hoped it would be easier to find an access panel of some kind which their previous general search had missed. Minutes passed with no result. The walls had no apparent seams, and the door was set into the framework so closely that there seemed to be no space between the door and the edge of the wall into which it slid."Try the floor," suggested Joe. Mark dropped down and scanned the floor minutely. Joe moved farther to the right and Zip to the left of the door, their fingers moving gently over the surface looking for some kind of irregularity.St. George watched them with a mix of curiosity and amazement on his face. His men sat at the tables playing games, paying the Starmen little heed. Once in a while one looked up, then turned back to his game. Others napped on the sofas."Look here," said Mark. Zip and Joe came over to see what he had found. "What do you see?" he asked them, sitting back on his heels."Where?" asked Joe."You find it-see if I'm right," answered Mark.Joe pursed his lips and squinted. Zip watched carefully. George appeared almost impassive, but inside his heart was beating faster."I see it," observed Joe after a minute."What?" burst out St. George, then looked almost sheepish for showing his excitement."The light reflects off this patch here just a little differently from the rest of the floor. It's a perfect square about, oh, fifteen inches on a side.""Right," said Mark."How do we open it-if it's a panel, that is?" asked Joe. He pushed the corners, tried sliding the panel in every direction, bounced the square with his fingers, all with no result."Let me try," said Mark. He laid his hand gently on top. In a few seconds there was a click and the square lifted up an inch, supported by a small, spring-loaded shaft in the center. Mark lifted the panel off and revealed a recess filled with finely detailed circuit boards. Over and around them were a few dark wires that obviously did not belong to the original design.Joe snorted. "How did you do that?""Well, I thought that it had to be some sort of radiation that would open it. There were no obvious signs of physical fasteners like screws. So I figured it had to be magnetism, or light, or maybe heat. I thought body heat would be the easiest to try, so I laid my hand on it, concentrated, and made it warm, and it opened!""Good work, Mark, but let's not waste time! We're in a hurry now," urged Zip. "What do you see in there Joe?" By now George and several of his men had come over and were watching over the shoulders of the Starmen."Yeah, really simple circuit. I can disconnect it in a minute even without tools and we can be out the door." Joe reached in."Wait!" Zip grabbed Joe's wrist. "Is there any evidence that the circuit is tied into a larger system, like a master computer, that would tip anyone off that the door has been opened?"Joe peered into the aperture and carefully traced the wiring."Sorry, Zip. Sorry, everybody," he said, chagrined. "You're right. There is. But I can fix that too." He reached in and twisted two wires together. "Okay, that should bypass the door circuit and tell the master computer that the door is still closed. I can open the door now. Are you ready?"Zip stood up. "There are fourteen of us. We don't know where to go once we're free, so I'd like George to lead us. He's been through the asteroid. Take us somewhere, George, where we won't be found easily."George shook his head in a big arc. "Now Zip, I haven't been on this chunk for over fifteen years. I'm not real sure where to go!""George, no one else has been on the asteroid at all. There's no one but you."The asteroid miner looked down, dejected. "I don't like any of this. But you're right. Okay. We'll go out the door and back to the elevators. We'll take the one on the left. I'll take us to a floor one level down, then through a huge storeroom. On the other side are other corridors. I've been through there, and there are places to hide and more elevators to get us other places on the asteroid. After that I'm not sure. Maybe I'll remember when we get there.""Everyone got that?" said Zip. "Stay together and move quickly." No one had anything else to say. Zip turned to Joe."Let's go," decreed Zip. Joe removed one end of a black wire and touched it to another terminal. The door slid open.Outside was a scene that none of the Starmen had expected. Two pirates, dressed in their gray and black uniforms, were seated opposite one another at a small table on the far side of the corridor. The one on the right was a well-muscled, large man with dark hair, weighing well over 200 pounds; the other was blond, of medium build. He was leaning on his elbow, pondering his next move in a board game. When the door slid open, they both looked up, utter surprise written over their faces.Both the Starmen and the pirates froze for a split second, then both sides moved at once. Mark charged for the big man and Joe for the blond. Simultaneously the huge pirate bellowed and threw the table toward the charging Starmen, scattering the game pieces. Mark stopped the flying table without slowing his pace and slammed it hard back at the pirates, legs first. The blond man managed to evade the table, but the big pirate took two table legs on his left thigh and upper chest. He groaned, and the laser pistol he had been drawing was caught behind the table. Mark quickly threw the table upside-down to his left, reached with both hands for the pirate's right arm, and pulled the man quickly down and toward himself. His right knee came up and caught the man in the solar plexus. The pirate went down with a whoosh of air and lay still. Mark picked up his pistol.Meanwhile, the blond pirate had screamed for help in a panicky voice, turned, and was dashing down the corridor toward the elevators. Joe took hold of the table's leg nearest him and skated the table forcefully down the corridor after the escaping pirate. It caught the man behind his left ankle as he was running. In the low gravity, the pirate turned almost completely over, his pistol flying. Joe caught up with him and delivered a quick punch that rendered the man unconscious. The entire fight had taken less than ten seconds.Zip stepped into the corridor calmly. "Did either of them have a chance to set off an alarm?""I think this one did," responded Joe, pointing to the fallen pirate at his feet and picking up his laser pistol. "He had about five seconds while he was running to send an emergency call."Zip grimaced. "That was stupid. I should have thought that they would have a guard. I just didn't think of it, with all the electronic gadgetry around here and their obvious need of manpower. My fault. Sloppy thinking. But it's worse to stand here and feel badly about it. We've got to disappear fast.""This way!!" shouted George and began to run toward the elevator. The asteroid miner who had previously been so sedate and hesitant now led the way. The Starmen followed him and the ten others brought up the rear. George reached the elevator door and pressed the panel. In seconds a door opened and the men hurried in. Just as the last man rushed through the opening and the doors began to close, the elevator doors in the next shaft opened and a troop of pirates poured out, guns drawn. In front of them they saw their two comrades lying motionless in the corridor, table and chairs in full disarray."Come on!" commanded their leader, leaping forward and turning toward his men to enforce his order. His eyes opened wide as he saw the doors of the adjacent elevator closing on the escaped prisoners. The Starmen's last view of the scene was the pirate leader's shocked face, mouth agape, pulling his laser pistol up to fire. Then their doors sealed and they began to descend.Almost instantly, it seemed, the door opened. The only light came from the interior of the elevator. It shone on an uncountable number of enormous crates, stacked three high and set in rows extending beyond the range of the minimal light. Though the walls of the room could not be seen, there was a distinct feeling that the open space was huge-larger than a gymnasium, perhaps larger than a stadium. No one said a word. No one moved.Suddenly Zip grabbed the laser pistol that Joe was carrying and leaped out of the elevator. He whipped around and fired at the control panel next to the large central elevator. The panel flared red for a second and then sparked like fireworks. Zip released the activation trigger on the pistol and stepped back. A few pops echoed in the darkness against a background of the soft sizzling sound of molten metal dripping down the wall.Zip ran to the third elevator, calling out, "Move away from the elevator! Mark, destroy the controls!" Simultaneously Mark and Zip demolished the control panels of the remaining two elevators. When the controls were obliterated, the lights in the elevator went out and the fourteen erstwhile prisoners stood in the utter darkness of the immense chamber. The sole illumination was provided by the fading red glow of the superheated panels that had been their targets and a few bright orange dots in the gaping holes that remained."I don't know if that'll prevent the pirates from stopping at this floor, but every elevator on Earth I know about can't move beyond any floor where the controls are inoperable. George! Where do we go?" Zip asked."Does anyone have a light?" responded the asteroid miner. Just then a pale glow like early dawn rose around them and filled the chamber."What's that?" cried a frightened voice."Automatic lighting, probably," answered Joe. "When someone moves far enough away from the elevator, or when its light goes out, the automatic lighting goes on.""Follow me," directed George. He led the procession to the right of the elevator shafts. On one side was a blank wall at least 25 feet high. On the other were row upon row of crates. Each box had a mark on it, but none of the Starmen could recognize its meaning. Far down the rows was the opposite wall of the chamber, at least 200 yards away.George St. George was hurrying, leading the band of fourteen onward. There was no opportunity for conversation, but Mark stepped up close to Zip, who had taken the last position in the march."Think what this place is, Zip!" the mystically-oriented Starman breathed, his eyes alight with excitement. "This was made by an intelligent, extra-terrestrial race we've never heard of! The Titanians certainly didn't make it! And whoever made it was shaped just like us! As George said before, the controls, the beds, the chairs-all are designed for people like us! Same size! And imagine what must be in these storage units!""I have been thinking about it, Mark," answered Zip. "I'll want more time later to sift through my impressions, but there are too many questions here to deal with at the pace we're going.""Of course, but think! Who made this place? How big is the complex? When and why did they abandon it? Where are they now?""Yes-and above all, what else will we find in here?"Just then the screech of tortured metal sounded loudly throughout the chamber. Everyone turned and stared back at the elevators, where the sound was coming from. A spot on the left door of the central elevator began to glow red, then orange, then white. Iridescent metal began to spew forth in chunks. Then a spherical mechanism about the size of a basketball shot through the hole. A few bright green and yellow lights the size of small coins lit up its dull silver surface.Zip's blood ran cold. "It's an airbot!" he cried. Zip had never seen an airbot before, but he knew what it was: an aerial reconobot, an armed robotic flying device which, among other uses, could be programmed to track down fugitives, drawn by their body heat. Zip and Mark lifted their laser pistols and fired simultaneously. Their beams lit up red dots on the surface of the flying ball but scattered harmlessly, as the Starmen assumed they would. The airbot quickly oriented itself to the escapees and began to fly toward them.9: A Vision in the Night"RUN! Go! Scatter! Move!" shouted Zip frantically. He ran forward to the closest aisle between the stacks of crates, wheeled right, and sped down the narrow space. He heard the quiet, efficient "zzap" sound of the airbot's disabling beam, but apparently not directed toward him yet. Desperation powered his legs and they pumped at peak speed. He didn't know where the others were or what they were doing. Someone else was racing behind him but he didn't stop to find out who it was.It was not cowardice that inspired his flight, but the desire to preserve the team. Scattering and flying gave a slight hope that some of the men might escape the relentless search of the airbot-or at least put off the inevitable. The rotation of the asteroid provided artificial gravity, but it was low enough to enable the men to move quickly, covering a lot of distance as they ran."Zzap. Zzap," he heard again, more distant this time. He came to the end of the aisle and had to slow to keep from slamming into the wall in front of him. He reached out his left hand and grabbed the corner of a crate to help him execute the turn. As he made the quick right angle twist at the end of the row of crates, he glanced behind him with his peripheral vision. Joe was close behind him and several yards farther away were two of the miners. Even as he looked, he saw the airbot fly over the crates into the aisle he had just cleared, missing the ceiling by less than a foot. With the hated "zzap" sound, it fired one beam toward the miner at the rear of the headlong retreat, and the man went limp and collapsed. His momentum carried him forward several feet before he stopped moving.Zip saw it all in a split-second as his inertia carried him out of view. He looked forward again and sped down the aisle; after passing a few rows he turned again to the left. Far ahead of him he saw the elevator door with the bulging rupture through which the airbot had burst into the warehouse. Suddenly the airbot flew over the stack of crates to Zip's left and appeared about fifteen yards in front of him. A feeling of panicky horror surged through Zip as he saw the airbot re-orient itself in his direction.All at once every point of light on the airbot went out and it hung motionless in the air. Then it sped back to the elevator door as if jerked by a cable. It smashed through the hole it had made and flew into the shaft. Instantly there was a dull "whump," more felt in one's tissues than heard aloud. A bright light came through the opening like a spotlight, then faded."What happened to the airbot?" Joe's amazed voice behind him asked the question that was in Zip's mind."Let's go," said Zip. "Let's find out who's down and carry them away." Both the Starmen were breathing hard, but quickly returned to normal as they paced the aisles. In moments they had assembled those whom the airbot had not found. Only four men had been disabled by the airbot's beams."Take us out of here, George," ordered Zip. His voice was quiet but carried the authority of leadership that people welcome when there is a crisis. Using the fireman's carry, eight men easily transported the four who were unconscious. George St. George turned without a word and led the way. Everyone followed. St. George came to the end of the walkway and turned to the left around the last row of storage units. On his right was a bank of elevator doors, some large and some small. He came to the first one and with his hand shaking pressed some numbers into a control panel. Nothing happened.He looked up to Zip with a countenance marked with anguish and pleaded, "I can't do it. My fingers won't work. Mr. Foster, you press the numbers, please." Zip stepped up to the panel. As the asteroid miner called out the directions, Zip pressed the buttons."Top center. Right center. Top right. Top right again. Bottom left. Center. Sorry, I'm a little shaken up.""That's okay, George. I think we'll be fine now." The elevator door opened and all the men stepped into the conveyance. The door closed. George reached out and pressed one button. The elevator began to move-not down or up as the men expected, but away from the chamber where they had fought the airbot."What's wrong with these men?" asked one of the miners. "They're completely unconscious and their arms and legs are swinging around like they're puppets or something.""They're just out temporarily, not hurt," answered Joe. "Airbots disrupt certain neural connections to bring on sleep and complete relaxation of all muscle functions. I'm not sure how high the airbot's beam was set, but I'd guess pretty high. They'll probably sleep for several hours but they'll be fine when they wake up.""What did you do to that machine that was chasing us?" asked another of St. George's companions."I didn't do anything to it. I don't know what happened to it," answered Zip. "I suppose it malfunctioned. Lucky for us." Joe and Mark both glanced sidelong at Zip, then looked away. The Starmen knew that whatever had happened to the airbot, a malfunction was not one of the possibilities.Another of the miners spoke up. "I've never been on an elevator that moved horizontally before. Where are we going, George? This transit is taking longer than just moving between floors.""The elevators inside this rock can move in just about any direction except slantindicular. If I remembered accurately, this one'll take us to a control and information center of some kind. I don't know where it is in relation to where we started, but we should be safe there and if I don't forget where we come out, I can always get us back to the warehouse if we want to return."The elevator came to a stop and the door opened onto darkness. As before, the elevator light illumined a small space, in which the men could see a few counters. When the first passenger debarked, soft lights went on. The illumination revealed a room of about 2,000 square feet, filled with viewscreens, computer stations, cabinets and shelves, tables and chairs, and a few sofas. At least a dozen doors led from the room. The four unconscious men were laid carefully down onto the sofas."What is this place?" Zip asked St. George."Haven't any idea, Starman. I don't mind pushing buttons at random when it comes to elevators, but you won't find me playing with any machine I don't understand. I don't want to find the ejection seat or rocket launchers by accident.""What do you think, Mark, Joe? Let's look around here." The Starmen began to examine the keyboards and control systems spread throughout the room. There were symbols written beside most of the controls, but none of the writing was recognizable."Alien writing," observed Mark. "I'd sure like to know what it says."Joe was at the next console, thoughtfully pressing buttons, but there was no response."We need to find food and water," said one of the others."Right," said Zip. "Everyone check through the shelves and cabinets. Open the doors, too, and look through, but don't go anywhere." Zip didn't speak aloud what was on his mind. The workings of the asteroid, no matter how technologically advanced, had been abandoned for probably thousands of years. There could be no water or food anywhere except where the pirates were. The Starmen and miners may have escaped captivity, but their freedom would do them no good until they found food, water, and a spaceship. Success in finding even one of those items without being recaptured was highly unlikely. And even if they could board a ship, escape from the asteroid was just about impossible. He wondered how long it would take before someone else realized these things and voiced them."There's nothing, Mr. Foster," said one of the men after everyone had searched thoroughly."Mm hmm," Zip nodded. "Well, let's sleep and start again in the morning. Maybe some of us can go back to the warehouse and open up a few of those crates. There may be food and water in some of them. Others can investigate some of the passages that lead away from here."The men arranged themselves around the room and lay down. "I think I found the light switch, anyway," said Joe and pressed a button next to one of the doorways. The room became dark."I assure you, Mr. Zimbardo, there was nothing wrong with the airbot," asserted a large man, standing before the pirate leader with a half dozen of his partners. "I don't know what threw it back into the elevator shaft and I don't know what made it explode-but there was nothing wrong with it. The prisoners must have done something to it.""These prisoners are more than asteroid miners! None of St. George's men has the capability of knocking out two armed men the way those two were knocked out. None of them has the know-how to disable a airbot!" Zimbardo turned to his chief control officer. "Gene! Get me Lather right away. Tell him to bring up all information he has on the prisoners he brought in from Z25. Tell him to bring especially the video-record of the prisoners." He turned back to the others. "You're dismissed!"Soon Lather appeared with a handful of records."Let's see the video-record first," said Zimbardo, and pushed his computer a little closer to his lieutenant. The man inserted the disk. In seconds, a view of the prisoners appeared on the screen, each one shuffling by as they entered the Silver Cloud.When all the prisoners had passed by, Zimbardo turned his head down in disgust. Lather opened a file and brought out another disk. "I've got-" he began."You fool!!" spat out Zimbardo through gritted teeth. "I don't need to see any more! I know who we've got now! How could you miss seeing that the three Starmen who completely destroyed our plans on Mars were your passengers for three days! How could you miss it??" He was shouting now. "They've been on the news for two weeks! How-" Zimbardo paused and tried hard to get control of himself. "They were our prisoners! -and now they've escaped! They're loose inside this asteroid, and we don't know where!""But sir," inserted Lather when Zimbardo paused to take a breath and clutch the air. "There aren't many places they can hide. There's not much to the inside of the complex-only five floors."Zimbardo turned to the ship captain. With words that smoldered, he said, "The complex of this asteroid is far larger than you think! I have barely begun to explore, and St. George knows more than I do!"Back in control now, Zimbardo punched his desk communicator. "Gene! Get a search party together and have them scour every part of the asteroid they can find." He filled in the details about the Starmen. But he knew that neither the miners nor the Starmen would be found. With George St. George leading them, they could be anywhere-anywhere but where his men would be able to search.Mark came out of a deep sleep into a light doze. He knew he was sleeping, but he was also mindful of his surroundings. It gradually washed through him that he was hearing voices. Two voices were conversing in very low tones, far away. He had a feeling that the air was thick and the sound had to struggle to get to him. He became aware of his eyelids, and they fluttered. Fully conscious but deeply relaxed now, he slowly opened his eyes. He saw only darkness, but it was not absolute.He turned his head slowly to the left. Through an open door, about twenty feet away along a corridor were two tall, vaguely humanoid beings wrapped in shadows. Mark's heart leaped and began to race, but outwardly he showed no trace that he was alert. His eyes narrowed in an attempt to see more clearly. He knew instinctively that the creatures were alien. They walked in utter silence and stepped into the room. Mark lay frozen. They looked around for a few seconds, then went back into the corridor to the place where he had first seen them. They manifested no ill intent toward the sleepers.The figures began conversing in low voices. Mark sensed a deep sadness in their tone. He strained to hear what they were saying, what their words sounded like.Suddenly he heard something that sounded familiar. "A coincidence," he thought to himself. They couldn't have said "Zimbardo." After several more exchanges, one of the figures pressed a series of buttons on the wall, next to a blank screen. It came alive with a dull silver glow. Bright green lines appeared in the configuration of a map or blueprint. Mark strove to see as well as to hear. Slender fingers pointed to one part of the screen or another as the conversation continued.Then he heard it again, this time clearly. "Zimbardo." Mark lifted his head a little and turned so he could observe the screen better. "A plan of the surface control center," he thought. He recognized the floor plan by its telltale great doors through which the prisoners had been marched.The scene changed as one of the figures pressed a button. A series of diagrams appeared, diagrams that indistinctly suggested a power plant to Mark. One of the tall figures began talking animatedly, pointing to various locations and repeating the word "Zimbardo" frequently.Suddenly Mark understood what was going on: the aliens were talking about shutting down the power plant! Mark strained to get a closer look at the diagram they were examining. "The aliens!" His mind raced. "They must be the builders of this base! Shutting down the power plant-why, they must want to stop Zimbardo! They're on our side!"Then the other figure spoke up. He seemed to agree with the animated one, but his voice had a sorrowful tone to it. He pressed a few buttons on the screen and a picture of a warship appeared. As the alien pointed to the ship and talked, all the life seemed to drain out of his companion and he began looking hopeless and despondent. He turned the screen off.Mark didn't understand-what was that ship? Why did it bring such hopelessness?As the panel went dark, Mark realized with a crushed heart that, for some reason, the aliens were not going to deactivate the power plant after all. He buried his face in his hands. Something was stopping them, something having to do with the spaceship that had appeared on the screen last.Mark looked up and saw that the figures had vanished!10: Both Sides MoveTHE GREAT AIRLOCK on the pirates' asteroid opened. From the depths of the abyss five ships came forth. Emerging from the stone tunnel, they moved into formation and then headed for the Asteroid Belt. Lurton Zimbardo's lieutenant Crass held the authority over the small fleet. Each ship was sheathed with the radar bender, making it invisible to the normal means of detection used by Starlight Enterprise, Space Command, and other Earth-based entities.As the ships came into the Belt, Crass gave the command to the other four pilots. "The target asteroid has been located. Proceed with the destruction of the sats." The sats were small, unmanned electronic satellite observers, distributed throughout the Asteroid Belt to aid in research and navigation. They monitored movement in the Belt and provided constantly updated information on the location, speed, and direction of major asteroids.The four ships moved into pre-determined areas in the quadrants around a small, heavy, black, iron asteroid that was speeding smoothly along on its course.Crass stood on the deck of his ship and gazed out at the small asteroid. He spoke as if to himself. "There it is, the first of five surprise packages for our beloved Mars." The pirate leader waited patiently for the pilots of the four companion ships to report back. He expected that their assignment would take about 45 minutes-maybe as long as an hour. The first report came in 42 minutes later."Mr. Crass, this is Slant. We located three sats in quadrant two and destroyed them all." The other reports came in only moments later. A total of fourteen sats had been located within 600 miles of the asteroid where Crass was waiting, and all had been destroyed. Crass opened the intercom on his own ship."We're clear. Go to it."Over a dozen space-suited men spilled out of the airlock. They had been waiting for the order from Crass. Each carried a large crate, nearly weightless in the Asteroid Belt. They maneuvered easily through space and floated gently to the surface of the asteroid-a dark 100-yard wide clump of dirty rock. Immediately the men began to distribute the crates evenly over the surface of the rock.The grim, forbidding, pocked asteroid became the site of frenzied work. The crewmen removed sheet after sheet of dark metal from the crates and fastened them to the floating chunk of iron. Tiny flames showed where the irregular metal of the asteroid was being shaped to fit the plates the pirates were anchoring to its surface.In one hemisphere three other men were attaching power and propulsion units. They sank holes several feet deep and inserted tubes, fuel tanks, and a control mechanism. At one place near the asteroid's equator a technician was installing a communications unit.The four companion ships had returned and remained on guard less than a quarter mile from the asteroid. In less than two hours the work on the asteroid was completed and the crewmen reentered their ship."Take us home," ordered Crass. The five ships left the Belt and began the quick journey back to their port. Crass smiled most of the way back.On Mars in the communications tower of Eagle City, technician Mel Golden was puzzled. Some of his data had just dried up. Mel was responsible for monitoring the sats in a large segment of the Asteroid Belt, and a section over a thousand miles in diameter had gone dark. He called to his superior."Will, I've got something curious here." A slender, middle-aged man with long gray hair walked over to the console."What is it, Mel?""Look at this. You asked us to report anything out of the ordinary. Well, occasionally one sat will malfunction, but it looks as if at least a dozen have stopped reporting all at once. I haven't plotted out the details yet, but there's an entire section of the Belt where nothing's happening.""When did it start?""Just a moment ago. So whatever occurred out there happened about..."-he thought for a second-"about eleven minutes ago.""Thanks, Mel. This could be the surprise we've been waiting for. I'll report this immediately." Will went over to the master communicator in the tower and sent a top priority message to Space Command's headquarters on Mars, describing the situation. Space Command headquarters forwarded the information to its centers on Earth and the Moon, as well as to Oritz Konig, SE's Head of Security in Mars Base.Konig's report to Richard Starlight included these words: "It looks probable that the pirates have taken some sort of action in the Belt. There are no population centers of any size within 10,000 miles of the place, and no known solitary miners. It's a completely dead spot, and sats are spaced very thinly there. Yet fourteen sats in a sphere at least a thousand miles in diameter were put out within a ten-minute period. No natural phenomenon can explain that. Space Command has the closest ship, but it won't get to the site for a little more than 22 hours. The nearest backup ship is more than three hours after that. SE doesn't have a ship of any kind at all within four days of the site, so we'll have to depend on Space Command for the first reports.""Wake up! Everybody wake up!" Starman Joe Taylor was shouting."What is it? What's wrong?" Voices came from several men, jerked awake by Joe's outburst."Food! There's food here!" he burst out. "And water! Someone brought us food and water! Lots of it!"Within seconds everyone was up and crowding around Joe. Now that he had roused his companions, he was bent over a half dozen large boxes, one of which was partially open. He reached in and took out a container filled with fruit. He handed it to one of George St. George's men, reached into the box again, and withdrew a vessel with water in it. It had a spigot on it as if it were made for traveling. The men began passing it around, drinking deeply. Joe dug in again and brought out another box. He opened it and held it up so that others could see. It contained several layers of items like large crackers."Where did it come from, Joe?" Zip asked."I don't know, Zip! I woke up before anyone else and noticed these crates. I jumped up, looked around but didn't see anybody. I opened the first one and saw the fruit. That's the whole story.""You don't know it's safe! You took a chance, Joe!""What kind of chance, David? Where were we going to find water, much less food? We were done for without this.""Not too much of a chance, I think, Zip," whispered Mark to the red-haired Starman. Zip turned his head and looked at Mark curiously. "The food's okay. Let the men distribute it and I'll tell you what I know.""Okay," Zip nodded. He turned to George. "Let the men take the crates apart and see what we've got here. We'll eat and then we'll make plans." George took over operations while the three Starmen stepped aside."What do you know, Mark?" asked Zip. Mark told the other Starmen what he had seen in the middle of the night."Hmmm. Hard to credit it, that the original builders of this wonder are still here," mused Zip. "Why would they let Earthmen come in and take over? I gather from what we've learned and what we've overheard that the pirates have been active here for over a dozen years, and George found this place over fifteen years ago.""The pirates haven't really taken over, Zip," said Joe. "It looks as if they haven't gone beyond the first few levels! Something's kept them out. Only George was able to get beyond the floor where the warehouse is. Maybe that's why Zimbardo wanted to find him and keep him alive. George doesn't know too much about this, this, I don't know what to call this place, but he knows more than any human living.""Whatever the truth is, we have some friends," contributed Mark. "They don't want to be seen, but they'll help us. I'll bet a golden asteroid that they're the ones who destroyed the airbot. I think we need to be ready to see what happens next.""You're right, Mark," said Zip. "We'll have to be prepared to move." The Starmen went back to the group. Everyone was seated on the floor or on chairs, eating a welcome and refreshing breakfast. The four men who had been rendered unconscious by the airbot had benefited from a good night's sleep and were back to normal.Mark reached into one of the crates and took out one of the items that looked like a large cracker. He saw that several of the miners were eating them. Zip had also taken a bite out of one and was chewing thoughtfully."What do you think of these crackers?" Mark asked."Survival food," opined Zip. "The fruit is delicious, though."When everyone had finished breakfast, George St. George asked, "What should we do now, Mr. Foster?""I was just going to ask you the same question, George," answered Zip. "Let's get the men together and make some plans." George called the miners together. Zip delivered a short speech, informing them that he, Joe, and Mark were Starmen and gave a brief summary of their assignment. With a nod, Zip asked Mark to tell what he had seen during the night. Then a number of men began to ask questions.All at once the room
