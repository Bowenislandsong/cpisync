opment of the highereducation of girls, and the intellectual or more systematised effort ofwoman.  Mrs. Pfeiffer, who writes a most admirable prose style, deals insuccession with the sentimental difficulty, with the economic problem,and with the arguments of physiologists.  She boldly grapples withProfessor Romanes, whose recent article in the Nineteenth Century, on theleading characters which mentally differentiate men and women, attractedso much attention, and produces some very valuable statistics fromAmerica, where the influence of education on health has been mostcarefully studied.  Her book is a most important contribution to thediscussion of one of the great social problems of our day.  The extendedactivity of women is now an accomplished fact; its results are on theirtrial; and Mrs. Pfeiffer's excellent essays sum up the situation verycompletely, and show the rational and scientific basis of the movementmore clearly and more logically than any other treatise I have as yetseen.* * * * *It is interesting to note that many of the most advanced modern ideas onthe subject of the education of women are anticipated by Defoe in hiswonderful Essay upon Projects, where he proposes that a college for womenshould be erected in every county in England, and ten colleges of thekind in London.  'I have often thought of it, 'he says,' as one of themost barbarous customs in the world that we deny the advantages oflearning to women.  Their youth is spent to teach them to stitch and sew,or make baubles.  They are taught to read, indeed, and perhaps to writetheir names or so, and that is the height of a woman's education.  And Iwould but ask any who slight the sex for their understanding, "What is aman (a gentleman I mean) good for that is taught no more?"  What has thewoman done to forfeit the privilege of being taught?  Shall we upbraidwomen with folly when it is only the error of this inhuman custom thathindered them being made wiser?'  Defoe then proceeds to elaborate hisscheme for the foundation of women's colleges, and enters into minutedetails about the architecture, the general curriculum, and thediscipline.  His suggestion that the penalty of death should be inflictedon any man who ventured to make a proposal of marriage to any of the girlstudents during term time possibly suggested the plot of Lord Tennyson'sPrincess, so its harshness may be excused, and in all other respects hisideas are admirable.  I am glad to see that this curious little volumeforms one of the National Library series.  In its anticipations of manyof our most modern inventions it shows how thoroughly practical alldreamers are.* * * * *I am sorry to see that Mrs. Fawcett deprecates the engagement of ladiesof education as dressmakers and milliners, and speaks of it as beingdetrimental to those who have fewer educational advantages.  I myselfwould like to see dressmaking regarded not merely as a learnedprofession, but as a fine art.  To construct a costume that will be atonce rational and beautiful requires an accurate knowledge of theprinciples of proportion, a thorough acquaintance with the laws ofhealth, a subtle sense of colour, and a quick appreciation of the properuse of materials, and the proper qualities of pattern and design.  Thehealth of a nation depends very largely on its mode of dress; theartistic feeling of a nation should find expression in its costume quiteas much as in its architecture; and just as the upholstering tradesmanhas had to give place to the decorative artist, so the ordinary milliner,with her lack of taste and lack of knowledge, her foolish fashions andher feeble inventions, will have to make way for the scientific andartistic dress designer.  Indeed, so far from it being wise to discouragewomen of education from taking up the profession of dressmakers, it isexactly women of education who are needed, and I am glad to see in thenew technical college for women at Bedford, millinery and dressmaking areto be taught as part of the ordinary curriculum.  There has also beenstarted in London a Society of Lady Dressmakers for the purpose ofteaching educated girls and women, and the Scientific Dress Associationis, I hear, doing very good work in the same direction.* * * * *I have received some very beautiful specimens of Christmas books fromMessrs. Griffith and Farran.  Treasures of Art and Song, edited by RobertEllice Mack, is a real edition de luxe of pretty poems and prettypictures; and Through the Year is a wonderfully artistic calendar.Messrs. Hildesheimer and Faulkner have also sent me Rhymes and Roses,illustrated by Ernest Wilson and St. Clair Simmons; Cape Town Dicky, achild's book, with some very lovely pictures by Miss Alice Havers; awonderful edition of The Deserted Village, illustrated by Mr. CharlesGregory and Mr. Hines; and some really charming Christmas cards, those byMiss Alice Havers, Miss Edwards, and Miss Dealy being especially good.* * * * *The most perfect and the most poisonous of all modern French poets onceremarked that a man can live for three days without bread, but that noone can live for three days without poetry.  This, however, can hardly besaid to be a popular view, or one that commends itself to that curiouslyuncommon quality which is called common-sense.  I fancy that most people,if they do not actually prefer a salmis to a sonnet, certainly like theirculture to repose on a basis of good cookery, and as there is somethingto be said for this attitude, I am glad to see that several ladies areinteresting themselves in cookery classes.  Mrs. Marshall's brilliantlectures are, of course, well known, and besides her there is MadameLebour-Fawssett, who holds weekly classes in Kensington.  Madame Fawssettis the author of an admirable little book, entitled Economical FrenchCookery for Ladies, and I am glad to hear that her lectures are sosuccessful.  I was talking the other day to a lady who works a great dealat the East End of London, and she told me that no small part of thepermanent misery of the poor is due to their entire ignorance of thecleanliness and economy necessary for good cooking.* * * * *The Popular Ballad Concert Society has been reorganised under the name ofthe Popular Musical Union.  Its object will be to train the workingclasses thoroughly in the enjoyment and performance of music, and toprovide the inhabitants of the crowded districts of the East End withconcerts and oratorios, to be performed as far as possible by trainedmembers of the working classes; and, though money is urgently required,it is proposed to make the Society to a certain degree self-supporting bygiving something in the form of high-class concerts in return forsubscriptions and donations.  The whole scheme is an excellent one, and Ihope that the readers of the Woman's World will give it their valuablesupport.  Mrs. Ernest Hart is the secretary, and the treasurer is theRev. S.

(Hildesheimer andFaulkner.)THE POETS' CORNER--IV(Pall Mall Gazette, January 20, 1888.)A cynical critic once remarked that no great poet is intelligible and nolittle poet worth understanding, but that otherwise poetry is anadmirable thing.  This, however, seems to us a somewhat harsh view of thesubject.  Little poets are an extremely interesting study.  The best ofthem have often some new beauty to show us, and though the worst of themmay bore yet they rarely brutalise.  Poor Folks' Lives, for instance, bythe Rev. Frederick Langbridge, is a volume that could do no possible harmto any one.  These poems display a healthy, rollicking, G. R. Sims toneof feeling, an almost unbounded regard for the converted drunkard, and astrong sympathy with the sufferings of the poor.  As for their theology,it is of that honest, downright and popular kind, which in theserationalistic days is probably quite as useful as any other form oftheological thought.  Here is the opening of a poem called A StreetSermon, which is an interesting example of what muscular Christianity cando in the sphere of verse-making:   What, God fight shy of the city?      He's t' other side up I guess;   If you ever want to find Him,      Whitechapel's the right address.Those who prefer pseudo-poetical prose to really prosaic poetry will wishthat Mr. Dalziel had converted most of his Pictures in the Fire intoleaders for the Daily Telegraph, as, from the literary point of view,they have all the qualities dear to the Asiatic school.  What a splendidleader the young lions of Fleet Street would have made out of ThePrestige of England, for instance, a poem suggested by the opening of theZulu war in 1879.   Now away sail our ships far away o'er the sea,      Far away with our gallant and brave;   The loud war-cry is sounding like wild revelrie,      And our heroes dash on to their grave;   For the fierce Zulu tribes have arisen in their might,      And in thousands swept down on our few;   But these braves only yielded when crushed in the fight,      Man to man to their colours were true.The conception of the war-cry sounding 'like wild revelrie' is quite inthe true Asiatic spirit, and indeed the whole poem is full of the daringEnglish of a special correspondent.  Personally, we prefer Mr. Dalzielwhen he is not quite so military.  The Fairies, for instance, is a verypretty poem, and reminds us of some of Dicky Doyle's charming drawings,and Nat Bentley is a capital ballad in its way.  The Irish poems,however, are rather vulgar and should be expunged.  The Celtic element inliterature is extremely valuable, but there is absolutely no excuse forshrieking 'Shillelagh!' and 'O Gorrah!'Women must Weep, by Professor Harald Williams, has the most dreadfulcover of any book that we have come across for some time past.  It ispossibly intended to symbolise the sorrow of the world, but it merelysuggests the decorative tendencies of an undertaker and is as depressingas it is detestable.  However, as the cowl does not make the monk, so thebinding, in the case of the Savile Club school, does not make the poet,and we open the volume without prejudice.  The first poem that we come tois a vigorous attack on those wicked and misguided people who believethat Beauty is its own reason for existing, and that Art should have noother aim but her own perfection.  Here are some of the Professor'sgravest accusations:   Why do they patch, in their fatal choice,      When at secrets such the angels quake,   But a play of the Vision and the Voice?--      Oh, it's all for Art's sake.   Why do they gather what should be left,      And leave behind what they ought to take,   And exult in the basest blank or theft?--      Oh, it's all for Art's sake.It certainly must be admitted that to 'patch' or to 'exult in the basestblank' is a form of conduct quite unbefitting an artist, the veryobscurity and incomprehensible character of such a crime adding somethingto its horror.  However, while fully recognising the wickedness of'patching' we cannot but think that Professor Harald Williams is happierin his criticism of life than he is in his art criticism.  His poemBetween the Banks, for instance, has a touch of sincerity and finefeeling that almost atones for its over-emphasis.Mr. Buchan's blank verse drama Joseph and His Brethren bears noresemblance to that strange play on the same subject which Mr. Swinburneso much admires.  Indeed, it may be said to possess all the fataloriginality of inexperience.  However, Mr. Buchan does not leave us inany doubt about his particular method of writing.  'As to the dialogue,'he says, 'I have put the language of real life into the mouths of thespeakers, except when they may be supposed to be under strong emotion;then their utterances become more rapid--broken--figurative--in shortmore poetical.'  Well, here is the speech of Potiphar's wife under strongemotion:   ZULEEKHA (seizing him).  Love me! or death!   Ha! dost thou think thou wilt not, and yet live?   By Isis, no.  And thou wilt turn away,   Iron, marble mockman!  Ah!  I hold thy life!   Love feeds on death.  It swallows up all life,   Hugging, or killing.  I to woo, and thou--   Unhappy me!  Oh!The language here is certainly rapid and broken, and the expression'marble mockman' is, we suppose, figurative, but the passage can scarcelybe described as poetical, though it fulfils all Mr. Buchan's conditions.Still, tedious as Zuleekha and Joseph are, the Chorus of Ancients is muchworse.  These 'ideal spectators' seem to spend their lives in utteringthose solemn platitudes that with the aged pass for wisdom.  The chiefoffenders are the members of what Mr. Buchan calls 'The2nd.--Semi-chorus,' who have absolutely no hesitation in interrupting theprogress of the play with observations of this kind:   2ND.--semi-chorus   Ah! but favour extreme shown to one      Among equals who yet stand apart,         Awakeneth, say ye, if naturally,            The demons--jealousy, envy, hate,--         In the breast of those passed by.It is a curious thing that when minor poets write choruses to a play theyshould always consider it necessary to adopt the style and language of abad translator.  We fear that Mr. Bohn has much to answer for.God's Garden is a well-meaning attempt to use Nature for theological andeducational purposes.  It belongs to that antiquated school of thoughtthat, in spite of the discoveries of modern science, invites the sluggardto look at the ant, and the idle to imitate the bee.  It is full of falseanalogies and dull eighteenth-century didactics.  It tells us that theflowering cactus should remind us that a dwarf may possess mental andmoral qualities, that the mountain ash should teach us the preciousfruits of affliction, and that a fond father should learn from theexample of the chestnut that the most beautiful children often turn outbadly!  We must admit that we have no sympathy with this point of view,and we strongly protest against the idea that   The flaming poppy, with its black core, tells   Of anger's flushing face, and heart of sin.The worst use that man can make of Nature is to turn her into a mirrorfor his own vices, nor are Nature's secrets ever disclosed to those whoapproach her in this spirit.  However, the author of this irritatinglittle volume is not always botanising and moralising in this recklessand improper fashion.  He has better moments, and those who sympathisewith the Duke of Westminster's efforts to provide open spaces for thepeople, will no doubt join in the aspiration--   God bless wise Grosvenors whose hearts incline,   Workmen to fete, and grateful souls refine;though they may regret that so noble a sentiment is expressed in soinadequate a form.It is difficult to understand why Mr. Cyrus Thornton should have calledhis volume Voices of the Street.  However, poets have a perfect right tochristen their own children, and if the wine is good no one shouldquarrel with the bush.  Mr. Thornton's verse is often graceful andmelodious, and some of his lines, such as--   And the wise old Roman bondsman saw no terror in the dead--   Children when the play was over, going softly home to bed,have a pleasant Tennysonian ring.  The Ballad of the Old Year is ratherdepressing.  'Bury the Old Year Solemnly' has been said far too often,and the sentiment is suitable only for Christmas crackers.  The bestthing in the book is The Poet's Vision of Death, which is quite above theaverage.Mrs. Dobell informs us that she has already published sixteen volumes ofpoetry and that she intends to publish two more.  The volume that nowlies before us is entitled In the Watches of the Night, most of the poemsthat it contains having been composed 'in the neighbourhood of the sea,between the hours of ten and two o'clock.'  Judging from the followingextract we cannot say that we consider this a very favourable time forinspiration, at any rate in the case of Mrs. Dobell:   Were Anthony Trollope and George Eliot   Alive--which unfortunately they are not--   As regards the subject of 'quack-snubbing,' you know,   To support me I am sure they hadn't been slow--   For they, too, hated the wretched parasite   That fattens on the freshest, the most bright   Of the blossoms springing from the--Public Press!--   And that oft are flowers that even our quacks should bless!(1) Poor Folks' Lives.

(Remington andCo.)LITERARY AND OTHER NOTES--IV(Woman's World, February 1888.)Canute The Great, by Michael Field, is in many respects a reallyremarkable work of art.  Its tragic element is to be found in life, notin death; in the hero's psychological development, not in his moraldeclension or in any physical calamity; and the author has borrowed frommodern science the idea that in the evolutionary struggle for existencethe true tragedy may be that of the survivor.  Canute, the rough generousViking, finds himself alienated from his gods, his forefathers, his verydreams.  With centuries of Pagan blood in his veins, he sets himself tothe task of becoming a great Christian governor and lawgiver to men; andyet he is fully conscious that, while he has abandoned the noble impulsesof his race, he still retains that which in his nature is most fierce orfearful.  It is not by faith that he reaches the new creed, nor throughgentleness that he seeks after the new culture.  The beautiful Christianwoman whom he has made queen of his life and lands teaches him no mercy,and knows nothing of forgiveness.  It is sin and not suffering thatpurifies him--mere sin itself.  'Be not afraid,' he says in the lastgreat scene of the play:      'Be not afraid;   I have learnt this, sin is a mighty bond   'Twixt God and man.  Love that has ne'er forgiven   Is virgin and untender; spousal passion   Becomes acquainted with life's vilest things,   Transmutes them, and exalts.  Oh, wonderful,   This touch of pardon,--all the shame cast out;   The heart a-ripple with the gaiety,   The leaping consciousness that Heaven knows all,   And yet esteems us royal.  Think of it--   The joy, the hope!'This strange and powerful conception is worked out in a manner as strongas it is subtle; and, indeed, almost every character in the play seems tosuggest some new psychological problem.  The mere handling of the verseis essentially characteristic of our modern introspective method, as itpresents to us, not thought in its perfected form, but the involutions ofthought seeking for expression.  We seem to witness the very workings ofthe mind, and to watch the passion struggling for utterance.  In plays ofthis kind (plays that are meant to be read, not to be acted) it must beadmitted that we often miss that narrative and descriptive element whichin the epic is so great a charm, and, indeed, may be said to be almostessential to the perfect literary presentation of any story.  Thiselement the Greek managed to retain by the introduction of chorus andmessenger; but we seem to have been unable to invent any substitute forit.  That there is here a distinct loss cannot, I think, be denied.  Thereis something harsh, abrupt, and inartistic in such a stage-direction as'Canute strangles Edric, flings his body into the stream, and gazes out.'It strikes no dramatic note, it conveys no picture, it is meagre andinadequate.  If acted it might be fine; but as read, it is unimpressive.However, there is no form of art that has not got its limitations, andthough it is sad to see the action of a play relegated to a formalfootnote, still there is undoubtedly a certain gain in psychologicalanalysis and psychological concentration.It is a far cry from the Knutlinga Saga to Rossetti's note-book, butMichael Field passes from one to the other without any loss of power.Indeed, most readers will probably prefer The Cup of Water, which is thesecond play in this volume, to the earlier historical drama.  It is morepurely poetical; and if it has less power, it has certainly more beauty.Rossetti conceived the idea of a story in which a young king fallspassionately in love with a little peasant girl who gives him a cup ofwater, and is by her beloved in turn, but being betrothed to a noblelady, he yields her in marriage to his friend, on condition that once ayear--on the anniversary of their meeting--she brings him a cup of water.The girl dies in childbirth, leaving a daughter who grows into hermother's perfect likeness, and comes to meet the king when he is hunting.Just, however, as he is about to take the cup from her hand, a secondfigure, in her exact likeness, but dressed in peasant's clothes, steps toher side, looks in the king's face, and kisses him on the mouth.  Hefalls forward on his horse's neck, and is lifted up dead.  Michael Fieldhas struck out the supernatural element so characteristic of Rossetti'sgenius, and in some other respects modified for dramatic purposesmaterial Rossetti left unused.  The result is a poem of exquisite andpathetic grace.  Cara, the peasant girl, is a creation as delicate as itis delightful, and it deserves to rank beside the Faun of Callirhoe.  Asfor the young king who loses all the happiness of his life through onenoble moment of unselfishness, and who recognised as he stands overCara's dead body that      women are not chattels,   To deal with as one's generosity   May prompt or straiten, . . .and that      we must learn   To drink life's pleasures if we would be pure,he is one of the most romantic figures in all modern dramatic work.Looked at from a purely technical point of view, Michael Field's verse issometimes lacking in music, and has no sustained grandeur of movement;but it is extremely dramatic, and its method is admirably suited toexpress those swift touches of nature and sudden flashes of thought whichare Michael Field's distinguishing qualities.  As for the moral containedin these plays, work that has the rich vitality of life has alwayssomething of life's mystery also; it cannot be narrowed down to a formalcreed, nor summed up in a platitude; it has many answers, and more thanone secret.* * * * *Miss Frances Martin's Life of Elizabeth Gilbert is an extremelyinteresting book.  Elizabeth Gilbert was born at a time when, as herbiographer reminds us, kindly and intelligent men and women could gravelyimplore the Almighty to 'take away' a child merely because it was blind;when they could argue that to teach the blind to read, or to attempt toteach them to work, was to fly in the face of Providence; and her wholelife was given to the endeavour to overcome this prejudice andsuperstition; to show that blindness, though a great privation, is notnecessarily a disqualification; and that blind men and women can learn,labour, and fulfil all the duties of life.  Before her day all that theblind were taught was to commit texts from the Bible to memory.  She sawthat they could learn handicrafts, and be made industrious andself-supporting.  She began with a small cellar in Holborn, at the rentof eighteenpence a week, but before her death she could point to largeand well-appointed workshops in almost every city of England where blindmen and women are employed, where tools have been invented by or modifiedfor them, and where agencies have been established for the sale of theirwork.  The whole story of her life is full of pathos and of beauty.  Shewas not born blind, but lost her sight through an attack of scarlet feverwhen she was three years old.  For a long time she could not realise herposition, and we hear of the little child making earnest appeals to betaken 'out of the dark room,' or to have a candle lighted; and once shewhispered to her father, 'If I am a very good little girl, may I see mydoll to-morrow?'  However, all memory of vision seems to have faded fromher before she left the sick-room, though, taught by those around her,she soon began to take an imaginary interest in colour, and a very realone in form and texture.  An old nurse is still alive who remembersmaking a pink frock for her when she was a child, her delight at itsbeing pink and her pleasure in stroking down the folds; and when in 1835the young Princess Victoria visited Oxford with her mother, Bessie, asshe was always called, came running home, exclaiming, 'Oh, mamma, I haveseen the Duchess of Kent, and she had on a brown silk dress.'  Heryouthful admiration of Wordsworth was based chiefly upon his love offlowers, but also on personal knowledge.  When she was about ten yearsold, Wordsworth went to Oxford to receive the honorary degree of D.C.L.from the University.  He stayed with Dr. Gilbert, then Principal ofBrasenose, and won Bessie's heart the first day by telling at the dinnertable how he had almost leapt off the coach in Bagley Wood to gather theblue veronica.  But she had a better reason for remembering that visit.One day she was in the drawing-room alone, and Wordsworth entered.  For amoment he stood silent before the blind child, the little sensitive face,with its wondering, inquiring look, turned towards him.  Then he gravelysaid, 'Madam, I hope I do not disturb you.'  She never forgot that'Madam'--grave, solemn, almost reverential.As for the great practical work of her life, the amelioration of thecondition of the blind, Miss Martin gives a wonderful account of hernoble efforts and her noble success; and the volume contains a great manyinteresting letters from eminent people, of which the followingcharacteristic note from Mr. Ruskin is not the least interesting:   DENMARK HILL, 2nd September 1871.   MADAM,--I am obliged by your letter, and I deeply sympathise with the   objects of the institution over which you preside.  But one of my main   principles of work is that every one must do their best, and spend   their all in their own work, and mine is with a much lower race of   sufferers than you plead for--with those who 'have eyes and see   not.'--I am, Madam, your faithful servant, J. Ruskin.Miss Martin is a most sympathetic biographer, and her book should be readby all who care to know the history of one of the remarkable women of ourcentury.* * * * *Ourselves and Our Neighbours is a pleasant volume of social essays fromthe pen of one of the most graceful and attractive of all Americanpoetesses, Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton.  Mrs. Moulton, who has a verylight literary touch, discusses every important modern problem--fromSociety rosebuds and old bachelors, down to the latest fashions inbonnets and in sonnets.  The best chapter in the book is that entitled'The Gospel of Good Gowns,' which contains some very excellent remarks onthe ethics of dress.  Mrs. Moulton sums up her position in the followingpassage:--   The desire to please is a natural characteristic of unspoiled   womanhood.  'If I lived in the woods, I should dress for the trees,'   said a woman widely known for taste and for culture.  Every woman's   dress should be, and if she has any ideality will be, an expression of   herself. . . .  The true gospel of dress is that of fitness and taste.   Pictures are painted, and music is written, and flowers are fostered,   that life may be made beautiful.  Let women delight our eyes like   pictures, be harmonious as music, and fragrant as flowers, that they   also may fulfil their mission of grace and of beauty.  By   companionship with beautiful thoughts shall their tastes be so formed   that their toilets will never be out of harmony with their means or   their position.  They will be clothed almost as unconsciously as the   lilies of the field; but each one will be herself, and there will be   no more uniformity in their attire than in their faces.The modern Dryad who is ready to 'dress for the trees' seems to me acharming type; but I hardly think that Mrs. Moulton is right when shesays that the woman of the future will be clothed 'almost asunconsciously as the lilies of the field.'  Possibly, however, she meansmerely to emphasise the distinction between dressing and dressing-up, adistinction which is often forgotten.* * * * *Warring' Angels is a very sad and suggestive story.  It contains noimpossible heroine and no improbable hero, but is simply a faithfultranscript from life, a truthful picture of men and women as they are.Darwin could not have enjoyed it, as it does not end happily.  There is,at least, no distribution of cakes and ale in the last chapter.  But,then, scientific people are not always the best judges of literature.They seem to think that the sole aim of art should be to amuse, and hadthey been consulted on the subject would have banished Melpomene fromParnassus.  It may be admitted, however, that not a little of our modernart is somewhat harsh and painful.  Our Castaly is very salt with tears,and we have bound the brows of the Muses with cypress and with yew.  Weare often told that we are a shallow age, yet we have certainly thesaddest literature of all the ages, for we have made Truth and not Beautythe aim of art, and seem to value imitation more than imagination.  Thistendency is, of course, more marked in fiction than it is in poetry.Beauty of form is always in itself a source of joy; the mere _technique_of verse has an imaginative and spiritual element; and life must, to acertain degree, be transfigured before it can find its expression inmusic.  But ordinary fiction, rejecting the beauty of form in order torealise the facts of life, seems often to lack the vital element ofdelight, to miss that pleasure-giving power in virtue of which the artsexist.  It would not, however, be fair to regard Warring Angels simply asa specimen of literary photography.  It has a marked distinction ofstyle, a definite grace and simplicity of manner.  There is nothing crudein it, though it is to a certain degree inexperienced; nothing violent,though it is often strong.  The story it has to tell has frequently beentold before, but the treatment makes it new; and Lady Flower, for whosewhite soul the angels of good and evil are at war, is admirablyconceived, and admirably drawn.* * * * *A Song of Jubilee and Other Poems contains some pretty, picturesqueverses.  Its author is Mrs. De Courcy Laffan, who, under the name of Mrs.Leith Adams, is well known as a novelist and story writer.  The JubileeOde is quite as good as most of the Jubilee Odes have been, and some ofthe short poems are graceful.  This from The First Butterfly is pretty:   O little bird without a song!  I love   Thy silent presence, floating in the light--   A living, perfect thing, when scarcely yet   The snow-white blossom crawls along the wall,   And not a daisy shows its star-like head   Amid the grass.Miss Bella Duffy's Life of Madame de Stael forms part of that admirable'Eminent Women' Series, which is so well edited by Mr. John H. Ingram.There is nothing absolutely new in Miss Duffy's book, but this was not tobe expected.  Unpublished correspondence, that delight of the eagerbiographer, is not to be had in the case of Madame de Stael, the DeBroglie family having either destroyed or successfully concealed all thepapers which might have revealed any facts not already in the possessionof the world.  Upon the other hand, the book has the excellent quality ofcondensation, and gives us in less than two hundred pages a very goodpicture of Madame de Stael and her day.  Miss Duffy's criticism ofCorinne is worth quoting:   Corinne is a classic of which everybody is bound to speak with   respect.  The enormous admiration which it exacted at the time of its   appearance may seem somewhat strange in this year of grace; but then   it must be remembered that Italy was not the over-written country it   has since become.  Besides this, Madame de Stael was the most   conspicuous personage of her day.  Except Chateaubriand, she had   nobody to dispute with her the palm of literary glory in France.  Her   exile, her literary circle, her courageous opinions, had kept the eyes   of Europe fixed on her for years, so that any work from her pen was   sure to excite the liveliest curiosity.   Corinne is a kind of glorified guide-book, with some of the qualities   of a good novel.  It is very long winded, but the appetite of the age   was robust in that respect, and the highly-strung emotions of the hero   and heroine could not shock a taste which had been formed by the   Sorrows of Werther.  It is extremely moral, deeply sentimental, and of   a deadly earnestness--three characteristics which could not fail to   recommend it to a dreary and ponderous generation, the most deficient   in taste that ever trod the earth.   But it is artistic in the sense that the interest is concentrated from   first to last on the central figure, and the drama, such as it is,   unfolds itself naturally from its starting point, which is the   contrast between the characters of Oswald and Corinne.The 'dreary and ponderous generation, the most deficient in taste thatever trod the earth,' seems to me a somewhat exaggerated mode ofexpression, but 'glorified guide-book' is a not unfelicitous descriptionof the novel that once thrilled Europe.  Miss Duffy sums up her opinionof Madame de Stael as a writer in the following passage:   Her mind was strong of grasp and wide in range, but continuous effort   fatigued it.  She could strike out isolated sentences alternately   brilliant, exhaustive, and profound, but she could not link them to   other sentences so as to form an organic whole.  Her thought was   definite singly, but vague as a whole.  She always saw things   separately, and tried to combine them arbitrarily, and it is generally   difficult to follow out any idea of hers from its origin to its end.   Her thoughts are like pearls of price profusely scattered, or   carelessly strung together, but not set in any design.  On closing one   of her books, the reader is left with no continuous impression.  He   has been dazzled and delighted, enlightened also by flashes; but the   horizons disclosed have vanished again, and the outlook is enriched by   no new vistas.   Then she was deficient in the higher qualities of the imagination.  She   could analyse, but not characterise; construct, but not create.  She   could take one defect like selfishness, or one passion like love, and   display its workings; or she could describe a whole character, like   Napoleon's, with marvellous penetration; but she could not make her   personages talk, or act like human beings.  She lacked pathos, and had   no sense of humour.  In short, hers was a mind endowed with enormous   powers of comprehension, and an amazing richness of ideas, but   deficient in perception of beauty, in poetry, and in true originality.   She was a great social personage, but her influence on literature was   not destined to be lasting, because, in spite of foreseeing too much,   she had not the true prophetic sense of proportion, and confused the   things of the present with those of the future--the accidental with   the enduring.I cannot but think that in this passage Miss Duffy rather underratesMadame de Stael's influence on the literature of the nineteenth century.It is true that she gave our literature no new form, but she was one ofthose who gave it a new spirit, and the romantic movement owes her nosmall debt.  However, a biography should be read for its pictures morethan for its criticisms, and Miss Duffy shows a remarkable narrativepower, and tells with a good deal of esprit the wonderful adventures ofthe brilliant woman whom Heine termed 'a whirlwind in petticoats.'* * * * *Mr. Harcourt's reprint of John Evelyn's Life of Mrs. Godolphin is awelcome addition to the list of charming library books.  Mr. Harcourt'sgrandfather, the Archbishop of York, himself John Evelyn's great-great-grandson, inherited the manuscript from his distinguished ancestor, andin 1847 entrusted it for publication to Samuel Wilberforce, then Bishopof Oxford.  As the book has been for a long time out of print, this newedition is sure to awake fresh interest in the life of the noble andvirtuous lady whom John Evelyn so much admired.  Margaret Godolphin wasone of the Queen's Maids of Honour at the Court of Charles II., and wasdistinguished for the delicate purity of her nature, as well as for herhigh intellectual attainments.  Some of the extracts Evelyn gives fromher Diary seem to show an austere, formal, almost ascetic spirit; but itwas inevitable that a nature so refined as hers should have turned inhorror from such ideals of life as were presented by men like Buckinghamand Rochester, like Etheridge, Killigrew, and Sedley, like the Kinghimself, to whom she could scarcely bring herself to speak.  After hermarriage she seems to have become happier and brighter, and her earlydeath makes her a pathetic and interesting figure in the history of thetime.  Evelyn can see no fault in her, and his life of her is the mostwonderful of all panegyrics.* * * * *Amongst the Maids-of-Honour mentioned by John Evelyn is Frances Jennings,the elder sister of the great Duchess of Marlborough.  Miss Jennings, whowas one of the most beautiful women of her day, married first Sir GeorgeHamilton, brother of the author of the Memoires de Grammont, andafterwards Richard Talbot, who was made Duke of Tyrconnel by James II.William's successful occupation of Ireland, where her husband was LordDeputy, reduced her to poverty and obscurity, and she was probably thefirst Peeress who ever took to millinery as a livelihood.  She had adressmaker's shop in the Strand, and, not wishing to be detected, sat ina white mask and a white dress, and was known by the name of the 'WhiteWidow.'I was reminded of the Duchess when I read Miss Emily Faithfull'sadmirable article in Gralignani on 'Ladies as Shopkeepers.'  'The mostdaring innovation in England at this moment,' says Miss Faithfull, 'isthe lady shopkeeper.  At present but few people have had the courage tobrave the current social prejudice.  We draw such fine distinctionsbetween the wholesale and retail traders that our cotton-spinners, calico-makers, and general merchants seem to think that they belong to a totallydifferent sphere, from which they look down on the lady who has hadsufficient brains, capital, and courage to open a shop.  But the oldworld moves faster than it did in former days, and before the end of thenineteenth century it is probable that a gentlewoman will be recognisedin spite of her having entered on commercial pursuits, especially as weare growing accustomed to see scions of our noblest families on our StockExchange and in tea-merchants' houses; one Peer of the realm is now doingan extensive business in coals, and another is a cab proprietor.'  MissFaithfull then proceeds to give a most interesting account of the Londondairy opened by the Hon. Mrs. Maberley, of Madame Isabel's millineryestablishment, and of the wonderful work done by Miss Charlotte Robinson,who has recently been appointed Decorator to the Queen.  About threeyears ago, Miss Faithfull tells us, Miss Robinson came to Manchester, andopened a shop in King Street, and, regardless of that bugbear whichterrifies most women--the loss of social status--she put up her own nameover the door, and without the least self-assertion quietly entered intocompetition with the sterner sex.  The result has been eminentlysatisfactory.  This year Miss Robinson has exhibited at Saltaire and atManchester, and next year she proposes to exhibit at Glasgow, and,possibly, at Brussels.  At first she had some difficulty in making peopleunderstand that her work is really commercial, not charitable; she feelsthat, until a healthy public opinion is created, women will pose as'destitute ladies,' and never take a dignified position in any callingthey adopt.  Gentlemen who earn their own living are not spoken of as'destitute,' and we must banish this idea in connection with ladies whoare engaged in an equally honourable manner.  Miss Faithfull concludesher most valuable article as follows: 'The more highly educated our womenof business are, the better for themselves, their work, and the wholecommunity.  Many of the professions to which ladies have hitherto turnedare overcrowded, and when once the fear of losing social position isboldy disregarded, it will be found that commercial life offers a varietyof more or less lucrative employments to ladies of birth and capital, whofind it more congenial to their tastes and requirements to invest theirmoney and spend their energies in a business which yields a fair returnrather than sit at home content with a scanty pittance.'I myself entirely agree with Miss Faithfull, though I feel that there issomething to be said in favour of the view put forward by Lady Shrewsburyin the Woman's World, {289} and a great deal to be said in favour of Mrs.Joyce's scheme for emigration.  Mr. Walter Besant, if we are to judgefrom his last novel, is of Lady Shrewsbury's way of thinking.* * * * *I hope that some of my readers will be interested in Miss BeatriceCrane's little poem, Blush-Roses, for which her father, Mr. Walter Crane,has done so lovely and graceful a design.  Mrs. Simon, of Birkdale Park,Southport, tells me that she offered a prize last term at her school forthe best sonnet on any work of art.  The poems were sent to ProfessorDowden, who awarded the prize to the youthful authoress of the followingsonnet on Mr. Watts's picture of Hope:   She sits with drooping form and fair bent head,   Low-bent to hear the faintly-sounding strain   That thrills her with the sweet uncertain pain   Of timid trust and restful tears unshed.   Around she feels vast spaces.  Awe and dread   Encompass her.   And the dark doubt she fain   Would banish, sees the shuddering fear remain,   And ever presses near with stealthy tread.   But not for ever will the misty space   Close down upon her meekly-patient eyes.   The steady light within them soon will ope   Their heavy lids, and then the sweet fair face,   Uplifted in a sudden glad surprise,   Will find the bright reward which comes to Hope.I myself am rather inclined to prefer this sonnet on Mr. Watts's Psyche.The sixth line is deficient; but, in spite of the faulty _technique_,there is a great deal that is suggestive in it:   Unfathomable boundless mystery,   Last work of the Creator, deathless, vast,   Soul--essence moulded of a changeful past;   Thou art the offspring of Eternity;   Breath of his breath, by his vitality   Engendered, in his image cast,   Part of the Nature-song whereof the last   Chord soundeth never in the harmony.   'Psyche'!  Thy form is shadowed o'er with pain   Born of intensest longing, and the rain   Of a world's weeping lieth like a sea   Of silent soundless sorrow in thine eyes.   Yet grief is not eternal, for clouds rise   From out the ocean everlastingly.I have to thank Mr. William Rossetti for kindly allowing me to reproduceDante Gabriel Rossetti's drawing of the authoress of Goblin Market; andthanks are also due to Mr. Lafayette, of Dublin, for the use of hisphotograph of H.R.H. the Princess of Wales in her Academic Robes asDoctor of Music, which served as our frontispiece last month, and toMessrs.

(Sampson Low, Marston and Co.)THE POETS' CORNER--V(Pall Mall Gazette, February 15, 1888.)Mr. Heywood's Salome seems to have thrilled the critics of the UnitedStates.  From a collection of press notices prefixed to the volume welearn that Putnam's Magazine has found in it 'the simplicity and grace ofnaked Grecian statues,' and that Dr. Jos. G. Cogswell, LL.D., hasdeclared that it will live to be appreciated 'as long as the Englishlanguage endures.'  Remembering that prophecy is the most gratuitous formof error, we will not attempt to argue with Dr. Jos. G. Cogswell, LL.D.,but will content ourselves with protesting against such a detestableexpression as 'naked Grecian statues.'  If this be the literary style ofthe future the English language will not endure very long.  As for thepoem itself, the best that one can say of it is that it is a triumph ofconscientious industry.  From an artistic point of view it is a verycommonplace production indeed, and we must protest against such blankverse as the following:   From the hour I saw her first, I was entranced,   Or embosomed in a charmed world, circumscribed   By its proper circumambient atmosphere,   Herself its centre, and wide pervading spirit.   The air all beauty of colour held dissolved,   And tints distilled as dew are shed by heaven.Mr. Griffiths' Sonnets and Other Poems are very simple, which is a goodthing, and very sentimental, which is a thing not quite so good.  As ageneral rule, his verse is full of pretty echoes of other writers, but inone sonnet he makes a distinct attempt to be original and the result isextremely depressing.   Earth wears her grandest robe, by autumn spun,   Like some stout matron who of youth has run   The course, . . .is the most dreadful simile we have ever come across even in poetry.  Mr.Griffiths should beware of originality.  Like beauty, it is a fatal gift.Imitators of Mr. Browning are, unfortunately, common enough, butimitators of Mr. and Mrs. Browning combined are so very rare that we haveread Mr. Francis Prevost's Fires of Green Wood with great interest.  Hereis a curious reproduction of the manner of Aurora Leigh:   But Spring! that part at least our unchaste eyes   Infer from some wind-blown philactery,   (It wears its breast bare also)--chestnut buds,   Pack'd in white wool as though sent here from heaven,   Stretching wild stems to reach each climbing lark   That shouts against the fading stars.And here is a copy of Mr. Browning's mannerisms.  We do not like it quiteso well:      If another      Save all bother,   Hold that perhaps loaves grow like parsnips:      Call the baker      Heaven's care-taker,   Live, die; Death may show him where the farce nips.      Not I; truly      He may duly   Into church or church-day shunt God;      Chink his pocket,      Win your locket;--   Down we go together to confront God.Yet, in spite of these ingenious caricatures there are some good poems,or perhaps we should say some good passages, in Mr. Prevost's volume.  TheWhitening of the Thorn-tree, for instance, opens admirably, and is, insome respects, a rather remarkable story.  We have no doubt that some dayMr. Prevost will be able to study the great masters without stealing fromthem.Mr. John Cameron Grant has christened himself 'England's Empire Poet,'and, lest we should have any doubts upon the subject, tells us that he'dare not lie,' a statement which in a poet seems to show a great want ofcourage.  Protection and Paper-Unionism are the gods of Mr. Grant'sidolatry, and his verse is full of such fine fallacies and masterlymisrepresentations that he should be made Laureate to the Primrose Leagueat once.  Such a stanza as--   Ask the ruined Sugar-worker if he loves the foreign beet--   Rather, one can hear him answer, would I see my children eat--would thrill any Tory tea-party in the provinces, and it would bedifficult for the advocates of Coercion to find a more appropriate or amore characteristic peroration for a stump speech than   We have not to do with justice, right depends on point of view,   The one question for our thought is, what's our neighbour going to do.The hymn to the Union Jack, also, would make a capital leaflet fordistribution in boroughs where the science of heraldry is absolutelyunknown, and the sonnet on Mr. Gladstone is sure to be popular with allwho admire violence and vulgarity in literature.  It is quite worthy ofThersites at his best.Mr. Evans's Caesar Borgia is a very tedious tragedy.  Some of thepassages are in the true 'Ercles' vein,' like the following:   CAESAR (starting up).   Help, Michelotto, help!  Begone!  Begone!   Fiends! torments! devils!  Gandia!  What, Gandia?   O turn those staring eyes away.  See!  See   He bleeds to death!  O fly!  Who are those fiends   That tug me by the throat?  O!  O!  O!  O!  (Pauses.)But, as a rule, the style is of a more commonplace character.  The otherpoems in the volume are comparatively harmless, though it is sad to findShakespeare's 'Bacchus with pink eyne' reappearing as 'pinky-eyedSilenus.'The Cross and the Grail is a collection of poems on the subject oftemperance.  Compared to real poetry these verses are as 'water untowine,' but no doubt this was the effect intended.  The illustrations arequite dreadful, especially one of an angel appearing to a young man fromChicago who seems to be drinking brown sherry.Juvenal in Piccadilly and The Excellent Mystery are two fierce socialsatires and, like most satires, they are the product of the corruptionthey pillory.  The first is written on a very convenient principle.  Blankspaces are left for the names of the victims and these the reader canfill up as he wishes.   Must--bluster,--give the lie,   --wear the night out,--sneer!is an example of this anonymous method.  It does not seem to us veryeffective.  The Excellent Mystery is much better.  It is full of cleverepigrammatic lines, and its wit fully atones for its bitterness.  It ishardly a poem to quote but it is certainly a poem to read.The Chronicle of Mites is a mock-heroic poem about the inhabitants of adecaying cheese who speculate about the origin of their species and holdlearned discussions upon the meaning of evolution and the Gospelaccording to Darwin.  This cheese-epic is a rather unsavoury productionand the style is at times so monstrous and so realistic that the authorshould be called the Gorgon-Zola of literature.(1) Salome.  By J. C. Heywood.

(Kegan Paul.)VENUS OR VICTORY(Pall Mall Gazette, February 24, 1888.)There are certain problems in archaeology that seem to possess a realromantic interest, and foremost among these is the question of the so-called Venus of Melos.  Who is she, this marble mutilated goddess whomGautier loved, to whom Heine bent his knee?  What sculptor wrought her,and for what shrine?  Whose hands walled her up in that rude niche wherethe Melian peasant found her?  What symbol of her divinity did she carry?Was it apple of gold or shield of bronze?  Where is her city and what washer name among gods and men?  The last writer on this fascinating subjectis Mr. Stillman, who in a most interesting book recently published inAmerica, claims that the work of art in question is no sea-born and foam-born Aphrodite, but the very Victory Without Wings that once stood in thelittle chapel outside the gates of the Acropolis at Athens.  So long agoas 1826, that is to say six years after the discovery of the statue, theVenus hypothesis was violently attacked by Millingen, and from that timeto this the battle of the archaeologists has never ceased.  Mr. Stillman,who fights, of course, under Millingen's banner, points out that thestatue is not of the Venus type at all, being far too heroic in characterto correspond to the Greek conception of Aphrodite at any period of theirartistic development, but that it agrees distinctly with certain well-known statues of Victory, such as the celebrated 'Victory of Brescia.'The latter is in bronze, is later, and has the wings, but the type isunmistakable, and though not a reproduction it is certainly arecollection of the Melian statue.  The representation of Victory on thecoin of Agathocles is also obviously of the Melian type, and in themuseum of Naples is a terra-cotta Victory in almost the identical actionand drapery.  As for Dumont d'Urville's statement that, when the statuewas discovered, one hand held an apple and the other a fold of thedrapery, the latter is obviously a mistake, and the whole evidence on thesubject is so contradictory that no reliance can be placed on thestatement made by the French Consul and the French naval officers, noneof whom seems to have taken the trouble to ascertain whether the arm andhand now in the Louvre were really found in the same niche as the statueat all.  At any rate, these fragments seem to be of extremely inferiorworkmanship, and they are so imperfect that they are quite worthless asdata for measure or opinion.  So far, Mr. Stillman is on old ground.  Hisreal artistic discovery is this.  In working about the Acropolis ofAthens, some years ago, he photographed among other sculptures themutilated Victories in the Temple of Nike Apteros, the 'WinglessVictory,' the little Ionic temple in which stood that statue of Victoryof which it was said that '_the Athenians made her without wings that shemight never leave Athens_.'  Looking over the photographs afterwards,when the impression of the comparatively diminutive size had passed, hewas struck with the close resemblance of the type to that of the Melianstatue.  Now, this resemblance is so striking that it cannot bequestioned by any one who has an eye for form.  There are the same largeheroic proportions, the same ampleness of physical development, and thesame treatment of drapery, and there is also that perfect spiritualkinship which, to any true antiquarian, is one of the most valuable modesof evidence.  Now it is generally admitted on both sides that the Melianstatue is probably Attic in its origin, and belongs certainly to theperiod between Phidias and Praxiteles, that is to say, to the age ofScopas, if it be not actually the work of Scopas himself; and as it is toScopas that these bas-reliefs have been always attributed, the similarityof style can, on Mr. Stillman's hypothesis, be easily accounted for.As regards the appearance of the statue in Melos, Mr. Stillman points outthat Melos belonged to Athens as late as she had any Greek allegiance,and that it is probable that the statue was sent there for concealment onthe occasion of some siege or invasion.  When this took place, Mr.Stillman does not pretend to decide with any degree of certainty, but itis evident that it must have been subsequent to the establishment of theRoman hegemony, as the brickwork of the niche in which the statue wasfound is clearly Roman in character, and before the time of Pausanias andPliny, as neither of these antiquaries mentions the statue.  Accepting,then, the statue as that of the Victory Without Wings, Mr. Stillmanagrees with Millingen in supposing that in her left hand she held abronze shield, the lower rim of which rested on the left knee where somemarks of the kind are easily recognisable, while with her right hand shetraced, or had just finished tracing, the names of the great heroes ofAthens.  Valentin's objection, that if this were so the left thigh wouldincline outwards so as to secure a balance, Mr. Stillman meets partly bythe analogy of the Victory of Brescia and partly by the evidence ofNature herself; for he has had a model photographed in the same positionas the statue and holding a shield in the manner he proposes in hisrestoration.  The result is precisely the contrary to that which Valentinassumes.  Of course, Mr. Stillman's solution of the whole matter must notbe regarded as an absolutely scientific demonstration.  It is simply aninduction in which a kind of artistic instinct, not communicable orequally valuable to all people, has had the greatest part, but to thismode of interpretation archaeologists as a class have been far tooindifferent; and it is certain that in the present case it has given us atheory which is most fruitful and suggestive.The little temple of Nike Apteros has had, as Mr. Stillman reminds us, adestiny unique of its kind.  Like the Parthenon, it was standing littlemore than two hundred years ago, but during the Turkish occupation it wasrazed, and its stones all built into the great bastion which covered thefront of the Acropolis and blocked up the staircase to the Propylaea.  Itwas dug out and restored, nearly every stone in its place, by two Germanarchitects during the reign of Otho, and it stands again just asPausanias described it on the spot where old AEgeus watched for thereturn of Theseus from Crete.  In the distance are Salamis and AEgina,and beyond the purple hills lies Marathon.  If the Melian statue beindeed the Victory Without Wings, she had no unworthy shrine.There are some other interesting essays in Mr. Stillman's book on thewonderful topographical knowledge of Ithaca displayed in the Odyssey, anddiscussions of this kind are always interesting as long as there is noattempt to represent Homer as the ordinary literary man; but the articleon the Melian statue is by far the most important and the mostdelightful.  Some people will, no doubt, regret the possibility of thedisappearance of the old name, and as Venus not as Victory will stillworship the stately goddess, but there are others who will be glad to seein her the image and ideal of that spiritual enthusiasm to which Athensowed her liberty, and by which alone can liberty be won.On the Track of Ulysses; together with an Excursion in Quest of the So-called Venus of Melos.  By W. J. Stillman.  (Houghton, Mifflin and Co.,Boston.)LITERARY AND OTHER NOTES--V(Woman's World, March 1888.)The Princess Emily Ruete of Oman and Zanzibar, whose efforts to introducewomen doctors into the East are so well known, has just published a mostinteresting account of her life, under the title of Memoirs of an ArabianPrincess.  The Princess is the daughter of the celebrated Sejid Said,Imam of Mesket and Sultan of Zanzibar, and her long residence in Germanyhas given her the opportunity of comparing Eastern with Westerncivilisation.  She writes in a very simple and unaffected manner; andthough she has many grievances against her brother, the present Sultan(who seems never to have forgiven her for her conversion to Christianityand her marriage with a German subject), she has too much tact, esprit,and good humour to trouble her readers with any dreary record of familyquarrels and domestic differences.  Her book throws a great deal of lighton the question of the position of women in the East, and shows that muchof what has been written on this subject is quite inaccurate.  One of themost curious passages is that in which the Princess gives an account ofher mother:   My mother was a Circassian by birth, who in early youth had been torn   away from her home.  Her father had been a farmer, and she had always   lived peacefully with her parents and her little brother and sister.   War broke out suddenly, and the country was overrun by marauding   bands.  On their approach, the family fled into an underground place,   as my mother called it--she probably meant a cellar, which is not   known in Zanzibar.  Their place of refuge was, however, invaded by a   merciless horde, the parents were slain, and the children carried off   by three mounted Arnauts.   She came into my father's possession when quite a child, probably at   the tender age of seven or eight years, as she cast her first tooth in   our house.  She was at once adopted as playmate by two of my sisters,   her own age, with whom she was educated and brought up.  Together with   them she learnt to read, which raised her a good deal above her   equals, who, as a rule, became members of our family at the age of   sixteen or eighteen years, or older still, when they had outgrown   whatever taste they might once have had for schooling.  She could   scarcely be called pretty; but she was tall and shapely, had black   eyes, and hair down to her knees.  Of a very gentle disposition, her   greatest pleasure consisted in assisting other people, in looking   after and nursing any sick person in the house; and I well remember   her going about with her books from one patient to another, reading   prayers to them.   She was in great favour with my father, who never refused her   anything, though she interceded mostly for others; and when she came   to see him, he always rose to meet her half-way--a distinction he   conferred but very rarely.  She was as kind and pious as she was   modest, and in all her dealings frank and open.  She had another   daughter besides myself, who had died quite young.  Her mental powers   were not great, but she was very clever at needlework.  She had always   been a tender and loving mother to me, but this did not hinder her   from punishing me severely when she deemed it necessary.   She had many friends at Bet-il-Mtoni, which is rarely to be met with   in an Arab harem.  She had the most unshaken and firmest trust in God.   When I was about five years old, I remember a fire breaking out in the   stables close by, one night while my father was at his city residence.   A false alarm spread over the house that we, too, were in imminent   danger; upon which the good woman hastened to take me on her arm, and   her big kuran (we pronounce the word thus) on the other, and hurried   into the open air.  On the rest of her possessions she set no value in   this hour of danger.Here is a description of Schesade, the Sultan's second legitimate wife:   She was a Persian Princess of entrancing beauty, and of inordinate   extravagance.  Her little retinue was composed of one hundred and   fifty cavaliers, all Persians, who lived on the ground floor; with   them she hunted and rode in the broad day--rather contrary to Arab   notions.  The Persian women are subjected to quite a Spartan training   in bodily exercise; they enjoy great liberty, much more so than Arab   women, but they are also more rude in mind and action.   Schesade is said to have carried on her extravagant style of life   beyond bounds; her dresses, cut always after the Persian fashion, were   literally covered with embroideries of pearls.  A great many of these   were picked up nearly every morning by the servants in her rooms,   where she had dropped them from her garments, but the Princess would   never take any of these precious jewels back again.  She did not only   drain my father's exchequer most wantonly, but violated many of our   sacred laws; in fact, she had only married him for his high station   and wealth, and had loved some one else all the time.  Such a state of   things could, of course, only end in a divorce; fortunately Schesade   had no children of her own.  There is a rumour still current among us   that beautiful Schesade was observed, some years after this event,   when my father carried on war in Persia, and had the good fortune of   taking the fortress of Bender Abbas on the Persian Gulf, heading her   troops, and taking aim at the members of our family herself.Another of the remarkable women mentioned by the Princess was herstepmother, Azze-bint-Zef, who seems to have completely ruled the Sultan,and to have settled all questions of home and foreign policy; while hergreat-aunt, the Princess Asche, was regent of the empire during theSultan's minority, and was the heroine of the siege of Mesket.  Of herthe Princess gives the following account:   Dressed in man's clothes, she inspected the outposts herself at night,   she watched and encouraged the soldiers in all exposed places, and was   saved several times only by the speed of her horse in unforeseen   attacks.  One night she rode out, oppressed with care, having just   received information that the enemy was about to attempt an entrance   into the city by means of bribery that night, and with intent to   massacre all; and now she went to convince herself of the loyalty of   her troops.  Very cautiously she rode up to a guard, requesting to   speak to the 'Akid' (the officer in charge), and did all in her power   to seduce him from his duty by great offers of reward on the part of   the besiegers.  The indignation of the brave man, however, completely   allayed her fears as to the fidelity of the troops, but the experiment   nearly cost her her own life.  The soldiers were about to massacre the   supposed spy on the spot, and it required all her presence of mind to   make good her escape.   The situation grew, however, to be very critical at Mesket.  Famine at   last broke out, and the people were well-nigh distracted, as no   assistance or relief could be expected from without.  It was therefore   decided to attempt a last sortie in order to die at least with glory.   There was just sufficient powder left for one more attack, but there   was no more lead for either guns or muskets.  In this emergency the   regent ordered iron nails and pebbles to be used in place of balls.   The guns were loaded with all the old iron and brass that could be   collected, and she opened her treasury to have bullets made out of her   own silver dollars.  Every nerve was strained, and the sally succeeded   beyond all hope.  The enemy was completely taken by surprise and fled   in all directions, leaving more than half their men dead and wounded   on the field.  Mesket was saved, and, delivered out of her deep   distress, the brave woman knelt down on the battlefield and thanked   God in fervent prayer.   From that time her Government was a peaceful one, and she ruled so   wisely that she was able to transfer to her nephew, my father, an   empire so unimpaired as to place him in a position to extend the   empire by the conquest of Zanzibar.  It is to my great-aunt,   therefore, that we owe, and not to an inconsiderable degree, the   acquisition of this second empire.She, too, was an Eastern woman!All through her book the Princess protests against the idea that Orientalwomen are degraded or oppressed, and in the following passage she pointsout how difficult it is for foreigners to get any real information on thesubject:   The education of the children is left entirely to the mother, whether   she be legitimate wife or purchased slave, and it constitutes her   chief happiness.  Some fashionable mothers in Europe shift this duty   on to the nurse, and, by-and-by, on the governess, and are quite   satisfied with looking up their children, or receiving their visits,   once a day.  In France the child is sent to be nursed in the country,   and left to the care of strangers.  An Arab mother, on the other hand,   looks continually after her children.  She watches and nurses them   with the greatest affection, and never leaves them as long as they may   stand in need of her motherly care, for which she is rewarded by the   fondest filial love.   If foreigners had more frequent opportunities to observe the   cheerfulness, the exuberance of spirits even, of Eastern women, they   would soon and more easily be convinced of the untruth of all those   stories afloat about the degraded, oppressed, and listless state of   their life.  It is impossible to gain a true insight into the actual   domesticity in a few moments' visit; and the conversation carried on,   on those formal occasions, hardly deserves that name; there is barely   more than the exchange of a few commonplace remarks--and it is   questionable if even these have been correctly interpreted.   Notwithstanding his innate hospitality, the Arab has the greatest   possible objection to having his home pried into by those of another   land and creed.  Whenever, therefore, a European lady called on us,   the enormous circumference of her hoops (which were the fashion then,   and took up the entire width of the stairs) was the first thing to   strike us dumb with wonder; after which, the very meagre conversation   generally confined itself on both sides to the mysteries of different   costumes; and the lady retired as wise as she was when she came, after   having been sprinkled over with attar of roses, and being the richer   for some parting presents.  It is true she had entered a harem; she   had seen the much-pitied Oriental ladies (though only through their   veils); she had with her own eyes seen our dresses, our jewellery, the   nimbleness with which we sat down on the floor--and that was all.  She   could not boast of having seen more than any other foreign lady who   had called before her.  She is conducted upstairs and downstairs, and   is watched all the time.  Rarely she sees more than the   reception-room, and more rarely still can she guess or find out who   the veiled lady is with whom she conversed.  In short, she has had no   opportunity whatsoever of learning anything of domestic life, or the   position of Eastern women.No one who is interested in the social position of women in the Eastshould fail to read these pleasantly-written memoirs.  The Princess isherself a woman of high culture, and the story of her life is asinstructive as history and as fascinating as fiction.* * * * *Mrs. Oliphant's Makers of Venice is an admirable literary pendant to thesame writer's charming book on Florence, though there is a widedifference between the beautiful Tuscan city and the sea-city of theAdriatic.  Florence, as Mrs. Oliphant points out, is a city full ofmemories of the great figures of the past.  The traveller cannot passalong her streets without treading in the very traces of Dante, withoutstepping on soil made memorable by footprints never to be effaced.  Thegreatness of the surroundings, the palaces, churches, and frowningmediaeval castles in the midst of the city, are all thrown into thebackground by the greatness, the individuality, the living power andvigour of the men who are their originators, and at the same time theirinspiring soul.  But when we turn to Venice the effect is very different.We do not think of the makers of that marvellous city, but rather of whatthey made.  The idealised image of Venice herself meets us everywhere.The mother is not overshadowed by the too great glory of any of her sons.In her records the city is everything--the republic, the worshipped idealof a community in which every man for the common glory seems to have beenwilling to sink his own.  We know that Dante stood within the red wallsof the arsenal, and saw the galleys making and mending, and the pitchflaming up to heaven; Petrarch came to visit the great Mistress of theSea, taking refuge there, 'in this city, true home of the human race,'from trouble, war and pestilence outside; and Byron, with his facileenthusiasms and fervent eloquence, made his home for a time in one of thestately, decaying palaces; but with these exceptions no great poet hasever associated himself with the life of Venice.  She had architects,sculptors and painters, but no singer of her own.  The arts through whichshe gave her message to the world were visible and imitative.  Mrs.Oliphant, in her bright, picturesque style, tells the story of Venicepleasantly and well.  Her account of the two Bellinis is especiallycharming; and the chapters on Titian and Tintoret are admirably written.She concludes her interesting and useful history with the followingwords, which are well worthy of quotation, though I must confess that the'alien modernisms' trouble me not a little:   The critics of recent days have had much to say as to the   deterioration of Venice in her new activity, and the introduction of   alien modernisms, in the shape of steamboats and other new industrial   agents, into her canals and lagoons.  But in this adoption of every   new development of power, Venice is only proving herself the most   faithful representative of the vigorous republic of old.  Whatever   prejudice or angry love may say, we cannot doubt that the Michiels,   the Dandolos, the Foscari, the great rulers who formed Venice, had   steamboats existed in their day, serving their purpose better than   their barges and peati, would have adopted them without hesitation,   without a thought of what any critics might say.  The wonderful new   impulse which has made Italy a great power has justly put strength and   life before those old traditions of beauty, which made her not only   the 'woman country' of Europe, but a sort of Odalisque trading upon   her charms, rather than the nursing mother of a noble and independent   nation.  That in her recoil from that somewhat degrading position, she   may here and there have proved too regardless of the claims of   antiquity, we need not attempt to deny; the new spring of life in her   is too genuine and great to keep her entirely free from this evident   danger.  But it is strange that any one who loves Italy, and sincerely   rejoices in her amazing resurrection, should fail to recognise how   venial is this fault.Miss Mabel Robinson's last novel, The Plan of Campaign, is a verypowerful study of modern political life.  As a concession to humanity,each of the politicians is made to fall in love, and the charm of theirvarious romances fully atones for the soundness of the author's theory ofrent.  Miss Robinson dissects, describes, and discourses with keenscientific insight and minute observation.  Her style, though somewhatlacking in grace, is, at its best, simple and strong.  Richard Talbot andElinor Fetherston are admirably conceived and admirably drawn, and thewhole account of the murder of Lord Roeglass is most dramatic.A Year in Eden, by Harriet Waters Preston, is a chronicle of New Englandlife, and is full of the elaborate subtlety of the American school offiction.  The Eden in question is the little village of Pierpont, and theEve of this provincial paradise is a beautiful girl called MonzaMiddleton, a fascinating, fearless creature, who brings ruin and miseryon all who love her.  Miss Preston writes an admirable prose style, andthe minor characters in the book are wonderfully lifelike and true.The Englishwoman's Year-Book contains a really extraordinary amount ofuseful information on every subject connected with woman's work.  In thecensus taken in 1831 (six years before the Queen ascended the Throne), nooccupation whatever was specified as appertaining to women, except thatof domestic service; but in the census of 1881, the number of occupationsmentioned as followed by women is upwards of three hundred and thirty.The most popular occupations seem to be those of domestic service, schoolteaching, and dressmaking; the lowest numbers on the list are those ofbankers, gardeners, and persons engaged in scientific pursuits.  Besidesthese, the Year-Book makes mention of stockbroking and conveyancing asprofessions that women are beginning to adopt.  The historical account ofthe literary work done by Englishwomen in this century, as given in theYear-Book, is curiously inadequate, and the list of women's magazines isnot complete, but in all other respects the publication seems a mostuseful and excellent one.* * * * *Wordsworth, in one of his interesting letters to Lady Beaumont, says thatit is 'an awful truth that there neither is nor can be any genuineenjoyment of poetry among nineteen out of twenty of those persons wholive or wish to live in the broad light of the world--among those whoeither are, or are striving to make themselves, people of considerationin society,' adding that the mission of poetry is 'to console theafflicted; to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier; toteach the young and the gracious of every age to see, to think, and feel,and, therefore, to become more actively and securely virtuous.'  I am,however, rather disposed to think that the age in which we live is onethat has a very genuine enjoyment of poetry, though we may no longeragree with Wordsworth's ideas on the subject of the poet's propermission; and it is interesting to note that this enjoyment manifestsitself by creation even more than by criticism.  To realise thepopularity of the great poets, one should turn to the minor poets and seewhom they follow, what master they select, whose music they echo.  Atpresent, there seems to be a reaction in favour of Lord Tennyson, if weare to judge by Rachel and Other Poems, which is a rather remarkablelittle volume in its way.  The poem that gives its title to the book isfull of strong lines and good images; and, in spite of its Tennysonianechoes, there is something attractive in such verses as the following:   Day by day along the Orient faintly glows the tender dawn,   Day by day the pearly dewdrops tremble on the upland lawn:   Day by day the star of morning pales before the coming ray,   And the first faint streak of radiance brightens to the perfect day.   Day by day the rosebud gathers to itself, from earth and sky,   Fragrant stores and ampler beauty, lovelier form and deeper dye:   Day by day a richer crimson mantles in its glowing breast--   Every golden hour conferring some sweet grace that crowns the rest.   And thou canst not tell the moment when the day ascends her throne,   When the morning star hath vanished, and the rose is fully blown.   So each day fulfils its purpose, calm, unresting, strong, and sure,   Moving onward to completion, doth the work of God endure.   How unlike man's toil and hurry! how unlike the noise, the strife,   All the pain of incompleteness, all the weariness of life!   Ye look upward and take courage.  He who leads the golden hours,   Feeds the birds, and clothes the lily, made these human hearts of   ours:   Knows their need, and will supply it, manna falling day by day,   Bread from heaven, and food of angels, all along the desert way.The Secretary of the International Technical College at Bedford hasissued a most interesting prospectus of the aims and objects of theInstitution.  The College seems to be intended chiefly for ladies whohave completed their ordinary course of English studies, and it will bedivided into two departments, Educational and Industrial.  In the latter,classes will be held for various decorative and technical arts, and forwood-carving, etching, and photography, as well as sick-nursing,dressmaking, cookery, physiology, poultry-rearing, and the cultivation offlowers.  The curriculum certainly embraces a wonderful amount ofsubjects, and I have no doubt that the College will supply a real want.* * * * *The Ladies' Employment Society has been so successful that it has movedto new premises in Park Street, Grosvenor Square, where there are somevery pretty and useful things for sale.  The children's smocks are quitecharming, and seem very inexpensive.  The subscription to the Society isone guinea a year, and a commission of five per cent. is charged on eachthing sold.* * * * *Miss May Morris, whose exquisite needle-work is well known, has justcompleted a pair of curtains for a house in Boston.  They are amongst themost perfect specimens of modern embroidery that I have seen, and arefrom Miss Morris's own design.  I am glad to hear that Miss Morris hasdetermined to give lessons in embroidery.  She has a thorough knowledgeof the art, her sense of beauty is as rare as it is refined, and herpower of design is quite remarkable.Mrs. Jopling's life-classes for ladies have been such a success that asimilar class has been started in Chelsea by Mr. Clegg Wilkinson at theCarlyle Studios, King's Road.  Mr. Wilkinson (who is a very brilliantyoung painter) is strongly of opinion that life should be studied fromlife itself, and not from that abstract presentation of life which wefind in Greek marbles--a position which I have always held very stronglymyself.(1) Memoirs of an Arabian Princess.

(Cornish Brothers.)THE POETS' CORNER--VI(Pall Mall Gazette, April 6, 1888.)David Westren, by Mr. Alfred Hayes, is a long narrative poem inTennysonian blank verse, a sort of serious novel set to music.  It issomewhat lacking in actuality, and the picturesque style in which it iswritten rather contributes to this effect, lending the story beauty butrobbing it of truth.  Still, it is not without power, and cultured verseis certainly a pleasanter medium for story-telling than coarse and commonprose.  The hero of the poem is a young clergyman of the muscularChristian school:   A lover of good cheer; a bubbling source   Of jest and tale; a monarch of the gun;   A dreader tyrant of the darting trout   Than that bright bird whose azure lightning threads   The brooklet's bowery windings; the red fox   Did well to seek the boulder-strewn hill-side,   When Westren cheered her dappled foes; the otter   Had cause to rue the dawn when Westren's form   Loomed through the streaming bracken, to waylay   Her late return from plunder, the rough pack   Barking a jealous welcome round their friend.One day he meets on the river a lovely girl who is angling, and helps herto land   A gallant fish, all flashing in the sun   In silver mail inlaid with scarlet gems,   His back thick-sprinkled as a leopard's hide   With rich brown spots, and belly of bright gold.They naturally fall in love with each other and marry, and for many yearsDavid Westren leads a perfectly happy life.  Suddenly calamity comes uponhim, his wife and children die and he finds himself alone and desolate.Then begins his struggle.  Like Job, he cries out against the injusticeof things, and his own personal sorrow makes him realise the sorrow andmisery of the world.  But the answer that satisfied Job does not satisfyhim.  He finds no comfort in contemplating Leviathan:   As if we lacked reminding of brute force,   As if we never felt the clumsy hoof,   As if the bulk of twenty million whales   Were worth one pleading soul, or all the laws   That rule the lifeless suns could soothe the sense   Of outrage in a loving human heart!   Sublime? majestic?  Ay, but when our trust   Totters, and faith is shattered to the base,   Grand words will not uprear it.Mr. Hayes states the problem of life extremely well, but his solution issadly inadequate both from a psychological and from a dramatic point ofview.  David Westren ultimately becomes a mild Unitarian, a sort ofpastoral Stopford Brooke with leanings towards Positivism, and we leavehim preaching platitudes to a village congregation.  However, in spite ofthis commonplace conclusion there is a great deal in Mr. Hayes's poemthat is strong and fine, and he undoubtedly possesses a fair ear formusic and a remarkable faculty of poetical expression.  Some of hisdescriptive touches of nature, such as   In meeting woods, whereon a film of mist   Slept like the bloom upon the purple grape,are very graceful and suggestive, and he will probably make his mark inliterature.There is much that is fascinating in Mr. Rennell Rodd's last volume, TheUnknown Madonna and Other Poems.  Mr. Rodd looks at life with all thecharming optimism of a young man, though he is quite conscious of thefact that a stray note of melancholy, here and there, has an artistic aswell as a popular value; he has a keen sense of the pleasurableness ofcolour, and his verse is distinguished by a certain refinement and purityof outline; though not passionate he can play very prettily with thewords of passion, and his emotions are quite healthy and quite harmless.In Excelsis, the most ambitious poem in the book, is somewhat tooabstract and metaphysical, and such lines as   Lift thee o'er thy 'here' and 'now,'   Look beyond thine 'I' and 'thou,'are excessively tedious.  But when Mr. Rodd leaves the problem of theUnconditioned to take care of itself, and makes no attempt to solve themysteries of the Ego and the non-Ego, he is very pleasant reading indeed.A Mazurka of Chopin is charming, in spite of the awkwardness of the fifthline, and so are the verses on Assisi, and those on San Servolo atVenice.  These last have all the brilliancy of a clever pastel.  Theprettiest thing in the whole volume is this little lyric on Spring:   Such blue of sky, so palely fair,   Such glow of earth, such lucid air!   Such purple on the mountain lines,   Such deep new verdure in the pines!   The live light strikes the broken towers,   The crocus bulbs burst into flowers,   The sap strikes up the black vine stock,   And the lizard wakes in the splintered rock,   And the wheat's young green peeps through the sod,   And the heart is touched with a thought of God;   The very silence seems to sing,   It must be Spring, it must be Spring!We do not care for 'palely fair' in the first line, and the repetition ofthe word 'strikes' is not very felicitous, but the grace of movement anddelicacy of touch are pleasing.The Wind, by Mr. James Ross, is a rather gusty ode, written apparentlywithout any definite scheme of metre, and not very impressive as it lacksboth the strength of the blizzard and the sweetness of Zephyr.  Here isthe opening:      The roaming, tentless wind      No rest can ever find--   From east, and west, and south, and north   He is for ever driven forth!      From the chill east   Where fierce hyaenas seek their awful feast:      From the warm west,   By beams of glitt'ring summer blest.Nothing could be much worse than this, and if the line 'Where fiercehyaenas seek their awful feast' is intended to frighten us, it entirelymisses its effect.  The ode is followed by some sonnets which aredestined, we fear, to be ludibria ventis.  Immortality, even in thenineteenth century, is not granted to those who rhyme 'awe' and 'war'together.Mr. Isaac Sharp's Saul of Tarsus is an interesting, and, in somerespects, a fine poem.   Saul of Tarsus, silently,   With a silent company,   To Damascus' gates drew nigh.   * * * * *   And his eyes, too, and his mien   Were, as are the eagles, keen;   All the man was aquiline--are two strong, simple verses, and indeed the spirit of the whole poem isdignified and stately.  The rest of the volume, however, isdisappointing.  Ordinary theology has long since converted its gold intolead, and words and phrases that once touched the heart of the world havebecome wearisome and meaningless through repetition.  If Theology desiresto move us, she must re-write her formulas.There is something very pleasant in coming across a poet who canapostrophise Byron as      transcendent star   That gems the firmament of poesy,and can speak of Longfellow as a 'mighty Titan.'  Reckless panegyrics ofthis kind show a kindly nature and a good heart, and Mr. Mackenzie'sHighland Daydreams could not possibly offend any one.  It must beadmitted that they are rather old-fashioned, but this is usually the casewith natural spontaneous verse.  It takes a great artist to be thoroughlymodern.  Nature is always a little behind the age.The Story of the Cross, an attempt to versify the Gospel narratives, is astrange survival of the Tate and Brady school of poetry.  Mr. Nash, whostyles himself 'a humble soldier in the army of Faith,' expresses a hopethat his book may 'invigorate devotional feeling, especially among theyoung, to whom verse is perhaps more attractive than to their elders,'but we should be sorry to think that people of any age could admire sucha paraphrase as the following:   Foxes have holes, in which to slink for rest,   The birds of air find shelter in the nest;   But He, the Son of Man and Lord of all,   Has no abiding place His own to call.It is a curious fact that the worst work is always done with the bestintentions, and that people are never so trivial as when they takethemselves very seriously.(1) David Westren.

CARO ON GEORGE SAND(Pall Mall Gazette, April 14, 1888.)The biography of a very great man from the pen of a very ladylikewriter--this is the best description we can give of M. Caro's Life ofGeorge Sand.  The late Professor of the Sorbonne could chatter charminglyabout culture, and had all the fascinating insincerity of an accomplishedphrase-maker; being an extremely superior person he had a great contemptfor Democracy and its doings, but he was always popular with theDuchesses of the Faubourg, as there was nothing in history or inliterature that he could not explain away for their edification; havingnever done anything remarkable he was naturally elected a member of theAcademy, and he always remained loyal to the traditions of thatthoroughly respectable and thoroughly pretentious institution.  In fact,he was just the sort of man who should never have attempted to write aLife of George Sand or to interpret George Sand's genius.  He was toofeminine to appreciate the grandeur of that large womanly nature, toomuch of a dilettante to realise the masculine force of that strong andardent mind.  He never gets at the secret of George Sand, and neverbrings us near to her wonderful personality.  He looks on her simply as alitterateur, as a writer of pretty stories of country life and ofcharming, if somewhat exaggerated, romances.  But George Sand was muchmore than this.  Beautiful as are such books as Consuelo and Mauprat,Francois le Champi and La Mare au Diable, yet in none of them is sheadequately expressed, by none of them is she adequately revealed.  As Mr.Matthew Arnold said, many years ago, 'We do not know George Sand unlesswe feel the spirit which goes through her work as a whole.'  With thisspirit, however, M. Caro has no sympathy.  Madame Sand's doctrines areantediluvian, he tells us, her philosophy is quite dead and her ideas ofsocial regeneration are Utopian, incoherent and absurd.  The best thingfor us to do is to forget these silly dreams and to read Teverino and LeSecretaire Intime.  Poor M. Caro!  This spirit, which he treats with suchairy flippancy, is the very leaven of modern life.  It is remoulding theworld for us and fashioning our age anew.  If it is antediluvian, it isso because the deluge is yet to come; if it is Utopian, then Utopia mustbe added to our geographies.  To what curious straits M. Caro is drivenby his violent prejudices may be estimated by the fact that he tries toclass George Sand's novels with the old Chansons de geste, the stories ofadventure characteristic of primitive literatures; whereas in usingfiction as a vehicle of thought, and romance as a means of influencingthe social ideals of her age, George Sand was merely carrying out thetraditions of Voltaire and Rousseau, of Diderot and of Chateaubriand.  Thenovel, says M. Caro, must be allied either to poetry or to science.  Thatit has found in philosophy one of its strongest allies seems not to haveoccurred to him.  In an English critic such a view might possibly beexcusable.  Our greatest novelists, such as Fielding, Scott and Thackeraycared little for the philosophy of their age.  But coming, as it does,from a French critic, the statement seems to show a strange want ofrecognition of one of the most important elements of French fiction.  Nor,even in the narrow limits that he has imposed upon himself, can M. Carobe said to be a very fortunate or felicitous critic.  To take merely oneinstance out of many, he says nothing of George Sand's delightfultreatment of art and the artist's life.  And yet how exquisitely does sheanalyse each separate art and present it to us in its relation to life!In Consuelo she tells us of music; in Horace of authorship; in Le Chateaudes Desertes of acting; in Les Maitres Mosaistes of mosaic work; in LeChateau de Pictordu of portrait painting; and in La Daniella of thepainting of landscape.  What Mr. Ruskin and Mr. Browning have done forEngland she did for France.  She invented an art literature.  It isunnecessary, however, to discuss any of M. Caro's minor failings, for thewhole effect of the book, so far as it attempts to portray for us thescope and character of George Sand's genius, is entirely spoiled by thefalse attitude assumed from the beginning, and though the dictum may seemto many harsh and exclusive, we cannot help feeling that an absoluteincapacity for appreciating the spirit of a great writer is noqualification for writing a treatise on the subject.As for Madame Sand's private life, which is so intimately connected withher art (for, like Goethe, she had to live her romances before she couldwrite them), M. Caro says hardly anything about it.  He passes it overwith a modesty that almost makes one blush, and for fear of wounding thesusceptibilities of those grandes dames whose passions M. Paul Bourgetanalyses with such subtlety, he transforms her mother, who was a typicalFrench grisette, into 'a very amiable and spirituelle milliner'!  It mustbe admitted that Joseph Surface himself could hardly show greater tactand delicacy, though we ourselves must plead guilty to preferring MadameSand's own description of her as an 'enfant du vieux pave de Paris.'As regards the English version, which is by M. Gustave Masson, it may beup to the intellectual requirements of the Harrow schoolboys, but it willhardly satisfy those who consider that accuracy, lucidity and ease areessential to a good translation.  Its carelessness is absolutelyastounding, and it is difficult to understand how a publisher like Mr.Routledge could have allowed such a piece of work to issue from hispress.  'Il descend avec le sourire d'un Machiavel' appears as 'hedescends into the smile of a Machiavelli'; George Sand's remark toFlaubert about literary style, 'tu la consideres comme un but, elle n'estqu'un effet' is translated 'you consider it an end, it is merely aneffort'; and such a simple phrase as 'ainsi le veut Festhe'tique duroman' is converted into 'so the aesthetes of the world would have it.''Il faudra relacher mes Economies' is 'I will have to draw upon mysavings,' not 'my economies will assuredly be relaxed'; 'cassuresresineuses' is not 'cleavages full of rosin,' and 'Mme. Sand ne reussitque deux fois' is hardly 'Madame Sand was not twice successful.''Querelles d'ecole' does not mean 'school disputations'; 'ceux qui sefont une sorte d'esthetique de l'indifference absolue' is not 'those ofwhich the aesthetics seem to be an absolute indifference'; 'chimere'should not be translated 'chimera,' nor 'lettres ineditees' 'ineditedletters'; 'ridicules' means absurdities, not 'ridicules,' and 'qui pourradefinir sa pensee?' is not 'who can clearly despise her thought?'  M.Masson comes to grief over even such a simple sentence as 'elle s'etonnades fureurs qui accueillirent ce livre, ne comprenant pas que l'on haisseun auteur a travers son oeuvre,' which he translates 'she was surprisedat the storm which greeted this book, _not understanding that the authoris hated through his work_.'  Then, passing over such phrases as'substituted by religion' instead of 'replaced by religion,' and'vulgarisation' where 'popularisation' is meant, we come to that mostirritating form of translation, the literal word-for-word style.  Thestream 'excites itself by the declivity which it obeys' is one of M.Masson's finest achievements in this genre, and it is an admirableinstance of the influence of schoolboys on their masters.  However, itwould be tedious to make a complete 'catalogue of slips,' so we willcontent ourselves by saying that M. Masson's translation is not merelyquite unworthy of himself, but is also quite undeserved by the public.Nowadays, the public has its feelings.George Sand.  By the late Elme Marie Caro.  Translated by Gustave Masson,B.A., Assistant Master, Harrow School.  'Great French Writers' Series.(Routledge and Sons.)THE POETS' CORNER--VII(Pall Mall Gazette, October 24, 1888.)Mr. Ian Hamilton's Ballad of Hadji is undeniably clever.  Hadji is awonderful Arab horse that a reckless hunter rides to death in the pursuitof a wild boar, and the moral of the poem--for there is a moral--seems tobe that an absorbing passion is a very dangerous thing and blunts thehuman sympathies.  In the course of the chase a little child is drowned,a Brahmin maiden murdered, and an aged peasant severely wounded, but thehunter cares for none of these things and will not hear of stopping torender any assistance.  Some of the stanzas are very graceful, notablyone beginning   Yes--like a bubble filled with smoke--   The curd-white moon upswimming broke   The vacancy of space;but such lines as the following, which occur in the description of thefight with the boar--   I hung as close as keepsake locket   On maiden breast--but from its socket   He wrenched my bridle arm,are dreadful, and 'his brains festooned the thorn' is not a very happyway of telling the reader how the boar died.  All through the volume wefind the same curious mixture of good and bad.  To say that the sunkisses the earth 'with flame-moustachoed lip' is awkward and uncouth, andyet the poem in which the expression occurs has some pretty lines.  Mr.Ian Hamilton should prune.  Pruning, whether in the garden or in thestudy, is a most healthy and useful employment.  The volume is nicelyprinted, but Mr. Strang's frontispiece is not a great success, and mostof the tail-pieces seem to have been designed without any reference tothe size of the page.Mr. Catty dedicates his book to the memory of Wordsworth, Shelley,Coleridge and Keats--a somewhat pompous signboard for such very ordinarywine--and an inscription in golden letters on the cover informs us thathis poems are 'addressed to the rising generation,' whom, he tells uselsewhere, he is anxious to initiate into the great comprehensive truththat 'Virtue is no other than self-interest, deeply understood.'  Inorder to further this laudable aim he has written a very tedious blankverse poem which he calls The Secret of Content, but it certainly doesnot convey that secret to the reader.  It is heavy, abstract and prosaic,and shows how intolerably dull a man can be who has the best intentionsand the most earnest beliefs.  In the rest of the volume, where Mr. Cattydoes not take himself quite so seriously, there are some rather pleasingthings.  The sonnet on Shelley's room at University College would beadmirable but for the unmusical character of the last line.   Green in the wizard arms   Of the foam-bearded Atlantic,   An isle of old enchantment,   A melancholy isle,   Enchanted and dreaming lies;   And there, by Shannon's flowing   In the moonlight, spectre-thin,   The spectre Erin sits.   Wail no more, lonely one, mother of exile wail no more,   Banshee of the world--no more!   Thy sorrows are the world's, thou art no more alone;   Thy wrongs the world's--are the first and last stanzas of Mr. Todhunter's poem The Banshee.  Tothrow away the natural grace of rhyme from a modern song is, as Mr.Swinburne once remarked, a wilful abdication of half the power and halfthe charm of verse, and we cannot say that Mr. Todhunter has given usmuch that consoles us for its loss.  Part of his poem reads like atranslation of an old Bardic song, part of it like rough material forpoetry, and part of it like misshapen prose.  It is an interestingspecimen of poetic writing but it is not a perfect work of art.  It isamorphous and inchoate, and the same must be said of the two other poems,The Doom of the Children of Lir, and The Lamentation for the Sons ofTurann.  Rhyme gives architecture as well as melody to song, and thoughthe lovely lute-builded walls of Thebes may have risen up to unrhymedchoral metres, we have had no modern Amphion to work such wonders for us.Such a verse as--   Five were the chiefs who challenged   By their deeds the Over-kingship,   Bov Derg, the Daghda's son, Ilbrac of Assaroe,   And Lir of the White Field in the plain of Emain Macha;   And after them stood up Midhir the proud, who reigned   Upon the hills of Bri,   Of Bri the loved of Liath, Bri of the broken heart;   And last was Angus Og; all these had many voices,   But for Bov Derg were most,has, of course, an archaeological interest, but has no artistic value atall.  Indeed, from the point of view of art, the few little poems at theend of the volume are worth all the ambitious pseudo-epics that Mr.Todhunter has tried to construct out of Celtic lore.  A Bacchic Day ischarming, and the sonnet on the open-air performance of The FaithfullShepherdesse is most gracefully phrased and most happy in conception.Mr. Peacock is an American poet, and Professor Thomas Danleigh Supplee,A.M., Ph.D., F.R.S., who has written a preface to his Poems of the Plainsand Songs of the Solitudes, tells us that he is entitled to be called theLaureate of the West.  Though a staunch Republican, Mr. Peacock,according to the enthusiastic Professor, is not ashamed of his ancestorKing William of Holland, nor of his relatives Lord and Lady Peacock who,it seems, are natives of Scotland.  He was brought up at Zanesville,Muskingum Co., Ohio, where his father edited the Zanesville Aurora, andhe had an uncle who was 'a superior man' and edited the WheelingIntelligencer.  His poems seem to be extremely popular, and have beenhighly praised, the Professor informs us, by Victor Hugo, the SaturdayReview and the Commercial Advertiser.  The preface is the most amusingpart of the book, but the poems also are worth studying.  The Maniac, TheBandit Chief, and The Outlaw can hardly be called light reading, but westrongly recommend the poem on Chicago:   Chicago! great city of the West!   All that wealth, all that power invest;   Thou sprang like magic from the sand,   As touched by the magician's wand.'Thou sprang' is slightly depressing, and the second line is ratherobscure, but we should not measure by too high a standard the untutoredutterances of artless nature.  The opening lines of The Vendetta alsodeserve mention:   When stars are glowing through day's gloaming glow,   Reflecting from ocean's deep, mighty flow,   At twilight, when no grim shadows of night,   Like ghouls, have stalked in wake of the light.The first line is certainly a masterpiece, and, indeed, the whole volumeis full of gems of this kind.  The Professor remarks in his elaboratepreface that Mr. Peacock 'frequently rises to the sublime,' and the twopassages quoted above show how keenly critical is his taste in thesematters and how well the poet deserves his panegyric.Mr. Alexander Skene Smith's Holiday Recreations and Other Poems isheralded by a preface for which Principal Cairns is responsible.Principal Cairns claims that the life-story enshrined in Mr. Smith'spoems shows the wide diffusion of native fire and literary culture in allparts of Scotland, 'happily under higher auspices than those of merepoetic impulse.'  This is hardly a very felicitous way of introducing apoet, nor can we say that Mr. Smith's poems are distinguished by eitherfire or culture.  He has a placid, pleasant way of writing, and, indeed,his verses cannot do any harm, though he really should not publish suchattempts at metrical versions of the Psalms as the following:   A septuagenarian      We frequently may see;   An octogenarian      If one should live to be,   He is a burden to himself      With weariness and woe   And soon he dies, and off he flies,      And leaveth all below.The 'literary culture' that produced these lines is, we fear, not of avery high order.'I study Poetry simply as a fine art by which I may exercise my intellectand elevate my taste,' wrote the late Mr. George Morine many years ago toa friend, and the little posthumous volume that now lies before uscontains the record of his quiet literary life.  One of the sonnets, thatentitled Sunset, appeared in Mr. Waddington's anthology, about ten yearsafter Mr. Morine's death, but this is the first time that his collectedpoems have been published.  They are often distinguished by a grave andchastened beauty of style, and their solemn cadences have something ofthe 'grand manner' about them.  The editor, Mr. Wilton, to whom Mr.Morine bequeathed his manuscripts, seems to have performed his task withgreat tact and judgment, and we hope that this little book will meet withthe recognition that it deserves.(1) The Ballad of Hadji and Other Poems.

Lefebure's history ofEmbroidery and Lace is one of the most fascinating books that hasappeared on this delightful subject.  M. Lefebure is one of theadministrators of the Musee des Arts Decoratifs at Paris, besides being alace manufacturer; and his work has not merely an important historicalvalue, but as a handbook of technical instruction it will be found of thegreatest service by all needle-women.  Indeed, as the translator himselfpoints out, M. Lefebure's book suggests the question whether it is notrather by the needle and the bobbin, than by the brush, the graver or thechisel, that the influence of woman should assert itself in the arts.  InEurope, at any rate, woman is sovereign in the domain of art-needle-work,and few men would care to dispute with her the right of using thosedelicate implements so intimately associated with the dexterity of hernimble and slender fingers; nor is there any reason why the productionsof embroidery should not, as Mr. Alan Cole suggests, be placed on thesame level with those of painting, engraving and sculpture, though theremust always be a great difference between those purely decorative artsthat glorify their own material and the more imaginative arts in whichthe material is, as it were, annihilated, and absorbed into the creationof a new form.  In the beautifying of modern houses it certainly must beadmitted--indeed, it should be more generally recognised than it is--thatrich embroidery on hangings and curtains, portieres, couches and thelike, produces a far more decorative and far more artistic effect thancan be gained from our somewhat wearisome English practice of coveringthe walls with pictures and engravings; and the almost completedisappearance of embroidery from dress has robbed modern costume of oneof the chief elements of grace and fancy.That, however, a great improvement has taken place in English embroideryduring the last ten or fifteen years cannot, I think, be denied.  It isshown, not merely in the work of individual artists, such as Mrs.Holiday, Miss May Morris and others, but also in the admirableproductions of the South Kensington School of Embroidery (thebest--indeed, the only really good--school that South Kensington hasproduced).  It is pleasant to note, on turning over the leaves of M.Lefebure's book, that in this we are merely carrying out certain oldtraditions of Early English art.  In the seventh century, St. Ethelreda,first abbess of the Monastery of Ely, made an offering to St. Cuthbert ofa sacred ornament she had worked with gold and precious stones, and thecope and maniple of St. Cuthbert, which are preserved at Durham, areconsidered to be specimens of opus Anglicanum.  In the year 800, theBishop of Durham allotted the income of a farm of two hundred acres forlife to an embroideress named Eanswitha, in consideration of her keepingin repair the vestments of the clergy in his diocese.  The battlestandard of King Alfred was embroidered by Danish princesses; and theAnglo-Saxon Gudric gave Alcuid a piece of land, on condition that sheinstructed his daughter in needle-work.  Queen Mathilda bequeathed to theAbbey of the Holy Trinity at Caen a tunic embroidered at Winchester bythe wife of one Alderet; and when William presented himself to theEnglish nobles, after the Battle of Hastings, he wore a mantle coveredwith Anglo-Saxon embroideries, which is probably, M. Lefebure suggests,the same as that mentioned in the inventory of the Bayeux Cathedral,where, after the entry relating to the broderie a telle (representing theconquest of England), two mantles are described--one of King William,'all of gold, powdered with crosses and blossoms of gold, and edged alongthe lower border with an orphrey of figures.'  The most splendid exampleof the opus Anglicanum now in existence is, of course, the Syon cope atthe South Kensington Museum; but English work seems to have beencelebrated all over the Continent.  Pope Innocent IV. so admired thesplendid vestments worn by the English clergy in 1246, that he orderedsimilar articles from Cistercian monasteries in England.  St. Dunstan,the artistic English monk, was known as a designer for embroideries; andthe stole of St. Thomas a Becket is still preserved in the cathedral atSens, and shows us the interlaced scroll-forms used by Anglo-Saxon MS.illuminators.How far this modern artistic revival of rich and delicate embroidery willbear fruit depends, of course, almost entirely on the energy and studythat women are ready to devote to it; but I think that it must beadmitted that all our decorative arts in Europe at present have, atleast, this element of strength--that they are in immediate relationshipwith the decorative arts of Asia.  Wherever we find in European history arevival of decorative art, it has, I fancy, nearly always been due toOriental influence and contact with Oriental nations.  Our own keenlyintellectual art has more than once been ready to sacrifice realdecorative beauty either to imitative presentation or to ideal motive.  Ithas taken upon itself the burden of expression, and has sought tointerpret the secrets of thought and passion.  In its marvellous truth ofpresentation it has found its strength, and yet its weakness is therealso.  It is never with impunity that an art seeks to mirror life.  IfTruth has her revenge upon those who do not follow her, she is oftenpitiless to her worshippers.  In Byzantium the two arts met--Greek art,with its intellectual sense of form, and its quick sympathy withhumanity; Oriental art, with its gorgeous materialism, its frankrejection of imitation, its wonderful secrets of craft and colour, itssplendid textures, its rare metals and jewels, its marvellous andpriceless traditions.  They had, indeed, met before, but in Byzantiumthey were married; and the sacred tree of the Persians, the palm ofZoroaster, was embroidered on the hem of the garments of the Westernworld.  Even the Iconoclasts, the Philistines of theological history,who, in one of those strange outbursts of rage against Beauty that seemto occur only amongst European nations, rose up against the wonder andmagnificence of the new art, served merely to distribute its secrets morewidely; and in the Liber Pontificalis, written in 687 by Athanasius, thelibrarian, we read of an influx into Rome of gorgeous embroideries, thework of men who had arrived from Constantinople and from Greece.  Thetriumph of the Mussulman gave the decorative art of Europe a newdeparture--that very principle of their religion that forbade the actualrepresentation of any object in nature being of the greatest artisticservice to them, though it was not, of course, strictly carried out.  TheSaracens introduced into Sicily the art of weaving silken and goldenfabrics; and from Sicily the manufacture of fine stuffs spread to theNorth of Italy, and became localised in Genoa, Florence, Venice, andother towns.  A still greater art-movement took place in Spain under theMoors and Saracens, who brought over workmen from Persia to makebeautiful things for them.  M. Lefebure tells us of Persian embroiderypenetrating as far as Andalusia; and Almeria, like Palermo, had its Hoteldes Tiraz, which rivalled the Hotel des Tiraz at Bagdad, tiraz being thegeneric name for ornamental tissues and costumes made with them.  Spangles(those pretty little discs of gold, silver, or polished steel, used incertain embroidery for dainty glinting effects) were a Saracenicinvention; and Arabic letters often took the place of letters in theRoman characters for use in inscriptions upon embroidered robes andMiddle Age tapestries, their decorative value being so much greater.  Thebook of crafts by Etienne Boileau, provost of the merchants in 1258-1268,contains a curious enumeration of the different craft-guilds of Paris,among which we find 'the tapiciers, or makers of the tapis sarrasinois(or Saracen cloths), who say that their craft is for the service only ofchurches, or great men like kings and counts'; and, indeed, even in ourown day, nearly all our words descriptive of decorative textures anddecorative methods point to an Oriental origin.  What the inroads of theMohammedans did for Sicily and Spain, the return of the Crusaders did forthe other countries of Europe.  The nobles who left for Palestine clad inarmour, came back in the rich stuffs of the East; and their costumes,pouches (aumonieres sarra-sinoises), and caparisons excited theadmiration of the needle-workers of the West.  Matthew Paris says that atthe sacking of Antioch, in 1098, gold, silver and priceless costumes wereso equally distributed among the Crusaders, that many who the nightbefore were famishing and imploring relief, suddenly found themselvesoverwhelmed with wealth; and Robert de Clair tells us of the wonderfulfetes that followed the capture of Constantinople.  The thirteenthcentury, as M. Lefebure points out, was conspicuous for an increaseddemand in the West for embroidery.  Many Crusaders made offerings tochurches of plunder from Palestine; and St. Louis, on his return from thefirst Crusade, offered thanks at St. Denis to God for mercies bestowed onhim during his six years' absence and travel, and presented some richly-embroidered stuffs to be used on great occasions as coverings to thereliquaries containing the relics of holy martyrs.  European embroidery,having thus become possessed of new materials and wonderful methods,developed on its own intellectual and imitative lines, inclining, as itwent on, to the purely pictorial, and seeking to rival painting, and toproduce landscapes and figure-subjects with elaborate perspective andsubtle aerial effects.  A fresh Oriental influence, however, came throughthe Dutch and the Portuguese, and the famous Compagnie des Grandes Indes;and M. Lefebure gives an illustration of a door-hanging now in the ClunyMuseum, where we find the French fleurs-de-lys intermixed with Indianornament.  The hangings of Madame de Maintenon's room at Fontainebleau,which were embroidered at St. Cyr, represent Chinese scenery upon ajonquil-yellow ground.Clothes were sent out ready cut to the East to be embroidered, and manyof the delightful coats of the period of Louis XV. and Louis XVI. owetheir dainty decoration to the needles of Chinese artists.  In our ownday the influence of the East is strongly marked.  Persia has sent us hercarpets for patterns, and Cashmere her lovely shawls, and India herdainty muslins finely worked with gold thread palmates, and stitched overwith iridescent beetles' wings.  We are beginning now to dye by Orientalmethods, and the silk robes of China and Japan have taught us new wondersof colour-combination, and new subtleties of delicate design.  Whether wehave yet learned to make a wise use of what we have acquired is lesscertain.  If books produce an effect, this book of M. Lefebure shouldcertainly make us study with still deeper interest the whole question ofembroidery, and by those who already work with their needles it will befound full of most fertile suggestion and most admirable advice.Even to read of the marvellous works of embroidery that were fashioned inbygone ages is pleasant.  Time has kept a few fragments of Greekembroidery of the fourth century B.C. for us.  One is figured in M.Lefebure's book--a chain-stitch embroidery of yellow flax upon a mulberry-coloured worsted material, with graceful spirals and palmetto-patterns:and another, a tapestried cloth powdered with ducks, was reproduced inthe Woman's World some months ago for an article by Mr. Alan Cole. {334a}Now and then we find in the tomb of some dead Egyptian a piece ofdelicate work.  In the treasury at Ratisbon is preserved a specimen ofByzantine embroidery on which the Emperor Constantine is depicted ridingon a white palfrey, and receiving homage from the East and West.  Metzhas a red silk cope wrought with great eagles, the gift of Charlemagne,and Bayeux the needle-wrought epic of Queen Matilda.  But where is thegreat crocus-coloured robe, wrought for Athena, on which the gods foughtagainst the giants?  Where is the huge velarium that Nero stretchedacross the Colosseum at Rome, on which was represented the starry sky,and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by steeds?  How one would like to seethe curious table-napkins wrought for Heliogabalus, on which weredisplayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast;or the mortuary-cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred goldenbees; or the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishopof Pontus, and were embroidered with 'lions, panthers, bears, dogs,forests, rocks, hunters--all, in fact, that painters can copy fromnature.'  Charles of Orleans had a coat, on the sleeves of which wereembroidered the verses of a song beginning 'Madame, je suis tout joyeux,'the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, andeach note, of square shape in those days, formed with four pearls. {334b}The room prepared in the palace at Rheims for the use of Queen Joan ofBurgundy was decorated with 'thirteen hundred and twenty-one papegauts(parrots) made in broidery and blazoned with the King's arms, and fivehundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamentedwith the Queen's arms--the whole worked in fine gold.'  Catherine deMedicis had a mourning-bed made for her 'of black velvet embroidered withpearls and powdered with crescents and suns.'  Its curtains were ofdamask, 'with leafy wreaths and garlands figured upon a gold and silverground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls,' and itstood in a room hung with rows of the Queen's devices in cut black velveton cloth of silver.  Louis XIV. had gold-embroidered caryatides fifteenfeet high in his apartment.  The state-bed of Sobieski, King of Poland,was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises and pearls,with verses from the Koran; its supports were of silver-gilt, beautifullychased and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions.  He hadtaken it from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mahomethad stood under it.  The Duchess de la Ferte wore a dress ofreddish-brown velvet, the skirt of which, adjusted in graceful folds, washeld up by big butterflies made of Dresden china; the front was a tablierof cloth of silver, upon which was embroidered an orchestra of musiciansarranged in a pyramidal group, consisting of a series of six ranks ofperformers, with beautiful instruments wrought in raised needle-work.'Into the night go one and all,' as Mr. Henley sings in his charmingBallade of Dead Actors.Many of the facts related by M. Lefebure about the embroiderers' guildsare also extremely interesting.  Etienne Boileau, in his book of crafts,to which I have already alluded, tells us that a member of the guild wasprohibited from using gold of less value than 'eight sous (about 6s.) theskein; he was bound to use the best silk, and never to mix thread withsilk, because that made the work false and bad.'  The test or trial pieceprescribed for a worker who was the son of a master-embroiderer was 'asingle figure, a sixth of the natural size, to be shaded in gold'; whilstone not the son of a master was required to produce 'a complete incidentwith many figures.'  The book of crafts also mentions 'cutters-out andstencillers and illuminators' amongst those employed in the industry ofembroidery.  In 1551 the Parisian Corporation of Embroiderers issued anotice that 'for the future, the colouring in representations of nudefigures and faces should be done in three or four gradations of carnation-dyed silk, and not, as formerly, in white silks.'  During the fifteenthcentury every household of any position retained the services of anembroiderer by the year.  The preparation of colours also, whether forpainting or for dyeing threads and textile fabrics, was a matter which,M. Lefebure points out, received close attention from the artists of theMiddle Ages.  Many undertook long journeys to obtain the more famousrecipes, which they filed, subsequently adding to and correcting them asexperience dictated.  Nor were great artists above making and supplyingdesigns for embroidery.  Raphael made designs for Francis I., and Boucherfor Louis XV.; and in the Ambras collection at Vienna is a superb set ofsacerdotal robes from designs by the brothers Van Eyck and their pupils.Early in the sixteenth century books of embroidery designs were produced,and their success was so great that in a few years French, German,Italian, Flemish, and English publishers spread broadcast books of designmade by their best engravers.  In the same century, in order to give thedesigners opportunity of studying directly from nature, Jean Robin openeda garden with conservatories, in which he cultivated strange varieties ofplants then but little known in our latitudes.  The rich brocades andbrocadelles of the time are characterised by the introduction of largeflowery patterns, with pomegranates and other fruits with fine foliage.The second part of M. Lefebure's book is devoted to the history of lace,and though some may not find it quite as interesting as the earlierportion it will more than repay perusal; and those who still work in thisdelicate and fanciful art will find many valuable suggestions in it, aswell as a large number of exceedingly beautiful designs.  Compared toembroidery, lace seems comparatively modern.  M. Lefebure and Mr. AlanCole tell us that there is no reliable or documentary evidence to provethe existence of lace before the fifteenth century.  Of course in theEast, light tissues, such as gauzes, muslins, and nets, were made at veryearly times, and were used as veils and scarfs after the manner ofsubsequent laces, and women enriched them with some sort of embroidery,or varied the openness of them by here and there drawing out threads.  Thethreads of fringes seem also to have been plaited and knotted together,and the borders of one of the many fashions of Roman toga were of openreticulated weaving.  The Egyptian Museum at the Louvre has a curiousnetwork embellished with glass beads; and the monk Reginald, who tookpart in opening the tomb of St. Cuthbert at Durham in the twelfthcentury, writes that the Saint's shroud had a fringe of linen threads aninch long, surmounted by a border, 'worked upon the threads,' withrepresentations of birds and pairs of beasts, there being between eachsuch pair a branching tree, a survival of the palm of Zoroaster, to whichI have before alluded.  Our authors, however, do not in these examplesrecognise lace, the production of which involves more refined andartistic methods, and postulates a combination of skill and variedexecution carried to a higher degree of perfection.  Lace, as we know it,seems to have had its origin in the habit of embroidering linen.  Whiteembroidery on linen has, M. Lefebure remarks, a cold and monotonousaspect; that with coloured threads is brighter and gayer in effect, butis apt to fade in frequent washing; but white embroidery relieved by openspaces in, or shapes cut from, the linen ground, is possessed of anentirely new charm; and from a sense of this the birth may be traced ofan art in the result of which happy contrasts are effected betweenornamental details of close texture and others of open-work.Soon, also, was suggested the idea that, instead of laboriouslywithdrawing threads from stout linen, it would be more convenient tointroduce a needle-made pattern into an open network ground, which wascalled a lacis.  Of this kind of embroidery many specimens are extant.The Cluny Museum possesses a linen cap said to have belonged to CharlesV.; and an alb of linen drawn-thread work, supposed to have been made byAnne of Bohemia (1527), is preserved in the cathedral at Prague.Catherine de Medicis had a bed draped with squares of reseuil, or lacis,and it is recorded that 'the girls and servants of her household consumedmuch time in making squares of reseuil.'  The interesting pattern-booksfor open-ground embroidery, of which the first was published in 1527 byPierre Quinty, of Cologne, supply us with the means of tracing the stagesin the transition from white thread embroidery to needle-point lace.  Wemeet in them with a style of needle-work which differs from embroidery innot being wrought upon a stuff foundation.  It is, in fact, true lace,done, as it were, 'in the air,' both ground and pattern being entirelyproduced by the lace-maker.The elaborate use of lace in costume was, of course, largely stimulatedby the fashion of wearing ruffs, and their companion cuffs or sleeves.Catherine de Medicis induced one Frederic Vinciolo to come from Italy andmake ruffs and gadrooned collars, the fashion of which she started inFrance; and Henry III. was so punctilious over his ruffs that he wouldiron and goffer his cuffs and collars himself rather than see theirpleats limp and out of shape.  The pattern-books also gave a greatimpulse to the art.  M. Lefebure mentions German books with patterns ofeagles, heraldic emblems, hunting scenes, and plants and leaves belongingto Northern vegetation; and Italian books, in which the motifs consist ofoleander blossoms, and elegant wreaths and scrolls, landscapes withmythological scenes, and hunting episodes, less realistic than theNorthern ones, in which appear fauns, and nymphs or amorini shootingarrows.  With regard to these patterns, M. Lefebure notices a curiousfact.  The oldest painting in which lace is depicted is that of a lady,by Carpaccio, who died about 1523.  The cuffs of the lady are edged witha narrow lace, the pattern of which reappears in Vecellio's Corona, abook not published until 1591.  This particular pattern was, therefore,in use at least eighty years before it got into circulation with otherpublished patterns.It was not, however, till the seventeenth century that lace acquired areally independent character and individuality, and M. Duplessis statesthat the production of the more noteworthy of early laces owes more tothe influence of men than to that of women.  The reign of Louis XIV.witnessed the production of the most stately needle-point laces, thetransformation of Venetian point, and the growth of Points d'Alencon,d'Argentan, de Bruxelles and d'Angleterre.The king, aided by Colbert, determined to make France the centre, ifpossible, for lace manufacture, sending for this purpose both to Veniceand to Flanders for workers.  The studio of the Gobelins supplieddesigns.  The dandies had their huge rabatos or bands falling frombeneath the chin over the breast, and great prelates, like Bossuet andFenelon, wore their wonderful albs and rochets.  It is related of acollar made at Venice for Louis XIV. that the lace-workers, being unableto find sufficiently fine horse-hair, employed some of their own hairsinstead, in order to secure that marvellous delicacy of work which theyaimed at producing.In the eighteenth century, Venice, finding that laces of lighter texturewere sought after, set herself to make rose-point; and at the Court ofLouis XV. the choice of lace was regulated by still more elaborateetiquette.  The Revolution, however, ruined many of the manufactures.Alencon survived, and Napoleon encouraged it, and endeavoured to renewthe old rules about the necessity of wearing point-lace at Courtreceptions.  A wonderful piece of lace, powdered over with devices ofbees, and costing 40,000 francs, was ordered.  It was begun for theEmpress Josephine, but in the course of its making her escutcheons werereplaced by those of Marie Louise.M. Lefebure concludes his interesting history by stating very clearly hisattitude towards machine-made lace.  'It would be an obvious loss toart,' he says, 'should the making of lace by hand become extinct, formachinery, as skilfully devised as possible, cannot do what the handdoes.'  It can give us 'the results of processes, not the creations ofartistic handicraft.'  Art is absent 'where formal calculation pretendsto supersede emotion'; it is absent 'where no trace can be detected ofintelligence guiding handicraft, whose hesitancies even possess peculiarcharm . . . cheapness is never commendable in respect of things which arenot absolute necessities; it lowers artistic standard.'  These areadmirable remarks, and with them we take leave of this fascinating book,with its delightful illustrations, its charming anecdotes, its excellentadvice.  Mr. Alan Cole deserves the thanks of all who are interested inart for bringing this book before the public in so attractive and soinexpensive a form.Embroidery and Lace: Their Manufacture and History from the RemotestAntiquity to the Present Day.  Translated and enlarged by Alan S. Colefrom the French of Ernest Lefebure.  (Grevel and Co.)THE POETS' CORNER--VIII(Pall Mall Gazette, November 16, 1888.)A few years ago some of our minor poets tried to set Science to music, towrite sonnets on the survival of the fittest and odes to NaturalSelection.  Socialism, and the sympathy with those who are unfit, seem,if we may judge from Miss Nesbit's remarkable volume, to be the new themeof song, the fresh subject-matter for poetry.  The change has someadvantages.  Scientific laws are at once too abstract and too clearlydefined, and even the visible arts have not yet been able to translateinto any symbols of beauty the discoveries of modern science.  At theArts and Crafts Exhibition we find the cosmogony of Moses, not thecosmogony of Darwin.  To Mr. Burne-Jones Man is still a fallen angel, nota greater ape.  Poverty and misery, upon the other hand, are terriblyconcrete things.  We find their incarnation everywhere and, as we arediscussing a matter of art, we have no hesitation in saying that they arenot devoid of picturesqueness.  The etcher or the painter finds in them'a subject made to his hand,' and the poet has admirable opportunities ofdrawing weird and dramatic contrasts between the purple of the rich andthe rags of the poor.  From Miss Nesbit's book comes not merely the voiceof sympathy but also the cry of revolution:   This is our vengeance day.  Our masters made fat with our fasting   Shall fall before us like corn when the sickle for harvest is strong:   Old wrongs shall give might to our arm, remembrance of wrongs shall   make lasting   The graves we will dig for our tyrants we bore with too much and too   long.The poem from which we take this stanza is remarkably vigorous, and theonly consolation that we can offer to the timid and the Tories is that aslong as so much strength is employed in blowing the trumpet, the sword,so far as Miss Nesbit is concerned, will probably remain sheathed.Personally, and looking at the matter from a purely artistic point ofview, we prefer Miss Nesbit's gentler moments.  Her eye for Nature ispeculiarly keen.  She has always an exquisite sense of colour andsometimes a most delicate ear for music.  Many of her poems, such as TheMoat House, Absolution, and The Singing of the Magnificat are true worksof art, and Vies Manquees is a little gem of song, with its daintydancing measure, its delicate and wilful fancy and the sharp poignantnote of passion that suddenly strikes across it, marring its lightlaughter and lending its beauty a terrible and tragic meaning.From the sonnets we take this at random:   Not Spring--too lavish of her bud and leaf--      But Autumn with sad eyes and brows austere,      When fields are bare, and woods are brown and sere,   And leaden skies weep their enchantless grief.   Spring is so much too bright, since Spring is brief,      And in our hearts is Autumn all the year,      Least sad when the wide pastures are most drear   And fields grieve most--robbed of the last gold sheaf.These too, the opening stanzas of The Last Envoy, are charming:   The Wind, that through the silent woodland blows   O'er rippling corn and dreaming pastures goes      Straight to the garden where the heart of Spring   Faints in the heart of Summer's earliest rose.   Dimpling the meadow's grassy green and grey,   By furze that yellows all the common way,      Gathering the gladness of the common broom,   And too persistent fragrance of the may--   Gathering whatever is of sweet and dear,   The wandering wind has passed away from here,      Has passed to where within your garden waits   The concentrated sweetness of the year.But Miss Nesbit is not to be judged by mere extracts.  Her work is toorich and too full for that.Mr. Foster is an American poet who has read Hawthorne, which is wise ofhim, and imitated Longfellow, which is not quite so commendable.  HisRebecca the Witch is a story of old Salem, written in the metre ofHiawatha, with a few rhymes thrown in, and conceived in the spirit of theauthor of The Scarlet Letter.  The combination is not very satisfactory,but the poem, as a piece of fiction, has many elements of interest.  Mr.Foster seems to be quite popular in America.  The Chicago Times finds hisfancies 'very playful and sunny,' and the Indianapolis Journal speaks ofhis 'tender and appreciative style.'  He is certainly a cleverstory-teller, and The Noah's Ark (which 'somehow had escaped thesheriff's hand') is bright and amusing, and its pathos, like the pathosof a melodrama, is a purely picturesque element not intended to be takentoo seriously.  We cannot, however, recommend the definitely comic poems.They are very depressing.Mr. John Renton Denning dedicates his book to the Duke of Connaught, whois Colonel-in-Chief of the Rifle Brigade, in which regiment Mr. Denningwas once himself a private soldier.  His poems show an ardent love ofKeats and a profligate luxuriance of adjectives:   And I will build a bower for thee, sweet,   A verdurous shelter from the noonday heat,   Thick rustling ivy, broad and green, and shining,   With honeysuckle creeping up and twining   Its nectared sweetness round thee; violets   And daisies with their fringed coronets   And the white bells of tiny valley lilies,   And golden-leaved narcissi--daffodillies   Shall grow around thy dwelling--luscious fare   Of fruit on which the sun has laughed;this is the immature manner of Endymion with a vengeance and is not to beencouraged.  Still, Mr. Denning is not always so anxious to reproduce thefaults of his master.  Sometimes he writes with wonderful grace andcharm.  Sylvia, for instance, is an exceedingly pretty poem, and TheExile has many powerful and picturesque lines.  Mr. Denning should make aselection of his poems and publish them in better type and on betterpaper.  The 'get-up' of his volume, to use the slang phrase of our youngpoets, is very bad indeed, and reflects no credit on the press of theEducation Society of Bombay.The best poem in Mr. Joseph McKim's little book is, undoubtedly, Williamthe Silent.  It is written in the spirited Macaulay style:   Awake, awake, ye burghers brave! shout, shout for joy and sing!   With thirty thousand at his back comes forth your hero King.   Now shake for ever from your necks the servile yoke of Spain,   And raise your arms and end for aye false Alva's cruel reign.   Ho!  Maestricht, Liege, Brussels fair! pour forth your warriors brave,   And join your hands with him who comes your hearths and homes to save.Some people like this style.Mrs. Horace Dobell, who has arrived at her seventeenth volume of poetry,seems very angry with everybody, and writes poems to A Human Toad withlurid and mysterious footnotes such as--'Yet some one, _not_ a friend of--- _did_! on a certain occasion of a glib utterance of calumnies, by ---!at Hampstead.'  Here indeed is a Soul's Tragedy.'In many cases I have deliberately employed alliteration, believing thatthe music of a line is intensified thereby,' says Mr. Kelly in thepreface to his poems, and there is certainly no reason why Mr. Kellyshould not employ this 'artful aid.'  Alliteration is one of the manysecrets of English poetry, and as long as it is kept a secret it isadmirable.  Mr. Kelly, it must be admitted, uses it with becoming modestyand reserve and never suffers it to trammel the white feet of his brightand buoyant muse.  His volume is, in many ways, extremely interesting.Most minor poets are at their best in sonnets, but with him it is not so.His sonnets are too narrative, too diffuse, and too lyrical.  They lackconcentration, and concentration is the very essence of a sonnet.  Hislonger poems, on the other hand, have many good qualities.  We do notcare for Psychossolles, which is elaborately commonplace, but The Flightof Calliope has many charming passages.  It is a pity that Mr. Kelly hasincluded the poems written before the age of nineteen.  Youth is rarelyoriginal.Andiatorocte is the title of a volume of poems by the Rev. ClarenceWalworth, of Albany, N.Y.  It is a word borrowed from the Indians, andshould, we think, be returned to them as soon as possible.  The mostcurious poem of the book is called Scenes at the Holy Home:   Jesus and Joseph at work!  Hurra!   Sight never to see again,   A prentice Deity plies the saw,   While the Master ploughs with the plane.Poems of this kind were popular in the Middle Ages when the cathedrals ofevery Christian country served as its theatres.  They are anachronismsnow, and it is odd that they should come to us from the United States.  Inmatters of this kind we should have some protection.(1) Lays and Legends.  By E. Nesbit.

Putnam'sSons.)A NOTE ON SOME MODERN POETS(Woman's World, December 1888.)'If I were king,' says Mr. Henley, in one of his most modest rondeaus,   'Art should aspire, yet ugliness be dear;   Beauty, the shaft, should speed with wit for feather;   And love, sweet love, should never fall to sere,         If I were king.'And these lines contain, if not the best criticism of his own work,certainly a very complete statement of his aim and motive as a poet.  Hislittle Book of Verses reveals to us an artist who is seeking to find newmethods of expression and has not merely a delicate sense of beauty and abrilliant, fantastic wit, but a real passion also for what is horrible,ugly, or grotesque.  No doubt, everything that is worthy of existence isworthy also of art--at least, one would like to think so--but while echoor mirror can repeat for us a beautiful thing, to render artistically athing that is ugly requires the most exquisite alchemy of form, the mostsubtle magic of transformation.  To me there is more of the cry ofMarsyas than of the singing of Apollo in the earlier poems of Mr.Henley's volume, In Hospital: Rhymes and Rhythms, as he calls them.  Butit is impossible to deny their power.  Some of them are like bright,vivid pastels; others like charcoal drawings, with dull blacks and murkywhites; others like etchings with deeply-bitten lines, and abruptcontrasts, and clever colour-suggestions.  In fact, they are likeanything and everything, except perfected poems--that they certainly arenot.  They are still in the twilight.  They are preludes, experiments,inspired jottings in a note-book, and should be heralded by a design of'Genius Making Sketches.'  Rhyme gives architecture as well as melody toverse; it gives that delightful sense of limitation which in all the artsis so pleasurable, and is, indeed, one of the secrets of perfection; itwill whisper, as a French critic has said, 'things unexpected andcharming, things with strange and remote relations to each other,' andbind them together in indissoluble bonds of beauty; and in his constantrejection of rhyme, Mr. Henley seems to me to have abdicated half hispower.  He is a roi en exil who has thrown away some of the strings ofhis lute; a poet who has forgotten the fairest part of his kingdom.However, all work criticises itself.  Here is one of Mr. Henley'sinspired jottings.  According to the temperament of the reader, it willserve either as a model or as the reverse:   As with varnish red and glistening      Dripped his hair; his feet were rigid;      Raised, he settled stiffly sideways:      You could see the hurts were spinal.   He had fallen from an engine,      And been dragged along the metals.      It was hopeless, and they knew it;      So they covered him, and left him.   As he lay, by fits half sentient,      Inarticulately moaning,      With his stockinged feet protruded      Sharp and awkward from the blankets,   To his bed there came a woman,      Stood and looked and sighed a little,      And departed without speaking,      As himself a few hours after.   I was told she was his sweetheart.      They were on the eve of marriage.      She was quiet as a statue,      But her lip was gray and writhen.In this poem, the rhythm and the music, such as it is, areobvious--perhaps a little too obvious.  In the following I see nothingbut ingeniously printed prose.  It is a description--and a very accurateone--of a scene in a hospital ward.  The medical students are supposed tobe crowding round the doctor.  What I quote is only a fragment, but thepoem itself is a fragment:   So shows the ring   Seen, from behind, round a conjuror   Doing his pitch in the street.   High shoulders, low shoulders, broad shoulders, narrow ones,   Round, square, and angular, serry and shove;   While from within a voice,   Gravely and weightily fluent,   Sounds; and then ceases; and suddenly   (Look at the stress of the shoulders!)   Out of a quiver of silence,   Over the hiss of the spray,   Comes a low cry, and the sound   Of breath quick intaken through teeth   Clenched in resolve.  And the master   Breaks from the crowd, and goes,   Wiping his hands,   To the next bed, with his pupils   Flocking and whispering behind him.   Now one can see.   Case Number One   Sits (rather pale) with his bedclothes   Stripped up, and showing his foot   (Alas, for God's image!)   Swaddled in wet white lint   Brilliantly hideous with red.Theophile Gautier once said that Flaubert's style was meant to be read,and his own style to be looked at.  Mr. Henley's unrhymed rhythms formvery dainty designs, from a typographical point of view.  From the pointof view of literature, they are a series of vivid, concentratedimpressions, with a keen grip of fact, a terrible actuality, and analmost masterly power of picturesque presentation.  But the poeticform--what of that?Well, let us pass to the later poems, to the rondels and rondeaus, thesonnets and quatorzains, the echoes and the ballades.  How brilliant andfanciful this is!  The Toyokuni colour-print that suggested it could notbe more delightful.  It seems to have kept all the wilful fantastic charmof the original:   Was I a Samurai renowned,   Two-sworded, fierce, immense of bow?   A histrion angular and profound?   A priest? a porter?--Child, although   I have forgotten clean, I know   That in the shade of Fujisan,   What time the cherry-orchards blow,   I loved you once in old Japan.   As here you loiter, flowing-gowned   And hugely sashed, with pins a-row   Your quaint head as with flamelets crowned,   Demure, inviting--even so,   When merry maids in Miyako   To feel the sweet o' the year began,   And green gardens to overflow,   I loved you once in old Japan.   Clear shine the hills; the rice-fields round   Two cranes are circling; sleepy and slow,   A blue canal the lake's blue bound   Breaks at the bamboo bridge; and lo!   Touched with the sundown's spirit and glow,   I see you turn, with flirted fan,   Against the plum-tree's bloomy snow . . .   I loved you once in old Japan!   ENVOY.   Dear, 'twas a dozen lives ago;   But that I was a lucky man   The Toyokuni here will show:   I loved you--once--in old Japan!This rondel, too--how light it is, and graceful!--   We'll to the woods and gather may   Fresh from the footprints of the rain.   We'll to the woods, at every vein   To drink the spirit of the day.   The winds of spring are out at play,   The needs of spring in heart and brain.   We'll to the woods and gather may   Fresh from the footprints of the rain.   The world's too near her end, you say?   Hark to the blackbird's mad refrain!   It waits for her, the vast Inane?   Then, girls, to help her on the way   We'll to the woods and gather may.There are fine verses, also, scattered through this little book; some ofthem very strong, as--   Out of the night that covers me,      Black as the pit from pole to pole,   I thank whatever gods may be      For my unconquerable soul.   It matters not how strait the gate,      How charged with punishments the scroll,   I am the master of my fate:      I am the captain of my soul.Others with a true touch of romance, as--   Or ever the knightly years were gone      With the old world to the grave,   I was a king in Babylon,      And you were a Christian slave.And here and there we come across such felicitous phrases as--         In the sand   The gold prow-griffin claws a hold,or--         The spires   Shine and are changed,and many other graceful or fanciful lines, even 'the green sky's minorthirds' being perfectly right in its place, and a very refreshing bit ofaffectation in a volume where there is so much that is natural.However, Mr. Henley is not to be judged by samples.  Indeed, the mostattractive thing in the book is no single poem that is in it, but thestrong humane personality that stands behind both flawless and faultywork alike, and looks out through many masks, some of them beautiful, andsome grotesque, and not a few misshapen.  In the case with most of ourmodern poets, when we have analysed them down to an adjective, we can gono further, or we care to go no further; but with this book it isdifferent.  Through these reeds and pipes blows the very breath of life.It seems as if one could put one's hand upon the singer's heart and countits pulsations.  There is something wholesome, virile and sane about theman's soul.  Anybody can be reasonable, but to be sane is not common; andsane poets are as rare as blue lilies, though they may not be quite sodelightful.   Let the great winds their worst and wildest blow,   Or the gold weather round us mellow slow;   We have fulfilled ourselves, and we can dare,   And we can conquer, though we may not share   In the rich quiet of the afterglow,         What is to come,is the concluding stanza of the last rondeau--indeed, of the last poem inthe collection, and the high, serene temper displayed in these linesserves at once as keynote and keystone to the book.  The very lightnessand slightness of so much of the work, its careless moods and casualfancies, seem to suggest a nature that is not primarily interested inart--a nature, like Sordello's, passionately enamoured of life, one towhich lyre and lute are things of less importance.  From this mere joy ofliving, this frank delight in experience for its own sake, this loftyindifference, and momentary unregretted ardours, come all the faults andall the beauties of the volume.  But there is this difference betweenthem--the faults are deliberate, and the result of much study; thebeauties have the air of fascinating impromptus.  Mr. Henley's healthy,if sometimes misapplied, confidence in the myriad suggestions of lifegives him his charm.  He is made to sing along the highways, not to sitdown and write.  If he took himself more seriously, his work would becometrivial.* * * * *Mr. William Sharp takes himself very seriously and has written a prefaceto his Romantic Ballads and Poems of Phantasy, which is, on the whole,the most interesting part of his volume.  We are all, it seems, far toocultured, and lack robustness.  'There are those amongst us,' says Mr.Sharp, 'who would prefer a dexterously-turned triolet to such apparentlyuncouth measures as Thomas the Rhymer, or the ballad of Clerk Saunders:who would rather listen to the drawing-room music of the Villanelle thanto the wild harp-playing by the mill-dams o' Binnorie, or the sough ofthe night-wind o'er drumly Annan water.'  Such an expression as 'thedrawing-room music of the Villanelle' is not very happy, and I cannotimagine any one with the smallest pretensions to culture preferring adexterously turned triolet to a fine imaginative ballad, as it is onlythe Philistine who ever dreams of comparing works of art that areabsolutely different in motive, in treatment, and in form.  If EnglishPoetry is in danger--and, according to Mr. Sharp, the poor nymph is in avery critical state--what she has to fear is not the fascination ofdainty metre or delicate form, but the predominance of the intellectualspirit over the spirit of beauty.  Lord Tennyson dethroned Wordsworth asa literary influence, and later on Mr. Swinburne filled all the mountainvalleys with echoes of his own song.  The influence to-day is that of Mr.Browning.  And as for the triolets, and the rondels, and the carefulstudy of metrical subtleties, these things are merely the signs of adesire for perfection in small things and of the recognition of poetry asan art.  They have had certainly one good result--they have made ourminor poets readable, and have not left us entirely at the mercy ofgeniuses.But, says Mr. Sharp, every one is far too literary; even Rossetti is tooliterary.  What we want is simplicity and directness of utterance; theseshould be the dominant characteristics of poetry.  Well, is that quite socertain?  Are simplicity and directness of utterance absolute essentialsfor poetry?  I think not.  They may be admirable for the drama, admirablefor all those imitative forms of literature that claim to mirror life inits externals and its accidents, admirable for quiet narrative, admirablein their place; but their place is not everywhere.  Poetry has many modesof music; she does not blow through one pipe alone.  Directness ofutterance is good, but so is the subtle recasting of thought into a newand delightful form.  Simplicity is good, but complexity, mystery,strangeness, symbolism, obscurity even, these have their value.  Indeed,properly speaking, there is no such thing as Style; there are merelystyles, that is all.One cannot help feeling also that everything that Mr. Sharp says in hispreface was said at the beginning of the century by Wordsworth, onlywhere Wordsworth called us back to nature, Mr. Sharp invites us to wooromance.  Romance, he tells us, is 'in the air.'  A new romantic movementis imminent; 'I anticipate,' he says, 'that many of our poets, especiallythose of the youngest generation, will shortly turn towards the "ballad"as a poetic vehicle: and that the next year or two will see much romanticpoetry.'The ballad!  Well, Mr. Andrew Lang, some months ago, signed the death-warrant of the ballade, and--though I hope that in this respect Mr. Langresembles the Queen in Alice in Wonderland, whose bloodthirsty orderswere by general consent never carried into execution--it must be admittedthat the number of ballades given to us by some of our poets was,perhaps, a little excessive.  But the ballad?  Sir Patrick Spens, ClerkSaunders, Thomas the Rhymer--are these to be our archetypes, our models,the sources of our inspiration?  They are certainly great imaginativepoems.  In Chatterton's Ballad of Charity, Coleridge's Rhyme of theAncient Mariner, the La Belle Dame sans Merci of Keats, the Sister Helenof Rossetti, we can see what marvellous works of art the spirit of oldromance may fashion.  But to preach a spirit is one thing, to propose aform is another.  It is true that Mr. Sharp warns the rising generationagainst imitation.  A ballad, he reminds them, does not necessarilydenote a poem in quatrains and in antique language.  But his own poems,as I think will be seen later, are, in their way, warnings, and show thedanger of suggesting any definite 'poetic vehicle.'  And, further, aresimplicity and directness of utterance really the dominantcharacteristics of these old imaginative ballads that Mr. Sharp soenthusiastically, and, in some particulars, so wisely praises?  It doesnot seem to me to be so.  We are always apt to think that the voiceswhich sang at the dawn of poetry were simpler, fresher, and more naturalthan ours, and that the world which the early poets looked at, andthrough which they walked, had a kind of poetical quality of its own, andcould pass, almost without changing, into song.  The snow lies thick nowupon Olympus, and its scarped sides are bleak and barren, but once, wefancy, the white feet of the Muses brushed the dew from the anemones inthe morning, and at evening came Apollo to sing to the shepherds in thevale.  But in this we are merely lending to other ages what we desire, orthink we desire, for our own.  Our historical sense is at fault.  Everycentury that produces poetry is, so far, an artificial century, and thework that seems to us the most natural and simple product of its time isprobably the result of the most deliberate and self-conscious effort.  ForNature is always behind the age.  It takes a great artist to bethoroughly modern.Let us turn to the poems, which have really only the preface to blame fortheir somewhat late appearance.  The best is undoubtedly The Weird ofMichael Scott, and these stanzas are a fair example of its power:   Then Michael Scott laughed long and loud:   'Whan shone the mune ahint yon cloud      I speered the towers that saw my birth--   Lang, lang, sall wait my cauld grey shroud,      Lang cauld and weet my bed o' earth!'   But as by Stair he rode full speed   His horse began to pant and bleed;      'Win hame, win hame, my bonnie mare,   Win hame if thou wouldst rest and feed,      Win hame, we're nigh the House of Stair!'   But, with a shrill heart-bursten yell   The white horse stumbled, plunged, and fell,      And loud a summoning voice arose,   'Is't White-Horse Death that rides frae Hell,      Or Michael Scott that hereby goes?'   'Ah, Laird of Stair, I ken ye weel!   Avaunt, or I your saul sall steal,      An' send ye howling through the wood   A wild man-wolf--aye, ye maun reel      An' cry upon your Holy Rood!'There is a good deal of vigour, no doubt, in these lines; but one cannothelp asking whether this is to be the common tongue of the futureRenaissance of Romance.  Are we all to talk Scotch, and to speak of themoon as the 'mune,' and the soul as the 'saul'?  I hope not.  And yet ifthis Renaissance is to be a vital, living thing, it must have itslinguistic side.  Just as the spiritual development of music, and theartistic development of painting, have always been accompanied, if notoccasioned, by the discovery of some new instrument or some fresh medium,so, in the case of any important literary movement, half of its strengthresides in its language.  If it does not bring with it a rich and novelmode of expression, it is doomed either to sterility or to imitation.Dialect, archaisms and the like, will not do.  Take, for instance,another poem of Mr. Sharp's, a poem which he calls The Deith-Tide:   The weet saut wind is blawing      Upon the misty shore:   As, like a stormy snawing,      The deid go streaming o'er:--         The wan drown'd deid sail wildly            Frae out each drumly wave:         It's O and O for the weary sea,            And O for a quiet grave.This is simply a very clever pastiche, nothing more, and our language isnot likely to be permanently enriched by such words as 'weet,' 'saut,''blawing,' and 'snawing.'  Even 'drumly,' an adjective of which Mr. Sharpis so fond that he uses it both in prose and verse, seems to me to behardly an adequate basis for a new romantic movement.However, Mr. Sharp does not always write in dialect.  The Son of Allancan be read without any difficulty, and Phantasy can be read withpleasure.  They are both very charming poems in their way, and none theless charming because the cadences of the one recall Sister Helen, andthe motive of the other reminds us of La Belle Dame sans Merci.  Butthose who wish thoroughly to enjoy Mr. Sharp's poems should not read hispreface; just as those who approve of the preface should avoid readingthe poems.  I cannot help saying that I think the preface a greatmistake.  The work that follows it is quite inadequate, and there seemslittle use in heralding a dawn that rose long ago, and proclaiming aRenaissance whose first-fruits, if we are to judge them by any highstandard of perfection, are of so ordinary a character.* * * * *Miss Mary Robinson has also written a preface to her little volume,Poems, Ballads, and a Garden Play, but the preface is not very serious,and does not propose any drastic change or any immediate revolution inEnglish literature.  Miss Robinson's poems have always the charm ofdelicate music and graceful expression; but they are, perhaps, weakestwhere they try to be strong, and certainly least satisfying where theyseek to satisfy.  Her fanciful flower-crowned Muse, with her trippingsteps and pretty, wilful ways, should not write Antiphons to theUnknowable, or try to grapple with abstract intellectual problems.  Hersis not the hand to unveil mysteries, nor hers the strength for thesolving of secrets.  She should never leave her garden, and as for herwandering out into the desert to ask the Sphinx questions, that should besternly forbidden to her.  Durer's Melancolia, that serves as thefrontispiece to this dainty book, looks sadly out of place.  Her seat iswith the sibyls, not with the nymphs.  What has she to do withshepherdesses piping about Darwinism and 'The Eternal Mind'?However, if the Songs of the Inner Life are not very successful, theSpring Songs are delightful.  They follow each other like wind-blownpetals, and make one feel how much more charming flower is than fruit,apple-blossom than apple.  There are some artistic temperaments thatshould never come to maturity, that should always remain in the region ofpromise and should dread autumn with its harvesting more than winter withits frosts.  Such seems to me the temperament that this volume reveals.The first poem of the second series, La Belle au Bois Dormant, is worthall the more serious and thoughtful work, and has far more chance ofbeing remembered.  It is not always to high aim and lofty ambition thatthe prize is given.  If Daphne had gone to meet Apollo, she would neverhave known what laurels are.From these fascinating spring lyrics and idylls we pass to the romanticballads.  One artistic faculty Miss Robinson certainly possesses--thefaculty of imitation.  There is an element of imitation in all the arts;it is to be found in literature as much as in painting, and the danger ofvaluing it too little is almost as great as the danger of setting toohigh a value upon it.  To catch, by dainty mimicry, the very mood andmanner of antique work, and yet to retain that touch of modern passionwithout which the old form would be dull and empty; to win fromlong-silent lips some faint echo of their music, and to add to it a musicof one's own; to take the mode and fashion of a bygone age, and toexperiment with it, and search curiously for its possibilities; there isa pleasure in all this.  It is a kind of literary acting, and hassomething of the charm of the art of the stage-player.  And how well, onthe whole, Miss Robinson does it!  Here is the opening of the ballad ofRudel:   There was in all the world of France      No singer half so sweet:   The first note of his viol brought      A crowd into the street.   He stepped as young, and bright, and glad      As Angel Gabriel.   And only when we heard him sing      Our eyes forgot Rudel.   And as he sat in Avignon,      With princes at their wine,   In all that lusty company      Was none so fresh and fine.   His kirtle's of the Arras-blue,      His cap of pearls and green;   His golden curls fall tumbling round      The fairest face I've seen.How Gautier would have liked this from the same poem!--   Hew the timbers of sandal-wood,      And planks of ivory;   Rear up the shining masts of gold,      And let us put to sea.   Sew the sails with a silken thread      That all are silken too;   Sew them with scarlet pomegranates      Upon a sheet of blue.   Rig the ship with a rope of gold      And let us put to sea.   And now, good-bye to good Marseilles,      And hey for Tripoli!The ballad of the Duke of Gueldres's wedding is very clever:   'O welcome, Mary Harcourt,      Thrice welcome, lady mine;   There's not a knight in all the world      Shall be as true as thine.   'There's venison in the aumbry, Mary,      There's claret in the vat;   Come in, and breakfast in the hall      Where once my mother sat!'   O red, red is the wine that flows,      And sweet the minstrel's play,   But white is Mary Harcourt      Upon her wedding-day.   O many are the wedding guests      That sit on either side;   But pale below her crimson flowers      And homesick is the bride.Miss Robinson's critical sense is at once too sound and too subtle toallow her to think that any great Renaissance of Romance will necessarilyfollow from the adoption of the ballad-form in poetry; but her work inthis style is very pretty and charming, and The Tower of St. Maur, whichtells of the father who built up his little son in the wall of his castlein order that the foundations should stand sure, is admirable in its way.The few touches of archaism in language that she introduces are quitesufficient for their purpose, and though she fully appreciates theimportance of the Celtic spirit in literature, she does not consider itnecessary to talk of 'blawing' and 'snawing.'  As for the garden play,Our Lady of the Broken Heart, as it is called, the bright, birdlikesnatches of song that break in here and there--as the singing does inPippa Passes--form a very welcome relief to the somewhat ordinarymovement of the blank verse, and suggest to us again where MissRobinson's real power lies.  Not a poet in the true creative sense, sheis still a very perfect artist in poetry, using language as one might usea very precious material, and producing her best work by the rejection ofthe great themes and large intellectual motives that belong to fuller andricher song.  When she essays such themes, she certainly fails.  Herinstrument is the reed, not the lyre.  Only those should sing of Deathwhose song is stronger than Death is.* * * * *The collected poems of the author of John Halifax, Gentleman, have apathetic interest as the artistic record of a very gracious and comelylife.  They bring us back to the days when Philip Bourke Marston wasyoung--'Philip, my King,' as she called him in the pretty poem of thatname; to the days of the Great Exhibition, with the universal pipingabout peace; to those later terrible Crimean days, when Alma andBalaclava were words on the lips of our poets; and to days when Leonorawas considered a very romantic name.   Leonora, Leonora,   How the word rolls--Leonora.   Lion-like in full-mouthed sound,   Marching o'er the metric ground,   With a tawny tread sublime.   So your name moves, Leonora,   Down my desert rhyme.Mrs. Craik's best poems are, on the whole, those that are written inblank verse; and these, though not prosaic, remind one that prose was hertrue medium of expression.  But some of the rhymed poems haveconsiderable merit.  These may serve as examples of Mrs. Craik's style:   A SKETCH   Dost thou thus love me, O thou all beloved,   In whose large store the very meanest coin   Would out-buy my whole wealth?  Yet here thou comest   Like a kind heiress from her purple and down   Uprising, who for pity cannot sleep,   But goes forth to the stranger at her gate--   The beggared stranger at her beauteous gate--   And clothes and feeds; scarce blest till she has blest.   But dost thou love me, O thou pure of heart,   Whose very looks are prayers?  What couldst thou see   In this forsaken pool by the yew-wood's side,   To sit down at its bank, and dip thy hand,   Saying, 'It is so clear!'--and lo! ere long,   Its blackness caught the shimmer of thy wings,   Its slimes slid downward from thy stainless palm,   Its depths grew still, that there thy form might rise.   THE NOVICE   It is near morning.  Ere the next night fall      I shall be made the bride of heaven.  Then home      To my still marriage-chamber I shall come,   And spouseless, childless, watch the slow years crawl.   These lips will never meet a softer touch      Than the stone crucifix I kiss; no child      Will clasp this neck.  Ah, virgin-mother mild,   Thy painted bliss will mock me overmuch.   This is the last time I shall twist the hair      My mother's hand wreathed, till in dust she lay:      The name, her name given on my baptism day,   This is the last time I shall ever bear.   O weary world, O heavy life, farewell!      Like a tired child that creeps into the dark      To sob itself asleep, where none will mark,--   So creep I to my silent convent cell.   Friends, lovers whom I loved not, kindly hearts      Who grieve that I should enter this still door,      Grieve not.  Closing behind me evermore,   Me from all anguish, as all joy, it parts.The volume chronicles the moods of a sweet and thoughtful nature, andthough many things in it may seem somewhat old-fashioned, it is stillvery pleasant to read, and has a faint perfume of withered rose-leavesabout it.(1) A Book of Verses.

(Macmillan andCo.)SIR EDWIN ARNOLD'S LAST VOLUME(Pall Mall Gazette, December 11, 1888.)Writers of poetical prose are rarely good poets.  They may crowd theirpage with gorgeous epithet and resplendent phrase, may pile Pelions ofadjectives upon Ossas of descriptions, may abandon themselves to highlycoloured diction and rich luxuriance of imagery, but if their verse lacksthe true rhythmical life of verse, if their method is devoid of the self-restraint of the real artist, all their efforts are of very little avail.'Asiatic' prose is possibly useful for journalistic purposes, but'Asiatic' poetry is not to be encouraged.  Indeed, poetry may be said toneed far more self-restraint than prose.  Its conditions are moreexquisite.  It produces its effects by more subtle means.  It must not beallowed to degenerate into mere rhetoric or mere eloquence.  It is, inone sense, the most self-conscious of all the arts, as it is never ameans to an end but always an end in itself.  Sir Edwin Arnold has a verypicturesque or, perhaps we should say, a very pictorial style.  He knowsIndia better than any living Englishman knows it, and Hindoostanee betterthan any English writer should know it.  If his descriptions lackdistinction, they have at least the merit of being true, and when he doesnot interlard his pages with an interminable and intolerable series offoreign words he is pleasant enough.  But he is not a poet.  He is simplya poetical writer--that is all.However, poetical writers have their uses, and there is a good deal inSir Edwin Arnold's last volume that will repay perusal.  The scene of thestory is placed in a mosque attached to the monument of the Taj-Mahal,and a group composed of a learned Mirza, two singing girls with theirattendant, and an Englishman, is supposed to pass the night there readingthe chapter of Sa'di upon 'Love,' and conversing upon that theme withaccompaniments of music and dancing.  The Englishman is, of course, SirEdwin Arnold himself:         lover of India,   Too much her lover! for his heart lived there   How far soever wandered thence his feet.Lady Dufferin appears as   Lady Duffreen, the mighty Queen's Vice-queen!which is really one of the most dreadful blank-verse lines that we havecome across for some time past.  M. Renan is 'a priest of Frangestan,'who writes in 'glittering French'; Lord Tennyson is         One we honour for his songs--   Greater than Sa'di's self--and the Darwinians appear as the 'Mollahs of the West,' who         hold Adam's sons   Sprung of the sea-slug.All this is excellent fooling in its way, a kind of play-acting inliterature; but the best parts of the book are the descriptions of theTaj itself, which are extremely elaborate, and the various translationsfrom Sa'di with which the volume is interspersed.  The great monumentShah Jahan built for Arjamand is   Instinct with loveliness--not masonry!   Not architecture! as all others are,   But the proud passion of an Emperor's love   Wrought into living stone, which gleams and soars   With body of beauty shrining soul and thought,   Insomuch that it haps as when some face   Divinely fair unveils before our eyes--   Some woman beautiful unspeakably--   And the blood quickens, and the spirit leaps,   And will to worship bends the half-yielded knees,   Which breath forgets to breathe: so is the Taj;   You see it with the heart, before the eyes   Have scope to gaze.  All white! snow white! cloud white!We cannot say much in praise of the sixth line:   Insomuch that it haps as when some face:it is curiously awkward and unmusical.  But this passage from Sa'di isremarkable:   When Earth, bewildered, shook in earthquake-throes,   With mountain-roots He bound her borders close;      Turkis and ruby in her rocks He stored,   And on her green branch hung His crimson rose.   He shapes dull seed to fair imaginings;   Who paints with moisture as He painteth things?      Look! from the cloud He sheds one drop on ocean,   As from the Father's loins one drop He brings;--   And out of that He forms a peerless pearl,   And, out of this, a cypress boy or girl;      Utterly wotting all their innermosts,   For all to Him is visible!  Uncurl   Your cold coils, Snakes!  Creep forth, ye thrifty Ants!   Handless and strengthless He provides your wants      Who from the 'Is not' planned the 'Is to be,'   And Life in non-existent void implants.Sir Edwin Arnold suffers, of course, from the inevitable comparison thatone cannot help making between his work and the work of EdwardFitzgerald, and certainly Fitzgerald could never have written such a lineas 'utterly wotting all their innermosts,' but it is interesting to readalmost any translation of those wonderful Oriental poets with theirstrange blending of philosophy and sensuousness, of simple parable orfable and obscure mystic utterance.  What we regret most in Sir EdwinArnold's book is his habit of writing in what really amounts to a sort of'pigeon English.'  When we are told that 'Lady Duffreen, the mightyQueen's Vice-queen,' paces among the charpoys of the ward 'no whit afraidof sitla, or of tap'; when the Mirza explains--         ag lejao!   To light the kallians for the Saheb and me,and the attendant obeys with 'Achcha!  Achcha!' when we are invited tolisten to 'the Vina and the drum' and told about ekkas, Byragis, hamalsand Tamboora, all that we can say is that to such ghazals we are notprepared to say either Shamash or Afrin.  In English poetry we do notwant      chatkis for the toes,   Jasams for elbow-bands, and gote and har,   Bala and mala.This is not local colour; it is a sort of local discoloration.  It doesnot add anything to the vividness of the scene.  It does not bring theOrient more clearly before us.  It is simply an inconvenience to thereader and a mistake on the part of the writer.  It may be difficult fora poet to find English synonyms for Asiatic expressions, but even if itwere impossible it is none the less a poet's duty to find them.  We aresorry that a scholar and a man of culture like Sir Edwin Arnold shouldhave been guilty of what is really an act of treason against ourliterature.  But for this error, his book, though not in any sense a workof genius or even of high artistic merit, would still have been of someenduring value.  As it is, Sir Edwin Arnold has translated Sa'di and someone must translate Sir Edwin Arnold.With Sa'di in the Garden; or The Book of Love.  By Sir Edwin Arnold,M.A., K.C.I.E., Author of The Light of Asia, etc.  (Trubner and Co.)AUSTRALIAN POETS(Pall Mall Gazette, December 14, 1888.)Mr. Sladen dedicates his anthology (or, perhaps, we should say hisherbarium) of Australian song to Mr. Edmund Gosse, 'whose exquisitecritical faculty is,' he tells us, 'as conspicuous in his poems as in hislectures on poetry.'  After so graceful a compliment Mr. Gosse mustcertainly deliver a series of discourses upon Antipodean art before theCambridge undergraduates, who will, no doubt, be very much interested onhearing about Gordon, Kendall and Domett, to say nothing of theextraordinary collection of mediocrities whom Mr. Sladen has somewhatruthlessly dragged from their modest and well-merited obscurity.  Gordon,however, is very badly represented in Mr. Sladen's book, the only threespecimens of his work that are included being an unrevised fragment, hisValedictory Poem and An Exile's Farewell.  The latter is, of course,touching, but then the commonplace always touches, and it is a great pitythat Mr. Sladen was unable to come to any financial arrangement with theholders of Gordon's copyright.  The loss to the volume that now liesbefore us is quite irreparable.  Through Gordon Australia found her firstfine utterance in song.Still, there are some other singers here well worth studying, and it isinteresting to read about poets who lie under the shadow of the gum-tree,gather wattle blossoms and buddawong and sarsaparilla for their loves,and wander through the glades of Mount Baw-baw listening to the carelessraptures of the mopoke.  To them November is      The wonder with the golden wings,   Who lays one hand in Summer's, one in Spring's:January is full of 'breaths of myrrh, and subtle hints of rose-lands';   She is the warm, live month of lustre--she   Makes glad the land and lulls the strong sad sea;while February is 'the true Demeter,' and   With rich warm vine-blood splashed from heel to knee,   Comes radiant through the yellow woodlands.Each month, as it passes, calls for new praise and for music differentfrom our own.  July is a 'lady, born in wind and rain'; in August   Across the range, by every scarred black fell,   Strong Winter blows his horn of wild farewell;while October is 'the queen of all the year,' the 'lady of the yellowhair,' who strays 'with blossom-trammelled feet' across the'haughty-featured hills,' and brings the Spring with her.  We mustcertainly try to accustom ourselves to the mopoke and the sarsaparillaplant, and to make the gum-tree and the buddawong as dear to us as theolives and the narcissi of white Colonus.  After all, the Muses are greattravellers, and the same foot that stirred the Cumnor cowslips may someday brush the fallen gold of the wattle blossoms and tread delicatelyover the tawny bush-grass.Mr. Sladen has, of course, a great belief in the possibilities ofAustralian poetry.  There are in Australia, he tells us, far more writerscapable of producing good work than has been assumed.  It is onlynatural, he adds, that this should be so, 'for Australia has one of thosedelightful climates conducive to rest in the open air.  The middle of theday is so hot that it is really more healthful to lounge about than totake stronger exercise.'  Well, lounging in the open air is not a badschool for poets, but it largely depends on the lounger.  What strikesone on reading over Mr. Sladen's collection is the depressingprovinciality of mood and manner in almost every writer.  Page followspage, and we find nothing but echoes without music, reflections withoutbeauty, second-rate magazine verses and third-rate verses for Colonialnewspapers.  Poe seems to have had some influence--at least, there areseveral parodies of his method--and one or two writers have read Mr.Swinburne; but, on the whole, we have artless Nature in her mostirritating form.  Of course Australia is young, younger even than Americawhose youth is now one of her oldest and most hallowed traditions, butthe entire want of originality of treatment is curious.  And yet not socurious, perhaps, after all.  Youth is rarely original.There are, however, some exceptions.  Henry Clarence Kendall had a truepoetic gift.  The series of poems on the Austral months, from which wehave already quoted, is full of beautiful things; Landor's Rose Aylmer isa classic in its way, but Kendall's Rose Lorraine is in parts notunworthy to be mentioned after it; and the poem entitled Beyond Kerguelenhas a marvellous music about it, a wonderful rhythm of words and a realrichness of utterance.  Some of the lines are strangely powerful, and,indeed, in spite of its exaggerated alliteration, or perhaps inconsequence of it, the whole poem is a most remarkable work of art.   Down in the South, by the waste without sail on it--      Far from the zone of the blossom and tree--   Lieth, with winter and whirlwind and wail on it,      Ghost of a land by the ghost of a sea.   Weird is the mist from the summit to base of it;      Sun of its heaven is wizened and grey;   Phantom of light is the light on the face of it--      Never is night on it, never is day!   Here is the shore without flower or bird on it;      Here is no litany sweet of the springs--   Only the haughty, harsh thunder is heard on it,      Only the storm, with a roar in its wings!   Back in the dawn of this beautiful sphere, on it--      Land of the dolorous, desolate face--   Beamed the blue day; and the beautiful year on it      Fostered the leaf and the blossom of grace.   Grand were the lights of its midsummer noon on it--      Mornings of majesty shone on its seas;   Glitter of star and the glory of moon on it      Fell, in the march of the musical breeze.   Valleys and hills, with the whisper of wing in them,      Dells of the daffodil--spaces impearled,   Flowered and flashed with the splendour of spring in them,      Back in the morn of this wonderful world.Mr. Sladen speaks of Alfred Domett as 'the author of one of the greatpoems of a century in which Shelley and Keats, Byron and Scott,Wordsworth and Tennyson have all flourished,' but the extracts he givesfrom Ranolf and Amohia hardly substantiate this claim, although the songof the Tree-God in the fourth book is clever but exasperating.A Midsummer's Noon, by Charles Harpur, 'the grey forefather of Australianpoetry,' is pretty and graceful, and Thomas Henry's Wood-Notes and MissVeel's Saturday Night are worth reading; but, on the whole, theAustralian poets are extremely dull and prosaic.  There seem to be nosirens in the New World.  As for Mr. Sladen himself, he has done his workvery conscientiously.  Indeed, in one instance he almost re-writes anentire poem in consequence of the manuscript having reached him in amutilated condition.   A pleasant land is the land of dreams      _At the back of the shining air_!   It hath _sunnier_ skies and _sheenier_ streams,      And gardens _than Earth's more_ fair,is the first verse of this lucubration, and Mr. Sladen informs us withjustifiable pride that the parts printed in italics are from his own pen!This is certainly editing with a vengeance, and we cannot help sayingthat it reflects more credit on Mr. Sladen's good nature than on hiscritical or his poetical powers.  The appearance, also, in a volume of'poems produced in Australia,' of selections from Horne's Orion cannot bedefended, especially as we are given no specimen of the poetry Hornewrote during the time that he actually was in Australia, where he heldthe office of 'Warden of the Blue Mountains'--a position which, as far asthe title goes, is the loveliest ever given to any poet, and would havesuited Wordsworth admirably: Wordsworth, that is to say, at his best, forhe not infrequently wrote like the Distributor of Stamps.  However, Mr.Sladen has shown great energy in the compilation of this bulky volumewhich, though it does not contain much that is of any artistic value, hasa certain historical interest, especially for those who care to study theconditions of intellectual life in the colonies of a great empire.  Thebiographical notices of the enormous crowd of verse-makers which isincluded in this volume are chiefly from the pen of Mr. Patchett Martin.Some of them are not very satisfactory.  'Formerly of West Australia, nowresiding at Boston, U.S.  Has published several volumes of poetry,' is aludicrously inadequate account of such a man as John Boyle O'Reilly,while in 'poet, essayist, critic, and journalist, one of the mostprominent figures in literary London,' few will recognise the industriousMr. William Sharp.Still, on the whole, we should be grateful for a volume that has given usspecimens of Kendall's work, and perhaps Mr. Sladen will some day producean anthology of Australian poetry, not a herbarium of Australian verse.His present book has many good qualities, but it is almost unreadable.Australian Poets, 1788-1888.  Edited by Douglas B. W. Sladen, B.A.  Oxon.(Griffith, Farran and Co.)SOME LITERARY NOTES--I(Woman's World, January 1889.)In a recent article on English Poetesses, {374} I ventured to suggestthat our women of letters should turn their attention somewhat more toprose and somewhat less to poetry.  Women seem to me to possess just whatour literature wants--a light touch, a delicate hand, a graceful mode oftreatment, and an unstudied felicity of phrase.  We want some one whowill do for our prose what Madame de Sevigne did for the prose of France.George Eliot's style was far too cumbrous, and Charlotte Bronte's tooexaggerated.  However, one must not forget that amongst the women ofEngland there have been some charming letter-writers, and certainly nobook can be more delightful reading than Mrs. Ross's Three Generations ofEnglish Women, which has recently appeared.  The three Englishwomen whosememoirs and correspondence Mrs. Ross has so admirably edited are Mrs.John Taylor, Mrs. Sarah Austin, and Lady Duff Gordon, all of themremarkable personalities, and two of them women of brilliant wit andEuropean reputation.  Mrs. Taylor belonged to that great Norwich familyabout whom the Duke of Sussex remarked that they reversed the ordinarysaying that it takes nine tailors to make a man, and was for many yearsone of the most distinguished figures in the famous society of her nativetown.  Her only daughter married John Austin, the great authority onjurisprudence, and her salon in Paris was the centre of the intellect andculture of her day.  Lucie Duff Gordon, the only child of John and SarahAustin, inherited the talents of her parents.  A beauty, a femmed'esprit, a traveller, and clever writer, she charmed and fascinated herage, and her premature death in Egypt was really a loss to ourliterature.  It is to her daughter that we owe this delightful volume ofmemoirs.First we are introduced to Mrs. Ross's great-grandmother, Mrs. Taylor,who 'was called, by her intimate friends, "Madame Roland of Norwich,"from her likeness to the portraits of the handsome and unfortunateFrenchwoman.'  We hear of her darning her boy's grey worsted stockingswhile holding her own with Southey and Brougham, and dancing round theTree of Liberty with Dr. Parr when the news of the fall of the Bastillewas first known.  Amongst her friends were Sir James Mackintosh, the mostpopular man of the day, 'to whom Madame de Stael wrote, "Il n'y a pas desociete sans vous."  "C'est tres ennuyeux de diner sans vous; la societene va pas quand vous n'etes pas la";' Sir James Smith, the botanist;Crabb Robinson; the Gurneys; Mrs. Barbauld; Dr. Alderson and his charmingdaughter, Amelia Opie; and many other well-known people.  Her letters areextremely sensible and thoughtful.  'Nothing at present,' she says in oneof them, 'suits my taste so well as Susan's Latin lessons, and herphilosophical old master . . . When we get to Cicero's discussions on thenature of the soul, or Virgil's fine descriptions, my mind is filled up.Life is either a dull round of eating, drinking, and sleeping, or a sparkof ethereal fire just kindled. . . .  The character of girls must dependupon their reading as much as upon the company they keep.  Besides theintrinsic pleasure to be derived from solid knowledge, a woman ought toconsider it as her best resource against poverty.'  This is a somewhatcaustic aphorism: 'A romantic woman is a troublesome friend, as sheexpects you to be as imprudent as herself, and is mortified at what shecalls coldness and insensibility.'  And this is admirable: 'The art oflife is not to estrange oneself from society, and yet not to pay too dearfor it.'  This, too, is good: 'Vanity, like curiosity, is wanted as astimulus to exertion; indolence would certainly get the better of us ifit were not for these two powerful principles'; and there is a keen touchof humour in the following: 'Nothing is so gratifying as the idea thatvirtue and philanthropy are becoming fashionable.'  Dr. James Martineau,in a letter to Mrs. Ross, gives us a pleasant picture of the old ladyreturning from market 'weighted by her huge basket, with the shank of aleg of mutton thrust out to betray its contents,' and talking divinelyabout philosophy, poets, politics, and every intellectual topic of theday.  She was a woman of admirable good sense, a type of Roman matron,and quite as careful as were the Roman matrons to keep up the purity ofher native tongue.Mrs. Taylor, however, was more or less limited to Norwich.  Mrs. Austinwas for the world.  In London, Paris, and Germany, she ruled anddominated society, loved by every one who knew her.  'She is "My best andbrightest" to Lord Jeffrey; "Dear, fair and wise" to Sydney Smith; "Mygreat ally" to Sir James Stephen; "Sunlight through waste welteringchaos" to Thomas Carlyle (while he needed her aid); "La petite mere dugenre humain" to Michael Chevalier; "Liebes Mutterlein" to John StuartMill; and "My own Professorin" to Charles Buller, to whom she taughtGerman, as well as to the sons of Mr. James Mill.'  Jeremy Bentham, whenon his deathbed, gave her a ring with his portrait and some of his hairlet in behind.  'There, my dear,' he said, 'it is the only ring I evergave a woman.'  She corresponded with Guizot, Barthelemy de St. Hilaire,the Grotes, Dr. Whewell, the Master of Trinity, Nassau Senior, theDuchesse d'Orleans, Victor Cousin, and many other distinguished people.Her translation of Ranke's History of the Popes is admirable; indeed, allher literary work was thoroughly well done, and her edition of herhusband's Province of Jurisprudence deserves the very highest praise.  Twopeople more unlike than herself and her husband it would have beendifficult to find.  He was habitually grave and despondent; she wasbrilliantly handsome, fond of society, in which she shone, and 'with analmost superabundance of energy and animal spirits,' Mrs. Ross tells us.She married him because she thought him perfect, but he never producedthe work of which he was worthy, and of which she knew him to be worthy.Her estimate of him in the preface to the Jurisprudence is wonderfullystriking and simple.  'He was never sanguine.  He was intolerant of anyimperfection.  He was always under the control of severe love of truth.He lived and died a poor man.'  She was terribly disappointed in him, butshe loved him.  Some years after his death, she wrote to M. Guizot:   In the intervals of my study of his works I read his letters to   me--_forty-five years of love-letters_, the last as tender and   passionate as the first.  And how full of noble sentiments!  The   midday of our lives was clouded and stormy, full of cares and   disappointments; but the sunset was bright and serene--as bright as   the morning, and _more_ serene.  Now it is night with me, and must   remain so till the dawn of another day.  I am always alone--that is,   _I live with him_.The most interesting letters in the book are certainly those to M.Guizot, with whom she maintained the closest intellectual friendship; butthere is hardly one of them that does not contain something clever, orthoughtful, or witty, while those addressed to her, in turn, are veryinteresting.  Carlyle writes her letters full of lamentations, the wailof a Titan in pain, superbly exaggerated for literary effect.   Literature, one's sole craft and staff of life, lies broken in   abeyance; what room for music amid the braying of innumerable   jackasses, the howling of innumerable hyaenas whetting the tooth to   eat them up?  Alas for it! it is a sick disjointed time; neither shall   we ever mend it; at best let us hope to mend ourselves.  I declare I   sometimes think of throwing down the Pen altogether as a worthless   weapon; and leading out a colony of these poor starving Drudges to the   waste places of their old Mother Earth, when for sweat of their brow   bread _will_ rise for them; it were perhaps the worthiest service that   at this moment could be rendered our old world to throw open for it   the doors of the New.  Thither must they come at last, 'bursts of   eloquence' will do nothing; men are starving and will try many things   before they die.  But poor I, ach Gott!  I am no Hengist or Alaric;   only a writer of Articles in bad prose; stick to thy last, O Tutor;   the Pen is not worthless, it is omnipotent to those who have Faith.Henri Beyle (Stendhal), the great, I am often tempted to think thegreatest of French novelists, writes her a charming letter about nuances.'It seems to me,' he says, 'that except when they read Shakespeare,Byron, or Sterne, no Englishman understands "nuances"; we adore them.  Afool says to a woman, "I love you"; the words mean nothing, he might aswell say "Olli Batachor"; it is the nuance which gives force to themeaning.'  In 1839 Mrs. Austin writes to Victor Cousin: 'I have seenyoung Gladstone, a distinguished Tory who wants to re-establish educationbased on the Church in quite a Catholic form'; and we find hercorresponding with Mr. Gladstone on the subject of education.  'If youare strong enough to provide motives and checks,' she says to him, 'youmay do two blessed acts--reform your clergy and teach your people.  As itis, how few of them conceive what it is to teach a people'!  Mr.Gladstone replies at great length, and in many letters, from which we mayquote this passage:   You are for pressing and urging the people to their profit against   their inclination: so am I.  You set little value upon all merely   technical instruction, upon all that fails to touch the inner nature   of man: so do I.  And here I find ground of union broad and deep-laid   . . .   I more than doubt whether your idea, namely that of raising man to   social sufficiency and morality, can be accomplished, except through   the ancient religion of Christ; . . . or whether, the principles of   eclecticism are legitimately applicable to the Gospel; or whether, if   we find ourselves in a state of incapacity to work through the Church,   we can remedy the defect by the adoption of principles contrary to   hers . . .   But indeed I am most unfit to pursue the subject; private   circumstances of no common interest are upon me, as I have become very   recently engaged to Miss Glynne, and I hope your recollections will   enable you in some degree to excuse me.Lord Jeffrey has a very curious and suggestive letter on populareducation, in which he denies, or at least doubts, the effect of thiseducation on morals.  He, however, supports it on the ground 'that itwill increase the enjoyment of individuals,' which is certainly a verysensible claim.  Humboldt writes to her about an old Indian languagewhich was preserved by a parrot, the tribe who spoke it having beenexterminated, and about 'young Darwin,' who had just published his firstbook.  Here are some extracts from her own letters:   I heard from Lord Lansdowne two or three days ago. . . .  I think he   is ce que nous avons de mieux.  He wants only the energy that great   ambition gives.  He says, 'We shall have a parliament of railway   kings' . . . what can be worse than that?--The deification of money by   a whole people.  As Lord Brougham says, we have no right to give   ourselves pharisaical airs.  I must give you a story sent to me.  Mrs.   Hudson, the railway queen, was shown a bust of Marcus Aurelius at Lord   Westminster's, on which she said, 'I suppose that is not the present   Marquis.'  To gouter this, you must know that the extreme vulgar   (hackney coachmen, etc.) in England pronounce 'marquis' very like   'Marcus.'   Dec, 11th.--Went to Savigny's.  Nobody was there but W. Grimm and his   wife and a few men.  Grimm told me he had received two volumes of   Norwegian fairy-tales, and that they were delightful.  Talking of   them, I said, 'Your children appear to be the happiest in the world;   they live in the midst of fairytales.'  'Ah,' said he, 'I must tell   you about that.  When we were at Gottingen, somebody spoke to my   little son about his father's Mahrchen.  He had read them, but never   thought of their being mine.  He came running to me, and said with an   offended air, "Father, they say you wrote those fairy-tales; surely   you never invented such silly rubbish?"  He thought it below my   dignity.'   Savigny told a Volksmahrchen too:   'St. Anselm was grown old and infirm, and lay on the ground among   thorns and thistles.  Der liebe Gott said to him, "You are very badly   lodged there; why don't you build yourself a house?"  "Before I take   the trouble," said Anselm, "I should like to know how long I have to   live."  "About thirty years," said Der liebe Gott.  "Oh, for so short   a time," replied he, "it's not worth while," and turned himself round   among the thistles.'   Dr. Franck told me a story of which I had never heard before.  Voltaire   had for some reason or other taken a grudge against the prophet   Habakkuk, and affected to find in him things he never wrote.  Somebody   took the Bible and began to demonstrate to him that he was mistaken.   'C'est egal,' he said, impatiently, 'Habakkuk etait capable de tout!'   Oct. 30, 1853.   I am not in love with the Richtung (tendency) of our modern novelists.   There is abundance of talent; but writing a pretty, graceful,   touching, yet pleasing story is the last thing our writers nowadays   think of.  Their novels are party pamphlets on political or social   questions, like Sybil, or Alton Locke, or Mary Barton, or Uncle Tom;   or they are the most minute and painful dissections of the least   agreeable and beautiful parts of our nature, like those of Miss   Bronte--Jane Eyre and Villette; or they are a kind of martyrology,   like Mrs. Marsh's Emilia Wyndham, which makes you almost doubt whether   any torments the heroine would have earned by being naughty could   exceed those she incurred by her virtue.   Where, oh! where is the charming, humane, gentle spirit that dictated   the Vicar of Wakefield--the spirit which Goethe so justly calls   versohnend (reconciling), with all the weaknesses and woes of   humanity? . . .  Have you read Thackeray's Esmond?  It is a curious   and very successful attempt to imitate the style of our old novelists.   . . .  Which of Mrs. Gore's novels are translated?  They are very   clever, lively, worldly, bitter, disagreeable, and entertaining. . . .   Miss Austen's--are they translated?  They are not new, and are Dutch   paintings of every-day people--very clever, very true, very   _unaesthetic_, but amusing.  I have not seen Ruth, by Mrs. Gaskell.  I   hear it much admired--and blamed.  It is one of the many proofs of the   desire women now have to friser questionable topics, and to poser   insoluble moral problems.  George Sand has turned their heads in that   direction.  I think a few _broad_ scenes or hearty jokes a la Fielding   were very harmless in comparison.  They _confounded_ nothing. . . .   The Heir of Redcliffe I have not read. . . .  I am not worthy of   superhuman flights of virtue--in a novel.  I want to see how people   act and suffer who are as good-for-nothing as I am myself.  Then I   have the sinful pretension to be amused, whereas all our novelists   want to reform us, and to show us what a hideous place this world is:   Ma foi, je ne le sais que trap, without their help.   The Head of the Family has some merits . . . But there is too much   affliction and misery and frenzy.  The heroine is one of those   creatures now so common (in novels), who remind me of a poor bird tied   to a stake (as was once the cruel sport of boys) to be 'shyed' at   (i.e. pelted) till it died; only our gentle lady-writers at the end of   all untie the poor battered bird, and assure us that it is never the   worse for all the blows it has had--nay, the better--and that now,   with its broken wings and torn feathers and bruised body, it is going   to be quite happy.  No, fair ladies, you know that it is not   so--_resigned_, if you please, but make me no shams of happiness out   of such wrecks.In politics Mrs. Austin was a philosophical Tory.  Radicalism shedetested, and she and most of her friends seem to have regarded it asmoribund.  'The Radical party is evidently effete,' she writes to M.Victor Cousin; the probable 'leader of the Tory party' is Mr. Gladstone.'The people must be instructed, must be guided, must be, in short,governed,' she writes elsewhere; and in a letter to Dr. Whewell, she saysthat the state of things in France fills 'me with the deepest anxiety onone point,--the point on which the permanency of our institutions and oursalvation as a nation turn.  Are our higher classes able to keep the leadof the rest?  If they are, we are safe; if not, I agree with my poor dearCharles Buller--_our_ turn must come.  Now Cambridge and Oxford mustreally look to this.'  The belief in the power of the Universities tostem the current of democracy is charming.  She grew to regard Carlyle as'one of the dissolvents of the age--as mischievous as his extravaganceswill let him be'; speaks of Kingsley and Maurice as 'pernicious'; andtalks of John Stuart Mill as a 'demagogue.'  She was no doctrinaire.  'Oneounce of education demanded is worth a pound imposed.  It is no use togive the meat before you give the hunger.'  She was delighted at a letterof St. Hilaire's, in which he said, 'We have a system and no results; youhave results and no system.'  Yet she had a deep sympathy with the wantsof the people.  She was horrified at something Babbage told her of thepopulation of some of the manufacturing towns who are _worked out_ beforethey attain to thirty years of age.  'But I am persuaded that the remedywill not, cannot come from the people,' she adds.  Many of her lettersare concerned with the question of the higher education of women.  Shediscusses Buckle's lecture on 'The Influence of Women upon the Progressof Knowledge,' admits to M. Guizot that women's intellectual life islargely coloured by the emotions, but adds: 'One is not precisely a foolbecause one's opinions are greatly influenced by one's affections.  Theopinions of men are often influenced by worse things.'  Dr. Whewellconsults her about lecturing women on Plato, being slightly afraid lestpeople should think it ridiculous; Comte writes her elaborate letters onthe relation of women to progress; and Mr. Gladstone promises that Mrs.Gladstone will carry out at Hawarden the suggestions contained in one ofher pamphlets.  She was always very practical, and never lost heradmiration for plain sewing.All through the book we come across interesting and amusing things.  Shegets St. Hilaire to order a large, sensible bonnet for her in Paris,which was at once christened the 'Aristotelian,' and was supposed to bethe only useful bonnet in England.  Grote has to leave Paris after thecoup d'etat, he tells her, because he cannot bear to see theestablishment of a Greek tyrant.  Alfred de Vigny, Macaulay, JohnStirling, Southey, Alexis de Tocqueville, Hallam, and Jean Jacques Ampereall contribute to these pleasant pages.  She seems to have inspired thewarmest feelings of friendship in those who knew her.  Guizot writes toher: 'Madame de Stael used to say that the best thing in the world was aserious Frenchman.  I turn the compliment, and say that the best thing inthe world is an affectionate Englishman.  How much more an Englishwoman!Given equal qualities, a woman is always more charming than a man.'Lucie Austin, afterwards Lady Duff Gordon, was born in 1821.  Her chiefplayfellow was John Stuart Mill, and Jeremy Bentham's garden was herplayground.  She was a lovely, romantic child, who was always wanting theflowers to talk to her, and used to invent the most wonderful storiesabout animals, of whom she was passionately fond.  In 1834 Mrs. Austindecided on leaving England, and Sydney Smith wrote his immortal letter tothe little girl:   Lucie, Lucie, my dear child, don't tear your frock: tearing frocks is   not of itself a proof of genius.  But write as your mother writes, act   as your mother acts: be frank, loyal, affectionate, simple, honest,   and then integrity or laceration of frock is of little import.  And   Lucie, dear child, mind your arithmetic.  You know in the first sum of   yours I ever saw there was a mistake.  You had carried two (as a cab   is licensed to do), and you ought, dear Lucie, to have carried but   one.  Is this a trifle?  What would life be without arithmetic but a   scene of horrors?  You are going to Boulogne, the city of debts,   peopled by men who have never understood arithmetic.  By the time you   return, I shall probably have received my first paralytic stroke, and   shall have lost all recollection of you.  Therefore I now give you my   parting advice--don't marry anybody who has not a tolerable   understanding and a thousand a year.  And God bless you, dear child.At Boulogne she sat next Heine at table d'hote.  'He heard me speakGerman to my mother, and soon began to talk to me, and then said, "Whenyou go back to England, you can tell your friends that you have seenHeinrich Heine."  I replied, "And who is Heinrich Heine?"  He laughedheartily and took no offence at my ignorance; and we used to lounge onthe end of the pier together, where he told me stories in which fish,mermaids, water-sprites and a very funny old French fiddler with a poodlewere mixed up in the most fanciful manner, sometimes humorous, and veryoften pathetic, especially when the water-sprites brought him greetingsfrom the "Nord See."  He was . . . so kind to me and so sarcastic toevery one else.'  Twenty years afterwards the little girl whose 'brauneAugen' Heine had celebrated in his charming poem Wenn ich an deinemHause, used to go and see the dying poet in Paris.  'It does one good,'he said to her, 'to see a woman who does not carry about a broken heart,to be mended by all sorts of men, like the women here, who do not seethat a total want of heart is their real failing.'  On another occasionhe said to her: 'I have now made peace with the whole world, and at lastalso with God, who sends thee to me as a beautiful angel of death: Ishall certainly soon die.'  Lady Duff Gordon said to him: 'Poor Poet, doyou still retain such splendid illusions, that you transform a travellingEnglishwoman into Azrael?  That used not to be the case, for you alwaysdisliked us.'  He answered: 'Yes, I do not know what possessed me todislike the English, . . . it really was only petulance; I never hatedthem, indeed, I never knew them.  I was only once in England, but knew noone, and found London very dreary, and the people and the streets odious.But England has revenged herself well; she has sent me most excellentfriends--thyself and Milnes, that good Milnes.'There are delightful letters from Dicky Doyle here, with the most amusingdrawings, one of the present Sir Robert Peel as he made his maiden speechin the House being excellent; and the various descriptions of Hassan'sperformances are extremely amusing.  Hassan was a black boy, who had beenturned away by his master because he was going blind, and was found byLady Duff Gordon one night sitting on her doorstep.  She took care ofhim, and had him cured, and he seems to have been a constant source ofdelight to every one.  On one occasion, 'when Prince Louis Napoleon (thelate Emperor of the French) came in unexpectedly, he gravely said:"Please, my Lady, I ran out and bought twopenny worth of sprats for thePrince, and for the honour of the house."'  Here is an amusing letterfrom Mrs. Norton:   MY DEAR LUCIE,--We have never thanked you for the red Pots, which no   early Christian should be without, and which add that finishing stroke   to the splendour of our demesne, which was supposed to depend on a   roc's egg, in less intelligent times.  We have now a warm Pompeian   appearance, and the constant contemplation of these classical objects   favours the beauty of the facial line; for what can be deduced from   the great fact, apparent in all the states of antiquity, that   _straight noses_ were the ancient custom, but the logical assumption   that the constant habit of turning up the nose at unsightly   objects--such as the National Gallery and other offensive and   obtrusive things--has produced the modern divergence from the true and   proper line of profile?  I rejoice to think that we ourselves are   exempt.  I attribute this to our love of Pompeian Pots (on account of   the beauty and distinction of this Pot's shape I spell it with a big   P), which has kept us straight in a world of crookedness.  The pursuit   of profiles under difficulties--how much more rare than a pursuit of   knowledge!  Talk of setting good examples before our children!  Bah!   let us set good Pompeian Pots before our children, and when they grow   up they will not depart from them.Lady Duff Gordon's Letters from the Cape, and her brilliant translationof The Amber Witch, are, of course, well known.  The latter book was,with Lady Wilde's translation of Sidonia the Sorceress, my favouriteromantic reading when a boy.  Her letters from Egypt are wonderfullyvivid and picturesque.  Here is an interesting bit of art criticism:   Sheykh Yoosuf laughed so heartily over a print in an illustrated paper   from a picture of Hilton's of Rebekah at the well, with the old   'wekeel' of 'Sidi Ibraheem' (Abraham's chief servant) _kneeling_   before the girl he was sent to fetch, like an old fool without his   turban, and Rebekah and the other girls in queer fancy dresses, and   the camels with snouts like pigs.  'If the painter could not go into   "Es Sham" to see how the Arab really look,' said Sheykh Yoosuf, 'why   did he not paint a well in England, with girls like English   peasants--at least it would have looked natural to English people? and   the wekeel would not seem so like a madman if he had taken off a hat!'   I cordially agree with Yoosuf's art criticism.  _Fancy_ pictures of   Eastern things are hopelessly absurd.Mrs. Ross has certainly produced a most fascinating volume, and her bookis one of the books of the season.  It is edited with tact and judgment.* * * * *Caroline, by Lady Lindsay, is certainly Lady Lindsay's best work.  It iswritten in a very clever modern style, and is as full of esprit and witas it is of subtle psychological insight.  Caroline is an heiress, who,coming downstairs at a Continental hotel, falls into the arms of acharming, penniless young man.  The hero of the novel is the young man'sfriend, Lord Lexamont, who makes the 'great renunciation,' and succeedsin being fine without being priggish, and Quixotic without beingridiculous.  Miss Ffoulkes, the elderly spinster, is a capital character,and, indeed, the whole book is cleverly written.  It has also theadvantage of being in only one volume.  The influence of Mudie onliterature, the baneful influence of the circulating library, is clearlyon the wane.  The gain to literature is incalculable.  English novelswere becoming very tedious with their three volumes of padding--at least,the second volume was always padding--and extremely indigestible.  Areckless punster once remarked to me, apropos of English novels, that'the proof of the padding is in the eating,' and certainly Englishfiction has been very heavy--heavy with the best intentions.  LadyLindsay's book is a sign that better things are in store for us.  She isbrief and bright.* * * * *What are the best books to give as Christmas presents to good girls whoare always pretty, or to pretty girls who are occasionally good?  Peopleare so fond of giving away what they do not want themselves, that charityis largely on the increase.  But with this kind of charity I have notmuch sympathy.  If one gives away a book, it should be a charming book--socharming, that one regrets having given it, and would not take it back.Looking over the Christmas books sent to me by various publishers, I findthat these are the best and the most pleasing: Gleanings from the'Graphic,' by Randolph Caldecott, a most fascinating volume full ofsketches that have real wit and humour of line, and are not simplydependent on what the French call the legende, the literary explanation;Meg's Friend, by Alice Corkran, one of our most delicate and gracefulprose-writers in the sphere of fiction, and one whose work has the rareartistic qualities of refinement and simplicity; Under False Colours, bySarah Doudney, an excellent story; The Fisherman's Daughter, by FlorenceMontgomery, the author of Misunderstood, a tale with real charm of ideaand treatment; Under a Cloud, by the author of The Atelier du Lys, andquite worthy of its author; The Third Miss St. Quentin, by Mrs.Molesworth, and A Christmas Posy from the same fascinating pen, and withdelightful illustrations by Walter Crane.  Miss Rosa Mulholland'sGiannetta and Miss Agnes Giberne's Ralph Hardcastle's Will are alsoadmirable books for presents, and the bound volume of Atalanta has muchthat is delightful both in art and in literature.The prettiest, indeed the most beautiful, book from an artistic point ofview is undoubtedly Mr. Walter Crane's Flora's Feast.  It is animaginative Masque of Flowers, and as lovely in colour as it is exquisitein design.  It shows us the whole pomp and pageant of the year, theSnowdrops like white-crested knights, the little naked Crocus kneeling tocatch the sunlight in his golden chalice, the Daffodils blowing theirtrumpets like young hunters, the Anemones with their wind-blown raiment,the green-kirtled Marsh-marigolds, and the 'Lady-smocks allsilver-white,' tripping over the meadows like Arcadian milk-maids.Buttercups are here, and the white-plumed Thorn in spiky armour, and theCrown-imperial borne in stately procession, and red-bannered Tulips, andHyacinths with their spring bells, and Chaucer's Daisy--      small and sweet,   Si douce est la Marguerite.Gorgeous Peonies, and Columbines 'that drew the car of Venus,' and theRose with her lover, and the stately white-vestured Lilies, and widestaring Ox-eyes, and scarlet Poppies pass before us.  There are Primrosesand Corncockles, Chrysanthemums in robes of rich brocade, Sunflowers andtall Hollyhocks, and pale Christmas Roses.  The designs for theDaffodils, the wild Roses, the Convolvulus, and the Hollyhock areadmirable, and would be beautiful in embroidery or in any preciousmaterial.  Indeed, any one who wishes to find beautiful designs cannot dobetter than get the book.  It is, in its way, a little masterpiece, andits grace and fancy, and beauty of line and colour, cannot beover-estimated.  The Greeks gave human form to wood and stream, and sawNature best in Naiad or in Dryad.  Mr. Crane, with something of Gothicfantasy, has caught the Greek feeling, the love of personification, thepassion for representing things under the conditions of the human form.The flowers are to him so many knights and ladies, page-boys or shepherd-boys, divine nymphs or simple girls, and in their fair bodies or fancifulraiment one can see the flower's very form and absolute essence, so thatone loves their artistic truth no less than their artistic beauty.  Thisbook contains some of the best work Mr. Crane has ever done.  His art isnever so successful as when it is entirely remote from life.  Theslightest touch of actuality seems to kill it.  It lives, or should live,in a world of its own fashioning.  It is decorative in its completesubordination of fact to beauty of effect, in the grandeur of its curvesand lines, in its entirely imaginative treatment.  Almost every page ofthis book gives a suggestion for some rich tapestry, some fine screen,some painted cassone, some carving in wood or ivory.* * * * *From Messrs. Hildesheimer and Faulkner I have received a large collectionof Christmas cards and illustrated books.  One of the latter, an editionde luxe of Sheridan's Here's to the Maiden of Bashful Fifteen, is verycleverly illustrated by Miss Alice Havers and Mr. Ernest Wilson.  Itseems to me, however, that there is a danger of modern illustrationbecoming too pictorial.  What we need is good book-ornament, decorativeornament that will go with type and printing, and give to each page aharmony and unity of effect.  Merely dotting a page with reproductions ofwater-colour drawings will not do.  It is true that Japanese art, whichis essentially decorative, is pictorial also.  But the Japanese have themost wonderful delicacy of touch, and with a science so subtle that itgives the effect of exquisite accident, they can by mere placing make anundecorated space decorative.  There is also an intimate connectionbetween their art and their handwriting or printed characters.  They bothgo together, and show the same feeling for form and line.  Our aim shouldbe to discover some mode of illustration that will harmonise with theshapes of our letters.  At present there is a discord between ourpictorial illustrations and our unpictorial type.  The former are tooessentially imitative in character, and often disturb a page instead ofdecorating it.  However, I suppose we must regard most of these Christmasbooks merely as books of pictures, with a running accompaniment ofexplanatory text.  As the text, as a rule, consists of poetry, this isputting the poet in a very subordinate position; but the poetry in thebooks of this kind is not, as a rule, of a very high order of excellence.(1) Three Generations of English Women.

(Hildesheimerand Faulkner.)POETRY AND PRISON(Pall Mall Gazette, January 3, 1889.)Prison has had an admirable effect on Mr. Wilfrid Blunt as a poet.  TheLove Sonnets of Proteus, in spite of their clever Musset-like modernitiesand their swift brilliant wit, were but affected or fantastic at best.They were simply the records of passing moods and moments, of which somewere sad and others sweet, and not a few shameful.  Their subject was notof high or serious import.  They contained much that was wilful and weak.In Vinculis, upon the other hand, is a book that stirs one by its finesincerity of purpose, its lofty and impassioned thought, its depth andardour of intense feeling.  'Imprisonment,' says Mr. Blunt in hispreface, 'is a reality of discipline most useful to the modern soul,lapped as it is in physical sloth and self-indulgence.  Like a sicknessor a spiritual retreat it purifies and ennobles; and the soul emergesfrom it stronger and more self-contained.'  To him, certainly, it hasbeen a mode of purification.  The opening sonnets, composed in the bleakcell of Galway Gaol, and written down on the fly-leaves of the prisoner'sprayer-book, are full of things nobly conceived and nobly uttered, andshow that though Mr. Balfour may enforce 'plain living' by his prisonregulations, he cannot prevent 'high thinking' or in any way limit orconstrain the freedom of a man's soul.  They are, of course, intenselypersonal in expression.  They could not fail to be so.  But thepersonality that they reveal has nothing petty or ignoble about it.  Thepetulant cry of the shallow egoist which was the chief characteristic ofthe Love Sonnets of Proteus is not to be found here.  In its place wehave wild grief and terrible scorn, fierce rage and flame-like passion.Such a sonnet as the following comes out of the very fire of heart andbrain:   God knows, 'twas not with a fore-reasoned plan      I left the easeful dwellings of my peace,   And sought this combat with ungodly Man,      And ceaseless still through years that do not cease      Have warred with Powers and Principalities.   My natural soul, ere yet these strifes began,      Was as a sister diligent to please   And loving all, and most the human clan.   God knows it.  And He knows how the world's tears      Touched me.  And He is witness of my wrath,   How it was kindled against murderers      Who slew for gold, and how upon their path   I met them.  Since which day the World in arms   Strikes at my life with angers and alarms.And this sonnet has all the strange strength of that despair which is butthe prelude to a larger hope:   I thought to do a deed of chivalry,      An act of worth, which haply in her sight   Who was my mistress should recorded be      And of the nations.  And, when thus the fight      Faltered and men once bold with faces white   Turned this and that way in excuse to flee,      I only stood, and by the foeman's might   Was overborne and mangled cruelly.   Then crawled I to her feet, in whose dear cause      I made this venture, and 'Behold,' I said,   'How I am wounded for thee in these wars.'      But she, 'Poor cripple, would'st thou I should wed   A limbless trunk?' and laughing turned from me.   Yet she was fair, and her name 'Liberty.'The sonnet beginning   A prison is a convent without God--      Poverty, Chastity, Obedience   Its precepts are:is very fine; and this, written just after entering the gaol, ispowerful:   Naked I came into the world of pleasure,      And naked come I to this house of pain.   Here at the gate I lay down my life's treasure,      My pride, my garments and my name with men.      The world and I henceforth shall be as twain,   No sound of me shall pierce for good or ill      These walls of grief.  Nor shall I hear the vain   Laughter and tears of those who love me still.   Within, what new life waits me!  Little ease,      Cold lying, hunger, nights of wakefulness,   Harsh orders given, no voice to soothe or please,      Poor thieves for friends, for books rules meaningless;   This is the grave--nay, hell.  Yet, Lord of Might,   Still in Thy light my spirit shall see light.But, indeed, all the sonnets are worth reading, and The Canon of Aughrim,the longest poem in the book, is a most masterly and dramatic descriptionof the tragic life of the Irish peasant.  Literature is not much indebtedto Mr. Balfour for his sophistical Defence of Philosophic Doubt which isone of the dullest books we know, but it must be admitted that by sendingMr. Blunt to gaol he has converted a clever rhymer into an earnest anddeep-thinking poet.  The narrow confines of the prison cell seem to suitthe 'sonnet's scanty plot of ground,' and an unjust imprisonment for anoble cause strengthens as well as deepens the nature.In Vinculis.  By Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, Author of The Wind and theWhirlwind, The Love Sonnets of Proteus, etc. etc.  (Kegan Paul.)THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO WALT WHITMAN(Pall Mall Gazette, January 25, 1889.)'No one will get at my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literaryperformance . . . or as aiming mainly toward art and aestheticism.''Leaves of Grass . . . has mainly been the outcropping of my ownemotional and other personal nature--an attempt, from first to last, toput _a Person_, a human being (myself, in the latter half of theNineteenth Century in America,) freely, fully and truly on record.  Icould not find any similar personal record in current literature thatsatisfied me.'  In these words Walt Whitman gives us the true attitude weshould adopt towards his work, having, indeed, a much saner view of thevalue and meaning of that work than either his eloquent admirers or noisydetractors can boast of possessing.  His last book, November Boughs, ashe calls it, published in the winter of the old man's life, reveals tous, not indeed a soul's tragedy, for its last note is one of joy andhope, and noble and unshaken faith in all that is fine and worthy of suchfaith, but certainly the drama of a human soul, and puts on record with asimplicity that has in it both sweetness and strength the record of hisspiritual development, and of the aim and motive both of the manner andthe matter of his work.  His strange mode of expression is shown in thesepages to have been the result of deliberate and self-conscious choice.The 'barbaric yawp' which he sent over 'the roofs of the world' so manyyears ago, and which wrung from Mr. Swinburne's lip such lofty panegyricin song and such loud clamorous censure in prose, appears here in whatwill be to many an entirely new light.  For in his very rejection of artWalt Whitman is an artist.  He tried to produce a certain effect bycertain means and he succeeded.  There is much method in what many havetermed his madness, too much method, indeed, some may be tempted tofancy.In the story of his life, as he tells it to us, we find him at the age ofsixteen beginning a definite and philosophical study of literature:   Summers and falls, I used to go off, sometimes for a week at a   stretch, down in the country, or to Long Island's seashores--there, in   the presence of outdoor influences, I went over thoroughly the Old and   New Testaments, and absorb'd (probably to better advantage for me than   in any library or indoor room--it makes such difference _where_ you   read) Shakspere, Ossian, the best translated versions I could get of   Homer, Eschylus, Sophocles, the old German Nibelungen, the ancient   Hindoo poems, and one or two other masterpieces, Dante's among them.   As it happened, I read the latter mostly in an old wood.  The Iliad   . . . I read first thoroughly on the peninsula of Orient, northeast end   of Long Island, in a sheltered hollow of rock and sand, with the sea   on each side.  (I have wonder'd since why I was not overwhelmed by   those mighty masters.  Likely because I read them, as described, in   the full presence of Nature, under the sun, with the far-spreading   landscape and vistas, or the sea rolling in.)Edgar Allan Poe's amusing bit of dogmatism that, for our occasions andour day, 'there can be no such thing as a long poem,' fascinated him.'The same thought had been haunting my mind before,' he said, 'but Poe'sargument . . . work'd the sum out, and proved it to me,' and the Englishtranslation of the Bible seems to have suggested to him the possibilityof a poetic form which, while retaining the spirit of poetry, would stillbe free from the trammels of rhyme and of a definite metrical system.Having thus, to a certain degree, settled upon what one might call the'technique' of Whitmanism, he began to brood upon the nature of thatspirit which was to give life to the strange form.  The central point ofthe poetry of the future seemed to him to be necessarily 'an identicalbody and soul, a personality,' in fact, which personality, he tells usfrankly, 'after many considerations and ponderings I deliberately settledshould be myself.'  However, for the true creation and revealing of thispersonality, at first only dimly felt, a new stimulus was needed.  Thiscame from the Civil War.  After describing the many dreams and passionsof his boyhood and early manhood, he goes on to say:   These, however, and much more might have gone on and come to naught   (almost positively would have come to naught,) if a sudden, vast,   terrible, direct and indirect stimulus for new and national   declamatory expression had not been given to me.  It is certain, I   say, that although I had made a start before, only from the occurrence   of the Secession War, and what it show'd me as by flashes of   lightning, with the emotional depths it sounded and arous'd (of   course, I don't mean in my own heart only, I saw it just as plainly in   others, in millions)--that only from the strong flare and provocation   of that war's sights and scenes the final reasons-for-being of an   autochthonic and passionate song definitely came forth.   I went down to the war fields of Virginia . . . lived thenceforward in   camp--saw great battles and the days and nights afterward--partook of   all the fluctuations, gloom, despair, hopes again arous'd, courage   evoked--death readily risk'd--_the cause_, too--along and filling   those agonistic and lurid following years . . . the real parturition   years . . . of this henceforth homogeneous Union.  Without those three   or four years and the experiences they gave, Leaves of Grass would not   now be existing.Having thus obtained the necessary stimulus for the quickening andawakening of the personal self, some day to be endowed with universality,he sought to find new notes of song, and, passing beyond the mere passionfor expression, he aimed at 'Suggestiveness' first.   I round and finish little, if anything; and could not, consistently   with my scheme.  The reader will have his or her part to do, just as   much as I have had mine.  I seek less to state or display any theme or   thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the   theme or thought--there to pursue your own flight.Another 'impetus-word' is Comradeship, and other 'word-signs' are GoodCheer, Content and Hope.  Individuality, especially, he sought for:   I have allowed the stress of my poems from beginning to end to bear   upon American individuality and assist it--not only because that is a   great lesson in Nature, amid all her generalising laws, but as   counterpoise to the leveling tendencies of Democracy--and for other   reasons.  Defiant of ostensible literary and other conventions, I   avowedly chant 'the great pride of man in himself,' and permit it to   be more or less a motif of nearly all my verse.  I think this pride   indispensable to an American.  I think it not inconsistent with   obedience, humility, deference, and self-questioning.A new theme also was to be found in the relation of the sexes, conceivedin a natural, simple and healthy form, and he protests against poor Mr.William Rossetti's attempt to Bowdlerise and expurgate his song.   From another point of view Leaves of Grass is avowedly the song of Sex   and Amativeness, and even Animality--though meanings that do not   usually go along with these words are behind all, and will duly   emerge; and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and   atmosphere.  Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few lines, I   shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath   to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been   left unwritten were those lines omitted. . . .   Universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities . . . there   is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their normal   recognizance.  Literature is always calling in the doctor for   consultation and confession, and always giving evasions and swathing   suppressions in place of that 'heroic nudity,' on which only a genuine   diagnosis . . . can be built.  And in respect to editions of Leaves of   Grass in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion now to   confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate   renewals of thirty years, and to hereby prohibit, as far as word of   mine can do so, any elision of them.But beyond all these notes and moods and motives is the lofty spirit of agrand and free acceptance of all things that are worthy of existence.  Hedesired, he says, 'to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact shoulddirectly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom,health, mystery, beauty of every process, every concrete object, everyhuman or other existence, not only consider'd from the point of view ofall, but of each.'  His two final utterances are that 'really greatpoetry is always . . . the result of a national spirit, and not theprivilege of a polish'd and select few'; and that 'the strongest andsweetest songs yet remain to be sung.'Such are the views contained in the opening essay A Backward Glance O'erTravel'd Roads, as he calls it; but there are many other essays in thisfascinating volume, some on poets such as Burns and Lord Tennyson, forwhom Walt Whitman has a profound admiration; some on old actors andsingers, the elder Booth, Forrest, Alboni and Mario being his specialfavourites; others on the native Indians, on the Spanish element inAmerican nationality, on Western slang, on the poetry of the Bible, andon Abraham Lincoln.  But Walt Whitman is at his best when he is analysinghis own work and making schemes for the poetry of the future.  Literature,to him, has a distinctly social aim.  He seeks to build up the masses by'building up grand individuals.'  And yet literature itself must bepreceded by noble forms of life.  'The best literature is always theresult of something far greater than itself--not the hero but theportrait of the hero.  Before there can be recorded history or poem theremust be the transaction.'  Certainly, in Walt Whitman's views there is alargeness of vision, a healthy sanity and a fine ethical purpose.  He isnot to be placed with the professional litterateurs of his country,Boston novelists, New York poets and the like.  He stands apart, and thechief value of his work is in its prophecy, not in its performance.  Hehas begun a prelude to larger themes.  He is the herald to a new era.  Asa man he is the precursor of a fresh type.  He is a factor in the heroicand spiritual evolution of the human being.  If Poetry has passed him by,Philosophy will take note of him.November Boughs.  By Walt Whitman.  (Alexander Gardner.)THE NEW PRESIDENT(Pall Mall Gazette, January 26, 1889.)In a little book that he calls The Enchanted Island Mr. Wyke Bayliss, thenew President of the Royal Society of British Artists, has given hisgospel of art to the world.  His predecessor in office had also a gospelof art but it usually took the form of an autobiography.  Mr. Whistleralways spelt art, and we believe still spells it, with a capital 'I.'However, he was never dull.  His brilliant wit, his caustic satire, andhis amusing epigrams, or, perhaps, we should say epitaphs, on hiscontemporaries, made his views on art as delightful as they weremisleading and as fascinating as they were unsound.  Besides, heintroduced American humour into art criticism, and for this, if for noother reason, he deserves to be affectionately remembered.  Mr. WykeBayliss, upon the other hand, is rather tedious.  The last Presidentnever said much that was true, but the present President never saysanything that is new; and, if art be a fairy-haunted wood or an enchantedisland, we must say that we prefer the old Puck to the fresh Prospero.Water is an admirable thing--at least, the Greeks said it was--and Mr.Ruskin is an admirable writer; but a combination of both is a littledepressing.Still, it is only right to add that Mr. Wyke Bayliss, at his best, writesvery good English.  Mr. Whistler, for some reason or other, alwaysadopted the phraseology of the minor prophets.  Possibly it was in orderto emphasise his well-known claims to verbal inspiration, or perhaps hethought with Voltaire that Habakkuk etait capable de tout, and wished toshelter himself under the shield of a definitely irresponsible writernone of whose prophecies, according to the French philosopher, has everbeen fulfilled.  The idea was clever enough at the beginning, butultimately the manner became monotonous.  The spirit of the Hebrews isexcellent but their mode of writing is not to be imitated, and no amountof American jokes will give it that modernity which is essential to agood literary style.  Admirable as are Mr. Whistler's fireworks oncanvas, his fireworks in prose are abrupt, violent and exaggerated.However, oracles, since the days of the Pythia, have never beenremarkable for style, and the modest Mr. Wyke Bayliss is as much Mr.Whistler's superior as a writer as he is his inferior as a painter and anartist.  Indeed, some of the passages in this book are so charminglywritten and with such felicity of phrase that we cannot help feeling thatthe President of the British Artists, like a still more famous Presidentof our day, can express himself far better through the medium ofliterature than he can through the medium of line and colour.  This,however, applies only to Mr. Wyke Bayliss's prose.  His poetry is verybad, and the sonnets at the end of the book are almost as mediocre as thedrawings that accompany them.  As we read them we cannot but regret that,in this point at any rate, Mr. Bayliss has not imitated the wise exampleof his predecessor who, with all his faults, was never guilty of writinga line of poetry, and is, indeed, quite incapable of doing anything ofthe kind.As for the matter of Mr. Bayliss's discourses, his views on art must beadmitted to be very commonplace and old-fashioned.  What is the use oftelling artists that they should try and paint Nature as she really is?What Nature really is, is a question for metaphysics not for art.  Artdeals with appearances, and the eye of the man who looks at Nature, thevision, in fact, of the artist, is far more important to us than what helooks at.  There is more truth in Corot's aphorism that a landscape issimply 'the mood of a man's mind' than there is in all Mr. Bayliss'slaborious disquisitions on naturalism.  Again, why does Mr. Bayliss wastea whole chapter in pointing out real or supposed resemblances between abook of his published twelve years ago and an article by Mr. Palgravewhich appeared recently in the Nineteenth Century?  Neither the book northe article contains anything of real interest, and as for the hundred ormore parallel passages which Mr. Wyke Bayliss solemnly prints side byside, most of them are like parallel lines and never meet.  The onlyoriginal proposal that Mr. Bayliss has to offer us is that the House ofCommons should, every year, select some important event from national andcontemporary history and hand it over to the artists who are to choosefrom among themselves a man to make a picture of it.  In this way Mr.Bayliss believes that we could have the historic art, and suggests asexamples of what he means a picture of Florence Nightingale in thehospital at Scutari, a picture of the opening of the first London Board-school, and a picture of the Senate House at Cambridge with the girlgraduate receiving a degree 'that shall acknowledge her to be as wise asMerlin himself and leave her still as beautiful as Vivien.'  Thisproposal is, of course, very well meant, but, to say nothing of thedanger of leaving historic art at the mercy of a majority in the House ofCommons, who would naturally vote for its own view of things, Mr. Baylissdoes not seem to realise that a great event is not necessarily apictorial event.  'The decisive events of the world,' as has been wellsaid, 'take place in the intellect,' and as for Board-schools, academicceremonies, hospital wards and the like, they may well be left to theartists of the illustrated papers, who do them admirably and quite aswell as they need be done.  Indeed, the pictures of contemporary events,Royal marriages, naval reviews and things of this kind that appear in theAcademy every year, are always extremely bad; while the very samesubjects treated in black and white in the Graphic or the London News areexcellent.  Besides, if we want to understand the history of a nationthrough the medium of art, it is to the imaginative and ideal arts thatwe have to go and not to the arts that are definitely imitative.  Thevisible aspect of life no longer contains for us the secret of life'sspirit.  Probably it never did contain it.  And, if Mr. Barker's WaterlooBanquet and Mr. Frith's Marriage of the Prince of Wales are examples ofhealthy historic art, the less we have of such art the better.  However,Mr. Bayliss is full of the most ardent faith and speaks quite gravely ofgenuine portraits of St. John, St. Peter and St. Paul dating from thefirst century, and of the establishment by the Israelites of a school ofart in the wilderness under the now little appreciated Bezaleel.  He is apleasant, picturesque writer, but he should not speak about art.  Art isa sealed book to him.The Enchanted Island.  By Wyke Bayliss, F.S.A., President of the RoyalSociety of British Artists.  (Allen and Co.)SOME LITERARY NOTES--II(Woman's World, February 1889.)'The various collectors of Irish folk-lore,' says Mr. W. B. Yeats in hischarming little book Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry, 'have,from our point of view, one great merit, and from the point of view ofothers, one great fault.'   They have made their work literature rather than science, and told us   of the Irish peasantry rather than of the primitive religion of   mankind, or whatever else the folk-lorists are on the gad after.  To   be considered scientists they should have tabulated all their tales in   forms like grocers' bills--item the fairy king, item the queen.   Instead of this they have caught the very voice of the people, the   very pulse of life, each giving what was most noticed in his day.   Croker and Lover, full of the ideas of harum-scarum Irish gentility,   saw everything humorised.  The impulse of the Irish literature of   their time came from a class that did not--mainly for political   reasons--take the populace seriously, and imagined the country as a   humorist's Arcadia; its passion, its gloom, its tragedy, they knew   nothing of.  What they did was not wholly false; they merely magnified   an irresponsible type, found oftenest among boatmen, carmen, and   gentlemen's servants, into the type of a whole nation, and created the   stage Irishman.  The writers of 'Forty-eight, and the famine combined,   burst their bubble.  Their work had the dash as well as the   shallowness of an ascendant and idle class, and in Croker is touched   everywhere with beauty--a gentle Arcadian beauty.  Carleton, a peasant   born, has in many of his stories, . . . more especially in his ghost   stories, a much more serious way with him, for all his humour.   Kennedy, an old bookseller in Dublin, who seems to have had a   something of genuine belief in the fairies, comes next in time.  He   has far less literary faculty, but is wonderfully accurate, giving   often the very words the stories were told in.  But the best book   since Croker is Lady Wilde's Ancient Legends.  The humour has all   given way to pathos and tenderness.  We have here the innermost heart   of the Celt in the moments he has grown to love through years of   persecution, when, cushioning himself about with dreams, and hearing   fairy-songs in the twilight, he ponders on the soul and on the dead.   Here is the Celt, only it is the Celt dreaming.Into a volume of very moderate dimensions, and of extremely moderateprice, Mr. Yeats has collected together the most characteristic of ourIrish folklore stories, grouping them together according to subject.First come The Trooping Fairies.  The peasants say that these are 'fallenangels who were not good enough to be saved, nor bad enough to be lost';but the Irish antiquarians see in them 'the gods of pagan Ireland,' who,'when no longer worshipped and fed with offerings, dwindled away in thepopular imagination, and now are only a few spans high.'  Their chiefoccupations are feasting, fighting, making love, and playing the mostbeautiful music.  'They have only one industrious person amongst them,the lepra-caun--the shoemaker.'  It is his duty to repair their shoeswhen they wear them out with dancing.  Mr. Yeats tells us that 'near thevillage of Ballisodare is a little woman who lived amongst them sevenyears.  When she came home she had no toes--she had danced them off.'  OnMay Eve, every seventh year, they fight for the harvest, for the bestears of grain belong to them.  An old man informed Mr. Yeats that he sawthem fight once, and that they tore the thatch off a house.  'Had any oneelse been near they would merely have seen a great wind whirlingeverything into the air as it passed.'  When the wind drives the leavesand straws before it, 'that is the fairies, and the peasants take offtheir hats and say "God bless them."'  When they are gay, they sing.  Manyof the most beautiful tunes of Ireland 'are only their music, caught upby eavesdroppers.'  No prudent peasant would hum The Pretty Girl Milkingthe Cow near a fairy rath, 'for they are jealous, and do not like to heartheir songs on clumsy mortal lips.'  Blake once saw a fairy's funeral.But this, as Mr. Yeats points out, must have been an English fairy, forthe Irish fairies never die; they are immortal.Then come The Solitary Fairies, amongst whom we find the little Lepracaunmentioned above.  He has grown very rich, as he possesses all thetreasure-crocks buried in war-time.  In the early part of this century,according to Croker, they used to show in Tipperary a little shoeforgotten by the fairy shoemaker.  Then there are two rather disreputablelittle fairies--the Cluricaun, who gets intoxicated in gentlemen'scellars, and the Red Man, who plays unkind practical jokes.  'The Fear-Gorta (Man of Hunger) is an emaciated phantom that goes through the landin famine time, begging an alms and bringing good luck to the giver.'  TheWater-sheerie is 'own brother to the English Jack-o'-Lantern.'  'TheLeanhaun Shee (fairy mistress) seeks the love of mortals.  If theyrefuse, she must be their slave; if they consent, they are hers, and canonly escape by finding another to take their place.  The fairy lives ontheir life, and they waste away.  Death is no escape from her.  She isthe Gaelic muse, for she gives inspiration to those she persecutes.  TheGaelic poets die young, for she is restless, and will not let them remainlong on earth.'  The Pooka is essentially an animal spirit, and some haveconsidered him the forefather of Shakespeare's 'Puck.'  He lives onsolitary mountains, and among old ruins 'grown monstrous with muchsolitude,' and 'is of the race of the nightmare.'  'He has many shapes--isnow a horse, . . . now a goat, now an eagle.  Like all spirits, he isonly half in the world of form.'  The banshee does not care much for ourdemocratic levelling tendencies; she loves only old families, anddespises the parvenu or the nouveau riche.  When more than one banshee ispresent, and they wail and sing in chorus, it is for the death of someholy or great one.  An omen that sometimes accompanies the banshee is '.. . an immense black coach, mounted by a coffin, and drawn by headlesshorses driven by a Dullahan.'  A Dullahan is the most terrible thing inthe world.  In 1807 two of the sentries stationed outside St. James'sPark saw one climbing the railings, and died of fright.  Mr. Yeatssuggests that they are possibly 'descended from that Irish giant who swamacross the Channel with his head in his teeth.'Then come the stories of ghosts, of saints and priests, and of giants.The ghosts live in a state intermediary between this world and the next.They are held there by some earthly longing or affection, or some dutyunfulfilled, or anger against the living; they are those who are too goodfor hell, and too bad for heaven.  Sometimes they 'take the forms ofinsects, especially of butterflies.'  The author of the Parochial Surveyof Ireland 'heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly,"How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather?"  On Novembereve they are abroad, and dance with the fairies.'  As for the saints andpriests, 'there are no martyrs in the stories.'  That ancient chroniclerGiraldus Cambrensis 'taunted the Archbishop of Cashel, because no one inIreland had received the crown of martyrdom.  "Our people may bebarbarous," the prelate answered, "but they have never lifted their handsagainst God's saints; but now that a people have come amongst us who knowhow to make them (it was just after the English invasion), we shall havemartyrs plentifully."'  The giants were the old pagan heroes of Ireland,who grew bigger and bigger, just as the gods grew smaller and smaller.The fact is they did not wait for offerings; they took them vi et armis.Some of the prettiest stories are those that cluster round Tir-na-n-Og.This is the Country of the Young, 'for age and death have not found it;neither tears nor loud laughter have gone near it.'  'One man has gonethere and returned.  The bard, Oisen, who wandered away on a white horse,moving on the surface of the foam with his fairy Niamh lived there threehundred years, and then returned looking for his comrades.  The momenthis foot touched the earth his three hundred years fell on him, and hewas bowed double, and his beard swept the ground.  He described hissojourn in the Land of Youth to Patrick before he died.'  Since then,according to Mr. Yeats, 'many have seen it in many places; some in thedepths of lakes, and have heard rising therefrom a vague sound of bells;more have seen it far off on the horizon, as they peered out from thewestern cliffs.  Not three years ago a fisherman imagined that he sawit.'Mr. Yeats has certainly done his work very well.  He has shown greatcritical capacity in his selection of the stories, and his littleintroductions are charmingly written.  It is delightful to come across acollection of purely imaginative work, and Mr. Yeats has a very quickinstinct in finding out the best and the most beautiful things in Irishfolklore.  I am also glad to see that he has not confined himselfentirely to prose, but has included Allingham's lovely poem on TheFairies:   Up the airy mountain,      Down the rushy glen,   We daren't go a-hunting      For fear of little men;   Wee folk, good folk,      Trooping all together;   Green jacket, red cap,      And white owl's feather!   Down along the rocky shore      Some make their home,   They live on crispy pancakes      Of yellow tide-foam;   Some in the reeds      Of the black mountain lake,   With frogs for their watch-dogs      All night awake.   High on the hill-top      The old King sits;   He is now so old and gray      He's nigh lost his wits.   With a bridge of white mist      Columbkill he crosses,   On his stately journeys      From Slieveleague to Rosses;   Or going up with music,      On cold starry nights,   To sup with the Queen      Of the gay Northern Lights.All lovers of fairy tales and folklore should get this little book.  TheHorned Women, The Priest's Soul, {411} and Teig O'Kane, are reallymarvellous in their way; and, indeed, there is hardly a single story thatis not worth reading and thinking over.The wittiest writer in France at present is a woman.  That clever, thatspirituelle grande dame, who has adopted the pseudonym of 'Gyp,' has inher own country no rival.  Her wit, her delicate and delightful esprit,her fascinating modernity, and her light, happy touch, give her a uniqueposition in that literary movement which has taken for its object thereproduction of contemporary life.  Such books as Autour du Mariage,Autour du Divorce, and Le Petit Bob, are, in their way, little playfulmasterpieces, and the only work in England that we could compare withthem is Violet Fane's Edwin and Angelina Papers.  To the same brilliantpen which gave us these wise and witty studies of modern life we owe nowa more serious, more elaborate production.  Helen Davenant is asearnestly wrought out as it is cleverly conceived.  If it has a fault, itis that it is too full of matter.  Out of the same material a moreeconomical writer would have made two novels and half a dozenpsychological studies for publication in American magazines.  Thackerayonce met Bishop Wilberforce at dinner at Dean Stanley's, and, afterlistening to the eloquent prelate's extraordinary flow and fund ofstories, remarked to his neighbour, 'I could not afford to spend at thatrate.'  Violet Fane is certainly lavishly extravagant of incident, plot,and character.  But we must not quarrel with richness of subject-matterat a time when tenuity of purpose and meagreness of motive seem to bebecoming the dominant notes of contemporary fiction.  The side-issues ofthe story are so complex that it is difficult, almost impossible, todescribe the plot in any adequate manner.  The interest centres round ayoung girl, Helen Davenant by name, who contracts a private andclandestine marriage with one of those mysterious and fascinating foreignnoblemen who are becoming so invaluable to writers of fiction, either innarrative or dramatic form.  Shortly after the marriage her husband isarrested for a terrible murder committed some years before in Russia,under the evil influence of occult magic and mesmerism.  The crime wasdone in a hypnotic state, and, as described by Violet Fane, seems muchmore probable than the actual hypnotic experiments recorded in scientificpublications.  This is the supreme advantage that fiction possesses overfact.  It can make things artistically probable; can call for imaginativeand realistic credence; can, by force of mere style, compel us tobelieve.  The ordinary novelists, by keeping close to the ordinaryincidents of commonplace life, seem to me to abdicate half their power.Romance, at any rate, welcomes what is wonderful; the temper of wonder ispart of her own secret; she loves what is strange and curious.  Butbesides the marvels of occultism and hypnotism, there are many otherthings in Helen Davenant that are worthy of study.  Violet Fane writes anadmirable style.  The opening chapter of the book, with its terriblepoignant tragedy, is most powerfully written, and I cannot help wonderingthat the clever authoress cared to abandon, even for a moment, the superbpsychological opportunity that this chapter affords.  The touches ofnature, the vivid sketches of high life, the subtle renderings of thephases and fancies of society, are also admirably done.  Helen Davenantis certainly clever, and shows that Violet Fane can write prose that isas good as her verse, and can look at life not merely from the point ofview of the poet, but also from the standpoint of the philosopher, thekeen observer, the fine social critic.  To be a fine social critic is nosmall thing, and to be able to incorporate in a work of fiction theresults of such careful observation is to achieve what is out of thereach of many.  The difficulty under which the novelists of our daylabour seems to me to be this: if they do not go into society, theirbooks are unreadable; and if they do go into society, they have no timeleft for writing.  However, Violet Fane has solved the problem.   The chronicles which I am about to present to the reader are not the   result of any conscious effort of the imagination.  They are, as the   title-page indicates, records of dreams occurring at intervals during   the last ten years, and transcribed, pretty nearly in the order of   their occurrence, from my diary.  Written down as soon as possible   after awaking from the slumber during which they presented themselves,   these narratives, necessarily unstudied in style, and wanting in   elegance of diction, have at least the merit of fresh and vivid   colour; for they were committed to paper at a moment when the effect   and impress of each successive vision were strong and forceful on the   mind. . . .   The most remarkable features of the experiences I am about to record   are the methodical consecutiveness of their sequences, and the   intelligent purpose disclosed alike in the events witnessed and in the   words heard or read. . . .  I know of no parallel to this phenomenon,   unless in the pages of Bulwer Lytton's romance entitled The Pilgrims   of the Rhine, in which is related the story of a German student   endowed with so marvellous a faculty of dreaming, that for him the   normal conditions of sleeping and waking became reversed; his true   life was that which he lived in his slumbers, and his hours of   wakefulness appeared to him as so many uneventful and inactive   intervals of arrest, occurring in an existence of intense and vivid   interest which was wholly passed in the hypnotic state. . . .   During the whole period covered by these dreams I have been busily and   almost continuously engrossed with scientific and literary pursuits,   demanding accurate judgment and complete self-possession and rectitude   of mind.  At the time when many of the most vivid and remarkable   visions occurred I was following my course as a student at the Paris   Faculty of Medicine, preparing for examinations, daily visiting   hospital wards as dresser, and attending lectures.  Later, when I had   taken my degree, I was engaged in the duties of my profession and in   writing for the Press on scientific subjects.  Neither had I ever   taken opium, haschish, or other dream-producing agent.  A cup of tea   or coffee represents the extent of my indulgences in this direction.  I   mention these details in order to guard against inferences which might   otherwise be drawn as to the genesis of my faculty.   It may, perhaps, be worthy of notice that by far the larger number of   the dreams set down in this volume occurred towards dawn; sometimes   even, after sunrise, during a 'second sleep.'  A condition of fasting,   united possibly with some subtle magnetic or other atmospheric state,   seems, therefore, to be that most open to impressions of the kind.This is the account given by the late Dr. Anna Kingsford of the genesisof her remarkable volume, Dreams and Dream-Stories; and certainly some ofthe stories, especially those entitled Steepside, Beyond the Sunset, andThe Village of Seers, are well worth reading, though not intrinsicallyfiner, either in motive or idea, than the general run of magazinestories.  No one who had the privilege of knowing Mrs. Kingsford, who wasone of the brilliant women of our day, can doubt for a single moment thatthese tales came to her in the way she describes; but to me the result isjust a little disappointing.  Perhaps, however, I expect too much.  Thereis no reason whatsoever why the imagination should be finer in hours ofdreaming than in its hours of waking.  Mrs. Kingsford quotes a letterwritten by Jamblichus to Agathocles, in which he says: 'The soul has atwofold life, a lower and a higher.  In sleep the soul is liberated fromthe constraint of the body, and enters, as an emancipated being, on itsdivine life of intelligence.  The nobler part of the mind is thus unitedby abstraction to higher natures, and becomes a participant in the wisdomand foreknowledge of the gods. . . .  The night-time of the body is theday-time of the soul.'  But the great masterpieces of literature and thegreat secrets of wisdom have not been communicated in this way; and evenin Coleridge's case, though Kubla Khan is wonderful, it is not morewonderful, while it is certainly less complete, than the Ancient Mariner.As for the dreams themselves, which occupy the first portion of the book,their value, of course, depends chiefly on the value of the truths orpredictions which they are supposed to impart.  I must confess that mostmodern mysticism seems to me to be simply a method of imparting uselessknowledge in a form that no one can understand.  Allegory, parable, andvision have their high artistic uses, but their philosophical andscientific uses are very small.  However, here is one of Mrs. Kingsford'sdreams.  It has a pleasant quaintness about it:   THE WONDERFUL SPECTACLES   I was walking alone on the sea-shore.  The day was singularly clear   and sunny.  Inland lay the most beautiful landscape ever seen; and far   off were ranges of tall hills, the highest peaks of which were white   with glittering snows.  Along the sands by the sea came towards me a   man accoutred as a postman.  He gave me a letter.  It was from you.  It   ran thus:   'I have got hold of the earliest and most precious book extant.  It   was written before the world began.  The text is easy enough to read;   but the notes, which are very copious and numerous, are in such minute   and obscure characters that I cannot make them out.  I want you to get   for me the spectacles which Swedenborg used to wear; not the smaller   pair--those he gave to Hans Christian Andersen--but the large pair,   and these seem to have got mislaid.  I think they are Spinoza's make.   You know, he was an optical-glass maker by profession, and the best we   ever had.  See if you can get them for me.'   When I looked up after reading this letter I saw the postman hastening   away across the sands, and I cried out to him, 'Stop! how am I to send   the answer?  Will you not wait for it?'   He looked round, stopped, and came back to me.   'I have the answer here,' he said, tapping his letter-bag, 'and I   shall deliver it immediately.'   'How can you have the answer before I have written it?' I asked.  'You   are making a mistake.'   'No,' he said.  'In the city from which I come the replies are all   written at the office, and sent out with the letters themselves.  Your   reply is in my bag.'   'Let me see it,' I said.  He took another letter from his wallet, and   gave it to me.  I opened it, and read, in my own handwriting, this   answer, addressed to you:   'The spectacles you want can be bought in London; but you will not be   able to use them at once, for they have not been worn for many years,   and they sadly want cleaning.  This you will not be able to do   yourself in London, because it is too dark there to see well, and   because your fingers are not small enough to clean them properly.   Bring them here to me, and I will do it for you.'   I gave this letter back to the postman.  He smiled and nodded at me;   and then I perceived, to my astonishment, that he wore a camel's-hair   tunic round his waist.  I had been on the point of addressing him--I   know not why--as Hermes.  But I now saw that he must be John the   Baptist; and in my fright at having spoken to so great a Saint I   awoke.Mr. Maitland, who edits the present volume, and who was joint-author withMrs. Kingsford of that curious book The Perfect Way, states in a footnotethat in the present instance the dreamer knew nothing of Spinoza at thetime, and was quite unaware that he was an optician; and theinterpretation of the dream, as given by him, is that the spectacles inquestion were intended to represent Mrs. Kingsford's remarkable facultyof intuitional and interpretative perception.  For a spiritual messagefraught with such meaning, the mere form of this dream seems to mesomewhat ignoble, and I cannot say that I like the blending of thepostman with St. John the Baptist.  However, from a psychological pointof view, these dreams are interesting, and Mrs. Kingsford's book isundoubtedly a valuable addition to the literature of the mysticism of thenineteenth century.* * * * *The Romance of a Shop, by Miss Amy Levy, is a more mundane book, anddeals with the adventures of some young ladies who open a photographicstudio in Baker Street to the horror of some of their fashionablerelatives.  It is so brightly and pleasantly written that the suddenintroduction of a tragedy into it seems violent and unnecessary.  Itlacks the true tragic temper, and without this temper in literature allmisfortunes and miseries seem somewhat mean and ordinary.  With thisexception the book is admirably done, and the style is clever and full ofquick observation.  Observation is perhaps the most valuable faculty fora writer of fiction.  When novelists reflect and moralise, they are, as arule, dull.  But to observe life with keen vision and quick intellect, tocatch its many modes of expression, to seize upon the subtlety, orsatire, or dramatic quality of its situations, and to render life for uswith some spirit of distinction and fine selection--this, I fancy, shouldbe the aim of the modern realistic novelist.  It would be, perhaps, toomuch to say that Miss Levy has distinction; this is the rarest quality inmodern literature, though not a few of its masters are modern; but shehas many other qualities which are admirable.* * * * *Faithful and Unfaithful is a powerful but not very pleasing novel.However, the object of most modern fiction is not to give pleasure to theartistic instinct, but rather to portray life vividly for us, to drawattention to social anomalies, and social forms of injustice.  Many ofour novelists are really pamphleteers, reformers masquerading as story-tellers, earnest sociologists seeking to mend as well as to mirror life.The heroine, or rather martyr, of Miss Margaret Lee's story is a verynoble and graciously Puritanic American girl, who is married at the ageof eighteen to a man whom she insists on regarding as a hero.  Herhusband cannot live in the high rarefied atmosphere of idealism withwhich she surrounds him; her firm and fearless faith in him becomes afactor in his degradation.  'You are too good for me,' he says to her ina finely conceived scene at the end of the book; 'we have not an idea, aninclination, or a passion in common.  I'm sick and tired of seeming tolive up to a standard that is entirely beyond my reach and my desire.  Wemake each other miserable!  I can't pull you down, and for ten years youhave been exhausting yourself in vain efforts to raise me to your level.The thing must end!'  He asks her to divorce him, but she refuses.  Hethen abandons her, and availing himself of those curious facilities forbreaking the marriage-tie that prevail in the United States, succeeds indivorcing her without her consent, and without her knowledge.  The bookis certainly characteristic of an age so practical and so literary asours, an age in which all social reforms have been preceded and have beenlargely influenced by fiction.  Faithful and Unfaithful seems to point tosome coming change in the marriage-laws of America.(1) Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry.  Edited and Selected byW. B. Yeats.

(Macmillan and Co.)ONE OF THE BIBLES OF THE WORLD(Pall Mall Gazette, February 12, 1889.)The Kalevala is one of those poems that Mr. William Morris once describedas 'The Bibles of the World.'  It takes its place as a national epicbeside the Homeric poems, the Niebelunge, the Shahnameth and theMahabharata, and the admirable translation just published by Mr. JohnMartin Crawford is sure to be welcomed by all scholars and lovers ofprimitive poetry.  In his very interesting preface Mr. Crawford claimsfor the Finns that they began earlier than any other European nation tocollect and preserve their ancient folklore.  In the seventeenth centurywe meet men of literary tastes like Palmskold who tried to collect andinterpret the various national songs of the fen-dwellers of the North.But the Kalevala proper was collected by two great Finnish scholars ofour own century, Zacharias Topelius and Elias Lonnrot.  Both werepractising physicians, and in this capacity came into frequent contactwith the people of Finland.  Topelius, who collected eighty epicalfragments of the Kalevala, spent the last eleven years of his life inbed, afflicted with a fatal disease.  This misfortune, however, did notdamp his enthusiasm.  Mr. Crawford tells us that he used to invite thewandering Finnish merchants to his bedside and induce them to sing theirheroic poems which he copied down as soon as they were uttered, and thatwhenever he heard of a renowned Finnish minstrel he did all in his powerto bring the song-man to his house in order that he might gather newfragments of the national epic.  Lonnrot travelled over the wholecountry, on horseback, in reindeer sledges and in canoes, collecting theold poems and songs from the hunters, the fishermen and the shepherds.The people gave him every assistance, and he had the good fortune to comeacross an old peasant, one of the oldest of the runolainen in the Russianprovince of Wuokinlem, who was by far the most renowned song-man of thecountry, and from him he got many of the most splendid runes of the poem.And certainly the Kalevala, as it stands, is one of the world's greatpoems.  It is perhaps hardly accurate to describe it as an epic.  Itlacks the central unity of a true epic in our sense of the word.  It hasmany heroes beside Wainomoinen and is, properly speaking, a collection offolk-songs and ballads.  Of its antiquity there is no doubt.  It isthoroughly pagan from beginning to end, and even the legend of the VirginMariatta to whom the Sun tells where 'her golden babe lies hidden'--   Yonder is thy golden infant,   There thy holy babe lies sleeping   Hidden to his belt in water,   Hidden in the reeds and rushes--is, according to all scholars, essentially pre-Christian in origin.  Thegods are chiefly gods of air and water and forest.  The highest is thesky-god Ukks who is 'The Father of the Breezes,' 'The Shepherd of theLamb-Clouds'; the lightning is his sword, the rainbow is his bow; hisskirt sparkles with fire, his stockings are blue and his shoes crimson-coloured.  The daughters of the Sun and Moon sit on the scarlet rims ofthe clouds and weave the rays of light into a gleaming web.  Untarpresides over fogs and mists, and passes them through a silver sievebefore sending them to the earth.  Ahto, the wave-god, lives with 'hiscold and cruel-hearted spouse,' Wellamo, at the bottom of the sea in thechasm of the Salmon-Rocks, and possesses the priceless treasure of theSampo, the talisman of success.  When the branches of the primitive oak-trees shut out the light of the sun from the Northland, Pikku-Mies (thePygmy) emerged from the sea in a suit of copper, with a copper hatchet inhis belt, and having grown to a giant's stature felled the huge oak withthe third stroke of his axe.  Wirokannas is 'The Green-robed Priest ofthe Forest,' and Tapio, who has a coat of tree-moss and a high-crownedhat of fir-leaves, is 'The Gracious God of the Woodlands.'  Otso, thebear, is the 'Honey-Paw of the Mountains,' the 'Fur-robed Forest Friend.'In everything, visible and invisible, there is God, a divine presence.There are three worlds, and they are all peopled with divinities.As regards the poem itself, it is written in trochaic eight-syllabledlines with alliteration and the part-line echo, the metre whichLongfellow adopted for Hiawatha.  One of its distinguishingcharacteristics is its wonderful passion for nature and for the beauty ofnatural objects.  Lemenkainen says to Tapio:   Sable-bearded God of forests,   In thy hat and coat of ermine,   Robe thy trees in finest fibres,   Deck thy groves in richest fabrics,   Give the fir-trees shining silver,   Deck with gold the slender balsams,   Give the spruces copper-belting,   And the pine-trees silver girdles,   Give the birches golden flowers,   Deck their stems with silver fretwork,   This their garb in former ages   When the days and nights were brighter,   When the fir-trees shone like sunlight,   And the birches like the moonbeams;   Honey breathe throughout the forest,   Settled in the glens and highlands,   Spices in the meadow-borders,   Oil outpouring from the lowlands.All handicrafts and art-work are, as in Homer, elaborately described:   Then the smiter Ilmarinen   The eternal artist-forgeman,   In the furnace forged an eagle   From the fire of ancient wisdom,   For this giant bird of magic   Forged he talons out of iron,   And his beak of steel and copper;   Seats himself upon the eagle,   On his back between the wing-bones   Thus addresses he his creature,   Gives the bird of fire this order.   Mighty eagle, bird of beauty,   Fly thou whither I direct thee,   To Tuoni's coal-black river,   To the blue-depths of the Death-stream,   Seize the mighty fish of Mana,   Catch for me this water-monster.And Wainamoinen's boat-building is one of the great incidents of thepoem:   Wainamoinen old and skilful,   The eternal wonder-worker,   Builds his vessel with enchantment,   Builds his boat by art and magic,   From the timber of the oak-tree,   Forms its posts and planks and flooring.   Sings a song and joins the framework;   Sings a second, sets the siding;   Sings a third time, sets the rowlocks;   Fashions oars, and ribs, and rudder,   Joins the sides and ribs together.   . . . . .   Now he decks his magic vessel,   Paints the boat in blue and scarlet,   Trims in gold the ship's forecastle,   Decks the prow in molten silver;   Sings his magic ship down gliding,   On the cylinders of fir-tree;   Now erects the masts of pine-wood,   On each mast the sails of linen,   Sails of blue, and white, and scarlet,   Woven into finest fabric.All the characteristics of a splendid antique civilisation are mirroredin this marvellous poem, and Mr. Crawford's admirable translation shouldmake the wonderful heroes of Suomi song as familiar if not as dear to ourpeople as the heroes of the great Ionian epic.The Kalevala, the Epic Poem of Finland.  Translated into English by JohnMartin Crawford.  (G. P. Putnam's Sons.)POETICAL SOCIALISTS(Pall Mall Gazette, February 15, 1889.)Mr. Stopford Brooke said some time ago that Socialism and the socialisticspirit would give our poets nobler and loftier themes for song, wouldwiden their sympathies and enlarge the horizon of their vision and wouldtouch, with the fire and fervour of a new faith, lips that had else beensilent, hearts that but for this fresh gospel had been cold.  What Artgains from contemporary events is always a fascinating problem and aproblem that is not easy to solve.  It is, however, certain thatSocialism starts well equipped.  She has her poets and her painters, herart lecturers and her cunning designers, her powerful orators and herclever writers.  If she fails it will not be for lack of expression.  Ifshe succeeds her triumph will not be a triumph of mere brute force.  Thefirst thing that strikes one, as one looks over the list of contributorsto Mr. Edward Carpenter's Chants of Labour, is the curious variety oftheir several occupations, the wide differences of social position thatexist between them, and the strange medley of men whom a common passionhas for the moment united.  The editor is a 'Science lecturer'; he isfollowed by a draper and a porter; then we have two late Eton masters andthen two bootmakers; and these are, in their turn, succeeded by an ex-Lord Mayor of Dublin, a bookbinder, a photographer, a steel-worker and anauthoress.  On one page we have a journalist, a draughtsman and a music-teacher: and on another a Civil servant, a machine fitter, a medicalstudent, a cabinet-maker and a minister of the Church of Scotland.Certainly, it is no ordinary movement that can bind together in closebrotherhood men of such dissimilar pursuits, and when we mention that Mr.William Morris is one of the singers, and that Mr. Walter Crane hasdesigned the cover and frontispiece of the book, we cannot but feel that,as we pointed out before, Socialism starts well equipped.As for the songs themselves, some of them, to quote from the editor'spreface, are 'purely revolutionary, others are Christian in tone; thereare some that might be called merely material in their tendency, whilemany are of a highly ideal and visionary character.'  This is, on thewhole, very promising.  It shows that Socialism is not going to allowherself to be trammelled by any hard and fast creed or to be stereotypedinto an iron formula.  She welcomes many and multiform natures.  Sherejects none and has room for all.  She has the attraction of a wonderfulpersonality and touches the heart of one and the brain of another, anddraws this man by his hatred of injustice, and his neighbour by his faithin the future, and a third, it may be, by his love of art or by his wildworship of a lost and buried past.  And all of this is well.  For, tomake men Socialists is nothing, but to make Socialism human is a greatthing.They are not of any very high literary value, these poems that have beenso dexterously set to music.  They are meant to be sung, not to be read.They are rough, direct and vigorous, and the tunes are stirring andfamiliar.  Indeed, almost any mob could warble them with ease.  Thetranspositions that have been made are rather amusing.  'Twas inTrafalgar Square is set to the tune of 'Twas in Trafalgar's Bay; Up, YePeople! a very revolutionary song by Mr. John Gregory, boot-maker, with arefrain of   Up, ye People! or down into your graves!      Cowards ever will be slaves!is to be sung to the tune of Rule, Britannia! the old melody of The Vicarof Bray is to accompany the new Ballade of Law and Order--which, however,is not a ballade at all--and to the air of Here's to the Maiden ofBashful Fifteen the democracy of the future is to thunder forth one ofMr. T. D. Sullivan's most powerful and pathetic lyrics.  It is clear thatthe Socialists intend to carry on the musical education of the peoplesimultaneously with their education in political science and, here aselsewhere, they seem to be entirely free from any narrow bias or formalprejudice.  Mendelssohn is followed by Moody and Sankey; the Wacht amRhein stands side by side with the Marseillaise; Lillibulero, a chorusfrom Norma, John Brown and an air from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony are allequally delightful to them.  They sing the National Anthem in Shelley'sversion and chant William Morris's Voice of Toil to the flowing numbersof Ye Banks and Braes of Bonny Doon.  Victor Hugo talks somewhere of theterrible cry of 'Le Tigre Populaire,' but it is evident from Mr.Carpenter's book that should the Revolution ever break out in England weshall have no inarticulate roar but, rather, pleasant glees and gracefulpart-songs.  The change is certainly for the better.  Nero fiddled whileRome was burning--at least, inaccurate historians say he did; but it isfor the building up of an eternal city that the Socialists of our day aremaking music, and they have complete confidence in the art instincts ofthe people.   They say that the people are brutal--      That their instincts of beauty are dead--   Were it so, shame on those who condemn them      To the desperate struggle for bread.   But they lie in their throats when they say it,      For the people are tender at heart,   And a wellspring of beauty lies hidden      Beneath their life's fever and smart,is a stanza from one of the poems in this volume, and the feelingexpressed in these words is paramount everywhere.  The Reformation gainedmuch from the use of popular hymn-tunes, and the Socialists seemdetermined to gain by similar means a similar hold upon the people.However, they must not be too sanguine about the result.  The walls ofThebes rose up to the sound of music, and Thebes was a very dull cityindeed.Chants of Labour: A Song-Book of the People.  With Music.  Edited byEdward Carpenter.

BRANDER MATTHEWS' ESSAYS(Pall Mall Gazette, February 27, 1889.)'If you to have your book criticized favorably, give yourself a goodnotice in the Preface!' is the golden rule laid down for the guidance ofauthors by Mr. Brander Matthews in an amusing essay on the art of preface-writing and, true to his own theory, he announces his volume as 'the mostinteresting, the most entertaining, and the most instructive book of thedecade.'  Entertaining it certainly is in parts.  The essay on Poker, forinstance, is very brightly and pleasantly written.  Mr. Proctor objectedto Poker on the somewhat trivial ground that it was a form of lying, andon the more serious ground that it afforded special opportunities forcheating; and, indeed, he regarded the mere existence of the game outsidegambling dens as 'one of the most portentous phenomena of Americancivilisation.'  Mr. Brander Matthews points out, in answer to these gravecharges, that Bluffing is merely a suppressio veri and that it requires agreat deal of physical courage on the part of the player.  As for thecheating, he claims that Poker affords no more opportunities for theexercise of this art than either Whist or Ecarte, though he admits thatthe proper attitude towards an opponent whose good luck is undulypersistent is that of the German-American who, finding four aces in hishand, was naturally about to bet heavily, when a sudden thought struckhim and he inquired, 'Who dole dem carts?'  'Jakey Einstein' was theanswer.  'Jakey Einstein?' he repeated, laying down his hand; 'den I passout.'The history of the game will be found very interesting by allcard-lovers.  Like most of the distinctly national products of America,it seems to have been imported from abroad and can be traced back to anItalian game in the fifteenth century.  Euchre was probably acclimatisedon the Mississippi by the Canadian voyageurs, being a form of the Frenchgame of Triomphe.  It was a Kentucky citizen who, desiring to give hissons a few words of solemn advice for their future guidance in life, hadthem summoned to his deathbed and said to them, 'Boys, when you go downthe river to Orleens jest you beware of a game called Yucker where thejack takes the ace;--it's unchristian!'--after which warning he lay backand died in peace.  And 'it was Euchre which the two gentlemen wereplaying in a boat on the Missouri River when a bystander, shocked by thefrequency with which one of the players turned up the jack, took theliberty of warning the other player that the winner was dealing from thebottom, to which the loser, secure in his power of self-protection,answered gruffly, "Well, suppose he is--it's his deal, isn't it?"'The chapter On the Antiquity of Jests, with its suggestion of anInternational Exhibition of Jokes, is capital.  Such an exhibition, Mr.Matthews remarks, would at least dispel any lingering belief in the oldsaying that there are only thirty-eight good stories in existence andthat thirty-seven of these cannot be told before ladies; and theRetrospective Section would certainly be the constant resort of any truefolklorist.  For most of the good stories of our time are reallyfolklore, myth survivals, echoes of the past.  The two well-knownAmerican proverbs, 'We have had a hell of a time' and 'Let the other manwalk' are both traced back by Mr. Matthews: the first to Walpole'sletters, and the other to a story Poggio tells of an inhabitant ofPerugia who walked in melancholy because he could not pay his debts.'Vah, stulte,' was the advice given to him, 'leave anxiety to yourcreditors!' and even Mr. William M. Evart's brilliant repartee when hewas told that Washington once threw a dollar across the Natural Bridge inVirginia, 'In those days a dollar went so much farther than it does now!'seems to be the direct descendant of a witty remark of Foote's, though wemust say that in this case we prefer the child to the father.  The essayOn the French Spoken by Those who do not Speak French is also cleverlywritten and, indeed, on every subject, except literature, Mr. Matthews iswell worth reading.On literature and literary subjects he is certainly 'sadly to seek.'  Theessay on The Ethics of Plagiarism, with its laborious attempt torehabilitate Mr. Rider Haggard and its foolish remarks on Poe's admirablepaper Mr. Longfellow and Other Plagiarists, is extremely dull andcommonplace and, in the elaborate comparison that he draws between Mr.Frederick Locker and Mr. Austin Dobson, the author of Pen and Ink showsthat he is quite devoid of any real critical faculty or of any fine senseof the difference between ordinary society verse and the exquisite workof a very perfect artist in poetry.  We have no objection to Mr. Matthewslikening Mr. Locker to Mr. du Maurier, and Mr. Dobson to RandolphCaldecott and Mr. Edwin Abbey.  Comparisons of this kind, thoughextremely silly, do not do much harm.  In fact, they mean nothing and areprobably not intended to mean anything.  Upon the other hand, we reallymust protest against Mr. Matthews' efforts to confuse the poetry ofPiccadilly with the poetry of Parnassus.  To tell us, for instance, thatMr. Austin Dobson's verse 'has not the condensed clearness nor theincisive vigor of Mr. Locker's' is really too bad even for Transatlanticcriticism.  Nobody who lays claim to the slightest knowledge ofliterature and the forms of literature should ever bring the two namesinto conjunction.  Mr. Locker has written some pleasant vers de societe,some tuneful trifles in rhyme admirably suited for ladies' albums and formagazines.  But to mention Herrick and Suckling and Mr. Austin Dobson inconnection with him is absurd.  He is not a poet.  Mr. Dobson, upon theother hand, has produced work that is absolutely classical in itsexquisite beauty of form.  Nothing more artistically perfect in its waythan the Lines to a Greek Girl has been written in our time.  This littlepoem will be remembered in literature as long as Thyrsis is remembered,and Thyrsis will never be forgotten.  Both have that note of distinctionthat is so rare in these days of violence, exaggeration and rhetoric.  Ofcourse, to suggest, as Mr. Matthews does, that Mr. Dobson's poems belongto 'the literature of power' is ridiculous.  Power is not their aim, noris it their effect.  They have other qualities, and in their owndelicately limited sphere they have no contemporary rivals; they havenone even second to them.  However, Mr. Matthews is quite undaunted andtries to drag poor Mr. Locker out of Piccadilly, where he was reallyquite in his element, and to set him on Parnassus where he has no rightto be and where he would not claim to be.  He praises his work with therecklessness of an eloquent auctioneer.  These very commonplace andslightly vulgar lines on A Human Skull:   It may have held (to shoot some random shots)      Thy brains, Eliza Fry! or Baron Byron's;   The wits of Nelly Gwynne or Doctor Watts--      Two quoted bards.  Two philanthropic sirens.   But this, I trust, is clearly understood,      If man or woman, if adored or hated--   Whoever own'd this Skull was not so good      Nor quite so bad as many may have stated;are considered by him to be 'sportive and brightsome' and full of'playful humor,' and 'two things especially are to be noted inthem--individuality and directness of expression.'  Individuality anddirectness of expression!  We wonder what Mr. Matthews thinks these wordsmean.Unfortunate Mr. Locker with his uncouth American admirer!  How he mustblush to read these heavy panegyrics!  Indeed, Mr. Matthews himself hasat least one fit of remorse for his attempt to class Mr. Locker's workwith the work of Mr. Austin Dobson, but like most fits of remorse itleads to nothing.  On the very next page we have the complaint that Mr.Dobson's verse has not 'the condensed clearness' and the 'incisive vigor'of Mr. Locker's.  Mr. Matthews should confine himself to his cleverjournalistic articles on Euchre, Poker, bad French and old jokes.  Onthese subjects he can, to use an expression of his own, 'write funny.'  He'writes funny,' too, upon literature, but the fun is not quite soamusing.Pen and Ink: Papers on Subjects of More or Less Importance.  By BranderMatthews.  (Longmans, Green and Co.)SOME LITERARY NOTES--III(Woman's World, March 1889.)Miss Nesbit has already made herself a name as a writer of graceful andcharming verse, and though her last volume, Leaves of Life, does not showany distinct advance on her former work, it still fully maintains thehigh standard already achieved, and justifies the reputation of theauthor.  There are some wonderfully pretty poems in it, poems full ofquick touches of fancy, and of pleasant ripples of rhyme; and here andthere a poignant note of passion flashes across the song, as a scarletthread flashes through the shuttlerace of a loom, giving a new value tothe delicate tints, and bringing the scheme of colour to a higher andmore perfect key.  In Miss Nesbit's earlier volume, the Lays and Legends,as it was called, there was an attempt to give poetic form tohumanitarian dreams and socialistic aspirations; but the poems that dealtwith these subjects were, on the whole, the least successful of thecollection; and with the quick, critical instinct of an artist, MissNesbit seems to have recognised this.  In the present volume, at anyrate, such poems are rare, and these few felicitous verses give us thepoet's defence:   A singer sings of rights and wrongs,      Of world's ideals vast and bright,   And feels the impotence of songs      To scourge the wrong or help the right;   And only writhes to feel how vain      Are songs as weapons for his fight;   And so he turns to love again,      And sings of love for heart's delight.   For heart's delight the singers bind      The wreath of roses round the head,   And will not loose it lest they find      Time victor, and the roses dead.   'Man can but sing of what he knows--      I saw the roses fresh and red!'   And so they sing the deathless rose,      With withered roses garlanded.   And some within their bosom hide      Their rose of love still fresh and fair,   And walk in silence, satisfied      To keep its folded fragrance rare.   And some--who bear a flag unfurled--      Wreathe with their rose the flag they bear,   And sing their banner for the world,      And for their heart the roses there.   Yet thus much choice in singing is;      We sing the good, the true, the just,   Passionate duty turned to bliss,      And honour growing out of trust.   Freedom we sing, and would not lose      Her lightest footprint in life's dust.   We sing of her because we choose,      We sing of love because we must.Certainly Miss Nesbit is at her best when she sings of love and nature.Here she is close to her subject, and her temperament gives colour andform to the various dramatic moods that are either suggested by Natureherself or brought to Nature for interpretation.  This, for instance, isvery sweet and graceful:   When all the skies with snow were grey,      And all the earth with snow was white,   I wandered down a still wood way,      And there I met my heart's delight   Slow moving through the silent wood,   The spirit of its solitude:      The brown birds and the lichened tree      Seemed less a part of it than she.   Where pheasants' feet and rabbits' feet      Had marked the snow with traces small,   I saw the footprints of my sweet--      The sweetest woodland thing of all.   With Christmas roses in her hand,   One heart-beat's space I saw her stand;      And then I let her pass, and stood      Lone in an empty world of wood.   And though by that same path I've passed      Down that same woodland every day,   That meeting was the first and last,      And she is hopelessly away.   I wonder was she really there--   Her hands, and eyes, and lips, and hair?      Or was it but my dreaming sent      Her image down the way I went?   Empty the woods are where we met--      They will be empty in the spring;   The cowslip and the violet      Will die without her gathering.   But dare I dream one radiant day   Red rose-wreathed she will pass this way      Across the glad and honoured grass;      And then--I will not let her pass.And this Dedication, with its tender silver-grey notes of colour, ischarming:   In any meadow where your feet may tread,      In any garland that your love may wear,   May be the flower whose hidden fragrance shed      Wakes some old hope or numbs some old despair,      And makes life's grief not quite so hard to bear,   And makes life's joy more poignant and more dear   Because of some delight dead many a year.   Or in some cottage garden there may be      The flower whose scent is memory for you;   The sturdy southern-wood, the frail sweet-pea,      Bring back the swallow's cheep, the pigeon's coo,      And youth, and hope, and all the dreams they knew,   The evening star, the hedges grey with mist,   The silent porch where Love's first kiss was kissed.   So in my garden may you chance to find      Or royal rose or quiet meadow flower,   Whose scent may be with some dear dream entwined,      And give you back the ghost of some sweet hour,      As lilies fragrant from an August shower,   Or airs of June that over bean-fields blow,   Bring back the sweetness of my long ago.All through the volume we find the same dexterous refining of old themes,which is indeed the best thing that our lesser singers can give us, and athing always delightful.  There is no garden so well tilled but it canbear another blossom, and though the subject-matter of Miss Nesbit's bookis as the subject-matter of almost all books of poetry, she can certainlylend a new grace and a subtle sweetness to almost everything on which shewrites.The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems is from the clever pen of Mr. W.B. Yeats, whose charming anthology of Irish fairy-tales I had occasion tonotice in a recent number of the Woman's World. {437}  It is, I believe,the first volume of poems that Mr. Yeats has published, and it iscertainly full of promise.  It must be admitted that many of the poemsare too fragmentary, too incomplete.  They read like stray scenes out ofunfinished plays, like things only half remembered, or, at best, butdimly seen.  But the architectonic power of construction, the power tobuild up and make perfect a harmonious whole, is nearly always thelatest, as it certainly is the highest, development of the artistictemperament.  It is somewhat unfair to expect it in early work.  Onequality Mr. Yeats has in a marked degree, a quality that is not common inthe work of our minor poets, and is therefore all the more welcome tous--I mean the romantic temper.  He is essentially Celtic, and his verse,at its best, is Celtic also.  Strongly influenced by Keats, he seems tostudy how to 'load every rift with ore,' yet is more fascinated by thebeauty of words than by the beauty of metrical music.  The spirit thatdominates the whole book is perhaps more valuable than any individualpoem or particular passage, but this from The Wanderings of Oisin isworth quoting.  It describes the ride to the Island of Forgetfulness:   And the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow light,      For, as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams of the world   and the sun,   Ceased on our hands and faces, on hazel and oak leaf, the light,      And the stars were blotted above us, and the whole of the world was   one;   Till the horse gave a whinny; for cumbrous with stems of the hazel and   oak,      Of hollies, and hazels, and oak-trees, a valley was sloping away   From his hoofs in the heavy grasses, with monstrous slumbering folk,      Their mighty and naked and gleaming bodies heaped loose where they   lay.   More comely than man may make them, inlaid with silver and gold,      Were arrow and shield and war-axe, arrow and spear and blade,   And dew-blanched horns, in whose hollows a child of three years old      Could sleep on a couch of rushes, round and about them laid.And this, which deals with the old legend of the city lying under thewaters of a lake, is strange and interesting:   The maker of the stars and worlds      Sat underneath the market cross,   And the old men were walking, walking,      And little boys played pitch-and-toss.   'The props,' said He, 'of stars and worlds      Are prayers of patient men and good.'   The boys, the women, and old men,      Listening, upon their shadows stood.   A grey professor passing cried,      'How few the mind's intemperance rule!   What shallow thoughts about deep things!      The world grows old and plays the fool.'   The mayor came, leaning his left ear--      There were some talking of the poor--   And to himself cried, 'Communist!'      And hurried to the guardhouse door.   The bishop came with open book,      Whispering along the sunny path;   There was some talking of man's God,      His God of stupor and of wrath.   The bishop murmured, 'Atheist!      How sinfully the wicked scoff!'   And sent the old men on their way,      And drove the boys and women off.   The place was empty now of people;      A cock came by upon his toes;   An old horse looked across the fence,      And rubbed along the rail his nose.   The maker of the stars and worlds      To His own house did Him betake,   And on that city dropped a tear,      And now that city is a lake.Mr. Yeats has a great deal of invention, and some of the poems in hisbook, such as Mosada, Jealousy, and The Island of Statues, are veryfinely conceived.  It is impossible to doubt, after reading his presentvolume, that he will some day give us work of high import.  Up to this hehas been merely trying the strings of his instrument, running over thekeys.* * * * *Lady Munster's Dorinda is an exceedingly clever novel.  The heroine is asort of well-born Becky Sharp, only much more beautiful than Becky, or atleast than Thackeray's portraits of her, which, however, have alwaysseemed to me rather ill-natured.  I feel sure that Mrs. Rawdon Crawleywas extremely pretty, and I have never understood how it was thatThackeray could caricature with his pencil so fascinating a creation ofhis pen.  In the first chapter of Lady Munster's novel we find Dorinda ata fashionable school, and the sketches of the three old ladies whopreside over the select seminary are very amusing.  Dorinda is not verypopular, and grave suspicions rest upon her of having stolen a cheque.This is a startling debut for a heroine, and I was a little afraid atfirst that Dorinda, after undergoing endless humiliations, would beproved innocent in the last chapter.  It was quite a relief to find thatDorinda was guilty.  In fact, Dorinda is a kleptomaniac; that is to say,she is a member of the upper classes who spends her time in collectingworks of art that do not belong to her.  This, however, is only one ofher accomplishments, and it does not occupy any important place in thestory till the last volume is reached.  Here we find Dorinda married to aStyrian Prince, and living in the luxury for which she had always longed.Unfortunately, while staying in the house of a friend she is detectedstealing some rare enamels.  Her punishment, as described by LadyMunster, is extremely severe; and when she finally commits suicide,maddened by the imprisonment to which her husband had subjected her, itis difficult not to feel a good deal of pity for her.  Lady Munsterwrites a very clever, bright style, and has a wonderful faculty ofdrawing in a few sentences the most lifelike portraits of social typesand social exceptions.  Sir Jasper Broke and his sister, the Duke andDuchess of Cheviotdale, Lord and Lady Glenalmond, and Lord Baltimore, areall admirably drawn.  The 'novel of high life,' as it used to be called,has of late years fallen into disrepute.  Instead of duchesses inMayfair, we have philanthropic young ladies in Whitechapel; and thefashionable and brilliant young dandies, in whom Disraeli and BulwerLytton took such delight, have been entirely wiped out as heroes offiction by hardworking curates in the East End.  The aim of most of ourmodern novelists seems to be, not to write good novels, but to writenovels that will do good; and I am afraid that they are under theimpression that fashionable life is not an edifying subject.  They wishto reform the morals, rather than to portray the manners of their age.They have made the novel the mode of propaganda.  It is possible,however, that Dorinda points to some coming change, and certainly itwould be a pity if the Muse of Fiction confined her attention entirely tothe East End.* * * * *The four remarkable women whom Mrs. Walford has chosen as the subjects ofher Four Biographies from 'Blackwood' are Jane Taylor, Elizabeth Fry,Hannah More, and Mary Somerville.  Perhaps it is too much to say thatJane Taylor is remarkable.  In her day she was said to have been 'knownto four continents,' and Sir Walter Scott described her as 'among thefirst women of her time'; but no one now cares to read Essays in Rhyme,or Display, though the latter is really a very clever novel and full ofcapital things.  Elizabeth Fry is, of course, one of the greatpersonalities of this century, at any rate in the particular sphere towhich she devoted herself, and ranks with the many uncanonised saintswhom the world has loved, and whose memory is sweet.  Mrs. Walford givesa most interesting account of her.  We see her first a gay, laughing,flaxen-haired girl, 'mightily addicted to fun,' pleased to be finelydressed and sent to the opera to see the 'Prince,' and be seen by him;pleased to exhibit her pretty figure in a becoming scarlet riding-habit,and to be looked at with obvious homage by the young officers quarteredhard by, as she rode along the Norfolk lanes; 'dissipated' by simplyhearing their band play in the square, and made giddy by the veriesttrifle: 'an idle, flirting, worldly girl,' to use her own words.  Thencame the eventful day when 'in purple boots laced with scarlet' she wentto hear William Savery preach at the Meeting House.  This was the turning-point of her life, her psychological moment, as the phrase goes.  Afterit came the era of 'thees' and 'thous,' of the drab gown and the beaverhat, of the visits to Newgate and the convict ships, of the work ofrescuing the outcast and seeking the lost.  Mrs. Walford quotes thefollowing interesting account of the famous interview with QueenCharlotte at the Mansion-House:   Inside the Egyptian Hall there was a subject for Hayter--the   diminutive stature of the Queen, covered with diamonds, and her   countenance lighted up with the kindest benevolence; Mrs. Fry, her   simple Quaker's dress adding to the height of her figure--though a   little flushed--preserving her wonted calmness of look and manner;   several of the bishops standing near; the platform crowded with waving   feathers, jewels, and orders; the hall lined with spectators, gaily   and nobly clad, and the centre filled with hundreds of children,   brought there from their different schools to be examined.  A murmur   of applause ran through the assemblage as the Queen took Mrs. Fry by   the hand.  The murmur was followed by a clap and a shout, which was   taken up by the multitudes without till it died away in the distance.Those who regard Hannah More as a prim maiden lady of the conventionaltype, with a pious and literary turn of mind, will be obliged to changetheir views should they read Mrs. Walford's admirable sketch of theauthoress of Percy.  Hannah More was a brilliant wit, a femme d'esprit,passionately fond of society, and loved by society in return.  When theserious-minded little country girl, who at the age of eight had covered awhole quire of paper with letters seeking to reform imaginary depravedcharacters, and with return epistles full of contrition and promises ofamendment, paid her first visit to London, she became at once theintimate friend of Johnson, Burke, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Garrick, and mostof the distinguished people of the day, delighting them by her charm, andgrace, and wit.  'I dined at the Adelphi yesterday,' she writes in one ofher letters.  'Garrick was the very soul of the company, and I never sawJohnson in more perfect good-humour.  After all had risen to go we stoodround them for above an hour, laughing, in defiance of every rule ofdecorum and Chesterfield.  I believe we should never have thought ofsitting down, nor of parting, had not an impertinent watchman beensaucily vociferating.  Johnson outstaid them all, and sat with me forhalf an hour.'  The following is from her sister's pen:   On Tuesday evening we drank tea at Sir Joshua's with Dr. Johnson.   Hannah is certainly a great favourite.  She was placed next him, and   they had the entire conversation to themselves.  They were both in   remarkably high spirits, and it was certainly her lucky night; I never   heard her say so many good things.  The old genius was as jocular as   the young one was pleasant.  You would have imagined we were at some   comedy had you heard our peals of laughter.  They certainly tried   which could 'pepper the highest,' and it is not clear to me that the   lexicographer was really the highest seasoner.Hannah More was certainly, as Mrs. Walford says, 'the feted and caressedidol of society.'  The theatre at Bristol vaunted, 'Boast we not a More?'and the learned cits at Oxford inscribed their acknowledgment of herauthority.  Horace Walpole sat on the doorstep--or threatened to doso--till she promised to go down to Strawberry Hill; Foster quoted her;Mrs. Thrale twined her arms about her; Wilberforce consulted her andemployed her.  When The Estimate of the Religion of the Fashionable Worldwas published anonymously, 'Aut Morus, aut Angelus,' exclaimed the Bishopof London, before he had read six pages.  Of her village stories andballads two million copies were sold during the first year.  Caelebs inSearch of a Wife ran into thirty editions.  Mrs. Barbauld writes to tellher about 'a good and sensible woman' of her acquaintance, who, on beingasked how she contrived to divert herself in the country, replied, 'Ihave my spinning-wheel and my Hannah More.  When I have spun one pound offlax I put on another, and when I have finished my book I begin it again._I want no other amusement_.'  How incredible it all sounds!  No wonderthat Mrs. Walford exclaims, 'No other amusement!  Good heavens!  Breathesthere a man, woman, or child with soul so quiescent nowadays as to besatisfied with reels of flax and yards of Hannah More?  Give us Hannah'scompany, but not--not her writings!'  It is only fair to say that Mrs.Walford has thoroughly carried out the views she expresses in thispassage, for she gives us nothing of Hannah More's grandiloquent literaryproductions, and yet succeeds in making us know her thoroughly.  Thewhole book is well written, but the biography of Hannah More is awonderfully brilliant sketch, and deserves great praise.* * * * *Miss Mabel Wotton has invented a new form of picture-gallery.  Feelingthat the visible aspect of men and women can be expressed in literatureno less than through the medium of line and colour, she has collectedtogether a series of Word Portraits of Famous Writers extending fromGeoffrey Chaucer to Mrs. Henry Wood.  It is a far cry from the author ofthe Canterbury Tales to the authoress of East Lynne; but as a beauty, atany rate, Mrs. Wood deserved to be described, and we hear of the pureoval of her face, of her perfect mouth, her 'dazzling' complexion, andthe extraordinary youth by which 'she kept to the last the . . .freshness of a young girl.'  Many of the 'famous writers' seem to havebeen very ugly.  Thomson, the poet, was of a dull countenance, and agross, unanimated, uninviting appearance; Richardson looked 'like a plumpwhite mouse in a wig.'  Pope is described in the Guardian, in 1713, as 'alively little creature, with long arms and legs: a spider is no illemblem of him.  He has been taken at a distance for a small windmill.'Charles Kingsley appears as 'rather tall, very angular, surprisinglyawkward, with thin staggering legs, a hatchet face adorned with scraggygray whiskers, a faculty for falling into the most ungainly attitudes,and making the most hideous contortions of visage and frame; with a roughprovincial accent and an uncouth way of speaking which would be set downfor absurd caricature on the boards of a comic theatre.'  Lamb isdescribed by Carlyle as 'the leanest of mankind; tiny black breechesbuttoned to the knee-cap and no further, surmounting spindle legs also inblack, face and head fineish, black, bony, lean, and of a Jew typerather'; and Talfourd says that the best portrait of him is his owndescription of Braham--'a compound of the Jew, the gentleman, and theangel.'  William Godwin was 'short and stout, his clothes loosely andcarelessly put on, and usually old and worn; his hands were generally inhis pockets; he had a remarkably large, bald head, and a weak voice;seeming generally half asleep when he walked, and even when he talked.'Lord Charlemont spoke of David Hume as more like a 'turtle-eatingalderman' than 'a refined philosopher.'  Mary Russell Mitford was ill-naturedly described by L.E.L. as 'Sancho Panza in petticoats!'; and asfor poor Rogers, who was somewhat cadaverous, the descriptions given ofhim are quite dreadful.  Lord Dudley once asked him 'why, now that hecould afford it, he did not set up his hearse,' and it is said thatSydney Smith gave him mortal offence by recommending him 'when he sat forhis portrait to be drawn saying his prayers, with his face hidden in hishands,' christened him the 'Death dandy,' and wrote underneath a pictureof him, 'Painted in his lifetime.'  We must console ourselves--if notwith Mr. Hardy's statement that 'ideal physical beauty is incompatiblewith mental development, and a full recognition of the evil of things'--atleast with the pictures of those who had some comeliness, and grace, andcharm.  Dr. Grosart says of a miniature of Edmund Spenser, 'It is anexquisitely beautiful face.  The brow is ample, the lips thin but mobile,the eyes a grayish-blue, the hair and beard a golden red (as of "redmonie" of the ballads) or goldenly chestnut, the nose withsemi-transparent nostril and keen, the chin firm-poised, the expressionrefined and delicate.  Altogether just such "presentment" of the Poet ofBeauty par excellence, as one would have imagined.'  Antony Wooddescribes Sir Richard Lovelace as being, at the age of sixteen, 'the mostamiable and beautiful person that ever eye beheld.'  Nor need we wonderat this when we remember the portrait of Lovelace that hangs at DulwichCollege.  Barry Cornwall, described himself by S. C. Hall as 'a decidedlyrather pretty little fellow,' said of Keats: 'His countenance lives in mymind as one of singular beauty and brightness,--it had an expression asif he had been looking on some glorious sight.'  Chatterton and Byronwere splendidly handsome, and beauty of a high spiritual order may beclaimed both for Milton and Shelley, though an industrious gentlemanlately wrote a book in two volumes apparently for the purpose of provingthat the latter of these two poets had a snub nose.  Hazlitt once saidthat 'A man's life may be a lie to himself and others, and yet a picturepainted of him by a great artist would probably stamp his character.'  Fewof the word-portraits in Miss Wotton's book can be said to have beendrawn by a great artist, but they are all interesting, and Miss Wottonhas certainly shown a wonderful amount of industry in collecting herreferences and in grouping them.  It is not a book to be read throughfrom beginning to end, but it is a delightful book to glance at, and byits means one can raise the ghosts of the dead, at least as well as thePsychical Society can.(1) Leaves of Life.

WILLIAM MORRIS'S LAST BOOK(Pall Mall Gazette, March 2, 1889.)Mr. Morris's last book is a piece of pure art workmanship from beginningto end, and the very remoteness of its style from the common language andordinary interests of our day gives to the whole story a strange beautyand an unfamiliar charm.  It is written in blended prose and verse, likethe mediaeval 'cante-fable,' and tells the tale of the House of theWolfings in its struggles against the legionaries of Rome then advancinginto Northern Germany.  It is a kind of Saga, and the language in whichthe folk-epic, as we may call it, is set forth recalls the antiquedignity and directness of our English tongue four centuries ago.  From anartistic point of view it may be described as an attempt to return by aself-conscious effort to the conditions of an earlier and a fresher age.Attempts of this kind are not uncommon in the history of art.  From somesuch feeling came the Pre-Raphaelite movement of our own day and thearchaistic movement of later Greek sculpture.  When the result isbeautiful the method is justified, and no shrill insistence upon asupposed necessity for absolute modernity of form can prevail against thevalue of work that has the incomparable excellence of style.  Certainly,Mr. Morris's work possesses this excellence.  His fine harmonies and richcadences create in the reader that spirit by which alone can its ownspirit be interpreted, awake in him something of the temper of romanceand, by taking him out of his own age, place him in a truer and morevital relation to the great masterpieces of all time.  It is a bad thingfor an age to be always looking in art for its own reflection.  It iswell that, now and then, we are given work that is nobly imaginative inits method and purely artistic in its aim.  As we read Mr. Morris's storywith its fine alternations of verse and prose, its decorative anddescriptive beauties, its wonderful handling of romantic and adventurousthemes, we cannot but feel that we are as far removed from the ignoblefiction as we are from the ignoble facts of our own day.  We breathe apurer air, and have dreams of a time when life had a kind of poeticalquality of its own, and was simple and stately and complete.The tragic interest of The House of the Wolfings centres round the figureof Thiodolf, the great hero of the tribe.  The goddess who loves himgives him, as he goes to battle against the Romans, a magical hauberk onwhich rests this strange fate: that he who wears it shall save his ownlife and destroy the life of his land.  Thiodolf, finding out thissecret, brings the hauberk back to the Wood-Sun, as she is called, andchooses death for himself rather than the ruin of his cause, and so thestory ends.But Mr. Morris has always preferred romance to tragedy, and set thedevelopment of action above the concentration of passion.  His story islike some splendid old tapestry crowded with stately images and enrichedwith delicate and delightful detail.  The impression it leaves on us isnot of a single central figure dominating the whole, but rather of amagnificent design to which everything is subordinated, and by whicheverything becomes of enduring import.  It is the whole presentation ofthe primitive life that really fascinates.  What in other hands wouldhave been mere archaeology is here transformed by quick artistic instinctand made wonderful for us, and human and full of high interest.  Theancient world seems to have come to life again for our pleasure.Of a work so large and so coherent, completed with no less perfectionthan it is conceived, it is difficult by mere quotation to give anyadequate idea.  This, however, may serve as an example of its narrativepower.  The passage describes the visit of Thiodolf to the Wood-Sun:   The moonlight lay in a great flood on the grass without, and the dew   was falling in the coldest hour of the night, and the earth smelled   sweetly: the whole habitation was asleep now, and there was no sound   to be known as the sound of any creature, save that from the distant   meadow came the lowing of a cow that had lost her calf, and that a   white owl was flitting about near the eaves of the Roof with her wild   cry that sounded like the mocking of merriment now silent.  Thiodolf   turned toward the wood, and walked steadily through the scattered   hazel-trees, and thereby into the thick of the beech-trees, whose   boles grew smooth and silver-grey, high and close-set: and so on and   on he went as one going by a well-known path, though there was no   path, till all the moonlight was quenched under the close roof of the   beech-leaves, though yet for all the darkness, no man could go there   and not feel that the roof was green above him.  Still he went on in   despite of the darkness, till at last there was a glimmer before him,   that grew greater till he came unto a small wood-lawn whereon the turf   grew again, though the grass was but thin, because little sunlight got   to it, so close and thick were the tall trees round about it. . . .   Nought looked Thiodolf either at the heavens above, or the trees, as   he strode from off the husk-strewn floor of the beech wood on to the   scanty grass of the lawn, but his eyes looked straight before him at   that which was amidmost of the lawn: and little wonder was that; for   there on a stone chair sat a woman exceeding fair, clad in glittering   raiment, her hair lying as pale in the moonlight on the grey stone as   the barley acres in the August night before the reaping-hook goes in   amongst them.  She sat there as though she were awaiting some one, and   he made no stop nor stay, but went straight up to her, and took her in   his arms, and kissed her mouth and her eyes, and she him again; and   then he sat himself down beside her.As an example of the beauty of the verse we would take this from the songof the Wood-Sun.  It at least shows how perfectly the poetry harmoniseswith the prose, and how natural the transition is from the one to theother:   In many a stead Doom dwelleth, nor sleepeth day nor night:   The rim of the bowl she kisseth, and beareth the chambering light   When the kings of men wend happy to the bride-bed from the board.   It is little to say that she wendeth the edge of the grinded sword,   When about the house half builded she hangeth many a day;   The ship from the strand she shoveth, and on his wonted way   By the mountain hunter fareth where his foot ne'er failed before:   She is where the high bank crumbles at last on the river's shore:   The mower's scythe she whetteth; and lulleth the shepherd to sleep   Where the deadly ling-worm wakeneth in the desert of the sheep.   Now we that come of the God-kin of her redes for ourselves we wot,   But her will with the lives of men-folk and their ending know we not.   So therefore I bid thee not fear for thyself of Doom and her deed,   But for me: and I bid thee hearken to the helping of my need.   Or else--Art thou happy in life, or lusteth thou to die   In the flower of thy days, when thy glory and thy longing bloom on   high?The last chapter of the book in which we are told of the great feast madefor the dead is so finely written that we cannot refrain from quotingthis passage:   Now was the glooming falling upon the earth; but the Hall was bright   within even as the Hall-Sun had promised.  Therein was set forth the   Treasure of the Wolfings; fair cloths were hung on the walls, goodly   broidered garments on the pillars: goodly brazen cauldrons and fair-   carven chests were set down in nooks where men could see them well,   and vessels of gold and silver were set all up and down the tables of   the feast.  The pillars also were wreathed with flowers, and flowers   hung garlanded from the walls over the precious hangings; sweet gums   and spices were burning in fair-wrought censers of brass, and so many   candles were alight under the Roof, that scarce had it looked more   ablaze when the Romans had litten the faggots therein for its burning   amidst the hurry of the Morning Battle.   There then they fell to feasting, hallowing in the high-tide of their   return with victory in their hands: and the dead corpses of Thiodolf   and Otter, clad in precious glittering raiment, looked down on them   from the High-seat, and the kindreds worshipped them and were glad;   and they drank the Cup to them before any others, were they Gods or   men.In days of uncouth realism and unimaginative imitation, it is a highpleasure to welcome work of this kind.  It is a work in which all loversof literature cannot fail to delight.A Tale of the House of the Wolfings and all the Kindreds of the Mark.Written in Prose and in Verse by William Morris.  (Reeves and Turner.)ADAM LINDSAY GORDON(Pall Mall Gazette, March 25, 1889.)A critic recently remarked of Adam Lindsay Gordon that through himAustralia had found her first fine utterance in song. {452}  This,however, is an amiable error.  There is very little of Australia inGordon's poetry.  His heart and mind and fancy were always preoccupiedwith memories and dreams of England and such culture as England gave him.He owed nothing to the land of his adoption.  Had he stayed at home hewould have done much better work.  In a few poems such as The SickStockrider, From the Wreck, and Wolf and Hound there are notes ofAustralian influences, and these Swinburnian stanzas from the dedicationto the Bush Ballads deserve to be quoted, though the promise they holdout was never fulfilled:   They are rhymes rudely strung with intent less      Of sound than of words,   In lands where bright blossoms are scentless,      And songless bright birds;   Where, with fire and fierce drought on her tresses,   Insatiable summer oppresses   Sere woodlands and sad wildernesses,      And faint flocks and herds.   Whence gather'd?--The locust's grand chirrup      May furnish a stave;   The ring of a rowel and stirrup,      The wash of a wave.   The chaunt of the marsh frog in rushes,   That chimes through the pauses and hushes      Of nightfall, the torrent that gushes,   The tempests that rave.      In the gathering of night gloom o'erhead, in   The still silent change,      All fire-flushed when forest trees redden   On slopes of the range.   When the gnarl'd, knotted trunks Eucalyptian   Seem carved, like weird columns Egyptian,   With curious device--quaint inscription,      And hieroglyph strange;   In the Spring, when the wattle gold trembles      'Twixt shadow and shine,   When each dew-laden air draught resembles      A long draught of wine;   When the sky-line's blue burnish'd resistance      Makes deeper the dreamiest distance,   Some song in all hearts hath existence,--      Such songs have been mine.As a rule, however, Gordon is distinctly English, and the landscapes hedescribes are always the landscapes of our own country.  He writes aboutmediaeval lords and ladies in his Rhyme of Joyous Garde, about Cavaliersand Roundheads in The Romance of Britomarte, and Ashtaroth, his longestand most ambitious poem, deals with the adventures of the Norman baronsand Danish knights of ancient days.  Steeped in Swinburne and bewilderedwith Browning, he set himself to reproduce the marvellous melody of theone and the dramatic vigour and harsh strength of the other.  From theWreck is a sort of Australian edition of the Ride to Ghent.  These arethe first three stanzas of one of the so-called Bush Ballads:   On skies still and starlit      White lustres take hold,   And grey flashes scarlet,      And red flashes gold.   And sun-glories cover   The rose, shed above her,   Like lover and lover      They flame and unfold.   . . . . .   Still bloom in the garden      Green grass-plot, fresh lawn,   Though pasture lands harden      And drought fissures yawn.   While leaves, not a few fall,   Let rose-leaves for you fall,   Leaves pearl-strung with dewfall,      And gold shot with dawn.   Does the grass-plot remember      The fall of your feet   In Autumn's red ember      When drought leagues with heat,   When the last of the roses   Despairingly closes   In the lull that reposes      Ere storm winds wax fleet?And the following verses show that the Norman Baron of Ashtaroth had readDolores just once too often:   Dead priests of Osiris, and Isis,      And Apis! that mystical lore,   Like a nightmare, conceived in a crisis      Of fever, is studied no more;   Dead Magian! yon star-troop that spangles      The arch of yon firmament vast   Looks calm, like a host of white angels      On dry dust of votaries past.   On seas unexplored can the ship shun      Sunk rocks?  Can man fathom life's links,   Past or future, unsolved by Egyptian      Or Theban, unspoken by Sphynx?   The riddle remains yet, unravell'd      By students consuming night oil.   O earth! we have toil'd, we have travailed:      How long shall we travail and toil?By the classics Gordon was always very much fascinated.  He loved what hecalls 'the scroll that is godlike and Greek,' though he is ratheruncertain about his quantities, rhyming 'Polyxena' to 'Athena' and'Aphrodite' to 'light,' and occasionally makes very rash statements, aswhen he represents Leonidas exclaiming to the three hundred atThermopylae:   'Ho! comrades let us gaily dine--      This night with Plato we shall sup,'if this be not, as we hope it is, a printer's error.  What theAustralians liked best were his spirited, if somewhat rough, horse-racingand hunting poems.  Indeed, it was not till he found that How We Beat theFavourite was on everybody's lips that he consented to forego hisanonymity and appear in the unsuspected character of a verse-writer,having up to that time produced his poems shyly, scribbled them on scrapsof paper, and sent them unsigned to the local magazines.  The fact isthat the social atmosphere of Melbourne was not favourable to poets, andthe worthy colonials seem to have shared Audrey's doubts as to whetherpoetry was a true and honest thing.  It was not till Gordon won the CupSteeplechase for Major Baker in 1868 that he became really popular, andprobably there were many who felt that to steer Babbler to the winning-post was a finer achievement than 'to babble o'er green fields.'On the whole, it is impossible not to regret that Gordon ever emigrated.His literary power cannot be denied, but it was stunted in uncongenialsurroundings and marred by the rude life he was forced to lead.  Australiahas converted many of our failures into prosperous and admirablemediocrities, but she certainly spoiled one of our poets for us.  Ovid atTomi is not more tragic than Gordon driving cattle or farming anunprofitable sheep-ranch.That Australia, however, will some day make amends by producing a poet ofher own we cannot doubt, and for him there will be new notes to sound andnew wonders to tell of.  The description, given by Mr. Marcus Clarke inthe preface to this volume, of the aspect and spirit of Nature inAustralia is most curious and suggestive.  The Australian forests, hetells us, are funereal and stern, and 'seem to stifle, in their blackgorges, a story of sullen despair.'  No leaves fall from the trees, but'from the melancholy gum strips of white bark hang and rustle.  Greatgrey kangaroos hop noiselessly over the coarse grass.  Flights ofcockatoos stream out, shrieking like evil souls.  The sun suddenly sinksand the mopokes burst out into horrible peals of semi-human laughter.'The aborigines aver that, when night comes, from the bottomless depth ofsome lagoon a misshapen monster rises, dragging his loathsome lengthalong the ooze.  From a corner of the silent forest rises a dismal chant,and around a fire dance natives painted like skeletons.  All isfear-inspiring and gloomy.  No bright fancies are linked with thememories of the mountains.  Hopeless explorers have named them out oftheir sufferings--Mount Misery, Mount Dreadful, Mount Despair.   In Australia alone (says Mr. Clarke) is to be found the Grotesque, the   Weird, the strange scribblings of nature learning how to write.  But   the dweller in the wilderness acknowledges the subtle charm of the   fantastic land of monstrosities.  He becomes familiar with the beauty   of loneliness.  Whispered to by the myriad tongues of the wilderness,   he learns the language of the barren and the uncouth, and can read the   hieroglyphs of haggard gum-trees, blown into odd shapes, distorted   with fierce hot winds, or cramped with cold nights, when the Southern   Cross freezes in a cloudless sky of icy blue.  The phantasmagoria of   that wild dream-land termed the Bush interprets itself, and the Poet   of our desolation begins to comprehend why free Esau loved his   heritage of desert sand better than all the bountiful richness of   Egypt.Here, certainly, is new material for the poet, here is a land that iswaiting for its singer.  Such a singer Gordon was not.  He remainedthoroughly English, and the best that we can say of him is that he wroteimperfectly in Australia those poems that in England he might have madeperfect.Poems.  By Adam Lindsay Gordon.  (Samuel Mullen.)THE POETS' CORNER--IX(Pall Mall Gazette, March 30, 1889.)Judges, like the criminal classes, have their lighter moments, and it wasprobably in one of his happiest and, certainly, in one of his mostcareless moods that Mr. Justice Denman conceived the idea of putting theearly history of Rome into doggerel verse for the benefit of a little boyof the name of Jack.  Poor Jack!  He is still, we learn from the preface,under six years of age, and it is sad to think of the future career of aboy who is being brought up on bad history and worse poetry.  Here is apassage from the learned judge's account of Romulus:   Poor Tatius by some unknown hand      Was soon assassinated,   Some said by Romulus' command;      I know not--but 'twas fated.   Sole King again, this Romulus      Play'd some fantastic tricks,   Lictors he had, who hatchets bore      Bound up with rods of sticks.   He treated all who thwarted him      No better than a dog,   Sometimes 'twas 'Heads off, Lictors, there!'      Sometimes 'Ho!  Lictors, flog!'   Then he created Senators,      And gave them rings of gold;   Old soldiers all; their name deriv'd      From 'Senex' which means 'old.'   Knights, too, he made, good horsemen all,      Who always were at hand   To execute immediately      Whate'er he might command.   But these were of Patrician rank,      Plebeians all the rest;   Remember this distinction, Jack!      For 'tis a useful test.The reign of Tullius Hostilius opens with a very wicked rhyme:   As Numa, dying, only left      A daughter, named Pompilia,   The Senate had to choose a King.      They choose one sadly _sillier_.If Jack goes to the bad, Mr. Justice Denman will have much to answer for.After such a terrible example from the Bench, it is pleasant to turn tothe seats reserved for Queen's Counsel.  Mr. Cooper Willis's Tales andLegends, if somewhat boisterous in manner, is still very spirited andclever.  The Prison of the Danes is not at all a bad poem, and there is agreat deal of eloquent, strong writing in the passage beginning:   The dying star-song of the night sinks in the dawning day,   And the dark-blue sheen is changed to green, and the green fades into   grey,   And the sleepers are roused from their slumbers, and at last the   Danesmen know   How few of all their numbers are left them by the foe.Not much can be said of a poet who exclaims:   Oh, for the power of Byron or of Moore,   To glow with one, and with the latter soar.And yet Mr. Moodie is one of the best of those South African poets whoseworks have been collected and arranged by Mr. Wilmot.  Pringle, the'father of South African verse,' comes first, of course, and his bestpoem is, undoubtedly, Afar in the Desert:   Afar in the desert I love to ride,   With the silent Bush-boy alone by my side:   Away, away, from the dwelling of men   By the wild-deer's haunt, by the buffalo's glen:   By valleys remote where the oribi plays,   Where the gnu, the gazelle and the hartebeest graze,   And the kudu and eland unhunted recline   By the skirts of grey forests o'erhung with wild vine,   Where the elephant browses at peace in his wood,   And the river-horse gambols unscared in the flood,   And the mighty rhinoceros wallows at will   In the fen where the wild ass is drinking his fill.It is not, however, a very remarkable production.The Smouse, by Fannin, has the modern merit of incomprehensibility.  Itreads like something out of The Hunting of the Snark:   I'm a Smouse, I'm a Smouse in the wilderness wide,   The veld is my home, and the wagon's my pride:   The crack of my 'voerslag' shall sound o'er the lea,   I'm a Smouse, I'm a Smouse, and the trader is free!   I heed not the Governor, I fear not his law,   I care not for civilisation one straw,   And ne'er to 'Ompanda'--'Umgazis' I'll throw   While my arm carries fist, or my foot bears a toe!   'Trek,' 'trek,' ply the whip--touch the fore oxen's skin,   I'll warrant we'll 'go it' through thick and through thin--   Loop! loop ye oud skellums! ot Vikmaan trek jy;   I'm a Smouse, I'm a Smouse, and the trader is free!The South African poets, as a class, are rather behind the age.  Theyseem to think that 'Aurora' is a very novel and delightful epithet forthe dawn.  On the whole they depress us.Chess, by Mr. Louis Tylor, is a sort of Christmas masque in which thedramatis personae consist of some unmusical carollers, a priggish youngman called Eric, and the chessmen off the board.  The White Queen'sKnight begins a ballad and the Black King's Bishop completes it.  ThePawns sing in chorus and the Castles converse with each other.  Thesilliness of the form makes it an absolutely unreadable book.Mr. Williamson's Poems of Nature and Life are as orthodox in spirit asthey are commonplace in form.  A few harmless heresies of art and thoughtwould do this poet no harm.  Nearly everything that he says has been saidbefore and said better.  The only original thing in the volume is thedescription of Mr. Robert Buchanan's 'grandeur of mind.'  This isdecidedly new.Dr. Cockle tells us that Mullner's Guilt and The Ancestress ofGrillparzer are the masterpieces of German fate-tragedy.  His translationof the first of these two masterpieces does not make us long for anyfurther acquaintance with the school.  Here is a specimen from the fourthact of the fate-tragedy.   SCENE VIII.   ELVIRA.  HUGO.   ELVIRA (after long silence, leaving the harp, steps to Hugo, and seeks   his gaze).   HUGO (softly).  Though I made sacrifice of thy sweet life.  The Father   has forgiven.  Can the wife--Forgive?   ELVIRA (on his breast).  She can!   HUGO (with all the warmth of love).  Dear wife!   ELVIRA (after a pause, in deep sorrow).  Must it be so, beloved one?   HUGO (sorry to have betrayed himself).  What?In his preface to The Circle of Seasons, a series of hymns and verses forthe seasons of the Church, the Rev. T. B. Dover expresses a hope thatthis well-meaning if somewhat tedious book 'may be of value to those manyearnest people to whom the subjective aspect of truth is helpful.'  Thepoem beginning   Lord, in the inn of my poor worthless heart      Guests come and go; but there is room for Thee,has some merit and might be converted into a good sonnet.  The majorityof the poems, however, are quite worthless.  There seems to be somecurious connection between piety and poor rhymes.Lord Henry Somerset's verse is not so good as his music.  Most of theSongs of Adieu are marred by their excessive sentimentality of feelingand by the commonplace character of their weak and lax form.  There isnothing that is new and little that is true in verse of this kind:   The golden leaves are falling,      Falling one by one,   Their tender 'Adieux' calling      To the cold autumnal sun.   The trees in the keen and frosty air      Stand out against the sky,   'Twould seem they stretch their branches bare      To Heaven in agony.It can be produced in any quantity.  Lord Henry Somerset has too muchheart and too little art to make a good poet, and such art as he doespossess is devoid of almost every intellectual quality and entirelylacking in any intellectual strength.  He has nothing to say and says it.Mrs. Cora M. Davis is eloquent about the splendours of what the authoressof The Circle of Seasons calls 'this earthly ball.'   Let's sing the beauties of this grand old earth,she cries, and proceeds to tell how   Imagination paints old Egypt's former glory,   Of mighty temples reaching heavenward,   Of grim, colossal statues, whose barbaric story   The caustic pens of erudition still record,   Whose ancient cities of glittering minarets   Reflect the gold of Afric's gorgeous sunsets.'The caustic pens of erudition' is quite delightful and will beappreciated by all Egyptologists.  There is also a charming passage inthe same poem on the pictures of the Old Masters:      the mellow richness of whose tints impart,   By contrast, greater delicacy still to modern art.This seems to us the highest form of optimism we have ever come across inart criticism.  It is American in origin, Mrs. Davis, as her biographertells us, having been born in Alabama, Genesee co., N.Y.(1) The Story of the Kings of Rome in Verse.  By the Hon. G.

I fear that thiswill sound to many a somewhat uninviting description of this admirableand useful body, whose papers and productions have been recentlypublished by Professor Knight, under the title of Wordsworthiana.  'Plainliving and high thinking' are not popular ideals.  Most people prefer tolive in luxury, and to think with the majority.  However, there is reallynothing in the essays and addresses of the Wordsworth Society that needcause the public any unnecessary alarm; and it is gratifying to notethat, although the society is still in the first blush of enthusiasm, ithas not yet insisted upon our admiring Wordsworth's inferior work.  Itpraises what is worthy of praise, reverences what should be reverenced,and explains what does not require explanation.  One paper is quitedelightful; it is from the pen of Mr. Rawnsley, and deals with suchreminiscences of Wordsworth as still linger among the peasantry ofWestmoreland.  Mr. Rawnsley grew up, he tells us, in the immediatevicinity of the present Poet-Laureate's old home in Lincolnshire, and hadbeen struck with the swiftness with which,   As year by year the labourer tills   His wonted glebe, or lops the glades,the memories of the poet of the Somersby Wold had 'faded from off thecircle of the hills'--had, indeed, been astonished to note how littlereal interest was taken in him or his fame, and how seldom his works weremet with in the houses of the rich or poor in the very neighbourhood.Accordingly, when he came to reside in the Lake Country, he endeavouredto find out what of Wordsworth's memory among the men of the Dales stilllingered on--how far he was still a moving presence among them--how farhis works had made their way into the cottages and farmhouses of thevalleys.  He also tried to discover how far the race of Westmoreland andCumberland farm-folk--the 'Matthews' and the 'Michaels' of the poet, asdescribed by him--were real or fancy pictures, or how far the charactersof the Dalesmen had been altered in any remarkable manner by touristinfluences during the thirty-two years that have passed since the Lakepoet was laid to rest.With regard to the latter point, it will be remembered that Mr. Ruskin,writing in 1876, said that 'the Border peasantry, painted with absolutefidelity by Scott and Wordsworth,' are, as hitherto, a scarcely injuredrace; that in his fields at Coniston he had men who might have foughtwith Henry V. at Agincourt without being distinguished from any of hisknights; that he could take his tradesmen's word for a thousand pounds,and need never latch his garden gate; and that he did not fearmolestation, in wood or on moor, for his girl guests.  Mr. Rawnsley,however, found that a certain beauty had vanished which the simpleretirement of old valley days fifty years ago gave to the men among whomWordsworth lived.  'The strangers,' he says, 'with their gifts of gold,their vulgarity, and their requirements, have much to answer for.'  Asfor their impressions of Wordsworth, to understand them one mustunderstand the vernacular of the Lake District.  'What was Mr. Wordsworthlike in personal appearance?' said Mr. Rawnsley once to an old retainer,who still lives not far from Rydal Mount.  'He was a ugly-faaced man, anda mean liver,' was the answer; but all that was really meant was that hewas a man of marked features, and led a very simple life in matters offood and raiment.  Another old man, who believed that Wordsworth 'gotmost of his poetry out of Hartley,' spoke of the poet's wife as 'a veryonpleasant woman, very onpleasant indeed.  A close-fisted woman, that'swhat she was.'  This, however, seems to have been merely a tribute toMrs. Wordsworth's admirable housekeeping qualities.The first person interviewed by Mr. Rawnsley was an old lady who had beenonce in service at Rydal Mount, and was, in 1870, a lodging-house keeperat Grasmere.  She was not a very imaginative person, as may be gatheredfrom the following anecdote:--Mr. Rawnsley's sister came in from a lateevening walk, and said, 'O Mrs. D---, have you seen the wonderfulsunset?'  The good lady turned sharply round and, drawing herself to herfull height, as if mortally offended, answered: 'No, miss; I'm a tidycook, I know, and "they say" a decentish body for a landlady, but I don'tknaw nothing about sunsets or them sort of things, they've never been inmy line.'  Her reminiscence of Wordsworth was as worthy of tradition asit was explanatory, from her point of view, of the method in whichWordsworth composed, and was helped in his labours by his enthusiasticsister.  'Well, you know,' she said, 'Mr. Wordsworth went humming andbooing about, and she, Miss Dorothy, kept close behint him, and shepicked up the bits as he let 'em fall, and tak' 'em down, and put 'emtogether on paper for him.  And you may be very well sure as how shedidn't understand nor make sense out of 'em, and I doubt that he didn'tknow much about them either himself, but, howivver, there's a great manyfolk as do, I dare say.'  Of Wordsworth's habit of talking to himself,and composing aloud, we hear a great deal.  'Was Mr. Wordsworth asociable man?' asked Mr. Rawnsley of a Rydal farmer.  'Wudsworth, for a'he had noa pride nor nowt,' was the answer, 'was a man who was quite oneto hissel, ye kna.  He was not a man as folks could crack wi', nor not aman as could crack wi' folks.  But there was another thing as kep' folkoff, he had a ter'ble girt deep voice, and ye might see his faace agaanfor long enuff.  I've knoan folks, village lads and lasses, coming overby old road above, which runs from Grasmere to Rydal, flayt a'most todeath there by Wishing Gaate to hear the girt voice a groanin' andmutterin' and thunderin' of a still evening.  And he had a way ofstandin' quite still by the rock there in t' path under Rydal, and folkscould hear sounds like a wild beast coming from the rocks, and childerwere scared fit to be dead a'most.'Wordsworth's description of himself constantly recurs to one:   And who is he with modest looks,      And clad in sober russet gown?   He murmurs by the running brooks,      A music sweeter than their own;   He is retired as noontide dew,   Or fountain in a noonday grove.But the corroboration comes in strange guise.  Mr. Rawnsley asked one ofthe Dalesmen about Wordsworth's dress and habits.  This was the reply:'Wudsworth wore a Jem Crow, never seed him in a boxer in my life,--a JemCrow and an old blue cloak was his rig, and _as for his habits, he hadnoan_; niver knew him with a pot i' his hand, or a pipe i' his mouth.  Buthe was a great skater, for a' that--noan better in these parts--why, hecould cut his own naame upo' the ice, could Mr. Wudsworth.'  Skatingseems to have been Wordsworth's one form of amusement.  He was 'overfeckless i' his hands'--could not drive or ride--'not a bit of fish inhim,' and 'nowt of a mountaineer.'  But he could skate.  The rapture ofthe time when, as a boy, on Esthwaite's frozen lake, he had      wheeled about,   Proud and exulting like an untired horse   That cares not for his home, and, shod with steel,   Had hissed along the polished ice,was continued, Mr. Rawnsley tells us, into manhood's later day; and Mr.Rawnsley found many proofs that the skill the poet had gained, when   Not seldom from the uproar he retired,   Into a silent bay, or sportively   Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng   To cut across the reflex of a star,was of such a kind as to astonish the natives among whom he dwelt.  Therecollection of a fall he once had, when his skate caught on a stone,still lingers in the district.  A boy had been sent to sweep the snowfrom the White Moss Tarn for him.  'Did Mr. Wudsworth gie ye owt?' he wasasked, when he returned from his labour.  'Na, but I seed him tumlle,though!' was the answer.  'He was a ter'ble girt skater, was Wudsworthnow,' says one of Mr. Rawnsley's informants; 'he would put one hand i'his breast (he wore a frill shirt i' them days), and t'other hand i' hiswaistband, same as shepherds does to keep their hands warm, and he wouldstand up straight and sway and swing away grandly.'Of his poetry they did not think much, and whatever was good in it theyascribed to his wife, his sister, and Hartley Coleridge.  He wrotepoetry, they said, 'because he couldn't help it--because it was hishobby'--for sheer love, and not for money.  They could not understand hisdoing work 'for nowt,' and held his occupation in somewhat light esteembecause it did not bring in 'a deal o' brass to the pocket.'  'Did youever read his poetry, or see any books about in the farmhouses?' askedMr. Rawnsley.  The answer was curious: 'Ay, ay, time or two.  But ya'reweel aware there's potry and potry.  There's potry wi' a li'le bitpleasant in it, and potry sic as a man can laugh at or the childerunderstand, and some as takes a deal of mastery to make out what's said,and a deal of Wudsworth's was this sort, ye kna.  You could tell fra theman's faace his potry would niver have no laugh in it.  His potry wasquite different work from li'le Hartley.  Hartley 'ud goa running alongbeside o' the brooks and mak his, and goa in the first oppen door andwrite what he had got upo' paper.  But Wudsworth's potry was real hardstuff, and bided a deal of makking, and he'd keep it in his head for longenough.  Eh, but it's queer, mon, different ways folks hes of makingpotry now . . . Not but what Mr. Wudsworth didn't stand very high, andwas a well-spoken man enough.'  The best criticism on Wordsworth that Mr.Rawnsley heard was this: 'He was an open-air man, and a great critic oftrees.'There are many useful and well-written essays in Professor Knight'svolume, but Mr. Rawnsley's is far the most interesting of all.  It givesus a graphic picture of the poet as he appeared in outward semblance andmanner to those about whom he wrote.* * * * *Mary Myles is Mrs. Edmonds's first attempt at writing fiction.  Mrs.Edmonds is well known as an authority on modern Greek literature, and herstyle has often a very pleasant literary flavour, though in her dialoguesshe has not as yet quite grasped the difference between la langue parleeand la langue ecrite.  Her heroine is a sort of Nausicaa from Girton, whodevelops into the Pallas Athena of a provincial school.  She has her love-romance, like her Homeric prototype, and her Odysseus returns to her atthe close of the book.  It is a nice story.* * * * *Lady Dilke's Art in the Modern State is a book that cannot fail tointerest deeply every one who cares either for art or for history.  The'modern State' which gives its title to the book is that political andsocial organisation of our day that comes to us from the France ofRichelieu and Colbert, and is the direct outcome of the 'Grand Siecle,'the true greatness of which century, as Lady Dilke points out, consistsnot in its vain wars, and formal stage and stilted eloquence, and pompouspalaces, but in the formation and working out of the political and socialsystem of which these things were the first-fruits.  To the question thatnaturally rises on one's lips, 'How can one dwell on the art of theseventeenth century?--it has no charm,' Lady Dilke answers that this artpresents in its organisation, from the point of view of social polity,problems of the highest intellectual interest.  Throughout all itsphases--to quote her own words--'the life of France wears, during theseventeenth century, a political aspect.  The explanation of all changesin the social system, in letters, in the arts, in fashions even, has tobe sought in the necessities of the political position; and the seemingcaprices of taste take their rise from the same causes which went todetermine the making of a treaty or the promulgation of an edict.  Thisseems all the stranger because, in times preceding, letters and the arts,at least, appeared to flourish in conditions as far removed from theaction of statecraft as if they had been a growth of fairyland.  In theMiddle Ages they were devoted to a virgin image of Virtue; they framed,in the shade of the sanctuary, an ideal shining with the beauty born ofself-renunciation, of resignation to self-enforced conditions of moraland physical suffering.  By the queenly Venus of the Renaissance theywere consecrated to the joys of life, and the world saw that throughtheir perfect use men might renew their strength, and behold virtue andbeauty with clear eyes.  It was, however, reserved for the rulers ofFrance in the seventeenth century fully to realise the political functionof letters and the arts in the modern State, and their immense importancein connection with the prosperity of a commercial nation.'The whole subject is certainly extremely fascinating.  The Renaissancehad for its object the development of great personalities.  The perfectfreedom of the temperament in matters of art, the perfect freedom of theintellect in intellectual matters, the full development of theindividual, were the things it aimed at.  As we study its history we findit full of great anarchies.  It solved no political or social problems;it did not seek to solve them.  The ideal of the 'Grand Siecle,' and ofRichelieu, in whom the forces of that great age were incarnate, wasdifferent.  The ideas of citizenship, of the building up of a greatnation, of the centralisation of forces, of collective action, of ethnicunity of purpose, came before the world.  It was inevitable that theyshould have done so, and Lady Dilke, with her keen historic sense and herwonderful power of grouping facts, has told us the story of theirstruggle and their victory.  Her book is, from every point of view, amost remarkable work.  Her style is almost French in its clearness, itssobriety, its fine and, at times, ascetic simplicity.  The whole ground-plan and intellectual-conception is admirable.It is, of course, easy to see how much Art lost by having a new missionforced upon her.  The creation of a formal tradition upon classical linesis never without its danger, and it is sad to find the provincial townsof France, once so varied and individual in artistic expression, writingto Paris for designs and advice.  And yet, through Colbert's greatcentralising scheme of State supervision and State aid, France was theone country in Europe, and has remained the one country in Europe, wherethe arts are not divorced from industry.  The Academy of Painting andSculpture and the School of Architecture were not, to quote Lady Dilke'swords, called into being in order that royal palaces should be raisedsurpassing all others in magnificence:   Bievrebache and the Savonnerie were not established only that such   palaces should be furnished more sumptuously than those of an Eastern   fairy-tale.  Colbert did not care chiefly to inquire, when organising   art administration, what were the institutions best fitted to foster   the proper interests of art; he asked, in the first place, what would   most contribute to swell the national importance.  Even so, in   surrounding the King with the treasures of luxury, his object was   twofold--their possession should, indeed, illustrate the Crown, but   should also be a unique source of advantage to the people.   Glass-workers were brought from Venice, and lace-makers from Flanders,   that they might yield to France the secrets of their skill.  Palaces   and public buildings were to afford commissions for French artists,   and a means of technical and artistic education for all those employed   upon them.  The royal collections were but a further instrument in   educating the taste and increasing the knowledge of the working   classes.  The costly factories of the Savonnerie and the Gobelins were   practical schools, in which every detail of every branch of all those   industries which contribute to the furnishing and decoration of houses   were brought to perfection; whilst a band of chosen apprentices were   trained in the adjoining schools.  To Colbert is due the honour of   having foreseen, not only that the interests of the modern State were   inseparably bound up with those of industry, but also that the   interests of industry could not, without prejudice, be divorced from   art.Mr. Bret Harte has never written anything finer than Cressy.  It is oneof his most brilliant and masterly productions, and will take rank withthe best of his Californian stories.  Hawthorne re-created for us theAmerica of the past with the incomparable grace of a very perfect artist,but Mr. Bret Harte's emphasised modernity has, in its own sphere, wonequal, or almost equal, triumphs.  Wit, pathos, humour, realism,exaggeration, and romance are in this marvellous story all blendedtogether, and out of the very clash and chaos of these things comes lifeitself.  And what a curious life it is, half civilised and halfbarbarous, naive and corrupt, chivalrous and commonplace, real andimprobable!  Cressy herself is the most tantalising of heroines.  She isalways eluding one's grasp.  It is difficult to say whether shesacrifices herself on the altar of romance, or is merely a girl with anextraordinary sense of humour.  She is intangible, and the more we knowof her, the more incomprehensible she becomes.  It is pleasant to comeacross a heroine who is not identified with any great cause, andrepresents no important principle, but is simply a wonderful nymph fromAmerican backwoods, who has in her something of Artemis, and not a littleof Aphrodite.* * * * *It is always a pleasure to come across an American poet who is notnational, and who tries to give expression to the literature that heloves rather than to the land in which he lives.  The Muses care solittle for geography!  Mr. Richard Day's Poems have nothing distinctivelyAmerican about them.  Here and there in his verse one comes across aflower that does not bloom in our meadows, a bird to which our woodlandshave never listened.  But the spirit that animates the verse is simpleand human, and there is hardly a poem in the volume that English lipsmight not have uttered.  Sounds of the Temple has much in it that isinteresting in metre as well as in matter:--   Then sighed a poet from his soul:      'The clouds are blown across the stars,      And chill have grown my lattice bars;   I cannot keep my vigil whole   By the lone candle of my soul.   'This reed had once devoutest tongue,      And sang as if to its small throat      God listened for a perfect note;   As charily this lyre was strung:   God's praise is slow and has no tongue.'But the best poem is undoubtedly the Hymn to the Mountain:--   Within the hollow of thy hand--      This wooded dell half up the height,      Where streams take breath midway in flight--   Here let me stand.   Here warbles not a lowland bird,      Here are no babbling tongues of men;      Thy rivers rustling through the glen   Alone are heard.   Above no pinion cleaves its way,      Save when the eagle's wing, as now,      With sweep imperial shades thy brow   Beetling and grey.   What thoughts are thine, majestic peak?      And moods that were not born to chime      With poets' ineffectual rhyme   And numbers weak?   The green earth spreads thy gaze before,      And the unfailing skies are brought      Within the level of thy thought.   There is no more.   The stars salute thy rugged crown      With syllables of twinkling fire;      Like choral burst from distant choir,   Their psalm rolls down.   And I within this temple niche,      Like statue set where prophets talk,      Catch strains they murmur as they walk,   And I am rich.Miss Ella Curtis's A Game of Chance is certainly the best novel that thisclever young writer has as yet produced.  If it has a fault, it is thatit is crowded with too much incident, and often surrenders the study ofcharacter to the development of plot.  Indeed, it has many plots, each ofwhich, in more economical hands, would have served as the basis of acomplete story.  We have as the central incident the career of a cleverlady's-maid who personifies her mistress, and is welcomed by Sir JohnErskine, an English country gentleman, as the widow of his dead son.  Thereal husband of the adventuress tracks his wife to England, and claimsher.  She pretends that he is insane, and has him removed.  Then he triesto murder her, and when she recovers, she finds her beauty gone and hersecret discovered.  There is quite enough sensation here to interest eventhe jaded City man, who is said to have grown quite critical of late onthe subject of what is really a thrilling plot.  But Miss Curtis is notsatisfied.  The lady's-maid has an extremely handsome brother, who is awonderful musician, and has a divine tenor voice.  With him the statelyLady Judith falls wildly in love, and this part of the story is treatedwith a great deal of subtlety and clever analysis.  However, Lady Judithdoes not marry her rustic Orpheus, so the social convenances areundisturbed.  The romance of the Rector of the Parish, who falls in lovewith a charming school-teacher, is a good deal overshadowed by LadyJudith's story, but it is pleasantly told.  A more important episode isthe marriage between the daughter of the Tory squire and the Radicalcandidate for the borough.  They separate on their wedding-day, and arenot reconciled till the third volume.  No one could say that MissCurtis's book is dull.  In fact, her style is very bright and amusing.  Itis impossible, perhaps, not to be a little bewildered by the amount ofcharacters, and by the crowded incidents; but, on the whole, the schemeof the construction is clear, and certainly the decoration is admirable.(1) Wordsworthiana: A Selection from Papers read to the WordsworthSociety.

FROUDE'S BLUE-BOOK(Pall Mall Gazette, April 13, 1889.)Blue-books are generally dull reading, but Blue-books on Ireland havealways been interesting.  They form the record of one of the greattragedies of modern Europe.  In them England has written down herindictment against herself and has given to the world the history of hershame.  If in the last century she tried to govern Ireland with aninsolence that was intensified by race hatred and religious prejudice,she has sought to rule her in this century with a stupidity that isaggravated by good intentions.  The last of these Blue-books, Mr.Froude's heavy novel, has appeared, however, somewhat too late.  Thesociety that he describes has long since passed away.  An entirely newfactor has appeared in the social development of the country, and thisfactor is the Irish-American and his influence.  To mature its powers, toconcentrate its actions, to learn the secret of its own strength and ofEngland's weakness, the Celtic intellect has had to cross the Atlantic.At home it had but learned the pathetic weakness of nationality; in astrange land it realised what indomitable forces nationality possesses.What captivity was to the Jews, exile has been to the Irish.  America andAmerican influence has educated them.  Their first practical leader is anIrish-American.But while Mr. Froude's book has no practical relation to modern Irishpolitics, and does not offer any solution of the present question, it hasa certain historical value.  It is a vivid picture of Ireland in thelatter half of the eighteenth century, a picture often false in itslights and exaggerated in its shadows, but a picture none the less.  Mr.Froude admits the martyrdom of Ireland but regrets that the martyrdom wasnot more completely carried out.  His ground of complaint against theExecutioner is not his trade but his bungling.  It is the bluntness notthe cruelty of the sword that he objects to.  Resolute government, thatshallow shibboleth of those who do not understand how complex a thing theart of government is, is his posthumous panacea for past evils.  Hishero, Colonel Goring, has the words Law and Order ever on his lips,meaning by the one the enforcement of unjust legislation, and implying bythe other the suppression of every fine national aspiration.  That thegovernment should enforce iniquity and the governed submit to it, seemsto Mr. Froude, as it certainly is to many others, the true ideal ofpolitical science.  Like most penmen he overrates the power of the sword.Where England has had to struggle she has been wise.  Where physicalstrength has been on her side, as in Ireland, she has been made unwieldyby that strength.  Her own strong hands have blinded her.  She has hadforce but no direction.There is, of course, a story in Mr. Froude's novel.  It is not simply apolitical disquisition.  The interest of the tale, such as it is, centresround two men, Colonel Goring and Morty Sullivan, the Cromwellian and theCelt.  These men are enemies by race and creed and feeling.  The firstrepresents Mr. Froude's cure for Ireland.  He is a resolute 'Englishman,with strong Nonconformist tendencies,' who plants an industrial colony onthe coast of Kerry, and has deep-rooted objections to that illicit tradewith France which in the last century was the sole method by which theIrish people were enabled to pay their rents to their absentee landlords.Colonel Goring bitterly regrets that the Penal Laws against the Catholicsare not rigorously carried out.  He is a '_Police_ at any price' man.   'And this,' said Goring scornfully, 'is what you call governing   Ireland, hanging up your law like a scarecrow in the garden till every   sparrow has learnt to make a jest of it.  Your Popery Acts!  Well, you   borrowed them from France.  The French Catholics did not choose to   keep the Hugonots among them, and recalled the Edict of Nantes.  As   they treated the Hugonots, so you said to all the world that you would   treat the Papists.  You borrowed from the French the very language of   your Statute, but they are not afraid to stand by their law, and you   are afraid to stand by yours.  You let the people laugh at it, and in   teaching them to despise one law, you teach them to despise all   laws--God's and man's alike.  I cannot say how it will end; but I can   tell you this, that you are training up a race with the education   which you are giving them that will astonish mankind by and bye.'Mr. Froude's resume of the history of Ireland is not without power thoughit is far from being really accurate.  'The Irish,' he tells us, 'haddisowned the facts of life, and the facts of life had proved thestrongest.'  The English, unable to tolerate anarchy so near theirshores, 'consulted the Pope.  The Pope gave them leave to interfere, andthe Pope had the best of the bargain.  For the English brought him in,and the Irish . . . kept him there.'  England's first settlers wereNorman nobles.  They became more Irish than the Irish, and England foundherself in this difficulty: 'To abandon Ireland would be discreditable,to rule it as a province would be contrary to English traditions.'  Shethen 'tried to rule by dividing,' and failed.  The Pope was too strongfor her.  At last she made her great political discovery.  What Irelandwanted was evidently an entirely new population 'of the same race and thesame religion as her own.'  The new policy was partly carried out:   Elizabeth first and then James and then Cromwell replanted the Island,   introducing English, Scots, Hugonots, Flemings, Dutch, tens of   thousands of families of vigorous and earnest Protestants, who brought   their industries along with them.  Twice the Irish . . . tried . . .   to drive out this new element . . .  They failed. . . . [But] England   . . . had no sooner accomplished her long task than she set herself to   work to spoil it again.  She destroyed the industries of her colonists   by her trade laws.  She set the Bishops to rob them of their religion.   . . . [As for the gentry,] The purpose for which they had been   introduced into Ireland was unfulfilled.  They were but alien   intruders, who did nothing, who were allowed to do nothing.  The time   would come when an exasperated population would demand that the land   should be given back to them, and England would then, perhaps, throw   the gentry to the wolves, in the hope of a momentary peace.  But her   own turn would follow.  She would be face to face with the old   problem, either to make a new conquest or to retire with disgrace.Political disquisitions of this kind, and prophecies after the event, arefound all through Mr. Froude's book, and on almost every second page wecome across aphorisms on the Irish character, on the teachings of Irishhistory and on the nature of England's mode of government.  Some of themrepresent Mr. Froude's own views, others are entirely dramatic andintroduced for the purpose of characterisation.  We append somespecimens.  As epigrams they are not very felicitous, but they areinteresting from some points of view.   Irish Society grew up in happy recklessness.  Insecurity added zest to   enjoyment.   We Irish must either laugh or cry, and if we went in for crying, we   should all hang ourselves.   Too close a union with the Irish had produced degeneracy both of   character and creed in all the settlements of English.   We age quickly in Ireland with the whiskey and the broken heads.   The Irish leaders cannot fight.  They can make the country   ungovernable, and keep an English army occupied in watching them.   No nation can ever achieve a liberty that will not be a curse to them,   except by arms in the field.   [The Irish] are taught from their cradles that English rule is the   cause of all their miseries.  They were as ill off under their own   chiefs; but they would bear from their natural leaders what they will   not bear from us, and if we have not made their lot more wretched we   have not made it any better.   'Patriotism?  Yes!  Patriotism of the Hibernian order.  The country   has been badly treated, and is poor and miserable.  This is the   patriot's stock in trade.  Does he want it mended?  Not he.  His own   occupation would be gone.'   Irish corruption is the twin-brother of Irish eloquence.   England will not let us break the heads of our scoundrels; she will   not break them herself; we are a free country, and must take the   consequences.   The functions of the Anglo-Irish Government were to do what ought not   to be done, and to leave undone what ought to be done.   The Irish race have always been noisy, useless and ineffectual.  They   have produced nothing, they have done nothing, which it is possible to   admire.  What they are, that they have always been, and the only hope   for them is that their ridiculous Irish nationality should be buried   and forgotten.   The Irish are the best actors in the world.   Order is an exotic in Ireland.  It has been imported from England, but   it will not grow.  It suits neither soil, nor climate.  If the English   wanted order in Ireland, they should have left none of us alive.   When ruling powers are unjust, nature reasserts her rights.   Even anarchy has its advantages.   Nature keeps an accurate account. . . .  The longer a bill is left   unpaid, the heavier the accumulation of interest.   You cannot live in Ireland without breaking laws on one side or   another.  Pecca fortiter, therefore, as . . .  Luther said.   The animal spirits of the Irish remained when all else was gone, and   if there was no purpose in their lives, they could at least enjoy   themselves.   The Irish peasants can make the country hot for the Protestant   gentleman, but that is all they are fit for.As we said before, if Mr. Froude intended his book to help the ToryGovernment to solve the Irish question he has entirely missed his aim.The Ireland of which he writes has disappeared.  As a record, however, ofthe incapacity of a Teutonic to rule a Celtic people against their ownwish, his book is not without value.  It is dull, but dull books are verypopular at present; and as people have grown a little tired of talkingabout Robert Elsmere, they will probably take to discussing The TwoChiefs of Dunboy.  There are some who will welcome with delight the ideaof solving the Irish question by doing away with the Irish people.  Thereare others who will remember that Ireland has extended her boundaries,and that we have now to reckon with her not merely in the Old World butin the New.The Two Chiefs of Dunboy: or An Irish Romance of the Last Century.  By J.A. Froude.  (Longmans, Green and Co.)SOME LITERARY NOTES--V(Woman's World, May 1889.)Miss Caroline Fitz Gerald's volume of poems, Venetia Victrix, isdedicated to Mr. Robert Browning, and in the poem that gives its title tothe book it is not difficult to see traces of Mr. Browning's influence.Venetia Victrix is a powerful psychological study of a man's soul, avivid presentation of a terrible, fiery-coloured moment in a marred andincomplete life.  It is sometimes complex and intricate in expression,but then the subject itself is intricate and complex.  Plastic simplicityof outline may render for us the visible aspect of life; it is differentwhen we come to deal with those secrets which self-consciousness alonecontains, and which self-consciousness itself can but half reveal.  Actiontakes place in the sunlight, but the soul works in the dark.There is something curiously interesting in the marked tendency of modernpoetry to become obscure.  Many critics, writing with their eyes fixed onthe masterpieces of past literature, have ascribed this tendency towilfulness and to affectation.  Its origin is rather to be found in thecomplexity of the new problems, and in the fact that self-consciousnessis not yet adequate to explain the contents of the Ego.  In Mr.Browning's poems, as in life itself which has suggested, or rathernecessitated, the new method, thought seems to proceed not on logicallines, but on lines of passion.  The unity of the individual is beingexpressed through its inconsistencies and its contradictions.  In astrange twilight man is seeking for himself, and when he has found hisown image, he cannot understand it.  Objective forms of art, such assculpture and the drama, sufficed one for the perfect presentation oflife; they can no longer so suffice.The central motive of Miss Caroline Fitz Gerald's psychological poem isthe study of a man who to do a noble action wrecks his own soul, sells itto evil, and to the spirit of evil.  Many martyrs have for a great causesacrificed their physical life; the sacrifice of the spiritual life has amore poignant and a more tragic note.  The story is supposed to be toldby a French doctor, sitting at his window in Paris one evening:   How far off Venice seems to-night!  How dim   The still-remembered sunsets, with the rim   Of gold round the stone haloes, where they stand,   Those carven saints, and look towards the land,   Right Westward, perched on high, with palm in hand,   Completing the peaked church-front.  Oh how clear   And dark against the evening splendour!  Steer   Between the graveyard island and the quay,   Where North-winds dash the spray on Venice;--see   The rosy light behind dark dome and tower,   Or gaunt smoke-laden chimney;--mark the power   Of Nature's gentleness, in rise or fall   Of interlinked beauty, to recall   Earth's majesty in desecration's place,   Lending yon grimy pile that dream-like face   Of evening beauty;--note yon rugged cloud,   Red-rimmed and heavy, drooping like a shroud   Over Murano in the dying day.   I see it now as then--so far away!The face of a boy in the street catches his eye.  He seems to see in itsome likeness to a dead friend.  He begins to think, and at lastremembers a hospital ward in Venice:      'Twas an April day,   The year Napoleon's troops took Venice--say   The twenty-fifth of April.  All alone   Walking the ward, I heard a sick man moan,   In tones so piteous, as his heart would break:   'Lost, lost, and lost again--for Venice' sake!'   I turned.  There lay a man no longer young,   Wasted with fever.  I had marked, none hung   About his bed, as friends, with tenderness,   And, when the priest went by, he spared to bless,   Glancing perplexed--perhaps mere sullenness.   I stopped and questioned: 'What is lost, my friend?'   'My soul is lost, and now draws near the end.   My soul is surely lost.  Send me no priest!   They sing and solemnise the marriage feast   Of man's salvation in the house of love,   And I in Hell, and God in Heaven above,   And Venice safe and fair on earth between--   No love of mine--mere service--for my Queen.'He was a seaman, and the tale he tells the doctor before he dies isstrange and not a little terrible.  Wild rage against a foster-brotherwho had bitterly wronged him, and who was one of the ten rulers overVenice, drives him to make a mad oath that on the day when he doesanything for his country's good he will give his soul to Satan.  Thatnight he sails for Dalmatia, and as he is keeping the watch, he sees aphantom boat with seven fiends sailing to Venice:   I heard the fiends' shrill cry: 'For Venice' good!   Rival thine ancient foe in gratitude,   Then come and make thy home with us in Hell!'   I knew it must be so.  I knew the spell   Of Satan on my soul.  I felt the power   Granted by God to serve Him one last hour,   Then fall for ever as the curse had wrought.   I climbed aloft.  My brain had grown one thought,   One hope, one purpose.  And I heard the hiss   Of raging disappointment, loth to miss   Its prey--I heard the lapping of the flame,   That through the blanched figures went and came,   Darting in frenzy to the devils' yell.   I set that cross on high, and cried: 'To Hell   My soul for ever, and my deed to God!   Once Venice guarded safe, let this vile clod   Drift where fate will.'         And then (the hideous laugh   Of fiends in full possession, keen to quaff   The wine of one new soul not weak with tears,   Pealing like ruinous thunder in mine ears)   I fell, and heard no more.  The pale day broke   Through lazar-windows, when once more I woke,   Remembering I might no more dare to pray.The idea of the story is extremely powerful, and Venetia Victrix iscertainly the best poem in the volume--better than Ophelion, which isvague, and than A Friar's Story, which is pretty but ordinary.  It showsthat we have in Miss Fitz Gerald a new singer of considerable ability andvigour of mind, and it serves to remind us of the splendid dramaticpossibilities extant in life, which are ready for poetry, and unsuitablefor the stage.  What is really dramatic is not necessarily that which isfitting for presentation in a theatre.  The theatre is an accident of thedramatic form.  It is not essential to it.  We have been deluded by thename of action.  To think is to act.Of the shorter poems collected here, this Hymn to Persephone is, perhaps,the best:   Oh, fill my cup, Persephone,      With dim red wine of Spring,         And drop therein a faded leaf         Plucked from the Autumn's bearded sheaf,   Whence, dread one, I may quaff to thee,      While all the woodlands ring.   Oh, fill my heart, Persephone,      With thine immortal pain,         That lingers round the willow bowers         In memories of old happy hours,   When thou didst wander fair and free      O'er Enna's blooming plain.   Oh, fill my soul, Persephone,      With music all thine own!         Teach me some song thy childhood knew,         Lisped in the meadow's morning dew,   Or chant on this high windy lea,      Thy godhead's ceaseless moan.But this Venetian Song also has a good deal of charm:   Leaning between carved stone and stone,      As glossy birds peer from a nest      Scooped in the crumbling trunk where rest   Their freckled eggs, I pause alone         And linger in the light awhile,            Waiting for joy to come to me--         Only the dawn beyond yon isle,            Only the sunlight on the sea.   I gaze--then turn and ply my loom,      Or broider blossoms close beside;      The morning world lies warm and wide,   But here is dim, cool silent gloom,         Gold crust and crimson velvet pile,            And not one face to smile on me--         Only the dawn beyond yon isle,            Only the sunlight on the sea.   Over the world the splendours break      Of morning light and noontide glow,      And when the broad red sun sinks low,   And in the wave long shadows shake,         Youths, maidens, glad with song and wile,            Glide and are gone, and leave with me         Only the dawn beyond yon isle,            Only the sunlight on the sea.Darwinism and Politics, by Mr. David Ritchie, of Jesus College, Oxford,contains some very interesting speculations on the position and thefuture of women in the modern State.  The one objection to the equalityof the sexes that he considers deserves serious attention is that made bySir James Stephen in his clever attack on John Stuart Mill.  Sir JamesStephen points out in Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, that women maysuffer more than they have done, if plunged into a nominally equal butreally unequal contest in the already overcrowded labour market.  Mr.Ritchie answers that, while the conclusion usually drawn from thisargument is a sentimental reaction in favour of the old family ideal, as,for instance, in Mr. Besant's books, there is another alternative, andthat is the resettling of the labour question.  'The elevation of thestatus of women and the regulation of the conditions of labour areultimately,' he says, 'inseparable questions.  On the basis ofindividualism, I cannot see how it is possible to answer the objectionsof Sir James Stephen.'  Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his Sociology, expresseshis fear that women, if admitted now to political life, might do mischiefby introducing the ethics of the family into the State.  'Under theethics of the family the greatest benefits must be given where the meritsare smallest; under the ethics of the State the benefits must beproportioned to the merits.'  In answer to this, Mr. Ritchie asks whetherin any society we have ever seen people so get benefits in proportion totheir merits, and protests against Mr. Spencer's separation of the ethicsof the family from those of the State.  If something is right in afamily, it is difficult to see why it is therefore, without any furtherreason, wrong in the State.  If the participation of women in politicsmeans that as a good family educates all its members, so must a goodState, what better issue could there be?  The family ideal of the Statemay be difficult of attainment, but as an ideal it is better than thepoliceman theory.  It would mean the moralisation of politics.  Thecultivation of separate sorts of virtues and separate ideals of duty inmen and women has led to the whole social fabric being weaker andunhealthier than it need be.  As for the objection that in countrieswhere it is considered necessary to have compulsory military service forall men, it would be unjust and inexpedient that women should have avoice in political matters, Mr. Ritchie meets it, or tries to meet it, byproposing that all women physically fitted for such purpose should becompelled to undergo training as nurses, and should be liable to becalled upon to serve as nurses in time of war.  This training, heremarks, 'would be more useful to them and to the community in time ofpeace than his military training is to the peasant or artisan.'  Mr.Ritchie's little book is extremely suggestive, and full of valuable ideasfor the philosophic student of sociology.* * * * *Mr. Alan Cole's lecture on Irish lace, delivered recently before theSociety of Arts, contains some extremely useful suggestions as to thebest method of securing an immediate connection between the art schoolsof a country and the country's ordinary manufactures.  In 1883, Mr. Colewas deputed by the Department of Science and Art to lecture at Cork andat Limerick on the subject of lace-making, and to give a history of itsrise and development in other countries, as well as a review of the manykinds of ornamental patterns used from the sixteenth century to moderntimes.  In order to make these lectures of practical value, Mr. Coleplaced typical specimens of Irish laces beside Italian, Flemish, andFrench laces, which seem to be the prototypes of the lace of Ireland.  Thepublic interest was immediately aroused.  Some of the newspapers stoutlymaintained that the ornament and patterns of Irish lace were of such anational character that it was wrong to asperse them on that score.Others took a different view, and came to the conclusion that Irish lacecould be vastly improved in all respects, if some systematic action couldbe taken to induce the lace-makers to work from more intelligentlycomposed patterns than those in general use.  There was a consensus ofopinion that the workmanship of Irish laces was good, and that it couldbe applied to better materials than those ordinarily used, and that itsmethods were suited to render a greater variety of patterns than thoseusually attempted.These and other circumstances seem to have prompted the promoters of theCork Exhibition to further efforts in the cause of lace-making.  Towardsthe close of the year 1883 they made fresh representations to Government,and inquired what forms of State assistance could be given.  A number ofconvents in the neighbourhood of Cork was engaged in giving instructionto children under their care in lace and crochet making.  At some, roomswere allotted for the use of grown-up workers who made laces under thesupervision of the nuns.  These convents obviously were centres whereexperiments in reform could be tried.  The convents, however, lackedinstruction in the designing of patterns for laces.  An excellent Schoolof Art was at work at Cork, but the students there had not beeninstructed in specially designing for lace.  If the convents with theirworkrooms could be brought into relation with this School of Art, itseemed possible that something of a serious character might be done tobenefit lace-makers, and also to open up a new field in ornamental designfor the students at the School of Art.  The rules of the Department ofScience and Art were found to be adapted to aid in meeting such wants asthose sketched out by the promoters at Cork.  As the nuns in thedifferent lace-making convents had not been able to attend in Cork tohear Mr. Cole's lectures, they asked that he should visit them and repeatthem at the convents.  This Mr. Cole did early in 1884, the masters ofthe local Schools of Art accompanying him on his visits.  Negotiationswere forthwith opened for connecting the convents with the art schools.By the end of 1885 some six or seven different lace-making convents hadplaced themselves in connection with Schools of Art at Cork andWaterford.  These convents were attended not only by the nuns but byoutside pupils also; and, at the request of the convents, Mr. Cole hasvisited them twice a year, lecturing and giving advice upon designs forlace.  The composition of new patterns for lace was attempted, and oldpatterns which had degenerated were revised and redrawn for the use ofthe workers connected with the convents.  There are now twelve convents,Mr. Cole tells us, where instruction in drawing and in the composition ofpatterns is given, and some of the students have won some of the higherprizes offered by the Department of Science and Art for designing lace-patterns.The Cork School of Art then acquired a collection of finely-patterned oldlaces, selections from which are freely circulated through the differentconvents connected with that school.  They have also the privilege ofborrowing similar specimens of old lace from the South Kensington Museum.So successful has been the system of education pursued by Mr. Brennan,the head-master of the Cork School of Art, that two female students ofhis school last year gained the gold and silver medals for their designsfor laces and crochets at the national competition which annually takesplace in London between all the Schools of Art in the United Kingdom.  Asfor the many lace-makers who were not connected either with the conventsor with the art schools, in order to assist them, a committee of ladiesand gentlemen interested in Irish lace-making raised subscriptions, andoffered prizes to be competed for by designers generally.  The bestdesigns were then placed out with lace-makers, and carried intoexecution.  It is, of course, often said that the proper person to makethe design is the lace-maker.  Mr. Cole, however, points out that fromthe sixteenth century forward the patterns for ornamental laces havealways been designed by decorative artists having knowledge of thecomposition of ornament, and of the materials for which they were calledupon to design.  Lace pattern books were published in considerablequantity in Italy, France and Germany during the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries, and from these the lace-makers worked.  Many lace-makers would, no doubt, derive benefit from practice in drawing, indiscriminating between well and badly shaped forms.  But the skill theyare primarily required to show and to develop is one of fine fingers inreproducing beautiful forms in threads.  The conception, arrangement, anddrawing of beautiful forms for a design, have to be undertaken bydecorative artists acquainted with the limitations of those materials andmethods which the ultimate expression of the design involves.This lovely Irish art of lace-making is very much indebted to Mr. Cole,who has really re-created it, given it new life, and shown it the trueartistic lines on which to progress.  Hardly 20,000 pounds a year isspent by England upon Irish laces, and almost all of this goes upon thecheaper and commoner kinds.  And yet, as Mr. Cole points out, it ispossible to produce Irish laces of as high artistic quality as almost anyforeign laces.  The Queen, Lady Londonderry, Lady Dorothy Nevill, Mrs.Alfred Morrison, and others, have done much to encourage the Irishworkers, and it rests largely with the ladies of England whether thisbeautiful art lives or dies.  The real good of a piece of lace, says Mr.Ruskin, is 'that it should show, first, that the designer of it had apretty fancy; next, that the maker of it had fine fingers; lastly, thatthe wearer of it has worthiness or dignity enough to obtain what isdifficult to obtain, and common-sense enough not to wear it on alloccasions.'* * * * *The High-Caste Hindu Woman is an interesting book.  It is from the pen ofthe Pundita Ramabai Sarasvati, and the introduction is written by MissRachel Bodley, M.D., the Dean of the Woman's Medical College ofPennsylvania.  The story of the parentage of this learned lady is verycurious.  A certain Hindu, being on a religious pilgrimage with hisfamily, which consisted of his wife and two daughters, one nine and theother seven years of age, stopped in a town to rest for a day or two.  Onemorning the Hindu was bathing in the sacred river Godavari, near thetown, when he saw a fine-looking man coming there to bathe also.  Afterthe ablution and the morning prayers were over, the father inquired ofthe stranger who he was and whence he came.  On learning his caste, andclan, and dwelling-place, and also that he was a widower, he offered himhis little daughter of nine in marriage.  All things were settled in anhour or so; next day the marriage was concluded, and the little girlplaced in the possession of the stranger, who took her nearly ninehundred miles away from her home, and gave her into the charge of hismother.  The stranger was the learned Ananta Shastri, a Brahman pundit,who had very advanced views on the subject of woman's education, and hedetermined that he would teach his girl-wife Sanskrit, and give her theintellectual culture that had been always denied to women in India.  Theirdaughter was the Pundita Ramabai, who, after the death of her parents,travelled all over India advocating the cause of female education, and towhom seems to be due the first suggestion for the establishment of theprofession of women doctors.  In 1866, Miss Mary Carpenter made a shorttour in India for the purpose of finding out some way by which women'scondition in that country might be improved.  She at once discovered thatthe chief means by which the desired end could be accomplished was byfurnishing women teachers for the Hindu Zenanas.  She suggested that theBritish Government should establish normal schools for training womenteachers, and that scholarships should be awarded to girls in order toprolong their school-going period, and to assist indigent women who wouldotherwise be unable to pursue their studies.In response to Miss Carpenter's appeal, upon her return to England, theEnglish Government founded several schools for women in India, and a few'Mary Carpenter Scholarships' were endowed by benevolent persons.  Theseschools were open to women of every caste; but while they haveundoubtedly been of use, they have not realised the hopes of theirfounders, chiefly through the impossibility of keeping caste rules inthem.  Ramabai, in a very eloquent chapter, proposes to solve the problemin a different way.  Her suggestion is that houses should be opened forthe young and high-caste child-widows, where they can take shelterwithout the fear of losing their caste, or of being disturbed in theirreligious belief, and where they may have entire freedom of action asregards caste rules.  The whole account given by the Pundita of the lifeof the high-caste Hindu lady is full of suggestion for the socialreformer and the student of progress, and her book, which is wonderfullywell written, is likely to produce a radical change in the educationalschemes that at present prevail in India.(1) Venetia Victrix.

She belongs to the school of BulwerLytton and George Sand, though she may lack the learning of the one andthe sincerity of the other.  She tries to make passion, imagination, andpoetry part of fiction.  She still believes in heroes and in heroines.She is florid and fervent and fanciful.  Yet even she, the high priestessof the impossible, is affected by her age.  Her last book, Guilderoy asshe calls it, is an elaborate psychological study of modern temperaments.For her, it is realistic, and she has certainly caught much of the toneand temper of the society of our day.  Her people move with ease andgrace and indolence.  The book may be described as a study of the peeragefrom a poetical point of view.  Those who are tired of mediocre youngcurates who have doubts, of serious young ladies who have missions, andof the ordinary figureheads of most of the English fiction of our time,might turn with pleasure, if not with profit, to this amazing romance.  Itis a resplendent picture of our aristocracy.  No expense has been sparedin gilding.  For the comparatively small sum of 1 pound, 11s. 6d. one isintroduced to the best society.  The central figures are exaggerated, butthe background is admirable.  In spite of everything, it gives one asense of something like life.What is the story?  Well, we must admit that we have a faint suspicionthat Ouida has told it to us before.  Lord Guilderoy, 'whose name was asold as the days of Knut,' falls madly in love, or fancies that he fallsmadly in love, with a rustic Perdita, a provincial Artemis who has 'aGainsborough face, with wide-opened questioning eyes and tumbled auburnhair.'  She is poor but well-born, being the only child of Mr. Vernon ofLlanarth, a curious recluse, who is half a pedant and half Don Quixote.Guilderoy marries her and, tiring of her shyness, her lack of power toexpress herself, her want of knowledge of fashionable life, returns to anold passion for a wonderful creature called the Duchess of Soria.  LadyGuilderoy becomes ice; the Duchess becomes fire; at the end of the bookGuilderoy is a pitiable object.  He has to submit to be forgiven by onewoman, and to endure to be forgotten by the other.  He is thoroughlyweak, thoroughly worthless, and the most fascinating person in the wholestory.  Then there is his sister Lady Sunbury, who is very anxious forGuilderoy to marry, and is quite determined to hate his wife.  She isreally a capital sketch.  Ouida describes her as 'one of those admirablyvirtuous women who are more likely to turn men away from the paths ofvirtue than the wickedest of sirens.'  She irritates herself, alienatesher children, and infuriates her husband:   'You are perfectly right; I know you are always right; I admit you   are; but it is just that which makes you so damnably odious!' said   Lord Sunbury once, in a burst of rage, in his town house, speaking in   such stentorian tones that the people passing up Grosvenor Street   looked up at his open windows, and a crossing-sweeper said to a match-   seller, 'My eye! ain't he giving it to the old gal like blazes.'The noblest character in the book is Lord Aubrey.  As he is not a geniushe, naturally, behaves admirably on every occasion.  He begins by pityingthe neglected Lady Guilderoy, and ends by loving her, but he makes thegreat renunciation with considerable effect, and, having induced LadyGuilderoy to receive back her husband, he accepts 'a distant and arduousViceroyalty.'  He is Ouida's ideal of the true politician, for Ouida hasapparently taken to the study of English politics.  A great deal of herbook is devoted to political disquisitions.  She believes that the properrulers of a country like ours are the aristocrats.  Oligarchy has greatfascinations for her.  She thinks meanly of the people and adores theHouse of Lords and Lord Salisbury.  Here are some of her views.  We willnot call them ideas:   The House of Lords wants nothing of the nation, and therefore it is   the only candid and disinterested guardian of the people's needs and   resources.  It has never withstood the real desire of the country: it   has only stood between the country and its impetuous and evanescent   follies.   A democracy cannot understand honour; how should it?  The Caucus is   chiefly made up of men who sand their sugar, put alum in their bread,   forge bayonets and girders which bend like willow-wands, send bad   calico to India, and insure vessels at Lloyd's which they know will go   to the bottom before they have been ten days at sea.   Lord Salisbury has often been accused of arrogance; people have never   seen that what they mistook for arrogance was the natural, candid   consciousness of a great noble that he is more capable of leading the   country than most men composing it would be.   Democracy, after having made everything supremely hideous and   uncomfortable for everybody, always ends by clinging to the coat tails   of some successful general.   The prosperous politician may be honest, but his honesty is at best a   questionable quality.  The moment that a thing is a metier, it is   wholly absurd to talk about any disinterestedness in the pursuit of   it.  To the professional politician national affairs are a manufacture   into which he puts his audacity and his time, and out of which he   expects to make so much percentage for his lifetime.   There is too great a tendency to govern the world by noise.Ouida's aphorisms on women, love, and modern society are somewhat morecharacteristic:   Women speak as though the heart were to be treated at will like a   stone, or a bath.   Half the passions of men die early, because they are expected to be   eternal.   It is the folly of life that lends charm to it.   What is the cause of half the misery of women?  That their love is so   much more tenacious than the man's: it grows stronger as his grows   weaker.   To endure the country in England for long, one must have the rusticity   of Wordsworth's mind, and boots and stockings as homely.   It is because men feel the necessity to explain that they drop into   the habit of saying what is not true.  Wise is the woman who never   insists on an explanation.   Love can make its own world in a solitude a deux, but marriage cannot.   Nominally monogamous, all cultured society is polygamous; often even   polyandrous.   Moralists say that a soul should resist passion.  They might as well   say that a house should resist an earthquake.   The whole world is just now on its knees before the poorer classes:   all the cardinal virtues are taken for granted in them, and it is only   property of any kind which is the sinner.   Men are not merciful to women's tears as a rule; and when it is a   woman belonging to them who weeps, they only go out, and slam the door   behind them.   Men always consider women unjust to them, when they fail to deify   their weaknesses.   No passion, once broken, will ever bear renewal.   Feeling loses its force and its delicacy if we put it under the   microscope too often.   Anything which is not flattery seems injustice to a woman.   When society is aware that you think it a flock of geese, it revenges   itself by hissing loudly behind your back.Of descriptions of scenery and art we have, of course, a large number,and it is impossible not to recognise the touch of the real Ouida mannerin the following:   It was an old palace: lofty, spacious, magnificent, and dull.  Busts   of dusky yellow marble, weird bronzes stretching out gaunt arms into   the darkness, ivories brown with age, worn brocades with gold threads   gleaming in them, and tapestries with strange and pallid figures of   dead gods, were all half revealed and half obscured in the twilight.   As he moved through them, a figure which looked almost as pale as the   Adonis of the tapestry and was erect and motionless like the statue of   the wounded Love, came before his sight out of the darkness.  It was   that of Gladys.It is a manner full of exaggeration and overemphasis, but with someremarkable rhetorical qualities and a good deal of colour.  Ouida is fondof airing a smattering of culture, but she has a certain intrinsicinsight into things and, though she is rarely true, she is never dull.Guilderoy, with all its faults, which are great, and its absurdities,which are greater, is a book to be read.Guilderoy.  By Ouida.  (Chatto and Windus.)SOME LITERARY NOTES--VI(Woman's World, June 1889.)A writer in the Quarterly Review for January 1874 says:   No literary event since the war has excited anything like such a   sensation in Paris as the publication of the Lettres a une Inconnue.   Even politics became a secondary consideration for the hour, and   academicians or deputies of opposite parties might be seen eagerly   accosting each other in the Chamber or the street to inquire who this   fascinating and perplexing 'unknown' could be.  The statement in the   Revue des Deux Mondes that she was an Englishwoman, moving in   brilliant society, was not supported by evidence; and M. Blanchard,   the painter, from whom the publisher received the manuscripts, died   most provokingly at the very commencement of the inquiry, and made no   sign.  Some intimate friends of Merimee, rendered incredulous by   wounded self-love at not having been admitted to his confidence,   insisted that there was no secret to tell; their hypothesis being that   the Inconnue was a myth, and the letters a romance, with which some   petty details of actual life had been interwoven to keep up the   mystification.But an artist like Merimee would not have left his work in so unformed astate, so defaced by repetitions, or with such a want of proportionbetween the parts.  The Inconnue was undoubtedly a real person, and herletters in answer to those of Merimee have just been published by Messrs.Macmillan under the title of An Author's Love.Her letters?  Well, they are such letters as she might have written.  'Bythe tideless sea at Cannes on a summer day,' says their anonymous author,'I had fallen asleep, and the plashing of the waves upon the shore haddoubtless made me dream.  When I awoke the yellow paper-covered volumesof Prosper Merimee's Lettres a une Inconnue lay beside me; I had beenreading the book before I fell asleep, but the answers--had they everbeen written, or had I only dreamed?'  The invention of the love-lettersof a curious and unknown personality, the heroine of one of the greatliterary flirtations of our age, was a clever idea, and certainly theauthor has carried out his scheme with wonderful success; with suchsuccess indeed that it is said that one of our statesmen, whose nameoccurs more than once in the volume, was for a moment completely taken inby what is really a jeu-d'esprit, the first serious joke perpetrated byMessrs. Macmillan in their publishing capacity.  Perhaps it is too muchto call it a joke.  It is a fine, delicate piece of fiction, animaginative attempt to complete a real romance.  As we had the letters ofthe academic Romeo, it was obviously right that we should pretend we hadthe answers of the clever and somewhat mondaine Juliet.  Or is it Julietherself, in her little Paris boudoir, looking over these two volumes witha sad, cynical smile?  Well, to be put into fiction is always a tributeto one's reality.As for extracts from these fascinating forgeries, the letters should beread in conjunction with those of Merimee himself.  It is difficult tojudge of them by samples.  We find the Inconnue first in London, probablyin 1840.   Little (she writes) can you imagine the storm of indignation you   aroused in me by your remark that your feelings for me were those   suitable for a fourteen-year-old niece.  Merci.  Anything less like a   respectable uncle than yourself I cannot well imagine.  The role would   never suit you, believe me, so do not try it.   Now in return for your story of the phlegmatic musical animal who   called forth such stormy devotion in a female breast, and who, himself   cold and indifferent, was loved to the extent of a watery grave being   sought by his inamorata as solace for his indifference, let _me_ ask   the question why the women who torment men with their uncertain   tempers, drive them wild with jealousy, laugh contemptuously at their   humble entreaties, and fling their money to the winds, have twice the   hold upon their affections that the patient, long-suffering, domestic,   frugal Griseldas have, whose existences are one long penance of   unsuccessful efforts to please?  Answer this comprehensively, and you   will have solved a riddle which has puzzled women since Eve asked   questions in Paradise.Later on she writes:   Why should all natures be alike?  It would make the old saws useless   if they were, and deprive us of one of the truest of them all,   'Variety is the spice of life.'  How terribly monotonous it would be   if all the flowers were roses, every woman a queen, and each man a   philosopher.  My private opinion is that it takes at least six men   such as one meets every day to make one really valuable one.  I like   so many men for one particular quality which they possess, and so few   men for all.  Comprenez-vous?In another place:   Is it not a trifle dangerous, this experiment we are trying of a   friendship in pen and ink and paper?  A letter.  What thing on earth   more dangerous to confide in?  Written at blood heat, it may reach its   destination when the recipient's mental thermometer counts zero, and   the burning words and thrilling sentences may turn to ice and be   congealed as they are read. . . .  A letter; the most uncertain thing   in a world of uncertainties, the best or the worst thing devised by   mortals.Again:   Surely it was for you, mon cher, that the description given of a   friend of mine was originally intended.  He is a trifle cynical, this   friend, and decidedly pessimistic, and of him it was reported that he   never believed in anything until he saw it, and then he was convinced   that it was an optical illusion.  The accuracy of the description   struck me.They seem to have loved each other best when they were parted.   I think I cannot bear it much longer, this incessant quarrelling when   we meet, and your unkindness during the short time that you are with   me.  Why not let it all end? it would be better for both of us.  I do   not love you less when I write these words; if you could know the   sadness which they echo in my heart you would believe this.  No, I   think I love you more, but I cannot understand you.  As you have often   said, our natures must be very different, entirely different; if so,   what is this curious bond between them?  To me you seem possessed with   some strange restlessness and morbid melancholy which utterly spoils   your life, and in return you never see me without overwhelming me with   reproaches, if not for one thing, for another.  I tell you I cannot,   will not, bear it longer.  If you love me, then in God's name cease   tormenting me as well as yourself with these wretched doubts and   questionings and complaints.  I have been ill, seriously ill, and   there is nothing to account for my illness save the misery of this   apparently hopeless state of things existing between us.  You have   made me weep bitter tears of alternate self-reproach and indignation,   and finally of complete miserable bewilderment as to this unhappy   condition of affairs.  Believe me, tears like these are not good to   mingle with love, they are too bitter, too scorching, they blister   love's wings and fall too heavily on love's heart.  I feel worn out   with a dreary sort of hopelessness; if you know a cure for pain like   this send it to me quickly.Yet, in the very next letter, she says to him:   Although I said good-bye to you less than an hour ago, I cannot   refrain from writing to tell you that a happy calm which seems to   penetrate my whole being seems also to have wiped out all remembrance   of the misery and unhappiness which has overwhelmed me lately.  Why   cannot it always be so, or would life perhaps be then too blessed, too   wholly happy for it to be life?  I know that you are free to-night,   will you not write to me, that the first words my eyes fall upon to-   morrow shall prove that to-day has not been a dream?  Yes, write to   me.The letter that immediately follows is one of six words only:   Let me dream--Let me dream.In the following there are interesting touches of actuality:   Did you ever try a cup of tea (the national beverage, by the way) at   an English railway station?  If you have not, I would advise you, as a   friend, to continue to abstain!  The names of the American drinks are   rather against them, the straws are, I think, about the best part of   them.  You do not tell me what you think of Mr. Disraeli.  I once met   him at a ball at the Duke of Sutherland's in the long picture gallery   of Stafford House.  I was walking with Lord Shrewsbury, and without a   word of warning he stopped and introduced him, mentioning with   reckless mendacity that I had read every book he had written and   admired them all, then he coolly walked off and left me standing face   to face with the great statesman.  He talked to me for some time, and   I studied him carefully.  I should say he was a man with one steady   aim: endless patience, untiring perseverance, iron concentration;   marking out one straight line before him so unbending that despite   themselves men stand aside as it is drawn straightly and steadily on.   A man who believes that determination brings strength, strength brings   endurance, and endurance brings success.  You know how often in his   novels he speaks of the influence of women, socially, morally, and   politically, yet his manner was the least interested or deferential in   talking that I have ever met with in a man of his class.  He certainly   thought this particular woman of singularly small account, or else the   brusque and tactless allusion to his books may perhaps have annoyed   him as it did me; but whatever the cause, when he promptly left me at   the first approach of a mutual acquaintance, I felt distinctly   snubbed.  Of the two men, Mr. Gladstone was infinitely more agreeable   in his manner, he left one with the pleasant feeling of measuring a   little higher in cubic inches than one did before, than which I know   no more delightful sensation.  A Paris, bientot.Elsewhere, we find cleverly-written descriptions of life in Italy, inAlgiers, at Hombourg, at French boarding-houses; stories about NapoleonIII., Guizot, Prince Gortschakoff, Montalembert, and others; politicalspeculations, literary criticisms, and witty social scandal; andeverywhere a keen sense of humour, a wonderful power of observation.  Asreconstructed in these letters, the Inconnue seems to have been notunlike Merimee himself.  She had the same restless, unyielding,independent character.  Each desired to analyse the other.  Each, being acritic, was better fitted for friendship than for love.  'We are sodifferent,' said Merimee once to her, 'that we can hardly understand eachother.'  But it was because they were so alike that each remained amystery to the other.  Yet they ultimately attained to a high altitude ofloyal and faithful friendship, and from a purely literary point of viewthese fictitious letters give the finishing touch to the strange romancethat so stirred Paris fifteen years ago.  Perhaps the real letters willbe published some day.  When they are, how interesting to compare them!The Bird-Bride, by Graham R. Tomson, is a collection of romantic ballads,delicate sonnets, and metrical studies in foreign fanciful forms.  Thepoem that gives its title to the book is the lament of an Eskimo hunterover the loss of his wife and children.   Years agone, on the flat white strand,      I won my sweet sea-girl:   Wrapped in my coat of the snow-white fur,   I watched the wild birds settle and stir,      The grey gulls gather and whirl.   One, the greatest of all the flock,      Perched on an ice-floe bare,   Called and cried as her heart were broke,   And straight they were changed, that fleet bird-folk,      To women young and fair.   Swift I sprang from my hiding-place      And held the fairest fast;   I held her fast, the sweet, strange thing:   Her comrades skirled, but they all took wing,      And smote me as they passed.   I bore her safe to my warm snow house;      Full sweetly there she smiled;   And yet, whenever the shrill winds blew,   She would beat her long white arms anew,      And her eyes glanced quick and wild.   But I took her to wife, and clothed her warm      With skins of the gleaming seal;   Her wandering glances sank to rest   When she held a babe to her fair, warm breast,      And she loved me dear and leal.   Together we tracked the fox and the seal,      And at her behest I swore   That bird and beast my bow might slay   For meat and for raiment, day by day,      But never a grey gull more.Famine comes upon the land, and the hunter, forgetting his oath, slaysfour sea-gulls for food.  The bird-wife 'shrilled out in a woful cry,'and taking the plumage of the dead birds, she makes wings for herchildren and for herself, and flies away with them.   'Babes of mine, of the wild wind's kin,      Feather ye quick, nor stay.   Oh, oho! but the wild winds blow!   Babes of mine, it is time to go:      Up, dear hearts, and away!'   And lo! the grey plumes covered them all,      Shoulder and breast and brow.   I felt the wind of their whirling flight:   Was it sea or sky? was it day or night?      It is always night-time now.   Dear, will you never relent, come back?      I loved you long and true.   O winged white wife, and our children three,   Of the wild wind's kin though you surely be,      Are ye not of my kin too?   Ay, ye once were mine, and, till I forget,      Ye are mine forever and aye,   Mine, wherever your wild wings go,   While shrill winds whistle across the snow      And the skies are blear and grey.Some powerful and strong ballads follow, many of which, such as The CruelPriest, Deid Folks' Ferry, and Marchen, are in that curious combinationof Scotch and Border dialect so much affected now by our modern poets.Certainly dialect is dramatic.  It is a vivid method of re-creating apast that never existed.  It is something between 'A Return to Nature'and 'A Return to the Glossary.'  It is so artificial that it is reallynaive.  From the point of view of mere music, much may be said for it.Wonderful diminutives lend new notes of tenderness to the song.  Thereare possibilities of fresh rhymes, and in search for a fresh rhyme poetsmay be excused if they wander from the broad highroad of classicalutterance into devious byways and less-trodden paths.  Sometimes one istempted to look on dialect as expressing simply the pathos ofprovincialisms, but there is more in it than mere mispronunciations.  Withthe revival of an antique form, often comes the revival of an antiquespirit.  Through limitations that are sometimes uncouth, and alwaysnarrow, comes Tragedy herself; and though she may stammer in herutterance, and deck herself in cast-off weeds and trammelling raiment,still we must hold ourselves in readiness to accept her, so rare are hervisits to us now, so rare her presence in an age that demands a happyending from every play, and that sees in the theatre merely a source ofamusement.  The form, too, of the ballad--how perfect it is in itsdramatic unity!  It is so perfect that we must forgive it its dialect, ifit happens to speak in that strange tongue.   Then by cam' the bride's company      Wi' torches burning bright.   'Tak' up, tak' up your bonny bride      A' in the mirk midnight!'   Oh, wan, wan was the bridegroom's face      And wan, wan was the bride,   But clay-cauld was the young mess-priest      That stood them twa beside!   Says, 'Rax me out your hand, Sir Knight,      And wed her wi' this ring';   And the deid bride's hand it was as cauld      As ony earthly thing.   The priest he touched that lady's hand,      And never a word he said;   The priest he touched that lady's hand,      And his ain was wet and red.   The priest he lifted his ain right hand,      And the red blood dripped and fell.   Says, 'I loved ye, lady, and ye loved me;      Sae I took your life mysel'.'   . . . . .   Oh! red, red was the dawn o' day,      And tall was the gallows-tree:   The Southland lord to his ain has fled      And the mess-priest's hangit hie!Of the sonnets, this To Herodotus is worth quoting:   Far-travelled coaster of the midland seas,      What marvels did those curious eyes behold!      Winged snakes, and carven labyrinths of old;   The emerald column raised to Heracles;   King Perseus' shrine upon the Chemmian leas;      Four-footed fishes, decked with gems and gold:      But thou didst leave some secrets yet untold,   And veiled the dread Osirian mysteries.   And now the golden asphodels among      Thy footsteps fare, and to the lordly dead      Thou tellest all the stories left unsaid   Of secret rites and runes forgotten long,      Of that dark folk who ate the Lotus-bread   And sang the melancholy Linus-song.Mrs. Tomson has certainly a very refined sense of form.  Her verse,especially in the series entitled New Words to Old Tunes, has grace anddistinction.  Some of the shorter poems are, to use a phrase madeclassical by Mr. Pater, 'little carved ivories of speech.'  She is one ofour most artistic workers in poetry, and treats language as a finematerial.(1) An Author's Love: Being the Unpublished Letters of Prosper Merimee's'Inconnue.'  (Macmillan and Co.)(2) The Bird-Bride: A Volume of Ballads and Sonnets.  By Graham R.Tomson.  (Longmans, Green and Co.)A THOUGHT-READER'S NOVEL(Pall Mall Gazette, June 5, 1889.)There is a great deal to be said in favour of reading a novel backwards.The last page is, as a rule, the most interesting, and when one beginswith the catastrophe or the denoument one feels on pleasant terms ofequality with the author.  It is like going behind the scenes of atheatre.  One is no longer taken in, and the hairbreadth escapes of thehero and the wild agonies of the heroine leave one absolutely unmoved.One knows the jealously-guarded secret, and one can afford to smile atthe quite unnecessary anxiety that the puppets of fiction always considerit their duty to display.  In the case of Mr. Stuart Cumberland's novel,The Vasty Deep, as he calls it, the last page is certainly thrilling andmakes us curious to know more about 'Brown, the medium.'Scene, a padded room in a mad-house in the United States.A gibbering lunatic discovered dashing wildly about the chamber as if inthe act of chasing invisible forms.'This is our worst case,' says a doctor opening the cell to one of thevisitors in lunacy.  'He was a spirit medium and he is hourly haunted bythe creations of his fancy.  We have to carefully watch him, for he hasdeveloped suicidal tendencies.'The lunatic makes a dash at the retreating form of his visitors, and, asthe door closes upon him, sinks with a yell upon the floor.A week later the lifeless body of Brown, the medium, is found suspendedfrom the gas bracket in his cell.How clearly one sees it all!  How forcible and direct the style is!  Andwhat a thrilling touch of actuality the simple mention of the 'gasbracket' gives us!  Certainly The Vasty Deep is a book to be read.And we have read it; read it with great care.  Though it is largelyautobiographical, it is none the less a work of fiction and, though someof us may think that there is very little use in exposing what is alreadyexposed and revealing the secrets of Polichinelle, no doubt there aremany who will be interested to hear of the tricks and deceptions ofcrafty mediums, of their gauze masks, telescopic rods and invisible silkthreads, and of the marvellous raps they can produce simply by displacingthe peroneus longus muscle!  The book opens with a description of thescene by the death-bed of Alderman Parkinson.  Dr. Josiah Brown, theeminent medium, is in attendance and tries to comfort the honest merchantby producing noises on the bedpost.  Mr. Parkinson, however, beingextremely anxious to revisit Mrs. Parkinson, in a materialised form afterdeath, will not be satisfied till he has received from his wife a solemnpromise that she will not marry again, such a marriage being, in hiseyes, nothing more nor less than bigamy.  Having received an assurance tothis effect from her, Mr. Parkinson dies, his soul, according to themedium, being escorted to the spheres by 'a band of white-robed spirits.'This is the prologue.  The next chapter is entitled 'Five Years After.'Violet Parkinson, the Alderman's only child, is in love with Jack Alston,who is 'poor, but clever.'  Mrs. Parkinson, however, will not hear of anymarriage till the deceased Alderman has materialised himself and givenhis formal consent.  A seance is held at which Jack Alston unmasks themedium and shows Dr. Josiah Brown to be an impostor--a foolish act, onhis part, as he is at once ordered to leave the house by the infuriatedMrs. Parkinson, whose faith in the Doctor is not in the least shaken bythe unfortunate exposure.The lovers are consequently parted.  Jack sails for Newfoundland, isshipwrecked and carefully, somewhat too carefully, tended by 'La-ki-wa,or the Star that shines,' a lovely Indian maiden who belongs to the tribeof the Micmacs.  She is a fascinating creature who wears 'a necklacecomposed of thirteen nuggets of pure gold,' a blanket of Englishmanufacture and trousers of tanned leather.  In fact, as Mr. StuartCumberland observes, she looks 'the embodiment of fresh dewy morn.'  WhenJack, on recovering his senses, sees her, he naturally inquires who sheis.  She answers, in the simple utterance endeared to us by FenimoreCooper, 'I am La-ki-wa.  I am the only child of my father, Tall Pine,chief of the Dildoos.'  She talks, Mr. Cumberland informs us, very goodEnglish.  Jack at once entrusts her with the following telegram which hewrites on the back of a five-pound note:--   Miss Violet Parkinson, Hotel Kronprinz, Franzensbad, Austria.--Safe.   JACK.But La-ki-wa, we regret to say, says to herself, 'He belongs to TallPine, to the Dildoos, and to me,' and never sends the telegram.Subsequently, La-ki-wa proposes to Jack who promptly rejects her and,with the usual callousness of men, offers her a brother's love.  La-ki-wa,naturally, regrets the premature disclosure of her passion and weeps.  'Mybrother,' she remarks, 'will think that I have the timid heart of a deerwith the crying voice of a papoose.  I, the daughter of Tall Pine--I aMicmac, to show the grief that is in my heart.  O, my brother, I amashamed.'  Jack comforts her with the hollow sophistries of a civilisedbeing and gives her his photograph.  As he is on his way to the steamerhe receives from Big Deer a soiled piece of a biscuit bag.  On it iswritten La-ki-wa's confession of her disgraceful behaviour about thetelegram.  'His thoughts,' Mr. Cumberland tells us, 'were bitter towardsLa-ki-wa, but they gradually softened when he remembered what he owedher.'Everything ends happily.  Jack arrives in England just in time to preventDr. Josiah Brown from mesmerising Violet whom the cunning doctor isanxious to marry, and he hurls his rival out of the window.  The victimis discovered 'bruised and bleeding among the broken flower-pots' by acomic policeman.  Mrs. Parkinson still believes in spiritualism, butrefuses to have anything to do with Brown as she discovers that thedeceased Alderman's 'materialised beard' was made only of 'horrid, coarsehorsehair.'  Jack and Violet are married at last and Jack is horridenough to send to 'La-ki-wa' another photograph.  The end of Dr. Brown ischronicled above.  Had we not known what was in store for him we shouldhardly have got through the book.  There is a great deal too much paddingin it about Dr. Slade and Dr. Bartram and other mediums, and thedisquisitions on the commercial future of Newfoundland seem endless andare intolerable.  However, there are many publics, and Mr. StuartCumberland is always sure of an audience.  His chief fault is a tendencyto low comedy; but some people like low comedy in fiction.The Vasty Deep: A Strange Story of To-day.  By Stuart Cumberland.(Sampson Low and Co.)THE POETS' CORNER--X(Pall Mall Gazette, June 24, 1889.)Is Mr. Alfred Austin among the Socialists?  Has somebody converted therespectable editor of the respectable National Review?  Has even dulnessbecome revolutionary?  From a poem in Mr. Austin's last volume this wouldseem to be the case.  It is perhaps unfair to take our rhymers tooseriously.  Between the casual fancies of a poet and the callous facts ofprose there is, or at least there should be, a wide difference.  Butsince the poem in question, Two Visions, as Mr. Austin calls it, wasbegun in 1863 and revised in 1889 we may regard it as fullyrepresentative of Mr. Austin's mature views.  He gives us, at any rate,in its somewhat lumbering and pedestrian verses, his conception of theperfect state:   Fearless, unveiled, and unattended      Strolled maidens to and fro:   Youths looked respect, but never bended      Obsequiously low.   And each with other, sans condition,      Held parley brief or long,   Without provoking _coarse suspicion      Of marriage_, or of wrong.   All were well clad, and none were better,      And gems beheld I none,   Save where there hung a jewelled fetter,      Symbolic, in the sun.   I saw a noble-looking maiden      Close Dante's solemn book,   And go, with crate of linen laden      And wash it in the brook.   Anon, a broad-browed _poet, dragging      A load of logs along_,   To warm his hearth, withal not flagging      In current of his song.   Each one some handicraft attempted      Or helped to till the soil:   None but the aged were exempted      From communistic toil.Such an expression as 'coarse suspicion of marriage' is not veryfortunate; the log-rolling poet of the fifth stanza is an ideal that wehave already realised and one in which we had but little comfort, and thefourth stanza leaves us in doubt whether Mr. Austin means thatwasherwomen are to take to reading Dante, or that students of Italianliterature are to wash their own clothes.  But, on the whole, though Mr.Austin's vision of the citta divina of the future is not veryinspiriting, it is certainly extremely interesting as a sign of thetimes, and it is evident from the two concluding lines of the followingstanzas that there will be no danger of the intellect being overworked:   Age lorded not, nor rose the hectic      Up to the cheek of youth;   But reigned throughout their dialectic      Sobriety of truth.   And if a long-held contest tended      To ill-defined result,   _It was by calm consent suspended      As over-difficult_.Mr. Austin, however, has other moods, and, perhaps, he is at his bestwhen he is writing about flowers.  Occasionally he wearies the reader bytedious enumerations of plants, lacking indeed reticence and tact andselection in many of his descriptions, but, as a rule, he is verypleasant when he is babbling of green fields.  How pretty these stanzasfrom the dedication are!   When vines, just newly burgeoned, link      Their hands to join the dance of Spring,   Green lizards glisten from cleft and chink,   And almond blossoms rosy pink      Cluster and perch, ere taking wing;   Where over strips of emerald wheat      Glimmer red peach and snowy pear,   And nightingales all day long repeat   Their love-song, not less glad than sweet      They chant in sorrow and gloom elsewhere;   Where purple iris-banners scale      Defending walls and crumbling ledge,   And virgin windflowers, lithe and frail,   Now mantling red, now trembling pale,      Peep out from furrow and hide in hedge.Some of the sonnets also (notably, one entitled When Acorns Fall) arevery charming, and though, as a whole, Love's Widowhood is tedious andprolix, still it contains some very felicitous touches.  We wish,however, that Mr. Austin would not write such lines as   Pippins of every sort, and _codlins manifold_.'Codlins manifold' is a monstrous expression.Mr. W. J. Linton's fame as a wood-engraver has somewhat obscured themerits of his poetry.  His Claribel and Other Poems, published in 1865,is now a scarce book, and far more scarce is the collection of lyricswhich he printed in 1887 at his own press and brought out under the titleof Love-Lore.  The large and handsome volume that now lies before uscontains nearly all these later poems as well as a selection fromClaribel and many renderings, in the original metre, of French poemsranging from the thirteenth century to our own day.  A portrait of Mr.Linton is prefixed, and the book is dedicated 'To William Bell Scott, myfriend for nearly fifty years.'  As a poet Mr. Linton is always fancifulwith a studied fancifulness, and often felicitous with a chance felicity.He is fascinated by our seventeenth-century singers, and has, here andthere, succeeded in catching something of their quaintness and not alittle of their charm.  There is a pleasant flavour about his verse.  Itis entirely free from violence and from vagueness, those two besettingsins of so much modern poetry.  It is clear in outline and restrained inform, and, at its best, has much that is light and lovely about it.  Howgraceful, for instance, this is!   BARE FEET   O fair white feet!  O dawn-white feet      Of Her my hope may claim!   Bare-footed through the dew she came      Her Love to meet.   Star-glancing feet, the windflowers sweet      Might envy, without shame,   As through the grass they lightly came,      Her Love to meet.   O Maiden sweet, with flower-kiss'd feet!      My heart your footstool name!   Bare-footed through the dew she came,      Her Love to meet.'Vindicate Gemma!' was Longfellow's advice to Miss Heloise Durant whenshe proposed to write a play about Dante.  Longfellow, it may beremarked, was always on the side of domesticity.  It was the secret ofhis popularity.  We cannot say, however, that Miss Durant has made uslike Gemma better.  She is not exactly the Xantippe whom Boccacciodescribes, but she is very boring, for all that:   GEMMA.  The more thou meditat'st, more mad art thou.   Clowns, with their love, can cheer poor wives' hearts more   O'er black bread and goat's cheese than thou canst mine   O'er red Vernaccia, spite of all thy learning!   Care I how tortured spirits feel in hell?   DANTE.  Thou tortur'st mine.   GEMMA.  Or how souls sing in heaven?   DANTE.  Would I were there.   GEMMA.  All folly, naught but folly.   DANTE.  Thou canst not understand the mandates given   To poets by their goddess Poesy. . . .   GEMMA.  Canst ne'er speak prose?  Why daily clothe thy thoughts   In strangest garb, as if thy wits played fool   At masquerade, where no man knows a maid   From matron?  Fie on poets' mutterings!   DANTE (to himself).  If, then, the soul absorbed at last to whole--   GEMMA.  Fie! fie!  I say.  Art thou bewitched?   DANTE.  O! peace.   GEMMA.  Dost thou deem me deaf and dumb?   DANTE.  O! that thou wert.Dante is certainly rude, but Gemma is dreadful.  The play is well meantbut it is lumbering and heavy, and the blank verse has absolutely nomerit.Father O'Flynn and Other Irish Lyrics, by Mr. A. P. Graves, is acollection of poems in the style of Lover.  Most of them are written indialect, and, for the benefit of English readers, notes are appended inwhich the uninitiated are informed that 'brogue' means a boot, that'mavourneen' means my dear, and that 'astore' is a term of affection.Here is a specimen of Mr. Graves's work:   'Have you e'er a new song,      My Limerick Poet,   To help us along      Wid this terrible boat,   Away over to Tork?'      'Arrah I understand;   For all of your work,      'Twill tighten you, boys,   To cargo that sand   To the overside strand,      Wid the current so strong      Unless you've a song--   A song to lighten and brighten you, boys. . . . 'It is a very dreary production and does not 'lighten and brighten' us abit.  The whole volume should be called The Lucubrations of a StageIrishman.The anonymous author of The Judgment of the City is a sort of bad Blake.So at least his prelude seems to suggest:      Time, the old viol-player,      For ever thrills his ancient strings   With the flying bow of Fate, and thence   Much discord, but some music, brings.      His ancient strings are truth,      Love, hate, hope, fear;      And his choicest melody      Is the song of the faithful seer.As he progresses, however, he develops into a kind of inferior Clough andwrites heavy hexameters upon modern subjects:   Here for a moment stands in the light at the door of a playhouse,   One who is dignified, masterly, hard in the pride of his station;   Here too, the stateliest of matrons, sour in the pride of her station;   With them their daughter, sad-faced and listless, half-crushed to   their likeness.He has every form of sincerity except the sincerity of the artist, adefect that he shares with most of our popular writers.(1) Love's Widowhood and Other Poems.

SWINBURNE'S LAST VOLUME(Pall Mall Gazette, June 27, 1889.)Mr. Swinburne once set his age on fire by a volume of very perfect andvery poisonous poetry.  Then he became revolutionary and pantheistic, andcried out against those that sit in high places both in heaven and onearth.  Then he invented Marie Stuart and laid upon us the heavy burdenof Bothwell.  Then he retired to the nursery and wrote poems aboutchildren of a somewhat over-subtle character.  He is now extremelypatriotic, and manages to combine with his patriotism a strong affectionfor the Tory party.  He has always been a great poet.  But he has hislimitations, the chief of which is, curiously enough, the entire lack ofany sense of limit.  His song is nearly always too loud for his subject.His magnificent rhetoric, nowhere more magnificent than in the volumethat now lies before us, conceals rather than reveals.  It has been saidof him, and with truth, that he is a master of language, but with stillgreater truth it may be said that Language is his master.  Words seem todominate him.  Alliteration tyrannises over him.  Mere sound oftenbecomes his lord.  He is so eloquent that whatever he touches becomesunreal.Let us turn to the poem on the Armada:   The wings of the south-west wind are widened; the breath of his   fervent lips,   More keen than a sword's edge, fiercer than fire, falls full on the   plunging ships.   The pilot is he of the northward flight, their stay and their   steersman he;   A helmsman clothed with the tempest, and girdled with strength to   constrain the sea.   And the host of them trembles and quails, caught fast in his hand as a   bird in the toils;   For the wrath and the joy that fulfil him are mightier than man's,   whom he slays and spoils.   And vainly, with heart divided in sunder, and labour of wavering will,   The lord of their host takes counsel with hope if haply their star   shine still.Somehow we seem to have heard all this before.  Does it come from thefact that of all the poets who ever lived Mr. Swinburne is the one who isthe most limited in imagery?  It must be admitted that he is so.  He haswearied us with his monotony.  'Fire' and the 'Sea' are the two wordsever on his lips.  We must confess also that this shrillsinging--marvellous as it is--leaves us out of breath.  Here is a passagefrom a poem called A Word with the Wind:   Be the sunshine bared or veiled, the sky superb or shrouded,      Still the waters, lax and languid, chafed and foiled,   Keen and thwarted, pale and patient, clothed with fire or clouded,      Vex their heart in vain, or sleep like serpents coiled.   Thee they look for, blind and baffled, wan with wrath and weary,      Blown for ever back by winds that rock the bird:   Winds that seamews breast subdue the sea, and bid the dreary      Waves be weak as hearts made sick with hope deferred.   Let the clarion sound from westward, let the south bear token      How the glories of thy godhead sound and shine:   Bid the land rejoice to see the land-wind's broad wings broken,      Bid the sea take comfort, bid the world be thine.Verse of this kind may be justly praised for the sustained strength andvigour of its metrical scheme.  Its purely technical excellence isextraordinary.  But is it more than an oratorical tour de force?  Does itreally convey much?  Does it charm?  Could we return to it again andagain with renewed pleasure?  We think not.  It seems to us empty.Of course, we must not look to these poems for any revelation of humanlife.  To be at one with the elements seems to be Mr. Swinburne's aim.  Heseeks to speak with the breath of wind and wave.  The roar of the fire isever in his ears.  He puts his clarion to the lips of Spring and bids herblow, and the Earth wakes from her dreams and tells him her secret.  Heis the first lyric poet who has tried to make an absolute surrender ofhis own personality, and he has succeeded.  We hear the song, but wenever know the singer.  We never even get near to him.  Out of thethunder and splendour of words he himself says nothing.  We have oftenhad man's interpretation of Nature; now we have Nature's interpretationof man, and she has curiously little to say.  Force and Freedom form hervague message.  She deafens us with her clangours.But Mr. Swinburne is not always riding the whirlwind and calling out ofthe depths of the sea.  Romantic ballads in Border dialect have not losttheir fascination for him, and this last volume contains some verysplendid examples of this curious artificial kind of poetry.  The amountof pleasure one gets out of dialect is a matter entirely of temperament.To say 'mither' instead of 'mother' seems to many the acme of romance.There are others who are not quite so ready to believe in the pathos ofprovincialisms.  There is, however, no doubt of Mr. Swinburne's masteryover the form, whether the form be quite legitimate or not.  The WearyWedding has the concentration and colour of a great drama, and thequaintness of its style lends it something of the power of a grotesque.The ballad of The Witch-Mother, a mediaeval Medea who slays her childrenbecause her lord is faithless, is worth reading on account of itshorrible simplicity.  The Bride's Tragedy, with its strange refrain of   In, in, out and in,   Blaws the wind and whirls the whin:The Jacobite's Exile--   O lordly flow the Loire and Seine,      And loud the dark Durance:   But bonnier shine the braes of Tyne      Than a' the fields of France;   And the waves of Till that speak sae still   Gleam goodlier where they glance:The Tyneside Widow and A Reiver's Neck-verse are all poems of fineimaginative power, and some of them are terrible in their fierceintensity of passion.  There is no danger of English poetry narrowingitself to a form so limited as the romantic ballad in dialect.  It is oftoo vital a growth for that.  So we may welcome Mr. Swinburne's masterlyexperiments with the hope that things which are inimitable will not beimitated.  The collection is completed by a few poems on children, somesonnets, a threnody on John William Inchbold, and a lovely lyric entitledThe Interpreters.   In human thought have all things habitation;      Our days   Laugh, lower, and lighten past, and find no station      That stays.   But thought and faith are mightier things than time      Can wrong,   Made splendid once by speech, or made sublime      By song.   Remembrance, though the tide of change that rolls      Wax hoary,   Gives earth and heaven, for song's sake and the soul's,      Their glory.Certainly, 'for song's sake' we should love Mr. Swinburne's work, cannot,indeed, help loving it, so marvellous a music-maker is he.  But what ofthe soul?  For the soul we must go elsewhere.Poems and Ballads.  Third Series.  By Algernon Charles Swinburne.  (Chattoand Windus.)THREE NEW POETS(Pall Mall Gazette, July 12, 1889.)Books of poetry by young writers are usually promissory notes that arenever met.  Now and then, however, one comes across a volume that is sofar above the average that one can hardly resist the fascinatingtemptation of recklessly prophesying a fine future for its author.  Sucha book Mr. Yeats's Wanderings of Oisin certainly is.  Here we findnobility of treatment and nobility of subject-matter, delicacy of poeticinstinct and richness of imaginative resource.  Unequal and uneven muchof the work must be admitted to be.  Mr. Yeats does not try to 'out-baby'Wordsworth, we are glad to say; but he occasionally succeeds in'out-glittering' Keats, and, here and there, in his book we come acrossstrange crudities and irritating conceits.  But when he is at his best heis very good.  If he has not the grand simplicity of epic treatment, hehas at least something of the largeness of vision that belongs to theepical temper.  He does not rob of their stature the great heroes ofCeltic mythology.  He is very naive and very primitive and speaks of hisgiants with the air of a child.  Here is a characteristic passage fromthe account of Oisin's return from the Island of Forgetfulness:   And I rode by the plains of the sea's edge, where all is barren and   grey,   Grey sands on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees,   Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would hasten away   Like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the seas.   Long fled the foam-flakes around me, the winds fled out of the vast,   Snatching the bird in secret, nor knew I, embosomed apart,   When they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast,   For Remembrance, lifting her leanness, keened in the gates of my   heart.   Till fattening the winds of the morning, an odour of new-mown hay   Came, and my forehead fell low, and my tears like berries fell down;   Later a sound came, half lost in the sound of a shore far away,   From the great grass-barnacle calling, and later the shore-winds   brown.   If I were as I once was, the gold hooves crushing the sand and the   shells,   Coming forth from the sea like the morning with red lips murmuring a   song,   Not coughing, my head on my knees, and praying, and wroth with the   bells,   I would leave no Saint's head on his body, though spacious his lands   were and strong.   Making way from the kindling surges, I rode on a bridle-path,   Much wondering to see upon all hands, of wattle and woodwork made,   Thy bell-mounted churches, and guardless the sacred cairn and the   earth,   And a small and feeble populace stooping with mattock and spade.In one or two places the music is faulty, the construction is sometimestoo involved, and the word 'populace' in the last line is ratherinfelicitous; but, when all is said, it is impossible not to feel inthese stanzas the presence of the true poetic spirit.A young lady who seeks for a 'song surpassing sense,' and tries toreproduce Mr. Browning's mode of verse for our edification, may seem tobe in a somewhat parlous state.  But Miss Caroline Fitz Gerald's work isbetter than her aim.  Venetia Victrix is in many respects a fine poem.  Itshows vigour, intellectual strength, and courage.  The story is a strangeone.  A certain Venetian, hating one of the Ten who had wronged him andidentifying his enemy with Venice herself, abandons his native city andmakes a vow that, rather than lift a hand for her good, he will give hissoul to Hell.  As he is sailing down the Adriatic at night, his ship issuddenly becalmed and he sees a huge galley      where sate   Like counsellors on high, exempt, elate,   The fiends triumphant in their fiery state,on their way to Venice.  He has to choose between his own ruin and theruin of his city.  After a struggle, he determines to sacrifice himselfto his rash oath.   I climbed aloft.  My brain had grown one thought,   One hope, one purpose.  And I heard the hiss   Of raging disappointment, loth to miss   Its prey--I heard the lapping of the flame,   That through the blenched figures went and came,   Darting in frenzy to the devils' yell.   I set that cross on high, and cried: 'To hell   My soul for ever, and my deed to God!   Once Venice guarded safe, let this vile clod   Drift where fate will!'         And then (the hideous laugh   Of fiends in full possession, keen to quaff   The wine of one new soul not weak with tears,   Pealing like ruinous thunder in mine ears)   I fell, and heard no more.  The pale day broke   Through lazar-windows, when once more I woke,   Remembering I might no more dare to pray.Venetia Victrix is followed by Ophelion, a curious lyrical play whosedramatis personae consist of Night, Death, Dawn and a Scholar.  It isintricate rather than musical, but some of the songs are graceful--notablyone beginning   Lady of heaven most pure and holy,      Artemis, fleet as the flying deer,   Glide through the dusk like a silver shadow,      Mirror thy brow in the lonely mere.Miss Fitz Gerald's volume is certainly worth reading.Mr. Richard Le Gallienne's little book, Volumes in Folio as he quaintlycalls it, is full of dainty verse and delicate fancy.  Lines such as   And lo! the white face of the dawn      Yearned like a ghost's against the pane,      A sobbing ghost amid the rain;   Or like a chill and pallid rose   Slowly upclimbing from the lawn,strike, with their fantastic choice of metaphors, a pleasing note.  Atpresent Mr. Le Gallienne's muse seems to devote herself entirely to theworship of books, and Mr. Le Gallienne himself is steeped in literarytraditions, making Keats his model and seeking to reproduce something ofKeats's richness and affluence of imagery.  He is keenly conscious howderivative his inspiration is:   Verse of my own! why ask so poor a thing,      When I might gather from the garden-ways   Of sunny memory fragrant offering      Of deathless blooms and white unwithering sprays?   Shakspeare had given me an English rose,      And honeysuckle Spenser sweet as dew,   Or I had brought you from that dreamy close      Keats' passion-blossom, or the mystic blue   Star-flower of Shelley's song, or shaken gold      From lilies of the Blessed Damosel,   Or stolen fire from out the scarlet fold      Of Swinburne's poppies. . . .Yet now that he has played his prelude with so sensitive and so gracefula touch, we have no doubt that he will pass to larger themes and noblersubject-matter, and fulfil the hope he expresses in this sextet:   For if perchance some music should be mine,      I would fling forth its notes like a fierce sea,   To wash away the piles of tyranny,      To make love free and faith unbound of creed.   O for some power to fill my shrunken line,      And make a trumpet of my oaten reed.(1) The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems.  By W. B. Yeats.  (KeganPaul.)(2) Venetia Victrix.

(Elkin Mathews.)A CHINESE SAGE(Speaker, February 8, 1890.)A eminent Oxford theologian once remarked that his only objection tomodern progress was that it progressed forward instead of backward--aview that so fascinated a certain artistic undergraduate that he promptlywrote an essay upon some unnoticed analogies between the development ofideas and the movements of the common sea-crab.  I feel sure the Speakerwill not be suspected even by its most enthusiastic friends of holdingthis dangerous heresy of retrogression.  But I must candidly admit that Ihave come to the conclusion that the most caustic criticism of modernlife I have met with for some time is that contained in the writings ofthe learned Chuang Tzu, recently translated into the vulgar tongue by Mr.Herbert Giles, Her Majesty's Consul at Tamsui.The spread of popular education has no doubt made the name of this greatthinker quite familiar to the general public, but, for the sake of thefew and the over-cultured, I feel it my duty to state definitely who hewas, and to give a brief outline of the character of his philosophy.Chuang Tzu, whose name must carefully be pronounced as it is not written,was born in the fourth century before Christ, by the banks of the YellowRiver, in the Flowery Land; and portraits of the wonderful sage seated onthe flying dragon of contemplation may still be found on the simple tea-trays and pleasing screens of many of our most respectable suburbanhouseholds.  The honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubtoften mocked at the dome-like forehead of the philosopher, and laughedover the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him.  Ifthey really knew who he was, they would tremble.  For Chuang Tzu spenthis life in preaching the great creed of Inaction, and in pointing outthe uselessness of all useful things.  'Do nothing, and everything willbe done,' was the doctrine which he inherited from his great master LaoTzu.  To resolve action into thought, and thought into abstraction, washis wicked transcendental aim.  Like the obscure philosopher of earlyGreek speculation, he believed in the identity of contraries; like Plato,he was an idealist, and had all the idealist's contempt for utilitariansystems; he was a mystic like Dionysius, and Scotus Erigena, and JacobBohme, and held, with them and with Philo, that the object of life was toget rid of self-consciousness, and to become the unconscious vehicle of ahigher illumination.  In fact, Chuang Tzu may be said to have summed upin himself almost every mood of European metaphysical or mysticalthought, from Heraclitus down to Hegel.  There was something in him ofthe Quietist also; and in his worship of Nothing he may be said to havein some measure anticipated those strange dreamers of mediaeval days who,like Tauler and Master Eckhart, adored the purum nihil and the Abyss.  Thegreat middle classes of this country, to whom, as we all know, ourprosperity, if not our civilisation, is entirely due, may shrug theirshoulders over all this and ask, with a certain amount of reason, what isthe identity of contraries to them, and why they should get rid of thatself-consciousness which is their chief characteristic.  But Chuang Tzuwas something more than a metaphysician and an illuminist.  He sought todestroy society, as we know it, as the middle classes know it; and thesad thing is that he combines with the passionate eloquence of a Rousseauthe scientific reasoning of a Herbert Spencer.  There is nothing of thesentimentalist in him.  He pities the rich more than the poor, if he everpities at all, and prosperity seems to him as tragic a thing assuffering.  He has nothing of the modern sympathy with failures, nor doeshe propose that the prizes should always be given on moral grounds tothose who come in last in the race.  It is the race itself that heobjects to; and as for active sympathy, which has become the professionof so many worthy people in our own day, he thinks that trying to makeothers good is as silly an occupation as 'beating a drum in a forest inorder to find a fugitive.'  It is a mere waste of energy.  That is all.While, as for a thoroughly sympathetic man, he is, in the eyes of ChuangTzu, simply a man who is always trying to be somebody else, and so missesthe only possible excuse for his own existence.Yes; incredible as it may seem, this curious thinker looked back with asigh of regret to a certain Golden Age when there were no competitiveexaminations, no wearisome educational systems, no missionaries, no pennydinners for the people, no Established Churches, no HumanitarianSocieties, no dull lectures about one's duty to one's neighbour, and notedious sermons about any subject at all.  In those ideal days, he tellsus, people loved each other without being conscious of charity, orwriting to the newspapers about it.  They were upright, and yet theynever published books upon Altruism.  As every man kept his knowledge tohimself, the world escaped the curse of scepticism; and as every man kepthis virtues to himself, nobody meddled in other people's business.  Theylived simple and peaceful lives, and were contented with such food andraiment as they could get.  Neighbouring districts were in sight, and'the cocks and dogs of one could be heard in the other,' yet the peoplegrew old and died without ever interchanging visits.  There was nochattering about clever men, and no laudation of good men.  Theintolerable sense of obligation was unknown.  The deeds of humanity leftno trace, and their affairs were not made a burden for posterity byfoolish historians.In an evil moment the Philanthropist made his appearance, and broughtwith him the mischievous idea of Government.  'There is such a thing,'says Chuang Tzu, 'as leaving mankind alone: there has never been such athing as governing mankind.'  All modes of government are wrong.  Theyare unscientific, because they seek to alter the natural environment ofman; they are immoral because, by interfering with the individual, theyproduce the most aggressive forms of egotism; they are ignorant, becausethey try to spread education; they are self-destructive, because theyengender anarchy.  'Of old,' he tells us, 'the Yellow Emperor firstcaused charity and duty to one's neighbour to interfere with the naturalgoodness of the heart of man.  In consequence of this, Yao and Shun worethe hair off their legs in endeavouring to feed their people.  Theydisturbed their internal economy in order to find room for artificialvirtues.  They exhausted their energies in framing laws, and they werefailures.'  Man's heart, our philosopher goes on to say, may be 'forceddown or stirred up,' and in either case the issue is fatal.  Yao made thepeople too happy, so they were not satisfied.  Chieh made them toowretched, so they grew discontented.  Then every one began to argue aboutthe best way of tinkering up society.  'It is quite clear that somethingmust be done,' they said to each other, and there was a general rush forknowledge.  The results were so dreadful that the Government of the dayhad to bring in Coercion, and as a consequence of this 'virtuous mensought refuge in mountain caves, while rulers of state sat trembling inancestral halls.'  Then, when everything was in a state of perfect chaos,the Social Reformers got up on platforms, and preached salvation from theills that they and their system had caused.  The poor Social Reformers!'They know not shame, nor what it is to blush,' is the verdict of ChuangTzuu upon them.The economic question, also, is discussed by this almond-eyed sage atgreat length, and he writes about the curse of capital as eloquently asMr. Hyndman.  The accumulation of wealth is to him the origin of evil.  Itmakes the strong violent, and the weak dishonest.  It creates the pettythief, and puts him in a bamboo cage.  It creates the big thief, and setshim on a throne of white jade.  It is the father of competition, andcompetition is the waste, as well as the destruction, of energy.  Theorder of nature is rest, repetition, and peace.  Weariness and war arethe results of an artificial society based upon capital; and the richerthis society gets, the more thoroughly bankrupt it really is, for it hasneither sufficient rewards for the good nor sufficient punishments forthe wicked.  There is also this to be remembered--that the prizes of theworld degrade a man as much as the world's punishments.  The age isrotten with its worship of success.  As for education, true wisdom canneither be learnt nor taught.  It is a spiritual state, to which he wholives in harmony with nature attains.  Knowledge is shallow if we compareit with the extent of the unknown, and only the unknowable is of value.Society produces rogues, and education makes one rogue cleverer thananother.  That is the only result of School Boards.  Besides, of whatpossible philosophic importance can education be, when it serves simplyto make each man differ from his neighbour?  We arrive ultimately at achaos of opinions, doubt everything, and fall into the vulgar habit ofarguing; and it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.  Look atHui Tzu.  'He was a man of many ideas.  His works would fill five carts.But his doctrines were paradoxical.'  He said that there were feathers inan egg, because there were feathers on a chicken; that a dog could be asheep, because all names were arbitrary; that there was a moment when aswiftly-flying arrow was neither moving nor at rest; that if you took astick a foot long, and cut it in half every day, you would never come tothe end of it; and that a bay horse and a dun cow were three, becausetaken separately they were two, and taken together they were one, and oneand two made up three.  'He was like a man running a race with his ownshadow, and making a noise in order to drown the echo.  He was a clevergadfly, that was all.  What was the use of him?'Morality is, of course, a different thing.  It went out of fashion, saysChuang Tzu, when people began to moralise.  Men ceased then to bespontaneous and to act on intuition.  They became priggish andartificial, and were so blind as to have a definite purpose in life.  Thencame Governments and Philanthropists, those two pests of the age.  Theformer tried to coerce people into being good, and so destroyed thenatural goodness of man.  The latter were a set of aggressive busybodieswho caused confusion wherever they went.  They were stupid enough to haveprinciples, and unfortunate enough to act up to them.  They all came tobad ends, and showed that universal altruism is as bad in its results asuniversal egotism.  They 'tripped people up over charity, and fetteredthem with duties to their neighbours.'  They gushed over music, andfussed over ceremonies.  As a consequence of all this, the world lost itsequilibrium, and has been staggering ever since.Who, then, according to Chuang Tzu, is the perfect man?  And what is hismanner of life?  The perfect man does nothing beyond gazing at theuniverse.  He adopts no absolute position.  'In motion, he is like water.At rest, he is like a mirror.  And, like Echo, he answers only when he iscalled upon.'  He lets externals take care of themselves.  Nothingmaterial injures him; nothing spiritual punishes him.  His mentalequilibrium gives him the empire of the world.  He is never the slave ofobjective existences.  He knows that, 'just as the best language is thatwhich is never spoken, so the best action is that which is never done.'He is passive, and accepts the laws of life.  He rests in inactivity, andsees the world become virtuous of itself.  He does not try to 'bringabout his own good deeds.'  He never wastes himself on effort.  He is nottroubled about moral distinctions.  He knows that things are what theyare, and that their consequences will be what they will be.  His mind isthe 'speculum of creation,' and he is ever at peace.All this is of course excessively dangerous, but we must remember thatChuang Tzu lived more than two thousand years ago, and never had theopportunity of seeing our unrivalled civilisation.  And yet it ispossible that, were he to come back to earth and visit us, he might havesomething to say to Mr. Balfour about his coercion and activemisgovernment in Ireland; he might smile at some of our philanthropicardours, and shake his head over many of our organised charities; theSchool Board might not impress him, nor our race for wealth stir hisadmiration; he might wonder at our ideals, and grow sad over what we haverealised.  Perhaps it is well that Chuang Tzu cannot return.Meanwhile, thanks to Mr. Giles and Mr. Quaritch, we have his book toconsole us, and certainly it is a most fascinating and delightful volume.Chuang Tzu is one of the Darwinians before Darwin.  He traces man fromthe germ, and sees his unity with nature.  As an anthropologist he isexcessively interesting, and he describes our primitive arboreal ancestorliving in trees through his terror of animals stronger than himself, andknowing only one parent, the mother, with all the accuracy of a lecturerat the Royal Society.  Like Plato, he adopts the dialogue as his mode ofexpression, 'putting words into other people's mouths,' he tells us, 'inorder to gain breadth of view.'  As a story-teller he is charming.  Theaccount of the visit of the respectable Confucius to the great Robber Cheis most vivid and brilliant, and it is impossible not to laugh over theultimate discomfiture of the sage, the barrenness of whose moralplatitudes is ruthlessly exposed by the successful brigand.  Even in hismetaphysics, Chuang Tzu is intensely humorous.  He personifies hisabstractions, and makes them act plays before us.  The Spirit of theClouds, when passing eastward through the expanse of air, happened tofall in with the Vital Principle.  The latter was slapping his ribs andhopping about: whereupon the Spirit of the Clouds said, 'Who are you, oldman, and what are you doing?'  'Strolling!' replied the Vital Principle,without stopping, for all activities are ceaseless.  'I want to _know_something,' continued the Spirit of the Clouds.  'Ah!' cried the VitalPrinciple, in a tone of disapprobation, and a marvellous conversationfollows, that is not unlike the dialogue between the Sphinx and theChimera in Flaubert's curious drama.  Talking animals, also, have theirplace in Chuang Tzu's parables and stories, and through myth and poetryand fancy his strange philosophy finds musical utterance.Of course it is sad to be told that it is immoral to be consciously good,and that doing anything is the worst form of idleness.  Thousands ofexcellent and really earnest philanthropists would be absolutely thrownupon the rates if we adopted the view that nobody should be allowed tomeddle in what does not concern him.  The doctrine of the uselessness ofall useful things would not merely endanger our commercial supremacy as anation, but might bring discredit upon many prosperous and serious-mindedmembers of the shop-keeping classes.  What would become of our popularpreachers, our Exeter Hall orators, our drawing-room evangelists, if wesaid to them, in the words of Chuang Tzu, 'Mosquitoes will keep a manawake all night with their biting, and just in the same way this talk ofcharity and duty to one's neighbour drives us nearly crazy.  Sirs, striveto keep the world to its own original simplicity, and, as the windbloweth where it listeth, so let Virtue establish itself.  Wherefore thisundue energy?'  And what would be the fate of governments andprofessional politicians if we came to the conclusion that there is nosuch thing as governing mankind at all?  It is clear that Chuang Tzu is avery dangerous writer, and the publication of his book in English, twothousand years after his death, is obviously premature, and may cause agreat deal of pain to many thoroughly respectable and industriouspersons.  It may be true that the ideal of self-culture andself-development, which is the aim of his scheme of life, and the basisof his scheme of philosophy, is an ideal somewhat needed by an age likeours, in which most people are so anxious to educate their neighboursthat they have actually no time left in which to educate themselves.  Butwould it be wise to say so?  It seems to me that if we once admitted theforce of any one of Chuang Tzu's destructive criticisms we should have toput some check on our national habit of self-glorification; and the onlything that ever consoles man for the stupid things he does is the praisehe always gives himself for doing them.  There may, however, be a few whohave grown wearied of that strange modern tendency that sets enthusiasmto do the work of the intellect.  To these, and such as these, Chuang Tzuwill be welcome.  But let them only read him.  Let them not talk abouthim.  He would be disturbing at dinner-parties, and impossible atafternoon teas, and his whole life was a protest against platformspeaking.  'The perfect man ignores self; the divine man ignores action;the true sage ignores reputation.'  These are the principles of ChuangTzu.Chuang Tzu: Mystic, Moralist, and Social Reformer.  Translated from theChinese by Herbert A. Giles, H.B.M.'s Consul at Tamsui.  (BernardQuaritch.)MR. PATER'S LAST VOLUME(Speaker, March 22, 1890.)When I first had the privilege--and I count it a very high one--ofmeeting Mr. Walter Pater, he said to me, smiling, 'Why do you alwayswrite poetry?  Why do you not write prose?  Prose is so much moredifficult.'It was during my undergraduate days at Oxford; days of lyrical ardour andof studious sonnet-writing; days when one loved the exquisite intricacyand musical repetitions of the ballade, and the villanelle with itslinked long-drawn echoes and its curious completeness; days when onesolemnly sought to discover the proper temper in which a triolet shouldbe written; delightful days, in which, I am glad to say, there was farmore rhyme than reason.I may frankly confess now that at the time I did not quite comprehendwhat Mr. Pater really meant; and it was not till I had carefully studiedhis beautiful and suggestive essays on the Renaissance that I fullyrealised what a wonderful self-conscious art the art of English prose-writing really is, or may be made to be.  Carlyle's stormy rhetoric,Ruskin's winged and passionate eloquence, had seemed to me to spring fromenthusiasm rather than from art.  I do not think I knew then that evenprophets correct their proofs.  As for Jacobean prose, I thought it tooexuberant; and Queen Anne prose appeared to me terribly bald, andirritatingly rational.  But Mr. Pater's essays became to me 'the goldenbook of spirit and sense, the holy writ of beauty.'  They are still thisto me.  It is possible, of course, that I may exaggerate about them.  Icertainly hope that I do; for where there is no exaggeration there is nolove, and where there is no love there is no understanding.  It is onlyabout things that do not interest one, that one can give a reallyunbiassed opinion; and this is no doubt the reason why an unbiassedopinion is always valueless.But I must not allow this brief notice of Mr. Pater's new volume todegenerate into an autobiography.  I remember being told in America thatwhenever Margaret Fuller wrote an essay upon Emerson the printers hadalways to send out to borrow some additional capital 'I's,' and I feel itright to accept this transatlantic warning.Appreciations, in the fine Latin sense of the word, is the title given byMr. Pater to his book, which is an exquisite collection of exquisiteessays, of delicately wrought works of art--some of them being almostGreek in their purity of outline and perfection of form, others mediaevalin their strangeness of colour and passionate suggestion, and all of themabsolutely modern, in the true meaning of the term modernity.  For he towhom the present is the only thing that is present, knows nothing of theage in which he lives.  To realise the nineteenth century one mustrealise every century that has preceded it, and that has contributed toits making.  To know anything about oneself, one must know all aboutothers.  There must be no mood with which one cannot sympathise, no deadmode of life that one cannot make alive.  The legacies of heredity maymake us alter our views of moral responsibility, but they cannot butintensify our sense of the value of Criticism; for the true critic is hewho bears within himself the dreams and ideas and feelings of myriadgenerations, and to whom no form of thought is alien, no emotionalimpulse obscure.Perhaps the most interesting, and certainly the least successful, of theessays contained in the present volume is that on Style.  It is the mostinteresting because it is the work of one who speaks with the highauthority that comes from the noble realisation of things noblyconceived.  It is the least successful, because the subject is tooabstract.  A true artist like Mr. Pater is most felicitous when he dealswith the concrete, whose very limitations give him finer freedom, whilethey necessitate more intense vision.  And yet what a high ideal iscontained in these few pages!  How good it is for us, in these days ofpopular education and facile journalism, to be reminded of the realscholarship that is essential to the perfect writer, who, 'being a truelover of words for their own sake, a minute and constant observer oftheir physiognomy,' will avoid what is mere rhetoric, or ostentatiousornament, or negligent misuse of terms, or ineffective surplusage, andwill be known by his tact of omission, by his skilful economy of means,by his selection and self-restraint, and perhaps above all by thatconscious artistic structure which is the expression of mind in style.  Ithink I have been wrong in saying that the subject is too abstract.  InMr. Pater's hands it becomes very real to us indeed, and he shows us how,behind the perfection of a man's style, must lie the passion of a man'ssoul.As one passes to the rest of the volume, one finds essays on Wordsworthand on Coleridge, on Charles Lamb and on Sir Thomas Browne, on some ofShakespeare's plays and on the English kings that Shakespeare fashioned,on Dante Rossetti, and on William Morris.  As that on Wordsworth seems tobe Mr. Pater's last work, so that on the singer of the Defence ofGuenevere is certainly his earliest, or almost his earliest, and it isinteresting to mark the change that has taken place in his style.  Thischange is, perhaps, at first sight not very apparent.  In 1868 we findMr. Pater writing with the same exquisite care for words, with the samestudied music, with the same temper, and something of the same mode oftreatment.  But, as he goes on, the architecture of the style becomesricher and more complex, the epithet more precise and intellectual.Occasionally one may be inclined to think that there is, here and there,a sentence which is somewhat long, and possibly, if one may venture tosay so, a little heavy and cumbersome in movement.  But if this be so, itcomes from those side-issues suddenly suggested by the idea in itsprogress, and really revealing the idea more perfectly; or from thosefelicitous after-thoughts that give a fuller completeness to the centralscheme, and yet convey something of the charm of chance; or from a desireto suggest the secondary shades of meaning with all their accumulatingeffect, and to avoid, it may be, the violence and harshness of toodefinite and exclusive an opinion.  For in matters of art, at any rate,thought is inevitably coloured by emotion, and so is fluid rather thanfixed, and, recognising its dependence upon moods and upon the passion offine moments, will not accept the rigidity of a scientific formula or atheological dogma.  The critical pleasure, too, that we receive fromtracing, through what may seem the intricacies of a sentence, the workingof the constructive intelligence, must not be overlooked.  As soon as wehave realised the design, everything appears clear and simple.  After atime, these long sentences of Mr. Pater's come to have the charm of anelaborate piece of music, and the unity of such music also.I have suggested that the essay on Wordsworth is probably the most recentbit of work contained in this volume.  If one might choose between somuch that is good, I should be inclined to say it is the finest also.  Theessay on Lamb is curiously suggestive; suggestive, indeed, of a somewhatmore tragic, more sombre figure, than men have been wont to think of inconnection with the author of the Essays of Elia.  It is an interestingaspect under which to regard Lamb, but perhaps he himself would have hadsome difficulty in recognising the portrait given of him.  He had,undoubtedly, great sorrows, or motives for sorrow, but he could consolehimself at a moment's notice for the real tragedies of life by readingany one of the Elizabethan tragedies, provided it was in a folio edition.The essay on Sir Thomas Browne is delightful, and has the strange,personal, fanciful charm of the author of the Religio Medici, Mr. Pateroften catching the colour and accent and tone of whatever artist, or workof art, he deals with.  That on Coleridge, with its insistence on thenecessity of the cultivation of the relative, as opposed to the absolutespirit in philosophy and in ethics, and its high appreciation of thepoet's true position in our literature, is in style and substance a veryblameless work.  Grace of expression and delicate subtlety of thought andphrase, characterise the essays on Shakespeare.  But the essay onWordsworth has a spiritual beauty of its own.  It appeals, not to theordinary Wordsworthian with his uncritical temper, and his grossconfusion of ethical and aesthetical problems, but rather to those whodesire to separate the gold from the dross, and to reach at the trueWordsworth through the mass of tedious and prosaic work that bears hisname, and that serves often to conceal him from us.  The presence of analien element in Wordsworth's art is, of course, recognised by Mr. Pater,but he touches on it merely from the psychological point of view,pointing out how this quality of higher and lower moods gives the effectin his poetry 'of a power not altogether his own, or under his control';a power which comes and goes when it wills, 'so that the old fancy whichmade the poet's art an enthusiasm, a form of divine possession, seemsalmost true of him.'  Mr. Pater's earlier essays had their purpureipanni, so eminently suitable for quotation, such as the famous passage onMona Lisa, and that other in which Botticelli's strange conception of theVirgin is so strangely set forth.  From the present volume it isdifficult to select any one passage in preference to another as speciallycharacteristic of Mr. Pater's treatment.  This, however, is worth quotingat length.  It contains a truth eminently suitable for our age:   That the end of life is not action but contemplation--_being_ as   distinct from _doing_--a certain disposition of the mind: is, in some   shape or other, the principle of all the higher morality.  In poetry,   in art, if you enter into their true spirit at all, you touch this   principle in a measure; these, by their sterility, are a type of   beholding for the mere joy of beholding.  To treat life in the spirit   of art is to make life a thing in which means and ends are identified:   to encourage such treatment, the true moral significance of art and   poetry.  Wordsworth, and other poets who have been like him in ancient   or more recent times, are the masters, the experts, in this art of   impassioned contemplation.  Their work is not to teach lessons, or   enforce rules, or even to stimulate us to noble ends, but to withdraw   the thoughts for a while from the mere machinery of life, to fix them,   with appropriate emotions, on the spectacle of those great facts in   man's existence which no machinery affects, 'on the great and   universal passions of men, the most general and interesting of their   occupations, and the entire world of nature'--on 'the operations of   the elements and the appearances of the visible universe, on storm and   sunshine, on the revolutions of the seasons, on cold and heat, on loss   of friends and kindred, on injuries and resentments, on gratitude and   hope, on fear and sorrow.'  To witness this spectacle with appropriate   emotions is the aim of all culture; and of these emotions poetry like   Wordsworth's is a great nourisher and stimulant.  He sees nature full   of sentiment and excitement; he sees men and women as parts of nature,   passionate, excited, in strange grouping and connection with the   grandeur and beauty of the natural world:--images, in his own words,   'of men suffering, amid awful forms and powers.'Certainly the real secret of Wordsworth has never been better expressed.After having read and reread Mr. Pater's essay--for it requiresre-reading--one returns to the poet's work with a new sense of joy andwonder, and with something of eager and impassioned expectation.  Andperhaps this might be roughly taken as the test or touchstone of thefinest criticism.Finally, one cannot help noticing the delicate instinct that has gone tofashion the brief epilogue that ends this delightful volume.  Thedifference between the classical and romantic spirits in art has often,and with much over-emphasis, been discussed.  But with what a light suretouch does Mr. Pater write of it!  How subtle and certain are hisdistinctions!  If imaginative prose be really the special art of thiscentury, Mr. Pater must rank amongst our century's most characteristicartists.  In certain things he stands almost alone.  The age has producedwonderful prose styles, turbid with individualism, and violent withexcess of rhetoric.  But in Mr. Pater, as in Cardinal Newman, we find theunion of personality with perfection.  He has no rival in his own sphere,and he has escaped disciples.  And this, not because he has not beenimitated, but because in art so fine as his there is something that, inits essence, is inimitable.Appreciations, with an Essay on Style.  By Walter Pater, Fellow ofBrasenose College.  (Macmillan and Co.)PRIMAVERA(Pall Mall Gazette, May 24, 1890.)In the summer term Oxford teaches the exquisite art of idleness, one ofthe most important things that any University can teach, and possibly asthe first-fruits of the dreaming in grey cloister and silent garden,which either makes or mars a man, there has just appeared in that lovelycity a dainty and delightful volume of poems by four friends.  These newyoung singers are Mr. Laurence Binyon, who has just gained the Newdigate;Mr. Manmohan Ghose, a young Indian of brilliant scholarship and highliterary attainments who gives some culture to Christ Church; Mr. StephenPhillips, whose recent performance of the Ghost in Hamlet at the GlobeTheatre was so admirable in its dignity and elocution; and Mr. ArthurCripps, of Trinity.  Particular interest attaches naturally to Mr.Ghose's work.  Born in India, of purely Indian parentage, he has beenbrought up entirely in England, and was educated at St. Paul's School,and his verses show us how quick and subtle are the intellectualsympathies of the Oriental mind, and suggest how close is the bond ofunion that may some day bind India to us by other methods than those ofcommerce and military strength.There is something charming in finding a young Indian using our languagewith such care for music and words as Mr. Ghose does.  Here is one of hissongs:   Over thy head, in joyful wanderings      Through heaven's wide spaces, free,   Birds fly with music in their wings;      _And from the blue, rough sea      The fishes flash and leap_;   There is a life of loveliest things      O'er thee, so fast asleep.   In the deep West the heavens grow heavenlier,      Eve after eve; _and still   The glorious stars remember to appear_;      The roses on the hill      Are fragrant as before:   Only thy face, of all that's dear,      I shall see nevermore!It has its faults.  It has a great many faults.  But the lines we haveset in italics are lovely.  The temper of Keats, the moods of MatthewArnold, have influenced Mr. Ghose, and what better influence could abeginner have?  Here are some stanzas from another of Mr. Ghose's poems:   Deep-shaded will I lie, and deeper yet      In night, where not a leaf its neighbour knows;   Forget the shining of the stars, forget      The vernal visitation of the rose;   And, far from all delights, prepare my heart's repose.   'O crave not silence thou! too soon, too sure,      Shall Autumn come, and through these branches weep:   Some birds shall cease, and flowers no more endure;      And thou beneath the mould unwilling creep,   And silent soon shalt be in that eternal sleep.   'Green still it is, where that fair goddess strays;      Then follow, till around thee all be sere.   Lose not a vision of her passing face;      Nor miss the sound of her soft robes, that here   Sweep over the wet leaves of the fast-falling year.'The second line is very beautiful, and the whole shows culture and tasteand feeling.  Mr. Ghose ought some day to make a name in our literature.Mr. Stephen Phillips has a more solemn classical Muse.  His best work ishis Orestes:   Me in far lands did Justice call, cold queen   Among the dead, who, after heat and haste   At length have leisure for her steadfast voice,   That gathers peace from the great deeps of hell.   She call'd me, saying: I heard a cry by night!   Go thou, and question not; within thy halls   My will awaits fulfilment.   . . . . . .      And she lies there,   My mother! ay, my mother now; O hair   That once I play'd with in these halls!  O eyes   That for a moment knew me as I came,   And lighten'd up, and trembled into love;   The next were darkened by my hand!  Ah me!   Ye will not look upon me in that world.   Yet thou, perchance, art happier, if thou go'st   Into some land of wind and drifting leaves,   To sleep without a star; but as for me,   Hell hungers, and the restless Furies wait.Milton, and the method of Greek tragedy are Mr. Phillips's influences,and again we may say, what better influences could a young singer have?His verse is dignified, and has distinction.* * * * *Mr. Cripps is melodious at times, and Mr. Binyon, Oxford's latestLaureate, shows us in his lyrical ode on Youth that he can handle adifficult metre dexterously, and in this sonnet that he can catch thesweet echoes that sleep in the sonnets of Shakespeare:   I cannot raise my eyelids up from sleep,   But I am visited with thoughts of you;   Slumber has no refreshment half so deep   As the sweet morn, that wakes my heart anew.   I cannot put away life's trivial care,   But you straightway steal on me with delight:   My purest moments are your mirror fair;   My deepest thought finds you the truth most bright   You are the lovely regent of my mind,   The constant sky to the unresting sea;   Yet, since 'tis you that rule me, I but find   A finer freedom in such tyranny.   Were the world's anxious kingdoms govern'd so,   Lost were their wrongs, and vanish'd half their woe!On the whole Primavera is a pleasant little book, and we are glad towelcome it.  It is charmingly 'got up,' and undergraduates might read itwith advantage during lecture hours.Primavera: Poems.  By Four Authors.  (Oxford: B. H.

I left Cairo withinan hour or two after the receipt of this dispatch, going by rail viaIndianapolis. Just as the train I was on was starting out of the depotat Indianapolis a messenger came running up to stop it, saying theSecretary of War was coming into the station and wanted to see me.I had never met Mr. Stanton up to that time, though we had held frequentconversations over the wires the year before, when I was in Tennessee.Occasionally at night he would order the wires between the WarDepartment and my headquarters to be connected, and we would hold aconversation for an hour or two.  On this occasion the Secretary wasaccompanied by Governor Brough of Ohio, whom I had never met, though heand my father had been old acquaintances.  Mr. Stanton dismissed thespecial train that had brought him to Indianapolis, and accompanied meto Louisville.Up to this time no hint had been given me of what was wanted after Ileft Vicksburg, except the suggestion in one of Halleck's dispatchesthat I had better go to Nashville and superintend the operation oftroops sent to relieve Rosecrans. Soon after we started the Secretaryhanded me two orders, saying that I might take my choice of them.  Thetwo were identical in all but one particular.  Both created the"Military Division of Mississippi," (giving me the command) composed ofthe Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the Tennessee, and allthe territory from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi River north ofBanks's command in the south-west.  One order left the departmentcommanders as they were, while the other relieved Rosecrans and assignedThomas to his place.  I accepted the latter.  We reached Louisvilleafter night and, if I remember rightly, in a cold, drizzling rain.  TheSecretary of War told me afterwards that he caught a cold on thatoccasion from which he never expected to recover.  He never did.A day was spent in Louisville, the Secretary giving me the military newsat the capital and talking about the disappointment at the results ofsome of the campaigns.  By the evening of the day after our arrival allmatters of discussion seemed exhausted, and I left the hotel to spendthe evening away, both Mrs. Grant (who was with me) and myself havingrelatives living in Louisville.  In the course of the evening Mr.Stanton received a dispatch from Mr. C. A. Dana, then in Chattanooga,informing him that unless prevented Rosecrans would retreat, andadvising peremptory orders against his doing so.As stated before, after the fall of Vicksburg I urged strongly upon thegovernment the propriety of a movement against Mobile.  GeneralRosecrans had been at Murfreesboro', Tennessee, with a large andwell-equipped army from early in the year 1863, with Bragg confrontinghim with a force quite equal to his own at first, considering it was onthe defensive.  But after the investment of Vicksburg Bragg's army waslargely depleted to strengthen Johnston, in Mississippi, who was beingreinforced to raise the siege.  I frequently wrote General Hallecksuggesting that Rosecrans should move against Bragg.  By so doing hewould either detain the latter's troops where they were or layChattanooga open to capture.  General Halleck strongly approved thesuggestion, and finally wrote me that he had repeatedly orderedRosecrans to advance, but that the latter had constantly failed tocomply with the order, and at last, after having held a council of war,had replied in effect that it was a military maxim "not to fight twodecisive battles at the same time."  If true, the maxim was notapplicable in this case.  It would be bad to be defeated in two decisivebattles fought the same day, but it would not be bad to win them.  I,however, was fighting no battle, and the siege of Vicksburg had drawnfrom Rosecrans' front so many of the enemy that his chances of victorywere much greater than they would be if he waited until the siege wasover, when these troops could be returned.  Rosecrans was ordered tomove against the army that was detaching troops to raise the siege.Finally he did move, on the 24th of June, but ten days afterwardsVicksburg surrendered, and the troops sent from Bragg were free toreturn.It was at this time that I recommended to the general-in-chief themovement against Mobile.  I knew the peril the Army of the Cumberlandwas in, being depleted continually, not only by ordinary casualties, butalso by having to detach troops to hold its constantly extending lineover which to draw supplies, while the enemy in front was as constantlybeing strengthened.  Mobile was important to the enemy, and in theabsence of a threatening force was guarded by little else thanartillery.  If threatened by land and from the water at the same timethe prize would fall easily, or troops would have to be sent to itsdefence.  Those troops would necessarily come from Bragg.  My judgmentwas overruled, and the troops under my command were dissipated overother parts of the country where it was thought they could render themost service.Soon it was discovered in Washington that Rosecrans was in trouble andrequired assistance.  The emergency was now too immediate to allow us togive this assistance by making an attack in rear of Bragg upon Mobile.It was therefore necessary to reinforce directly, and troops were sentfrom every available point.Rosecrans had very skilfully manoeuvred Bragg south of the TennesseeRiver, and through and beyond Chattanooga. If he had stopped andintrenched, and made himself strong there, all would have been right andthe mistake of not moving earlier partially compensated.  But he pushedon, with his forces very much scattered, until Bragg's troops fromMississippi began to join him.  Then Bragg took the initiative.Rosecrans had to fall back in turn, and was able to get his armytogether at Chickamauga, some miles south-east of Chattanooga, beforethe main battle was brought on.  The battle was fought on the 19th and20th of September, and Rosecrans was badly defeated, with a heavy lossin artillery and some sixteen thousand men killed, wounded and captured.The corps under Major-General George H. Thomas stood its ground, whileRosecrans, with Crittenden and McCook, returned to Chattanooga. Thomasreturned also, but later, and with his troops in good order.  Braggfollowed and took possession of Missionary Ridge, overlookingChattanooga. He also occupied Lookout Mountain, west of the town, whichRosecrans had abandoned, and with it his control of the river and theriver road as far back as Bridgeport.  The National troops were nowstrongly intrenched in Chattanooga Valley, with the Tennessee Riverbehind them and the enemy occupying commanding heights to the east andwest, with a strong line across the valley from mountain to mountain,and with Chattanooga Creek, for a large part of the way, in front oftheir line.On the 29th Halleck telegraphed me the above results, and directed allthe forces that could be spared from my department to be sent toRosecrans.  Long before this dispatch was received Sherman was on hisway, and McPherson was moving east with most of the garrison ofVicksburg.A retreat at that time would have been a terrible disaster.  It wouldnot only have been the loss of a most important strategic position tous, but it would have been attended with the loss of all the artillerystill left with the Army of the Cumberland and the annihilation of thatarmy itself, either by capture or demoralization.All supplies for Rosecrans had to be brought from Nashville. Therailroad between this base and the army was in possession of thegovernment up to Bridgeport, the point at which the road crosses to thesouth side of the Tennessee River; but Bragg, holding Lookout andRaccoon mountains west of Chattanooga, commanded the railroad, the riverand the shortest and best wagon-roads, both south and north of theTennessee, between Chattanooga and Bridgeport.  The distance betweenthese two places is but twenty-six miles by rail, but owing to theposition of Bragg, all supplies for Rosecrans had to be hauled by acircuitous route north of the river and over a mountainous country,increasing the distance to over sixty miles.This country afforded but little food for his animals, nearly tenthousand of which had already starved, and not enough were left to drawa single piece of artillery or even the ambulances to convey the sick.The men had been on half rations of hard bread for a considerable time,with but few other supplies except beef driven from Nashville across thecountry.  The region along the road became so exhausted of food for thecattle that by the time they reached Chattanooga they were much in thecondition of the few animals left alive there--"on the lift." Indeed,the beef was so poor that the soldiers were in the habit of saying, witha faint facetiousness, that they were living on "half rations of hardbread and BEEF DRIED ON THE HOOF."Nothing could be transported but food, and the troops were withoutsufficient shoes or other clothing suitable for the advancing season.What they had was well worn.  The fuel within the Federal lines wasexhausted, even to the stumps of trees. There were no teams to draw itfrom the opposite bank, where it was abundant.  The only way ofsupplying fuel, for some time before my arrival, had been to cut treeson the north bank of the river at a considerable distance up the stream,form rafts of it and float it down with the current, effecting a landingon the south side within our lines by the use of paddles or poles. Itwould then be carried on the shoulders of the men to their camps.If a retreat had occurred at this time it is not probable that any ofthe army would have reached the railroad as an organized body, iffollowed by the enemy.On the receipt of Mr. Dana's dispatch Mr. Stanton sent for me. Findingthat I was out he became nervous and excited, inquiring of every personhe met, including guests of the house, whether they knew where I was,and bidding them find me and send me to him at once.  About eleveno'clock I returned to the hotel, and on my way, when near the house,every person met was a messenger from the Secretary, apparentlypartaking of his impatience to see me.  I hastened to the room of theSecretary and found him pacing the floor rapidly in his dressing-gown.Saying that the retreat must be prevented, he showed me the dispatch.  Iimmediately wrote an order assuming command of the Military Division ofthe Mississippi, and telegraphed it to General Rosecrans.  I thentelegraphed to him the order from Washington assigning Thomas to thecommand of the Army of the Cumberland; and to Thomas that he must holdChattanooga at all hazards, informing him at the same time that I wouldbe at the front as soon as possible.  A prompt reply was received fromThomas, saying, "We will hold the town till we starve."  I appreciatedthe force of this dispatch later when I witnessed the condition ofaffairs which prompted it.  It looked, indeed, as if but two courseswere open:  one to starve, the other to surrender or be captured.On the morning of the 20th of October I started, with my staff, andproceeded as far as Nashville.  At that time it was not prudent totravel beyond that point by night, so I remained in Nashville until thenext morning.  Here I met for the first time Andrew Johnson, MilitaryGovernor of Tennessee.  He delivered a speech of welcome.  His composureshowed that it was by no means his maiden effort.  It was long, and Iwas in torture while he was delivering it, fearing something would beexpected from me in response.  I was relieved, however, the peopleassembled having apparently heard enough.  At all events they commenceda general hand-shaking, which, although trying where there is so much ofit, was a great relief to me in this emergency.From Nashville I telegraphed to Burnside, who was then at Knoxville,that important points in his department ought to be fortified, so thatthey could be held with the least number of men; to Admiral Porter atCairo, that Sherman's advance had passed Eastport, Mississippi, thatrations were probably on their way from St. Louis by boat for supplyinghis army, and requesting him to send a gunboat to convoy them; and toThomas, suggesting that large parties should be put at work on thewagon-road then in use back to Bridgeport.On the morning of the 21st we took the train for the front, reachingStevenson Alabama, after dark.  Rosecrans was there on his way north.He came into my car and we held a brief interview, in which he describedvery clearly the situation at Chattanooga, and made some excellentsuggestions as to what should be done.  My only wonder was that he hadnot carried them out.  We then proceeded to Bridgeport, where we stoppedfor the night.  From here we took horses and made our way by Jasper andover Waldron's Ridge to Chattanooga. There had been much rain, and theroads were almost impassable from mud, knee-deep in places, and fromwash-outs on the mountain sides.  I had been on crutches since the timeof my fall in New Orleans, and had to be carried over places where itwas not safe to cross on horseback.  The roads were strewn with thedebris of broken wagons and the carcasses of thousands of starved mulesand horses.  At Jasper, some ten or twelve miles from Bridgeport, therewas a halt.  General O. O. Howard had his headquarters there.  From thispoint I telegraphed Burnside to make every effort to secure five hundredrounds of ammunition for his artillery and small-arms.  We stopped forthe night at a little hamlet some ten or twelve miles farther on.  Thenext day we reached Chattanooga a little before dark.  I went directlyto General Thomas's headquarters, and remaining there a few days, untilI could establish my own.During the evening most of the general officers called in to pay theirrespects and to talk about the condition of affairs.  They pointed outon the map the line, marked with a red or blue pencil, which Rosecranshad contemplated falling back upon.  If any of them had approved themove they did not say so to me.  I found General W. F. Smith occupyingthe position of chief engineer of the Army of the Cumberland.  I hadknown Smith as a cadet at West Point, but had no recollection of havingmet him after my graduation, in 1843, up to this time.  He explained thesituation of the two armies and the topography of the country so plainlythat I could see it without an inspection.  I found that he hadestablished a saw-mill on the banks of the river, by utilizing an oldengine found in the neighborhood; and, by rafting logs from the northside of the river above, had got out the lumber and completed pontoonsand roadway plank for a second bridge, one flying bridge being therealready.  He was also rapidly getting out the materials and constructingthe boats for a third bridge.  In addition to this he had far under waya steamer for plying between Chattanooga and Bridgeport whenever wemight get possession of the river.  This boat consisted of a scow, madeof the plank sawed out at the mill, housed in, and a stern wheelattached which was propelled by a second engine taken from some shop orfactory.I telegraphed to Washington this night, notifying General Halleck of myarrival, and asking to have General Sherman assigned to the command ofthe Army of the Tennessee, headquarters in the field.  The request wasat once complied with.CHAPTER XLI.ASSUMING THE COMMAND AT CHATTANOOGA--OPENING A LINE OF SUPPLIES--BATTLEOF WAUHATCHIE--ON THE PICKET LINE.The next day, the 24th, I started out to make a personal inspection,taking Thomas and Smith with me, besides most of the members of mypersonal staff.  We crossed to the north side of the river, and, movingto the north of detached spurs of hills, reached the Tennessee atBrown's Ferry, some three miles below Lookout Mountain, unobserved bythe enemy.  Here we left our horses back from the river and approachedthe water on foot. There was a picket station of the enemy on theopposite side, of about twenty men, in full view, and we were withineasy range. They did not fire upon us nor seem to be disturbed by ourpresence.  They must have seen that we were all commissioned officers.But, I suppose, they looked upon the garrison of Chattanooga asprisoners of war, feeding or starving themselves, and thought it wouldbe inhuman to kill any of them except in self-defence.That night I issued orders for opening the route to Bridgeport--acracker line, as the soldiers appropriately termed it.  They had been solong on short rations that my first thought was the establishment of aline over which food might reach them.Chattanooga is on the south bank of the Tennessee, where that river runsnearly due west.  It is at the northern end of a valley five or sixmiles in width, through which Chattanooga Creek runs.  To the east ofthe valley is Missionary Ridge, rising from five to eight hundred feetabove the creek and terminating somewhat abruptly a half mile or morebefore reaching the Tennessee.  On the west of the valley is LookoutMountain, twenty-two hundred feet above-tide water.  Just below the townthe Tennessee makes a turn to the south and runs to the base of LookoutMountain, leaving no level ground between the mountain and river.  TheMemphis and Charleston Railroad passes this point, where the mountainstands nearly perpendicular. East of Missionary Ridge flows the SouthChickamauga River; west of Lookout Mountain is Lookout Creek; and westof that, Raccoon Mountains.  Lookout Mountain, at its northern end,rises almost perpendicularly for some distance, then breaks off in agentle slope of cultivated fields to near the summit, where it ends in apalisade thirty or more feet in height.  On the gently sloping ground,between the upper and lower palisades, there is a single farmhouse,which is reached by a wagon-road from the valley east.The intrenched line of the enemy commenced on the north end ofMissionary Ridge and extended along the crest for some distance south,thence across Chattanooga valley to Lookout Mountain. Lookout Mountainwas also fortified and held by the enemy, who also kept troops inLookout valley west, and on Raccoon Mountain, with pickets extendingdown the river so as to command the road on the north bank and render ituseless to us.  In addition to this there was an intrenched line inChattanooga valley extending from the river east of the town to LookoutMountain, to make the investment complete.  Besides the fortificationson Mission Ridge, there was a line at the base of the hill, withoccasional spurs of rifle-pits half-way up the front.  The enemy'spickets extended out into the valley towards the town, so far that thepickets of the two armies could converse.  At one point they wereseparated only by the narrow creek which gives its name to the valleyand town, and from which both sides drew water.  The Union lines wereshorter than those of the enemy.Thus the enemy, with a vastly superior force, was strongly fortified tothe east, south, and west, and commanded the river below.  Practically,the Army of the Cumberland was besieged. The enemy had stopped with hiscavalry north of the river the passing of a train loaded with ammunitionand medical supplies.  The Union army was short of both, not havingammunition enough for a day's fighting.General Halleck had, long before my coming into this new field, orderedparts of the 11th and 12th corps, commanded respectively by GeneralsHoward and Slocum, Hooker in command of the whole, from the Army of thePotomac to reinforce Rosecrans.  It would have been folly to send themto Chattanooga to help eat up the few rations left there.  They wereconsequently left on the railroad, where supplies could be brought tothem.  Before my arrival, Thomas ordered their concentration atBridgeport.General W. F. Smith had been so instrumental in preparing for the movewhich I was now about to make, and so clear in his judgment about themanner of making it, that I deemed it but just to him that he shouldhave command of the troops detailed to execute the design, although hewas then acting as a staff officer and was not in command of troops.On the 24th of October, after my return to Chattanooga, the followingdetails were made:  General Hooker, who was now at Bridgeport, wasordered to cross to the south side of the Tennessee and march up byWhitesides and Wauhatchie to Brown's Ferry.  General Palmer, with adivision of the 14th corps, Army of the Cumberland, was ordered to movedown the river on the north side, by a back road, until oppositeWhitesides, then cross and hold the road in Hooker's rear after he hadpassed. Four thousand men were at the same time detailed to act underGeneral Smith directly from Chattanooga. Eighteen hundred of them, underGeneral Hazen, were to take sixty pontoon boats, and under cover ofnight float by the pickets of the enemy at the north base of Lookout,down to Brown's Ferry, then land on the south side and capture or driveaway the pickets at that point.  Smith was to march with the remainderof the detail, also under cover of night, by the north bank of the riverto Brown's Ferry, taking with him all the material for laying the bridgeas soon as the crossing was secured.On the 26th, Hooker crossed the river at Bridgeport and commenced hiseastward march.  At three o'clock on the morning of the 27th, Hazenmoved into the stream with his sixty pontoons and eighteen hundred braveand well-equipped men.  Smith started enough in advance to be near theriver when Hazen should arrive.  There are a number of detached spurs ofhills north of the river at Chattanooga, back of which is a good roadparallel to the stream, sheltered from the view from the top of Lookout.It was over this road Smith marched.  At five o'clock Hazen landed atBrown's Ferry, surprised the picket guard, and captured most of it.  Byseven o'clock the whole of Smith's force was ferried over and inpossession of a height commanding the ferry.  This was speedilyfortified, while a detail was laying the pontoon bridge.  By ten o'clockthe bridge was laid, and our extreme right, now in Lookout valley, wasfortified and connected with the rest of the army.  The two bridges overthe Tennessee River--a flying one at Chattanooga and the new one atBrown's Ferry--with the road north of the river, covered from both thefire and the view of the enemy, made the connection complete.  Hookerfound but slight obstacles in his way, and on the afternoon of the 28themerged into Lookout valley at Wauhatchie.  Howard marched on to Brown'sFerry, while Geary, who commanded a division in the 12th corps, stoppedthree miles south.  The pickets of the enemy on the river below were nowcut off, and soon came in and surrendered.The river was now opened to us from Lookout valley to Bridgeport.Between Brown's Ferry and Kelly's Ferry the Tennessee runs through anarrow gorge in the mountains, which contracts the stream so much as toincrease the current beyond the capacity of an ordinary steamer to stemit.  To get up these rapids, steamers must be cordelled; that is, pulledup by ropes from the shore.  But there is no difficulty in navigatingthe stream from Bridgeport to Kelly's Ferry.  The latter point is onlyeight miles from Chattanooga and connected with it by a good wagon-road,which runs through a low pass in the Raccoon Mountains on the south sideof the river to Brown's Ferry, thence on the north side to the riveropposite Chattanooga. There were several steamers at Bridgeport, andabundance of forage, clothing and provisions.On the way to Chattanooga I had telegraphed back to Nashville for a goodsupply of vegetables and small rations, which the troops had been solong deprived of.  Hooker had brought with him from the east a fullsupply of land transportation.  His animals had not been subjected tohard work on bad roads without forage, but were in good condition.  Infive days from my arrival in Chattanooga the way was open to Bridgeportand, with the aid of steamers and Hooker's teams, in a week the troopswere receiving full rations.  It is hard for any one not an eye-witnessto realize the relief this brought.  The men were soon reclothed andalso well fed, an abundance of ammunition was brought up, and acheerfulness prevailed not before enjoyed in many weeks.  Neitherofficers nor men looked upon themselves any longer as doomed.  The weakand languid appearance of the troops, so visible before, disappeared atonce.  I do not know what the effect was on the other side, but assumeit must have been correspondingly depressing.  Mr. Davis had visitedBragg but a short time before, and must have perceived our condition tobe about as Bragg described it in his subsequent report.  "Thesedispositions," he said, "faithfully sustained, insured the enemy'sspeedy evacuation of Chattanooga for want of food and forage.  Possessedof the shortest route to his depot, and the one by which reinforcementsmust reach him, we held him at our mercy, and his destruction was only aquestion of time."  But the dispositions were not "faithfullysustained," and I doubt not but thousands of men engaged in trying to"sustain" them now rejoice that they were not.  There was no time duringthe rebellion when I did not think, and often say, that the South wasmore to be benefited by its defeat than the North.  The latter had thepeople, the institutions, and the territory to make a great andprosperous nation.  The former was burdened with an institutionabhorrent to all civilized people not brought up under it, and one whichdegraded labor, kept it in ignorance, and enervated the governing class.With the outside world at war with this institution, they could not haveextended their territory.  The labor of the country was not skilled, norallowed to become so.  The whites could not toil without becomingdegraded, and those who did were denominated "poor white trash."  Thesystem of labor would have soon exhausted the soil and left the peoplepoor.  The non-slaveholders would have left the country, and the smallslaveholder must have sold out to his more fortunate neighbor.  Soon theslaves would have outnumbered the masters, and, not being in sympathywith them, would have risen in their might and exterminated them.  Thewar was expensive to the South as well as to the North, both in bloodand treasure, but it was worth all it cost.The enemy was surprised by the movements which secured to us a line ofsupplies.  He appreciated its importance, and hastened to try to recoverthe line from us.  His strength on Lookout Mountain was not equal toHooker's command in the valley below.  From Missionary Ridge he had tomarch twice the distance we had from Chattanooga, in order to reachLookout Valley; but on the night of the 28th and 29th an attack was madeon Geary at Wauhatchie by Longstreet's corps.  When the battlecommenced, Hooker ordered Howard up from Brown's Ferry.  He had threemiles to march to reach Geary.  On his way he was fired upon by rebeltroops from a foot-hill to the left of the road and from which the roadwas commanded.  Howard turned to the left, charged up the hill andcaptured it before the enemy had time to intrench, taking manyprisoners.  Leaving sufficient men to hold this height, he pushed on toreinforce Geary.  Before he got up, Geary had been engaged for aboutthree hours against a vastly superior force.  The night was so dark thatthe men could not distinguish one from another except by the light ofthe flashes of their muskets.  In the darkness and uproar Hooker'steamsters became frightened and deserted their teams.  The mules alsobecame frightened, and breaking loose from their fastenings stampededdirectly towards the enemy.  The latter, no doubt, took this for acharge, and stampeded in turn.  By four o'clock in the morning thebattle had entirely ceased, and our "cracker line" was never afterwarddisturbed.In securing possession of Lookout Valley, Smith lost one man killed andfour or five wounded.  The enemy lost most of his pickets at the ferry,captured.  In the night engagement of the 28th-9th Hooker lost 416killed and wounded.  I never knew the loss of the enemy, but our troopsburied over one hundred and fifty of his dead and captured more than ahundred.After we had secured the opening of a line over which to bring oursupplies to the army, I made a personal inspection to see the situationof the pickets of the two armies.  As I have stated, Chattanooga Creekcomes down the centre of the valley to within a mile or such a matter ofthe town of Chattanooga, then bears off westerly, then north-westerly,and enters the Tennessee River at the foot of Lookout Mountain.  Thiscreek, from its mouth up to where it bears off west, lay between the twolines of pickets, and the guards of both armies drew their water fromthe same stream.  As I would be under short-range fire and in an opencountry, I took nobody with me, except, I believe, a bugler, who stayedsome distance to the rear.  I rode from our right around to our left.When I came to the camp of the picket guard of our side, I heard thecall, "Turn out the guard for the commanding general."  I replied,"Never mind the guard," and they were dismissed and went back to theirtents. Just back of these, and about equally distant from the creek,were the guards of the Confederate pickets.  The sentinel on their postcalled out in like manner, "Turn out the guard for the commandinggeneral," and, I believe, added, "General Grant."  Their line in amoment front-faced to the north, facing me, and gave a salute, which Ireturned.The most friendly relations seemed to exist between the pickets of thetwo armies.  At one place there was a tree which had fallen across thestream, and which was used by the soldiers of both armies in drawingwater for their camps.  General Longstreet's corps was stationed thereat the time, and wore blue of a little different shade from our uniform.Seeing a soldier in blue on this log, I rode up to him, commencedconversing with him, and asked whose corps he belonged to.  He was verypolite, and, touching his hat to me, said he belonged to GeneralLongstreet's corps.  I asked him a few questions--but not with a view ofgaining any particular information--all of which he answered, and I rodeoff.CHAPTER XLII.CONDITION OF THE ARMY--REBUILDING THE RAILROAD--GENERAL BURNSIDE'SSITUATION--ORDERS FOR BATTLE--PLANS FOR THE ATTACK--HOOKER'S POSITION--SHERMAN'S MOVEMENTS.Having got the Army of the Cumberland in a comfortable position, I nowbegan to look after the remainder of my new command. Burnside was inabout as desperate a condition as the Army of the Cumberland had been,only he was not yet besieged.  He was a hundred miles from the nearestpossible base, Big South Fork of the Cumberland River, and much fartherfrom any railroad we had possession of.  The roads back were overmountains, and all supplies along the line had long since beenexhausted.  His animals, too, had been starved, and their carcasseslined the road from Cumberland Gap, and far back towards Lexington, Ky.East Tennessee still furnished supplies of beef, bread and forage, butit did not supply ammunition, clothing, medical supplies, or smallrations, such as coffee, sugar, salt and rice.Sherman had started from Memphis for Corinth on the 11th of October.His instructions required him to repair the road in his rear in order tobring up supplies.  The distance was about three hundred and thirtymiles through a hostile country.  His entire command could not havemaintained the road if it had been completed.  The bridges had all beendestroyed by the enemy, and much other damage done.  A hostile communitylived along the road; guerilla bands infested the country, and more orless of the cavalry of the enemy was still in the West.  Often Sherman'swork was destroyed as soon as completed, and he only a short distanceaway.The Memphis and Charleston Railroad strikes the Tennessee River atEastport, Mississippi.  Knowing the difficulty Sherman would have tosupply himself from Memphis, I had previously ordered supplies sent fromSt. Louis on small steamers, to be convoyed by the navy, to meet him atEastport.  These he got.  I now ordered him to discontinue his work ofrepairing roads and to move on with his whole force to Stevenson,Alabama, without delay.  This order was borne to Sherman by a messenger,who paddled down the Tennessee in a canoe and floated over MuscleShoals; it was delivered at Iuka on the 27th.  In this Sherman wasnotified that the rebels were moving a force towards Cleveland, EastTennessee, and might be going to Nashville, in which event his troopswere in the best position to beat them there.  Sherman, with hischaracteristic promptness, abandoned the work he was engaged upon andpushed on at once.  On the 1st of November he crossed the Tennessee atEastport, and that day was in Florence, Alabama, with the head ofcolumn, while his troops were still crossing at Eastport, with Blairbringing up the rear.Sherman's force made an additional army, with cavalry, artillery, andtrains, all to be supplied by the single track road from Nashville.  Allindications pointed also to the probable necessity of supplyingBurnside's command in East Tennessee, twenty-five thousand more, by thesame route.  A single track could not do this.  I gave, therefore, anorder to Sherman to halt General G. M. Dodge's command, of about eightthousand men, at Athens, and subsequently directed the latter to arrangehis troops along the railroad from Decatur north towards Nashville, andto rebuild that road.  The road from Nashville to Decatur passes over abroken country, cut up with innumerable streams, many of them ofconsiderable width, and with valleys far below the road-bed.  All thebridges over these had been destroyed, and the rails taken up andtwisted by the enemy.  All the cars and locomotives not carried off hadbeen destroyed as effectually as they knew how to destroy them.  Allbridges and culverts had been destroyed between Nashville and Decatur,and thence to Stevenson, where the Memphis and Charleston and theNashville and Chattanooga roads unite.  The rebuilding of this roadwould give us two roads as far as Stevenson over which to supply thearmy.  From Bridgeport, a short distance farther east, the riversupplements the road.General Dodge, besides being a most capable soldier, was an experiencedrailroad builder.  He had no tools to work with except those of thepioneers--axes, picks, and spades.  With these he was able to intrenchhis men and protect them against surprises by small parties of theenemy.  As he had no base of supplies until the road could be completedback to Nashville, the first matter to consider after protecting his menwas the getting in of food and forage from the surrounding country.  Hehad his men and teams bring in all the grain they could find, or allthey needed, and all the cattle for beef, and such other food as couldbe found.  Millers were detailed from the ranks to run the mills alongthe line of the army.  When these were not near enough to the troops forprotection they were taken down and moved up to the line of the road.Blacksmith shops, with all the iron and steel found in them, were movedup in like manner.  Blacksmiths were detailed and set to work making thetools necessary in railroad and bridge building.  Axemen were put towork getting out timber for bridges and cutting fuel for locomotiveswhen the road should be completed.  Car-builders were set to workrepairing the locomotives and cars.  Thus every branch of railroadbuilding, making tools to work with, and supplying the workmen withfood, was all going on at once, and without the aid of a mechanic orlaborer except what the command itself furnished.  But rails and carsthe men could not make without material, and there was not enoughrolling stock to keep the road we already had worked to its fullcapacity.  There were no rails except those in use.  To supply thesedeficiencies I ordered eight of the ten engines General McPherson had atVicksburg to be sent to Nashville, and all the cars he had except ten.I also ordered the troops in West Tennessee to points on the river andon the Memphis and Charleston road, and ordered the cars, locomotivesand rails from all the railroads except the Memphis and Charleston toNashville.  The military manager of railroads also was directed tofurnish more rolling stock and, as far as he could, bridge material.General Dodge had the work assigned him finished within forty days afterreceiving his orders.  The number of bridges to rebuild was one hundredand eighty-two, many of them over deep and wide chasms; the length ofroad repaired was one hundred and two miles.The enemy's troops, which it was thought were either moving againstBurnside or were going to Nashville, went no farther than Cleveland.Their presence there, however, alarmed the authorities at Washington,and, on account of our helpless condition at Chattanooga, caused me muchuneasiness.  Dispatches were constantly coming, urging me to dosomething for Burnside's relief; calling attention to the importance ofholding East Tennessee; saying the President was much concerned for theprotection of the loyal people in that section, etc.  We had not atChattanooga animals to pull a single piece of artillery, much less asupply train.  Reinforcements could not help Burnside, because he hadneither supplies nor ammunition sufficient for them; hardly, indeed,bread and meat for the men he had.  There was no relief possible for himexcept by expelling the enemy from Missionary Ridge and aboutChattanooga.On the 4th of November Longstreet left our front with about fifteenthousand troops, besides Wheeler's cavalry, five thousand more, to goagainst Burnside.  The situation seemed desperate, and was moreaggravating because nothing could be done until Sherman should get up.The authorities at Washington were now more than ever anxious for thesafety of Burnside's army, and plied me with dispatches faster thanever, urging that something should be done for his relief.  On the 7th,before Longstreet could possibly have reached Knoxville, I orderedThomas peremptorily to attack the enemy's right, so as to force thereturn of the troops that had gone up the valley.  I directed him totake mules, officers' horses, or animals wherever he could get them tomove the necessary artillery.  But he persisted in the declaration thathe could not move a single piece of artillery, and could not see how hecould possibly comply with the order.  Nothing was left to be done butto answer Washington dispatches as best I could; urge Sherman forward,although he was making every effort to get forward, and encourageBurnside to hold on, assuring him that in a short time he should berelieved.  All of Burnside's dispatches showed the greatest confidencein his ability to hold his position as long as his ammunition held out.He even suggested the propriety of abandoning the territory he heldsouth and west of Knoxville, so as to draw the enemy farther from hisbase and make it more difficult for him to get back to Chattanooga whenthe battle should begin.  Longstreet had a railroad as far as Loudon;but from there to Knoxville he had to rely on wagon trains. Burnside'ssuggestion, therefore, was a good one, and it was adopted.  On the 14thI telegraphed him:"Sherman's advance has reached Bridgeport.  His whole force will beready to move from there by Tuesday at farthest.  If you can holdLongstreet in check until he gets up, or by skirmishing and falling backcan avoid serious loss to yourself and gain time, I will be able toforce the enemy back from here and place a force between Longstreet andBragg that must inevitably make the former take to the mountain-passesby every available road, to get to his supplies.  Sherman would havebeen here before this but for high water in Elk River driving him somethirty miles up that river to cross."And again later in the day, indicating my plans for his relief, asfollows:"Your dispatch and Dana's just received.  Being there, you can tellbetter how to resist Longstreet's attack than I can direct.  With yourshowing you had better give up Kingston at the last moment and save themost productive part of your possessions.  Every arrangement is now madeto throw Sherman's force across the river, just at and below the mouthof Chickamauga Creek, as soon as it arrives.  Thomas will attack on hisleft at the same time, and together it is expected to carry MissionaryRidge, and from there push a force on to the railroad between Clevelandand Dalton.  Hooker will at the same time attack, and, if he can, carryLookout Mountain.  The enemy now seems to be looking for an attack onhis left flank.  This favors us.  To further confirm this, Sherman'sadvance division will march direct from Whiteside to Trenton.  Theremainder of his force will pass over a new road just made fromWhiteside to Kelly's Ferry, thus being concealed from the enemy, andleave him to suppose the whole force is going up Lookout Valley.Sherman's advance has only just reached Bridgeport.  The rear will onlyreach there on the 16th.  This will bring it to the 19th as the earliestday for making the combined movement as desired.  Inform me if you thinkyou can sustain yourself until this time.  I can hardly conceive of theenemy breaking through at Kingston and pushing for Kentucky.  If theyshould, however, a new problem would be left for solution.  Thomas hasordered a division of cavalry to the vicinity of Sparta. I willascertain if they have started, and inform you.  It will be entirely outof the question to send you ten thousand men, not because they cannot bespared, but how would they be fed after they got even one day east fromhere?"Longstreet, for some reason or other, stopped at Loudon until the 13th.That being the terminus of his railroad communications, it is probablehe was directed to remain there awaiting orders.  He was in a positionthreatening Knoxville, and at the same time where he could be broughtback speedily to Chattanooga. The day after Longstreet left Loudon,Sherman reached Bridgeport in person and proceeded on to see me thatevening, the 14th, and reached Chattanooga the next day.My orders for battle were all prepared in advance of Sherman's arrival(*15), except the dates, which could not be fixed while troops to beengaged were so far away.  The possession of Lookout Mountain was of nospecial advantage to us now.  Hooker was instructed to send Howard'scorps to the north side of the Tennessee, thence up behind the hills onthe north side, and to go into camp opposite Chattanooga; with theremainder of the command, Hooker was, at a time to be afterwardsappointed, to ascend the western slope between the upper and lowerpalisades, and so get into Chattanooga valley.The plan of battle was for Sherman to attack the enemy's right flank,form a line across it, extend our left over South Chickamauga River soas to threaten or hold the railroad in Bragg's rear, and thus force himeither to weaken his lines elsewhere or lose his connection with hisbase at Chickamauga Station.  Hooker was to perform like service on ourright.  His problem was to get from Lookout Valley to Chattanooga Valleyin the most expeditious way possible; cross the latter valley rapidly toRossville, south of Bragg's line on Missionary Ridge, form line thereacross the ridge facing north, with his right flank extended toChickamauga Valley east of the ridge, thus threatening the enemy's rearon that flank and compelling him to reinforce this also.  Thomas, withthe Army of the Cumberland, occupied the centre, and was to assaultwhile the enemy was engaged with most of his forces on his two flanks.To carry out this plan, Sherman was to cross the Tennessee at Brown'sFerry and move east of Chattanooga to a point opposite the north end ofMission Ridge, and to place his command back of the foot-hills out ofsight of the enemy on the ridge.  There are two streams calledChickamauga emptying into the Tennessee River east of Chattanooga--NorthChickamauga, taking its rise in Tennessee, flowing south, and emptyinginto the river some seven or eight miles east; while the SouthChickamauga, which takes its rise in Georgia, flows northward, andempties into the Tennessee some three or four miles above the town.There were now one hundred and sixteen pontoons in the North ChickamaugaRiver, their presence there being unknown to the enemy.At night a division was to be marched up to that point, and at twoo'clock in the morning moved down with the current, thirty men in eachboat.  A few were to land east of the mouth of the South Chickamauga,capture the pickets there, and then lay a bridge connecting the twobanks of the river.  The rest were to land on the south side of theTennessee, where Missionary Ridge would strike it if prolonged, and asufficient number of men to man the boats were to push to the north sideto ferry over the main body of Sherman's command while those left on thesouth side intrenched themselves.  Thomas was to move out from his linesfacing the ridge, leaving enough of Palmer's corps to guard against anattack down the valley.  Lookout Valley being of no present value to us,and being untenable by the enemy if we should secure Missionary Ridge,Hooker's orders were changed.  His revised orders brought him toChattanooga by the established route north of the Tennessee.  He wasthen to move out to the right to Rossville.Hooker's position in Lookout Valley was absolutely essential to us solong as Chattanooga was besieged.  It was the key to our line forsupplying the army.  But it was not essential after the enemy wasdispersed from our front, or even after the battle for this purpose wasbegun.  Hooker's orders, therefore, were designed to get his force pastLookout Mountain and Chattanooga Valley, and up to Missionary Ridge.  Bycrossing the north face of Lookout the troops would come intoChattanooga Valley in rear of the line held by the enemy across thevalley, and would necessarily force its evacuation.  Orders wereaccordingly given to march by this route.  But days before the battlebegan the advantages as well as the disadvantages of this plan of actionwere all considered.  The passage over the mountain was a difficult oneto make in the face of an enemy.  It might consume so much time as tolose us the use of the troops engaged in it at other points where theywere more wanted.  After reaching Chattanooga Valley, the creek of thesame name, quite a formidable stream to get an army over, had to becrossed.  I was perfectly willing that the enemy should keep LookoutMountain until we got through with the troops on Missionary Ridge.  Bymarching Hooker to the north side of the river, thence up the stream,and recrossing at the town, he could be got in position at any namedtime; when in this new position, he would have Chattanooga Creek behindhim, and the attack on Missionary Ridge would unquestionably cause theevacuation by the enemy of his line across the valley and on LookoutMountain.  Hooker's order was changed accordingly.  As explainedelsewhere, the original order had to be reverted to, because of a floodin the river rendering the bridge at Brown's Ferry unsafe for thepassage of troops at the exact juncture when it was wanted to bring allthe troops together against Missionary Ridge.The next day after Sherman's arrival I took him, with Generals Thomasand Smith and other officers, to the north side of the river, and showedthem the ground over which Sherman had to march, and pointed outgenerally what he was expected to do.  I, as well as the authorities inWashington, was still in a great state of anxiety for Burnside's safety.Burnside himself, I believe, was the only one who did not share in thisanxiety. Nothing could be done for him, however, until Sherman's troopswere up.  As soon, therefore, as the inspection was over, Shermanstarted for Bridgeport to hasten matters, rowing a boat himself, Ibelieve, from Kelly's Ferry.  Sherman had left Bridgeport the nightof the 14th, reached Chattanooga the evening of the 15th, made theabove-described inspection on the morning of the 16th, and started backthe same evening to hurry up his command, fully appreciating theimportance of time.His march was conducted with as much expedition as the roads and seasonwould admit of.  By the 20th he was himself at Brown's Ferry with thehead of column, but many of his troops were far behind, and one division(Ewing's) was at Trenton, sent that way to create the impression thatLookout was to be taken from the south.  Sherman received his orders atthe ferry, and was asked if he could not be ready for the assault thefollowing morning.  News had been received that the battle had beencommenced at Knoxville.  Burnside had been cut off from telegraphiccommunications.  The President, the Secretary of War, and GeneralHalleck, were in an agony of suspense.  My suspense was also great, butmore endurable, because I was where I could soon do something to relievethe situation.  It was impossible to get Sherman's troops up for thenext day.  I then asked him if they could not be got up to make theassault on the morning of the 22d, and ordered Thomas to move on thatdate.  But the elements were against us.  It rained all the 20th and21st. The river rose so rapidly that it was difficult to keep thepontoons in place.General Orlando B. Willcox, a division commander under Burnside, was atthis time occupying a position farther up the valley than Knoxville--about Maynardville--and was still in telegraphic communication with theNorth.  A dispatch was received from him saying that he was threatenedfrom the east.  The following was sent in reply:"If you can communicate with General Burnside, say to him that ourattack on Bragg will commence in the morning.  If successful, such amove will be made as I think will relieve East Tennessee, if he can holdout.  Longstreet passing through our lines to Kentucky need not causealarm.  He would find the country so bare that he would lose histransportation and artillery before reaching Kentucky, and would meetsuch a force before he got through, that he could not return."Meantime, Sherman continued his crossing without intermission as fast ashis troops could be got up.  The crossing had to be effected in fullview of the enemy on the top of Lookout Mountain.  Once over, however,the troops soon disappeared behind the detached hill on the north side,and would not come to view again, either to watchmen on Lookout Mountainor Missionary Ridge, until they emerged between the hills to strike thebank of the river.  But when Sherman's advance reached a point oppositethe town of Chattanooga, Howard, who, it will be remembered, had beenconcealed behind the hills on the north side, took up his line of marchto join the troops on the south side.  His crossing was in full viewboth from Missionary Ridge and the top of Lookout, and the enemy ofcourse supposed these troops to be Sherman's.  This enabled Sherman toget to his assigned position without discovery.CHAPTER XLIII.PREPARATIONS FOR BATTLE--THOMAS CARRIES THE FIRST LINE OF THE ENEMY--SHERMAN CARRIES MISSIONARY RIDGE--BATTLE OF LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN--GENERAL HOOKER'S FIGHT.On the 20th, when so much was occurring to discourage--rains falling soheavily as to delay the passage of troops over the river at Brown'sFerry and threatening the entire breaking of the bridge; news coming ofa battle raging at Knoxville; of Willcox being threatened by a forcefrom the east--a letter was received from Bragg which contained thesewords:  "As there may still be some non-combatants in Chattanooga, Ideem it proper to notify you that prudence would dictate their earlywithdrawal." Of course, I understood that this was a device intended todeceive; but I did not know what the intended deception was.  On the22d, however, a deserter came in who informed me that Bragg was leavingour front, and on that day Buckner's division was sent to reinforceLongstreet at Knoxville, and another division started to follow but wasrecalled.  The object of Bragg's letter, no doubt, was in some way todetain me until Knoxville could be captured, and his troops there bereturned to Chattanooga.During the night of the 21st the rest of the pontoon boats, completed,one hundred and sixteen in all, were carried up to and placed in NorthChickamauga. The material for the roadway over these was deposited outof view of the enemy within a few hundred yards of the bank of theTennessee, where the north end of the bridge was to rest.Hearing nothing from Burnside, and hearing much of the distress inWashington on his account, I could no longer defer operations for hisrelief.  I determined, therefore, to do on the 23d, with the Army of theCumberland, what had been intended to be done on the 24th.The position occupied by the Army of the Cumberland had been made verystrong for defence during the months it had been besieged.  The line wasabout a mile from the town, and extended from Citico Creek, a smallstream running near the base of Missionary Ridge and emptying into theTennessee about two miles below the mouth of the South Chickamauga, onthe left, to Chattanooga Creek on the right.  All commanding points onthe line were well fortified and well equipped with artillery.  Theimportant elevations within the line had all been carefully fortifiedand supplied with a proper armament.  Among the elevations so fortifiedwas one to the east of the town, named Fort Wood.  It owed itsimportance chiefly to the fact that it lay between the town andMissionary Ridge, where most of the strength of the enemy was.  FortWood had in it twenty-two pieces of artillery, most of which would reachthe nearer points of the enemy's line.  On the morning of the 23dThomas, according to instructions, moved Granger's corps of twodivisions, Sheridan and T. J. Wood commanding, to the foot of Fort Wood,and formed them into line as if going on parade, Sheridan on the right,Wood to the left, extending to or near Citico Creek.  Palmer, commandingthe 14th corps, held that part of our line facing south and southwest.He supported Sheridan with one division (Baird's), while his otherdivision under Johnson remained in the trenches, under arms, ready to bemoved to any point. Howard's corps was moved in rear of the centre.  Thepicket lines were within a few hundred yards of each other.  At twoo'clock in the afternoon all were ready to advance.  By this time theclouds had lifted so that the enemy could see from his elevated positionall that was going on.  The signal for advance was given by a booming ofcannon from Fort Wood and other points on the line.  The rebel picketswere soon driven back upon the main guards, which occupied minor anddetached heights between the main ridge and our lines.  These too werecarried before halting, and before the enemy had time to reinforce theiradvance guards.  But it was not without loss on both sides. Thismovement secured to us a line fully a mile in advance of the one weoccupied in the morning, and the one which the enemy had occupied up tothis time.  The fortifications were rapidly turned to face the otherway.  During the following night they were made strong.  We lost in thispreliminary action about eleven hundred killed and wounded, while theenemy probably lost quite as heavily, including the prisoners that werecaptured. With the exception of the firing of artillery, kept up fromMissionary Ridge and Fort Wood until night closed in, this ended thefighting for the first day.The advantage was greatly on our side now, and if I could only have beenassured that Burnside could hold out ten days longer I should haverested more easily.  But we were doing the best we could for him and thecause.By the night of the 23d Sherman's command was in a position to move,though one division (Osterhaus's) had not yet crossed the river atBrown's Ferry.  The continuous rise in the Tennessee had rendered itimpossible to keep the bridge at that point in condition for troops tocross; but I was determined to move that night even without thisdivision.  Orders were sent to Osterhaus accordingly to report toHooker, if he could not cross by eight o'clock on the morning of the24th.  Because of the break in the bridge, Hooker's orders were againchanged, but this time only back to those first given to him.General W. F. Smith had been assigned to duty as Chief Engineer of theMilitary Division.  To him were given the general direction of movingtroops by the boats from North Chickamauga, laying the bridge after theyreached their position, and generally all the duties pertaining to hisoffice of chief engineer.  During the night General Morgan L. Smith'sdivision was marched to the point where the pontoons were, and thebrigade of Giles A. Smith was selected for the delicate duty of manningthe boats and surprising the enemy's pickets on the south bank of theriver.  During this night also General J. M. Brannan, chief ofartillery, moved forty pieces of artillery, belonging to the Army of theCumberland, and placed them on the north side of the river so as tocommand the ground opposite, to aid in protecting the approach to thepoint where the south end of the bridge was to rest.  He had to useSherman's artillery horses for this purpose, Thomas having none.At two o'clock in the morning, November 24th, Giles A. Smith pushed outfrom the North Chickamauga with his one hundred and sixteen boats, eachloaded with thirty brave and well-armed men.  The boats with theirprecious freight dropped down quietly with the current to avoidattracting the attention of any one who could convey information to theenemy, until arriving near the mouth of South Chickamauga. Here a fewboats were landed, the troops debarked, and a rush was made upon thepicket guard known to be at that point.  The guard were surprised, andtwenty of their number captured.  The remainder of the troops effected alanding at the point where the bridge was to start, with equally goodresults.  The work of ferrying over Sherman's command from the northside of the Tennessee was at once commenced, using the pontoons for thepurpose.  A steamer was also brought up from the town to assist.  Therest of M. L. Smith's division came first, then the division of John E.Smith.  The troops as they landed were put to work intrenching theirposition.  By daylight the two entire divisions were over, and wellcovered by the works they had built.The work of laying the bridge, on which to cross the artillery andcavalry, was now begun.  The ferrying over the infantry was continuedwith the steamer and the pontoons, taking the pontoons, however, as fastas they were wanted to put in their place in the bridge.  By a littlepast noon the bridge was completed, as well as one over the SouthChickamauga connecting the troops left on that side with their comradesbelow, and all the infantry and artillery were on the south bank of theTennessee.Sherman at once formed his troops for assault on Missionary Ridge.  Byone o'clock he started with M. L. Smith on his left, keeping nearly thecourse of Chickamauga River; J. E. Smith next to the right and a littleto the rear; and Ewing still farther to the right and also a little tothe rear of J. E. Smith's command, in column, ready to deploy to theright if an enemy should come from that direction.  A good skirmish linepreceded each of these columns.  Soon the foot of the hill was reached;the skirmishers pushed directly up, followed closely by their supports.By half-past three Sherman was in possession of the height withouthaving sustained much loss.  A brigade from each division was nowbrought up, and artillery was dragged to the top of the hill by hand.The enemy did not seem to be aware of this movement until the top of thehill was gained.  There had been a drizzling rain during the day, andthe clouds were so low that Lookout Mountain and the top of MissionaryRidge were obscured from the view of persons in the valley.  But now theenemy opened fire upon their assailants, and made several attempts withtheir skirmishers to drive them away, but without avail.  Later in theday a more determined attack was made, but this, too, failed, andSherman was left to fortify what he had gained.Sherman's cavalry took up its line of march soon after the bridge wascompleted, and by half-past three the whole of it was over both bridgesand on its way to strike the enemy's communications at ChickamaugaStation.  All of Sherman's command was now south of the Tennessee.During the afternoon General Giles A. Smith was severely wounded andcarried from the field.Thomas having done on the 23d what was expected of him on the 24th,there was nothing for him to do this day except to strengthen hisposition.  Howard, however, effected a crossing of Citico Creek and ajunction with Sherman, and was directed to report to him.  With two orthree regiments of his command he moved in the morning along the banksof the Tennessee, and reached the point where the bridge was being laid.He went out on the bridge as far as it was completed from the south end,and saw Sherman superintending the work from the north side and movinghimself south as fast as an additional boat was put in and the roadwayput upon it.  Howard reported to his new chief across the chasm betweenthem, which was now narrow and in a few minutes closed.While these operations were going on to the east of Chattanooga, Hookerwas engaged on the west.  He had three divisions: Osterhaus's, of the15th corps, Army of the Tennessee; Geary's, 12th corps, Army of thePotomac; and Cruft's, 14th corps, Army of the Cumberland.  Geary was onthe right at Wauhatchie, Cruft at the centre, and Osterhaus near Brown'sFerry.  These troops were all west of Lookout Creek.  The enemy had theeast bank of the creek strongly picketed and intrenched, and threebrigades of troops in the rear to reinforce them if attacked.  Thesebrigades occupied the summit of the mountain.  General Carter L.Stevenson was in command of the whole.  Why any troops, except artillerywith a small infantry guard, were kept on the mountain-top, I do notsee.  A hundred men could have held the summit--which is a palisade formore than thirty feet down--against the assault of any number of menfrom the position Hooker occupied.The side of Lookout Mountain confronting Hooker's command was rugged,heavily timbered, and full of chasms, making it difficult to advancewith troops, even in the absence of an opposing force.  Farther up, theground becomes more even and level, and was in cultivation.  On the eastside the slope is much more gradual, and a good wagon road, zigzaggingup it, connects the town of Chattanooga with the summit.Early on the morning of the 24th Hooker moved Geary's division,supported by a brigade of Cruft's, up Lookout Creek, to effect acrossing.  The remainder of Cruft's division was to seize the bridgeover the creek, near the crossing of the railroad. Osterhaus was to moveup to the bridge and cross it.  The bridge was seized by Gross's brigadeafter a slight skirmish with the pickets guarding it.  This attractedthe enemy so that Geary's movement farther up was not observed.  A heavymist obscured him from the view of the troops on the top of themountain.  He crossed the creek almost unobserved, and captured thepicket of over forty men on guard near by.  He then commenced ascendingthe mountain directly in his front.  By this time the enemy was seencoming down from their camps on the mountain slope, and filing intotheir rifle-pits to contest the crossing of the bridge.  By eleveno'clock the bridge was complete.  Osterhaus was up, and after some sharpskirmishing the enemy was driven away with considerable loss in killedand captured.While the operations at the bridge were progressing, Geary was pushingup the hill over great obstacles, resisted by the enemy directly in hisfront, and in face of the guns on top of the mountain.  The enemy,seeing their left flank and rear menaced, gave way, and were followed byCruft and Osterhaus.  Soon these were up abreast of Geary, and the wholecommand pushed up the hill, driving the enemy in advance.  By noon Gearyhad gained the open ground on the north slope of the mountain, with hisright close up to the base of the upper palisade, but there were strongfortifications in his front.  The rest of the command coming up, a linewas formed from the base of the upper palisade to the mouth ofChattanooga Creek.Thomas and I were on the top of Orchard Knob.  Hooker's advance now madeour line a continuous one.  It was in full view, extending from theTennessee River, where Sherman had crossed, up Chickamauga River to thebase of Mission Ridge, over the top of the north end of the ridge toChattanooga Valley, then along parallel to the ridge a mile or more,across the valley to the mouth of Chattanooga Creek, thence up the slopeof Lookout Mountain to the foot of the upper palisade.  The day washazy, so that Hooker's operations were not visible to us except atmoments when the clouds would rise.  But the sound of his artillery andmusketry was heard incessantly.  The enemy on his front was partiallyfortified, but was soon driven out of his works.  During the afternoonthe clouds, which had so obscured the top of Lookout all day as to hidewhatever was going on from the view of those below, settled down andmade it so dark where Hooker was as to stop operations for the time.  Atfour o'clock Hooker reported his position as impregnable.  By a littleafter five direct communication was established, and a brigade of troopswas sent from Chattanooga to reinforce him.  These troops had to crossChattanooga Creek and met with some opposition, but soon overcame it,and by night the commander, General Carlin, reported to Hooker and wasassigned to his left.  I now telegraphed to Washington:  "The fightto-day progressed favorably.  Sherman carried the end of MissionaryRidge, and his right is now at the tunnel, and his left at ChickamaugaCreek. Troops from Lookout Valley carried the point of the mountain, andnow hold the eastern slope and a point high up.  Hooker reports twothousand prisoners taken, besides which a small number have fallen intoour hands from Missionary Ridge."  The next day the President replied:"Your dispatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here.  Welldone. Many thanks to all.  Remember Burnside."  And Halleck alsotelegraphed: "I congratulate you on the success thus far of your plans.I fear that Burnside is hard pushed, and that any further delay mayprove fatal.  I know you will do all in your power to relieve him."The division of Jefferson C. Davis, Army of the Cumberland, had beensent to the North Chickamauga to guard the pontoons as they weredeposited in the river, and to prevent all ingress or egress ofcitizens.  On the night of the 24th his division, having crossed withSherman, occupied our extreme left from the upper bridge over the plainto the north base of Missionary Ridge. Firing continued to a late hourin the night, but it was not connected with an assault at any point.CHAPTER XLIV.BATTLE OF CHATTANOOGA--A GALLANT CHARGE--COMPLETE ROUT OF THE ENEMY--PURSUIT OF THE CONFEDERATES--GENERAL BRAGG--REMARKS ON CHATTANOOGA.At twelve o'clock at night, when all was quiet, I began to give ordersfor the next day, and sent a dispatch to Willcox to encourage Burnside.Sherman was directed to attack at daylight.  Hooker was ordered to moveat the same hour, and endeavor to intercept the enemy's retreat if hestill remained; if he had gone, then to move directly to Rossville andoperate against the left and rear of the force on Missionary Ridge.Thomas was not to move until Hooker had reached Missionary Ridge.  As Iwas with him on Orchard Knob, he would not move without further ordersfrom me.The morning of the 25th opened clear and bright, and the whole field wasin full view from the top of Orchard Knob.  It remained so all day.Bragg's headquarters were in full view, and officers--presumably staffofficers--could be seen coming and going constantly.The point of ground which Sherman had carried on the 24th was almostdisconnected from the main ridge occupied by the enemy. A low pass, overwhich there is a wagon road crossing the hill, and near which there is arailroad tunnel, intervenes between the two hills.  The problem now wasto get to the main ridge. The enemy was fortified on the point; and backfarther, where the ground was still higher, was a second fortificationcommanding the first.  Sherman was out as soon as it was light enough tosee, and by sunrise his command was in motion.  Three brigades held thehill already gained.  Morgan L. Smith moved along the east base ofMissionary Ridge; Loomis along the west base, supported by two brigadesof John E. Smith's division; and Corse with his brigade was between thetwo, moving directly towards the hill to be captured.  The ridge issteep and heavily wooded on the east side, where M. L. Smith's troopswere advancing, but cleared and with a more gentle slope on the westside.  The troops advanced rapidly and carried the extreme end of therebel works.  Morgan L. Smith advanced to a point which cut the enemyoff from the railroad bridge and the means of bringing up supplies byrail from Chickamauga Station, where the main depot was located.  Theenemy made brave and strenuous efforts to drive our troops from theposition we had gained, but without success.  The contest lasted for twohours.  Corse, a brave and efficient commander, was badly wounded inthis assault.  Sherman now threatened both Bragg's flank and his stores,and made it necessary for him to weaken other points of his line tostrengthen his right.  From the position I occupied I could see columnafter column of Bragg's forces moving against Sherman.  EveryConfederate gun that could be brought to bear upon the Union forces wasconcentrated upon him.  J. E. Smith, with two brigades, charged up thewest side of the ridge to the support of Corse's command, over openground and in the face of a heavy fire of both artillery and musketry,and reached the very parapet of the enemy.  He lay here for a time, butthe enemy coming with a heavy force upon his right flank, he wascompelled to fall back, followed by the foe.  A few hundred yardsbrought Smith's troops into a wood, where they were speedily reformed,when they charged and drove the attacking party back to hisintrenchments.Seeing the advance, repulse, and second advance of J. E. Smith from theposition I occupied, I directed Thomas to send a division to reinforcehim.  Baird's division was accordingly sent from the right of OrchardKnob.  It had to march a considerable distance directly under the eye ofthe enemy to reach its position.  Bragg at once commenced massing in thesame direction.  This was what I wanted.  But it had now got to be latein the afternoon, and I had expected before this to see Hooker crossingthe ridge in the neighborhood of Rossville and compelling Bragg to massin that direction also.The enemy had evacuated Lookout Mountain during the night, as I expectedhe would.  In crossing the valley he burned the bridge over ChattanoogaCreek, and did all he could to obstruct the roads behind him.  Hookerwas off bright and early, with no obstructions in his front but distanceand the destruction above named.  He was detained four hours crossingChattanooga Creek, and thus was lost the immediate advantage I expectedfrom his forces.  His reaching Bragg's flank and extending across it wasto be the signal for Thomas's assault of the ridge.  But Sherman'scondition was getting so critical that the assault for his relief couldnot be delayed any longer.Sheridan's and Wood's divisions had been lying under arms from earlymorning, ready to move the instant the signal was given. I now directedThomas to order the charge at once (*16). I watched eagerly to see theeffect, and became impatient at last that there was no indication of anycharge being made.  The centre of the line which was to make the chargewas near where Thomas and I stood, but concealed from view by anintervening forest.  Turning to Thomas to inquire what caused the delay,I was surprised to see Thomas J. Wood, one of the division commanderswho was to make the charge, standing talking to him.  I spoke to GeneralWood, asking him why he did not charge as ordered an hour before.  Hereplied very promptly that this was the first he had heard of it, butthat he had been ready all day to move at a moment's notice.  I told himto make the charge at once.  He was off in a moment, and in anincredibly short time loud cheering was heard, and he and Sheridan weredriving the enemy's advance before them towards Missionary Ridge.  TheConfederates were strongly intrenched on the crest of the ridge in frontof us, and had a second line half-way down and another at the base. Ourmen drove the troops in front of the lower line of rifle-pits sorapidly, and followed them so closely, that rebel and Union troops wentover the first line of works almost at the same time.  Many rebels werecaptured and sent to the rear under the fire of their own friends higherup the hill.  Those that were not captured retreated, and were pursued.The retreating hordes being between friends and pursuers caused theenemy to fire high to avoid killing their own men.  In fact, on thatoccasion the Union soldier nearest the enemy was in the safest position.Without awaiting further orders or stopping to reform, on our troopswent to the second line of works; over that and on for the crest--thuseffectually carrying out my orders of the 18th for the battle and of the24th (*17) for this charge.I watched their progress with intense interest.  The fire along therebel line was terrific.  Cannon and musket balls filled the air:  butthe damage done was in small proportion to the ammunition expended.  Thepursuit continued until the crest was reached, and soon our men wereseen climbing over the Confederate barriers at different points in frontof both Sheridan's and Wood's divisions.  The retreat of the enemy alongmost of his line was precipitate and the panic so great that Bragg andhis officers lost all control over their men.  Many were captured, andthousands threw away their arms in their flight.Sheridan pushed forward until he reached the Chickamauga River at apoint above where the enemy crossed.  He met some resistance from troopsoccupying a second hill in rear of Missionary Ridge, probably to coverthe retreat of the main body and of the artillery and trains.  It wasnow getting dark, but Sheridan, without halting on that account pushedhis men forward up this second hill slowly and without attracting theattention of the men placed to defend it, while he detached to the rightand left to surround the position.  The enemy discovered the movementbefore these dispositions were complete, and beat a hasty retreat,leaving artillery, wagon trains, and many prisoners in our hands.  ToSheridan's prompt movement the Army of the Cumberland, and the nation,are indebted for the bulk of the capture of prisoners, artillery, andsmall-arms that day. Except for his prompt pursuit, so much in this waywould not have been accomplished.While the advance up Mission Ridge was going forward, General Thomaswith staff, General Gordon Granger, commander of the corps making theassault, and myself and staff occupied Orchard Knob, from which theentire field could be observed.  The moment the troops were seen goingover the last line of rebel defences, I ordered Granger to join hiscommand, and mounting my horse I rode to the front.  General Thomas leftabout the same time. Sheridan on the extreme right was already inpursuit of the enemy east of the ridge.  Wood, who commanded thedivision to the left of Sheridan, accompanied his men on horseback inthe charge, but did not join Sheridan in the pursuit.  To the left, inBaird's front where Bragg's troops had massed against Sherman, theresistance was more stubborn and the contest lasted longer.  I orderedGranger to follow the enemy with Wood's division, but he was so muchexcited, and kept up such a roar of musketry in the direction the enemyhad taken, that by the time I could stop the firing the enemy had gotwell out of the way.  The enemy confronting Sherman, now seeingeverything to their left giving way, fled also.  Sherman, however, wasnot aware of the extent of our success until after nightfall, when hereceived orders to pursue at daylight in the morning.As soon as Sherman discovered that the enemy had left his front hedirected his reserves, Davis's division of the Army of the Cumberland,to push over the pontoon-bridge at the mouth of the Chickamauga, and tomove forward to Chickamauga Station.  He ordered Howard to move up thestream some two miles to where there was an old bridge, repair it duringthe night, and follow Davis at four o'clock in the morning.  Morgan L.Smith was ordered to reconnoitre the tunnel to see if that was stillheld.  Nothing was found there but dead bodies of men of both armies.The rest of Sherman's command was directed to follow Howard at daylightin the morning to get on to the railroad towards Graysville.Hooker, as stated, was detained at Chattanooga Creek by the destructionof the bridge at that point.  He got his troops over, with the exceptionof the artillery, by fording the stream at a little after three o'clock.Leaving his artillery to follow when the bridge should be reconstructed,he pushed on with the remainder of his command.  At Rossville he cameupon the flank of a division of the enemy, which soon commenced aretreat along the ridge.  This threw them on Palmer.  They could makebut little resistance in the position they were caught in, and as manyof them as could do so escaped.  Many, however, were captured.  Hooker'sposition during the night of the 25th was near Rossville, extending eastof the ridge.  Palmer was on his left, on the road to Graysville.During the night I telegraphed to Willcox that Bragg had been defeated,and that immediate relief would be sent to Burnside if he could holdout; to Halleck I sent an announcement of our victory, and informed himthat forces would be sent up the valley to relieve Burnside.Before the battle of Chattanooga opened I had taken measures for therelief of Burnside the moment the way should be clear. Thomas wasdirected to have the little steamer that had been built at Chattanoogaloaded to its capacity with rations and ammunition.  Granger's corps wasto move by the south bank of the Tennessee River to the mouth of theHolston, and up that to Knoxville accompanied by the boat.  In additionto the supplies transported by boat, the men were to carry forty roundsof ammunition in their cartridge-boxes, and four days' rations inhaversacks.In the battle of Chattanooga, troops from the Army of the Potomac, fromthe Army of the Tennessee, and from the Army of the Cumberlandparticipated.  In fact, the accidents growing out of the heavy rains andthe sudden rise in the Tennessee River so mingled the troops that theorganizations were not kept together, under their respective commanders,during the battle.  Hooker, on the right, had Geary's division of the12th corps, Army of the Potomac; Osterhaus's division of the 15th corps,Army of the Tennessee; and Cruft's division of the Army of theCumberland.  Sherman had three divisions of his own army, Howard's corpsfrom the Army of the Potomac, and Jefferson C. Davis's division of theArmy of the Cumberland.  There was no jealousy--hardly rivalry.  Indeed,I doubt whether officers or men took any note at the time of the fact ofthis intermingling of commands.  All saw a defiant foe surrounding them,and took it for granted that every move was intended to dislodge him,and it made no difference where the troops came from so that the end wasaccomplished.The victory at Chattanooga was won against great odds, considering theadvantage the enemy had of position, and was accomplished more easilythan was expected by reason of Bragg's making several grave mistakes:first, in sending away his ablest corps commander with over twentythousand troops; second, in sending away a division of troops on the eveof battle; third, in placing so much of a force on the plain in front ofhis impregnable position.It was known that Mr. Jefferson Davis had visited Bragg on MissionaryRidge a short time before my reaching Chattanooga. It was reported andbelieved that he had come out to reconcile a serious difference betweenBragg and Longstreet, and finding this difficult to do, planned thecampaign against Knoxville, to be conducted by the latter general.  Ihad known both Bragg and Longstreet before the war, the latter verywell.  We had been three years at West Point together, and, after mygraduation, for a time in the same regiment.  Then we served together inthe Mexican War.  I had known Bragg in Mexico, and met him occasionallysubsequently.  I could well understand how there might be anirreconcilable difference between them.Bragg was a remarkably intelligent and well-informed man, professionallyand otherwise.  He was also thoroughly upright. But he was possessed ofan irascible temper, and was naturally disputatious.  A man of thehighest moral character and the most correct habits, yet in the old armyhe was in frequent trouble. As a subordinate he was always on thelookout to catch his commanding officer infringing his prerogatives; asa post commander he was equally vigilant to detect the slightestneglect, even of the most trivial order.I have heard in the old army an anecdote very characteristic of Bragg.On one occasion, when stationed at a post of several companies commandedby a field officer, he was himself commanding one of the companies andat the same time acting as post quartermaster and commissary.  He wasfirst lieutenant at the time, but his captain was detached on otherduty.  As commander of the company he made a requisition upon thequartermaster--himself--for something he wanted.  As quartermaster hedeclined to fill the requisition, and endorsed on the back of it hisreasons for so doing.  As company commander he responded to this, urgingthat his requisition called for nothing but what he was entitled to, andthat it was the duty of the quartermaster to fill it.  As quartermasterhe still persisted that he was right.  In this condition of affairsBragg referred the whole matter to the commanding officer of the post.The latter, when he saw the nature of the matter referred, exclaimed:"My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarrelled with every officer in the army,and now you are quarrelling with yourself!"Longstreet was an entirely different man.  He was brave, honest,intelligent, a very capable soldier, subordinate to his superiors, justand kind to his subordinates, but jealous of his own rights, which hehad the courage to maintain.  He was never on the lookout to detect aslight, but saw one as soon as anybody when intentionally given.It may be that Longstreet was not sent to Knoxville for the reasonstated, but because Mr. Davis had an exalted opinion of his own militarygenius, and thought he saw a chance of "killing two birds with onestone."  On several occasions during the war he came to the relief ofthe Union army by means of his SUPERIOR MILITARY GENIUS.I speak advisedly when I saw Mr. Davis prided himself on his militarycapacity.  He says so himself, virtually, in his answer to the notice ofhis nomination to the Confederate presidency. Some of his generals havesaid so in their writings since the downfall of the Confederacy.My recollection is that my first orders for the battle of Chattanoogawere as fought.  Sherman was to get on Missionary Ridge, as he did;Hooker to cross the north end of Lookout Mountain, as he did, sweepacross Chattanooga Valley and get across the south end of the ridge nearRossville.  When Hooker had secured that position the Army of theCumberland was to assault in the centre.  Before Sherman arrived,however, the order was so changed as that Hooker was directed to come toChattanooga by the north bank of the Tennessee River.  The waters in theriver, owing to heavy rains, rose so fast that the bridge at Brown'sFerry could not be maintained in a condition to be used in crossingtroops upon it.  For this reason Hooker's orders were changed bytelegraph back to what they were originally.------NOTE.--From this point on this volume was written (with the exception ofthe campaign in the Wilderness, which had been previously written) byGeneral Grant, after his great illness in April, and the presentarrangement of the subject-matter was made by him between the 10th and18th of July, 1885.CHAPTER XLV.THE RELIEF OF KNOXVILLE--HEADQUARTERS MOVED TO NASHVILLE--VISITINGKNOXVILLE-CIPHER CIPHER DISPATCHES--WITHHOLDING ORDERS.Chattanooga now being secure to the National troops beyond any doubt, Iimmediately turned my attention to relieving Knoxville, about thesituation of which the President, in particular, was very anxious.Prior to the battles, I had made preparations for sending troops to therelief of Burnside at the very earliest moment after securingChattanooga. We had there two little steamers which had been built andfitted up from the remains of old boats and put in condition to run.General Thomas was directed to have one of these boats loaded withrations and ammunition and move up the Tennessee River to the mouth ofthe Holston, keeping the boat all the time abreast of the troops.General Granger, with the 4th corps reinforced to make twenty thousandmen, was to start the moment Missionary Ridge was carried, and under nocircumstances were the troops to return to their old camps.  With theprovisions carried, and the little that could be got in the country, itwas supposed he could hold out until Longstreet was driven away, afterwhich event East Tennessee would furnish abundance of food forBurnside's army and his own also.While following the enemy on the 26th, and again on the morning of the27th, part of the time by the road to Ringgold, I directed Thomas,verbally, not to start Granger until he received further orders from me;advising him that I was going to the front to more fully see thesituation.  I was not right sure but that Bragg's troops might be overtheir stampede by the time they reached Dalton.  In that case Braggmight think it well to take the road back to Cleveland, move thencetowards Knoxville, and, uniting with Longstreet, make a sudden dash uponBurnside.When I arrived at Ringgold, however, on the 27th, I saw that the retreatwas most earnest.  The enemy had been throwing away guns, caissons andsmall-arms, abandoning provisions, and, altogether, seemed to be movinglike a disorganized mob, with the exception of Cleburne's division,which was acting as rear-guard to cover the retreat.When Hooker moved from Rossville toward Ringgold Palmer's division tookthe road to Graysville, and Sherman moved by the way of ChickamaugaStation toward the same point.  As soon as I saw the situation atRinggold I sent a staff officer back to Chattanooga to advise Thomas ofthe condition of affairs, and direct him by my orders to start Grangerat once.  Feeling now that the troops were already on the march for therelief of Burnside I was in no hurry to get back, but stayed at Ringgoldthrough the day to prepare for the return of our troops.Ringgold is in a valley in the mountains, situated between EastChickamauga Creek and Taylor's Ridge, and about twenty miles south-eastfrom Chattanooga. I arrived just as the artillery that Hooker had leftbehind at Chattanooga Creek got up.  His men were attacking Cleburne'sdivision, which had taken a strong position in the adjacent hills so asto cover the retreat of the Confederate army through a narrow gorgewhich presents itself at that point.  Just beyond the gorge the valleyis narrow, and the creek so tortuous that it has to be crossed a greatmany times in the course of the first mile.  This attack wasunfortunate, and cost us some men unnecessarily.  Hooker captured,however, 3 pieces of artillery and 230 prisoners, and 130 rebel deadwere left upon the field.I directed General Hooker to collect the flour and wheat in theneighboring mills for the use of the troops, and then to destroy themills and all other property that could be of use to the enemy, but notto make any wanton destruction.At this point Sherman came up, having reached Graysville with histroops, where he found Palmer had preceded him.  Palmer had picked upmany prisoners and much abandoned property on the route.  I went back inthe evening to Graysville with Sherman, remained there over night anddid not return to Chattanooga until the following night, the 29th.  Ithen found that Thomas had not yet started Granger, thus having lost afull day which I deemed of so much importance in determining the fate ofKnoxville.  Thomas and Granger were aware that on the 23d of the monthBurnside had telegraphed that his supplies would last for ten or twelvedays and during that time he could hold out against Longstreet, but ifnot relieved within the time indicated he would be obliged to surrenderor attempt to retreat.  To effect a retreat would have been animpossibility.  He was already very low in ammunition, and with an armypursuing he would not have been able to gather supplies.Finding that Granger had not only not started but was very reluctant togo, he having decided for himself that it was a very bad move to make, Isent word to General Sherman of the situation and directed him to marchto the relief of Knoxville.  I also gave him the problem that we had tosolve--that Burnside had now but four to six days supplies left, andthat he must be relieved within that time.Sherman, fortunately, had not started on his return from Graysville,having sent out detachments on the railroad which runs from Dalton toCleveland and Knoxville to thoroughly destroy that road, and thesetroops had not yet returned to camp.  I was very loath to send Sherman,because his men needed rest after their long march from Memphis and hardfighting at Chattanooga. But I had become satisfied that Burnside wouldnot be rescued if his relief depended upon General Granger's movements.Sherman had left his camp on the north side of the Tennessee River, nearChattanooga, on the night of the 23d, the men having two days' cookedrations in their haversacks.  Expecting to be back in their tents bythat time and to be engaged in battle while out, they took with themneither overcoats nor blankets. The weather was already cold, and atnight they must have suffered more or less.  The two days' rations hadalready lasted them five days; and they were now to go through a countrywhich had been run over so much by Confederate troops that there was butlittle probability of finding much food.  They did, however, succeed incapturing some flour.  They also found a good deal of bran in some ofthe mills, which the men made up into bread; and in this and other waysthey eked out an existence until they could reach Knoxville.I was so very anxious that Burnside should get news of the steps beingtaken for his relief, and thus induce him to hold out a little longer ifit became necessary, that I determined to send a message to him.  Itherefore sent a member of my staff, Colonel J. H. Wilson, to get intoKnoxville if he could report to Burnside the situation fully, and givehim all the encouragement possible.  Mr. Charles A. Dana was atChattanooga during the battle, and had been there even before I assumedcommand.  Mr. Dana volunteered to accompany Colonel Wilson, and didaccompany him.  I put the information of what was being done for therelief of Knoxville into writing, and directed that in some way or otherit must be secretly managed so as to have a copy of this fall into thehands of General Longstreet.  They made the trip safely; GeneralLongstreet did learn of Sherman's coming in advance of his reachingthere, and Burnside was prepared to hold out even for a longer time ifit had been necessary.Burnside had stretched a boom across the Holston River to catch scowsand flats as they floated down.  On these, by previous arrangements withthe loyal people of East Tennessee, were placed flour and corn, withforage and provisions generally, and were thus secured for the use ofthe Union troops.  They also drove cattle into Knoxville by the eastside, which was not covered by the enemy; so that when relief arrivedBurnside had more provisions on hand than when he had last reported.Our total loss (not including Burnside's) in all these engagementsamounted to 757 killed, 4,529 wounded and 330 missing.  We captured6,142 prisoners--about 50 per cent. more than the enemy reported fortheir total loss--40 pieces of artillery, 69 artillery carriages andcaissons and over 7,000 stands of small-arms.  The enemy's loss in armswas probably much greater than here reported, because we picked up agreat many that were found abandoned.I had at Chattanooga, in round numbers, about 60,000 men.  Bragg hadabout half this number, but his position was supposed to be impregnable.It was his own fault that he did not have more men present.  He had sentLongstreet away with his corps swelled by reinforcements up to overtwenty thousand men, thus reducing his own force more than one-third anddepriving himself of the presence of the ablest general of his command.He did this, too, after our troops had opened a line of communication byway of Brown's and Kelly's ferries with Bridgeport, thus securing fullrations and supplies of every kind; and also when he knew reinforcementswere coming to me.  Knoxville was of no earthly use to him whileChattanooga was in our hands.  If he should capture Chattanooga,Knoxville with its garrison would have fallen into his hands without astruggle.  I have never been able to see the wisdom of this move.Then, too, after Sherman had arrived, and when Bragg knew that he was onthe north side of the Tennessee River, he sent Buckner's division toreinforce Longstreet.  He also started another division a day later, butour attack having commenced before it reached Knoxville Bragg ordered itback.  It had got so far, however, that it could not return toChattanooga in time to be of service there.  It is possible this latterblunder may have been made by Bragg having become confused as to whatwas going on on our side.  Sherman had, as already stated, crossed tothe north side of the Tennessee River at Brown's Ferry, in full view ofBragg's troops from Lookout Mountain, a few days before the attack.They then disappeared behind foot hills, and did not come to the view ofthe troops on Missionary Ridge until they met their assault.  Bragg knewit was Sherman's troops that had crossed, and, they being so long out ofview, may have supposed that they had gone up the north bank of theTennessee River to the relief of Knoxville and that Longstreet wastherefore in danger.  But the first great blunder, detaching Longstreet,cannot be accounted for in any way I know of.  If he had capturedChattanooga, East Tennessee would have fallen without a struggle.  Itwould have been a victory for us to have got our army away fromChattanooga safely.  It was a manifold greater victory to drive away thebesieging army; a still greater one to defeat that army in his chosenground and nearly annihilate it.The probabilities are that our loss in killed was the heavier, as wewere the attacking party.  The enemy reported his loss in killed at 361:but as he reported his missing at 4,146, while we held over 6,000 ofthem as prisoners, and there must have been hundreds if not thousandswho deserted, but little reliance can be placed on this report.  Therewas certainly great dissatisfaction with Bragg on the part of thesoldiers for his harsh treatment of them, and a disposition to get awayif they could.  Then, too, Chattanooga, following in the same half yearwith Gettysburg in the East and Vicksburg in the West, there was muchthe same feeling in the South at this time that there had been in theNorth the fall and winter before.  If the same license had been allowedthe people and press in the South that was allowed in the North,Chattanooga would probably have been the last battle fought for thepreservation of the Union.General William F. Smith's services in these battles had been such thatI thought him eminently entitled to promotion.  I was aware that he hadpreviously been named by the President for promotion to the grade ofmajor-general, but that the Senate had rejected the nomination.  I wasnot aware of the reasons for this course, and therefore stronglyrecommended him for a major-generalcy.  My recommendation was heeded andthe appointment made.Upon the raising of the siege of Knoxville I, of course, informed theauthorities at Washington--the President and Secretary of War--of thefact, which caused great rejoicing there.  The President especially wasrejoiced that Knoxville had been relieved (*18) without furtherbloodshed.  The safety of Burnside's army and the loyal people of EastTennessee had been the subject of much anxiety to the President forseveral months, during which time he was doing all he could to relievethe situation; sending a new commander (*19) with a few thousand troopsby the way of Cumberland Gap, and telegraphing me daily, almost hourly,to "remember Burnside," "do something for Burnside," and other appealsof like tenor.  He saw no escape for East Tennessee until after ourvictory at Chattanooga. Even then he was afraid that Burnside might beout of ammunition, in a starving condition, or overpowered:  and hisanxiety was still intense until he heard that Longstreet had been drivenfrom the field.Burnside followed Longstreet only to Strawberry Plains, some twentymiles or more east, and then stopped, believing that Longstreet wouldleave the State.  The latter did not do so, however, but stopped only ashort distance farther on and subsisted his army for the entire winteroff East Tennessee. Foster now relieved Burnside.  Sherman madedisposition of his troops along the Tennessee River in accordance withinstructions.  I left Thomas in command at Chattanooga, and, about the20th of December, moved my headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee.Nashville was the most central point from which to communicate with myentire military division, and also with the authorities at Washington.While remaining at Chattanooga I was liable to have my telegraphiccommunications cut so as to throw me out of communication with both mycommand and Washington.Nothing occurred at Nashville worthy of mention during the winter, (*20)so I set myself to the task of having troops in positions from whichthey could move to advantage, and in collecting all necessary suppliesso as to be ready to claim a due share of the enemy's attention upon theappearance of the first good weather in the spring.  I expected toretain the command I then had, and prepared myself for the campaignagainst Atlanta. I also had great hopes of having a campaign madeagainst Mobile from the Gulf.  I expected after Atlanta fell to occupythat place permanently, and to cut off Lee's army from the West by wayof the road running through Augusta to Atlanta and thence south-west.  Iwas preparing to hold Atlanta with a small garrison, and it was myexpectation to push through to Mobile if that city was in ourpossession:  if not, to Savannah; and in this manner to get possessionof the only east and west railroad that would then be left to the enemy.But the spring campaign against Mobile was not made.The Army of the Ohio had been getting supplies over Cumberland Gap untiltheir animals had nearly all starved.  I now determined to go myself tosee if there was any possible chance of using that route in the spring,and if not to abandon it. Accordingly I left Nashville in the latterpart of December by rail for Chattanooga. From Chattanooga I took one ofthe little steamers previously spoken of as having been built there,and, putting my horses aboard, went up to the junction of the Clinchwith the Tennessee.  From that point the railroad had been repaired upto Knoxville and out east to Strawberry Plains.  I went by railtherefore to Knoxville, where I remained for several days.  General JohnG. Foster was then commanding the Department of the Ohio.  It was anintensely cold winter, the thermometer being down as low as zero everymorning for more than a week while I was at Knoxville and on my way fromthere on horseback to Lexington, Kentucky, the first point where I couldreach rail to carry me back to my headquarters at Nashville.The road over Cumberland Gap, and back of it, was strewn with debris ofbroken wagons and dead animals, much as I had found it on my first tripto Chattanooga over Waldron's Ridge.  The road had been cut up to asgreat a depth as clay could be by mules and wagons, and in thatcondition frozen; so that the ride of six days from Strawberry Plains toLexington over these holes and knobs in the road was a very cheerlessone, and very disagreeable.I found a great many people at home along that route, both in Tennesseeand Kentucky, and, almost universally, intensely loyal.  They wouldcollect in little places where we would stop of evenings, to see me,generally hearing of my approach before we arrived.  The peoplenaturally expected to see the commanding general the oldest person inthe party.  I was then forty-one years of age, while my medical directorwas gray-haired and probably twelve or more years my senior.  The crowdswould generally swarm around him, and thus give me an opportunity ofquietly dismounting and getting into the house.  It also gave me anopportunity of hearing passing remarks from one spectator to anotherabout their general.  Those remarks were apt to be more complimentary tothe cause than to the appearance of the supposed general, owing to hisbeing muffled up, and also owing to the travel-worn condition we wereall in after a hard day's ride.  I was back in Nashville by the 13th ofJanuary, 1864.When I started on this trip it was necessary for me to have some personalong who could turn dispatches into cipher, and who could also read thecipher dispatches which I was liable to receive daily and almost hourly.Under the rules of the War Department at that time, Mr. Stanton hadtaken entire control of the matter of regulating the telegraph anddetermining how it should be used, and of saying who, and who alone,should have the ciphers.  The operators possessed of the ciphers, aswell as the ciphers used, were practically independent of the commanderswhom they were serving immediately under, and had to report to the WarDepartment through General Stager all the dispatches which they receivedor forwarded.I was obliged to leave the telegraphic operator back at Nashville,because that was the point at which all dispatches to me would come, tobe forwarded from there.  As I have said, it was necessary for me alsoto have an operator during this inspection who had possession of thiscipher to enable me to telegraph to my division and to the WarDepartment without my dispatches being read by all the operators alongthe line of wires over which they were transmitted.  Accordingly Iordered the cipher operator to turn over the key to Captain Cyrus B.Comstock, of the Corps of Engineers, whom I had selected as a wise anddiscreet man who certainly could be trusted with the cipher if theoperator at my headquarters could.The operator refused point blank to turn over the key to CaptainComstock as directed by me, stating that his orders from the WarDepartment were not to give it to anybody--the commanding general or anyone else.  I told him I would see whether he would or not.  He said thatif he did he would be punished.  I told him if he did not he mostcertainly would be punished. Finally, seeing that punishment was certainif he refused longer to obey my order, and being somewhat remote (evenif he was not protected altogether from the consequences of hisdisobedience to his orders) from the War Department, he yielded.  When Ireturned from Knoxville I found quite a commotion.  The operator hadbeen reprimanded very severely and ordered to be relieved.  I informedthe Secretary of War, or his assistant secretary in charge of thetelegraph, Stager, that the man could not be relieved, for he had onlyobeyed my orders.  It was absolutely necessary for me to have thecipher, and the man would most certainly have been punished if he hadnot delivered it; that they would have to punish me if they punishedanybody, or words to that effect.This was about the only thing approaching a disagreeable differencebetween the Secretary of War and myself that occurred until the war wasover, when we had another little spat.  Owing to his natural dispositionto assume all power and control in all matters that he had anythingwhatever to do with, he boldly took command of the armies, and, whileissuing no orders on the subject, prohibited any order from me going outof the adjutant-general's office until he had approved it.  This wasdone by directing the adjutant-general to hold any orders that came fromme to be issued from the adjutant-general's office until he had examinedthem and given his approval.  He never disturbed himself, either, inexamining my orders until it was entirely convenient for him; so thatorders which I had prepared would often lie there three or four daysbefore he would sanction them.  I remonstrated against this in writing,and the Secretary apologetically restored me to my rightful position ofGeneral-in-Chief of the Army.  But he soon lapsed again and took controlmuch as before.After the relief of Knoxville Sherman had proposed to Burnside that heshould go with him to drive Longstreet out of Tennessee; but Burnsideassured him that with the troops which had been brought by Granger, andwhich were to be left, he would be amply prepared to dispose ofLongstreet without availing himself of this offer.  As before statedSherman's command had left their camps north of the Tennessee, nearChattanooga, with two days' rations in their haversacks, without coatsor blankets, and without many wagons, expecting to return to their campsby the end of that time.  The weather was now cold and they weresuffering, but still they were ready to make the further sacrifice, hadit been required, for the good of the cause which had brought them intoservice.  Sherman, having accomplished the object for which he was sent,marched back leisurely to his old camp on the Tennessee River.CHAPTER XLVI.OPERATIONS IN MISSISSIPPI--LONGSTREET IN EAST TENNESSEE--COMMISSIONEDLIEUTENANT-GENERAL--COMMANDING THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES--FIRSTINTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT LINCOLN.Soon after his return from Knoxville I ordered Sherman to distribute hisforces from Stevenson to Decatur and thence north to Nashville; Shermansuggested that he be permitted to go back to Mississippi, to the limitsof his own department and where most of his army still remained, for thepurpose of clearing out what Confederates might still be left on theeast bank of the Mississippi River to impede its navigation by ourboats.  He expected also to have the co-operation of Banks to do thesame thing on the west shore.  Of course I approved heartily.About the 10th of January Sherman was back in Memphis, where Hurlbutcommanded, and got together his Memphis men, or ordered them collectedand sent to Vicksburg.  He then went to Vicksburg and out to whereMcPherson was in command, and had him organize his surplus troops so asto give him about 20,000 men in all.Sherman knew that General (Bishop) Polk was occupying Meridian with hisheadquarters, and had two divisions of infantry with a considerableforce of cavalry scattered west of him.  He determined, therefore, tomove directly upon Meridian.I had sent some 2,500 cavalry under General Sooy Smith to Sherman'sdepartment, and they had mostly arrived before Sherman got to Memphis.Hurlbut had 7,000 cavalry, and Sherman ordered him to reinforce Smith soas to give the latter a force of about 7,000 with which to go againstForrest, who was then known to be south-east from Memphis.  Smith wasordered to move about the 1st of February.While Sherman was waiting at Vicksburg for the arrival of Hurlbut withhis surplus men, he sent out scouts to ascertain the position andstrength of the enemy and to bring back all the information they couldgather.  When these scouts returned it was through them that he got theinformation of General Polk's being at Meridian, and of the strength anddisposition of his command.Forrest had about 4,000 cavalry with him, composed of thoroughlywell-disciplined men, who under so able a leader were very effective.Smith's command was nearly double that of Forrest, but not equal, man toman, for the lack of a successful experience such as Forrest's men hadhad.  The fact is, troops who have fought a few battles and won, andfollowed up their victories, improve upon what they were before to anextent that can hardly be counted by percentage.  The difference inresult is often decisive victory instead of inglorious defeat.  Thissame difference, too, is often due to the way troops are officered, andfor the particular kind of warfare which Forrest had carried on neitherarmy could present a more effective officer than he was.Sherman got off on the 3d of February and moved out on his expedition,meeting with no opposition whatever until he crossed the Big Black, andwith no great deal of opposition after that until he reached Jackson,Mississippi.  This latter place he reached on the 6th or 7th, Brandon onthe 8th, and Morton on the 9th.  Up to this time he moved in two columnsto enable him to get a good supply of forage, etc., and expedite themarch. Here, however, there were indications of the concentration ofConfederate infantry, and he was obliged to keep his army closetogether.  He had no serious engagement; but he met some of the enemywho destroyed a few of his wagons about Decatur, Mississippi, where, bythe way, Sherman himself came near being picked up.He entered Meridian on the 14th of the month, the enemy having retreatedtoward Demopolis, Alabama. He spent several days in Meridian inthoroughly destroying the railroad to the north and south, and also forthe purpose of hearing from Sooy Smith, who he supposed had met Forrestbefore this time and he hoped had gained a decisive victory because of asuperiority of numbers. Hearing nothing of him, however, he started onhis return trip to Vicksburg.  There he learned that Smith, whilewaiting for a few of his men who had been ice-bound in the Ohio River,instead of getting off on the 1st as expected, had not left until the11th.  Smith did meet Forrest, but the result was decidedly in Forrest'sfavor.Sherman had written a letter to Banks, proposing a co-operative movementwith him against Shreveport, subject to my approval.  I disapproved ofSherman's going himself, because I had other important work for him todo, but consented that he might send a few troops to the aid of Banks,though their time to remain absent must be limited.  We must have themfor the spring campaign.  The trans-Mississippi movement provedabortive.My eldest son, who had accompanied me on the Vicksburg campaign andsiege, had while there contracted disease, which grew worse, until hehad grown so dangerously ill that on the 24th of January I obtainedpermission to go to St. Louis, where he was staying at the time, to seehim, hardly expecting to find him alive on my arrival.  While I waspermitted to go, I was not permitted to turn over my command to any oneelse, but was directed to keep the headquarters with me and tocommunicate regularly with all parts of my division and with Washington,just as though I had remained at Nashville.When I obtained this leave I was at Chattanooga, having gone there againto make preparations to have the troops of Thomas in the southern partof Tennessee co-operate with Sherman's movement in Mississippi.  Idirected Thomas, and Logan who was at Scottsboro, Alabama, to keep up athreatening movement to the south against J. E. Johnston, who had againrelieved Bragg, for the purpose of making him keep as many troops aspossible there.I learned through Confederate sources that Johnston had already sent twodivisions in the direction of Mobile, presumably to operate againstSherman, and two more divisions to Longstreet in East Tennessee.  Seeingthat Johnston had depleted in this way, I directed Thomas to send atleast ten thousand men, besides Stanley's division which was already tothe east, into East Tennessee, and notified Schofield, who was now incommand in East Tennessee, of this movement of troops into hisdepartment and also of the reinforcements Longstreet had received.  Myobject was to drive Longstreet out of East Tennessee as a part of thepreparations for my spring campaign.About this time General Foster, who had been in command of theDepartment of the Ohio after Burnside until Schofield relieved him(*21), advised me that he thought it would be a good thing to keepLongstreet just where he was; that he was perfectly quiet in EastTennessee, and if he was forced to leave there, his whole well-equippedarmy would be free to go to any place where it could effect the most fortheir cause.  I thought the advice was good, and, adopting that view,countermanded the orders for pursuit of Longstreet.On the 12th of February I ordered Thomas to take Dalton and hold it, ifpossible; and I directed him to move without delay. Finding that he hadnot moved, on the 17th I urged him again to start, telling him howimportant it was, that the object of the movement was to co-operate withSherman, who was moving eastward and might be in danger.  Then again onthe 21st, he not yet having started, I asked him if he could not startthe next day.  He finally got off on the 22d or 23d.  The enemy fellback from his front without a battle, but took a new position quite asstrong and farther to the rear.  Thomas reported that he could not goany farther, because it was impossible with his poor teams, nearlystarved, to keep up supplies until the railroads were repaired.  He soonfell back.Schofield also had to return for the same reason.  He could not carrysupplies with him, and Longstreet was between him and the supplies stillleft in the country.  Longstreet, in his retreat, would be movingtowards his supplies, while our forces, following, would be recedingfrom theirs.  On the 2d of March, however, I learned of Sherman'ssuccess, which eased my mind very much.  The next day, the 3d, I wasordered to Washington.The bill restoring the grade of lieutenant-general of the army hadpassed through Congress and became a law on the 26th of February.  Mynomination had been sent to the Senate on the 1st of March and confirmedthe next day (the 2d).  I was ordered to Washington on the 3d to receivemy commission, and started the day following that.  The commission washanded to me on the 9th.  It was delivered to me at the ExecutiveMansion by President Lincoln in the presence of his Cabinet, my eldestson, those of my staff who were with me and and a few other visitors.The President in presenting my commission read from a paper--stating,however, as a preliminary, and prior to the delivery of it, that he haddrawn that up on paper, knowing my disinclination to speak in public,and handed me a copy in advance so that I might prepare a few lines ofreply.  The President said:"General Grant, the nation's appreciation of what you have done, and itsreliance upon you for what remains to be done in the existing greatstruggle, are now presented, with this commission constituting youlieutenant-general in the Army of the United States.  With this highhonor, devolves upon you, also, a corresponding responsibility.  As thecountry herein trusts you, so, under God, it will sustain you.  Iscarcely need to add, that, with what I here speak for the nation, goesmy own hearty personal concurrence."To this I replied:  "Mr. President, I accept the commission, withgratitude for the high honor conferred.  With the aid of the noblearmies that have fought in so many fields for our common country, itwill be my earnest endeavor not to disappoint your expectations.  I feelthe full weight of the responsibilities now devolving on me; and I knowthat if they are met, it will be due to those armies, and above all, tothe favor of that Providence which leads both nations and men."On the 10th I visited the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac atBrandy Station; then returned to Washington, and pushed west at once tomake my arrangements for turning over the commands there and givinggeneral directions for the preparations to be made for the springcampaign.It had been my intention before this to remain in the West, even if Iwas made lieutenant-general; but when I got to Washington and saw thesituation it was plain that here was the point for the commandinggeneral to be.  No one else could, probably, resist the pressure thatwould be brought to bear upon him to desist from his own plans andpursue others.  I determined, therefore, before I started back to haveSherman advanced to my late position, McPherson to Sherman's in commandof the department, and Logan to the command of McPherson's corps. Thesechanges were all made on my recommendation and without hesitation.  Mycommission as lieutenant-general was given to me on the 9th of March,1864.  On the following day, as already stated, I visited General Meade,commanding the Army of the Potomac, at his headquarters at BrandyStation, north of the Rapidan.  I had known General Meade slightly inthe Mexican war, but had not met him since until this visit.  I was astranger to most of the Army of the Potomac, I might say to all exceptthe officers of the regular army who had served in the Mexican war.There had been some changes ordered in the organization of that armybefore my promotion.  One was the consolidation of five corps intothree, thus throwing some officers of rank out of important commands.Meade evidently thought that I might want to make still one more changenot yet ordered.  He said to me that I might want an officer who hadserved with me in the West, mentioning Sherman specially, to take hisplace.  If so, he begged me not to hesitate about making the change.  Heurged that the work before us was of such vast importance to the wholenation that the feeling or wishes of no one person should stand in theway of selecting the right men for all positions.  For himself, he wouldserve to the best of his ability wherever placed.  I assured him that Ihad no thought of substituting any one for him.  As to Sherman, he couldnot be spared from the West.This incident gave me even a more favorable opinion of Meade than didhis great victory at Gettysburg the July before.  It is men who wait tobe selected, and not those who seek, from whom we may always expect themost efficient service.Meade's position afterwards proved embarrassing to me if not to him.  Hewas commanding an army and, for nearly a year previous to my takingcommand of all the armies, was in supreme command of the Army of thePotomac--except from the authorities at Washington.  All other generalofficers occupying similar positions were independent in their commandsso far as any one present with them was concerned.  I tried to makeGeneral Meade's position as nearly as possible what it would have beenif I had been in Washington or any other place away from his command.  Itherefore gave all orders for the movements of the Army of the Potomacto Meade to have them executed.  To avoid the necessity of having togive orders direct, I established my headquarters near his, unless therewere reasons for locating them elsewhere.  This sometimes happened, andI had on occasions to give orders direct to the troops affected.  On the11th I returned to Washington and, on the day after, orders werepublished by the War Department placing me in command of all the armies.I had left Washington the night before to return to my old command inthe West and to meet Sherman whom I had telegraphed to join me inNashville.Sherman assumed command of the military division of the Mississippi onthe 18th of March, and we left Nashville together for Cincinnati.  I hadSherman accompany me that far on my way back to Washington so that wecould talk over the matters about which I wanted to see him, withoutlosing any more time from my new command than was necessary.  The firstpoint which I wished to discuss was particularly about the co-operationof his command with mine when the spring campaign should commence. Therewere also other and minor points, minor as compared with the greatimportance of the question to be decided by sanguinary war--therestoration to duty of officers who had been relieved from importantcommands, namely McClellan, Burnside and Fremont in the East, and Buell,McCook, Negley and Crittenden in the West.Some time in the winter of 1863-64 I had been invited by thegeneral-in-chief to give my views of the campaign I thought advisablefor the command under me--now Sherman's.  General J. E. Johnston wasdefending Atlanta and the interior of Georgia with an army, the largestpart of which was stationed at Dalton, about 38 miles south ofChattanooga. Dalton is at the junction of the railroad from Clevelandwith the one from Chattanooga to Atlanta.There could have been no difference of opinion as to the first duty ofthe armies of the military division of the Mississippi.  Johnston's armywas the first objective, and that important railroad centre, Atlanta,the second.  At the time I wrote General Halleck giving my views of theapproaching campaign, and at the time I met General Sherman, it wasexpected that General Banks would be through with the campaign which hehad been ordered upon before my appointment to the command of all thearmies, and would be ready to co-operate with the armies east of theMississippi, his part in the programme being to move upon Mobile by landwhile the navy would close the harbor and assist to the best of itsability. (*22) The plan therefore was for Sherman to attack Johnston anddestroy his army if possible, to capture Atlanta and hold it, and withhis troops and those of Banks to hold a line through to Mobile, or atleast to hold Atlanta and command the railroad running east and west,and the troops from one or other of the armies to hold important pointson the southern road, the only east and west road that would be left inthe possession of the enemy.  This would cut the Confederacy in twoagain, as our gaining possession of the Mississippi River had donebefore.  Banks was not ready in time for the part assigned to him, andcircumstances that could not be foreseen determined the campaign whichwas afterwards made, the success and grandeur of which has resoundedthroughout all lands.In regard to restoring officers who had been relieved from importantcommands to duty again, I left Sherman to look after those who had beenremoved in the West while I looked out for the rest.  I directed,however, that he should make no assignment until I could speak to theSecretary of War about the matter.  I shortly after recommended to theSecretary the assignment of General Buell to duty.  I received theassurance that duty would be offered to him; and afterwards theSecretary told me that he had offered Buell an assignment and that thelatter had declined it, saying that it would be degradation to acceptthe assignment offered.  I understood afterwards that he refused toserve under either Sherman or Canby because he had ranked them both.Both graduated before him and ranked him in the old army.  Shermanranked him as a brigadier-general.  All of them ranked me in the oldarmy, and Sherman and Buell did as brigadiers.  The worst excuse asoldier can make for declining service is that he once ranked thecommander he is ordered to report to.On the 23d of March I was back in Washington, and on the 26th took up myheadquarters at Culpeper Court-House, a few miles south of theheadquarters of the Army of the Potomac.Although hailing from Illinois myself, the State of the President, Inever met Mr. Lincoln until called to the capital to receive mycommission as lieutenant-general.  I knew him, however, very well andfavorably from the accounts given by officers under me at the West whohad known him all their lives.  I had also read the remarkable series ofdebates between Lincoln and Douglas a few years before, when they wererival candidates for the United States Senate.  I was then a resident ofMissouri, and by no means a "Lincoln man" in that contest; but Irecognized then his great ability.In my first interview with Mr. Lincoln alone he stated to me that he hadnever professed to be a military man or to know how campaigns should beconducted, and never wanted to interfere in them:  but thatprocrastination on the part of commanders, and the pressure from thepeople at the North and Congress, WHICH WAS ALWAYS WITH HIM, forced himinto issuing his series of "Military Orders"--one, two, three, etc.  Hedid not know but they were all wrong, and did know that some of themwere.  All he wanted or had ever wanted was some one who would take theresponsibility and act, and call on him for all the assistance needed,pledging himself to use all the power of the government in renderingsuch assistance.  Assuring him that I would do the best I could with themeans at hand, and avoid as far as possible annoying him or the WarDepartment, our first interview ended.The Secretary of War I had met once before only, but felt that I knewhim better.While commanding in West Tennessee we had occasionally heldconversations over the wires, at night, when they were not beingotherwise used.  He and General Halleck both cautioned me against givingthe President my plans of campaign, saying that he was so kind-hearted,so averse to refusing anything asked of him, that some friend would besure to get from him all he knew.  I should have said that in ourinterview the President told me he did not want to know what I proposedto do.  But he submitted a plan of campaign of his own which he wantedme to hear and then do as I pleased about.  He brought out a map ofVirginia on which he had evidently marked every position occupied by theFederal and Confederate armies up to that time.  He pointed out on themap two streams which empty into the Potomac, and suggested that thearmy might be moved on boats and landed between the mouths of thesestreams.  We would then have the Potomac to bring our supplies, and thetributaries would protect our flanks while we moved out.  I listenedrespectfully, but did not suggest that the same streams would protectLee's flanks while he was shutting us up.I did not communicate my plans to the President, nor did I to theSecretary of War or to General Halleck.March the 26th my headquarters were, as stated, at Culpeper, and thework of preparing for an early campaign commenced.CHAPTER XLVII.THE MILITARY SITUATION--PLANS FOR THE CAMPAIGN--SHERIDAN ASSIGNED TOCOMMAND OF THE CAVALRY--FLANK MOVEMENTS--FORREST AT FORT PILLOW--GENERALBANKS'S EXPEDITION--COLONEL MOSBY--AN INCIDENT OF THE WILDERNESSCAMPAIGN.When I assumed command of all the armies the situation was about this:the Mississippi River was guarded from St. Louis to its mouth; the lineof the Arkansas was held, thus giving us all the North-west north ofthat river.  A few points in Louisiana not remote from the river wereheld by the Federal troops, as was also the mouth of the Rio Grande.East of the Mississippi we held substantially all north of the Memphisand Charleston Railroad as far east as Chattanooga, thence along theline of the Tennessee and Holston rivers, taking in nearly all of theState of Tennessee.  West Virginia was in our hands; and that part ofold Virginia north of the Rapidan and east of the Blue Ridge we alsoheld.  On the sea-coast we had Fortress Monroe and Norfolk in Virginia;Plymouth, Washington and New Berne in North Carolina; Beaufort, Follyand Morris islands, Hilton Head, Port Royal and Fort Pulaski in SouthCarolina and Georgia; Fernandina, St. Augustine, Key West and Pensacolain Florida. The balance of the Southern territory, an empire in extent,was still in the hands of the enemy.Sherman, who had succeeded me in the command of the military division ofthe Mississippi, commanded all the troops in the territory west of theAlleghanies and north of Natchez, with a large movable force aboutChattanooga. His command was subdivided into four departments, but thecommanders all reported to Sherman and were subject to his orders.  Thisarrangement, however, insured the better protection of all lines ofcommunication through the acquired territory, for the reason that thesedifferent department commanders could act promptly in case of a suddenor unexpected raid within their respective jurisdictions withoutawaiting the orders of the division commander.In the East the opposing forces stood in substantially the samerelations towards each other as three years before, or when the warbegan; they were both between the Federal and Confederate capitals.  Itis true, footholds had been secured by us on the sea-coast, in Virginiaand North Carolina, but, beyond that, no substantial advantage had beengained by either side.  Battles had been fought of as great severity ashad ever been known in war, over ground from the James River andChickahominy, near Richmond, to Gettysburg and Chambersburg, inPennsylvania, with indecisive results, sometimes favorable to theNational army, sometimes to the Confederate army; but in every instance,I believe, claimed as victories for the South by the Southern press ifnot by the Southern generals.  The Northern press, as a whole, did notdiscourage these claims; a portion of it always magnified rebel successand belittled ours, while another portion, most sincerely earnest intheir desire for the preservation of the Union and the overwhelmingsuccess of the Federal armies, would nevertheless generally expressdissatisfaction with whatever victories were gained because they werenot more complete.That portion of the Army of the Potomac not engaged in guarding lines ofcommunication was on the northern bank of the Rapidan.  The Army ofNorthern Virginia confronting it on the opposite bank of the same river,was strongly intrenched and commanded by the acknowledged ablest generalin the Confederate army.  The country back to the James River is cut upwith many streams, generally narrow, deep, and difficult to cross exceptwhere bridged.  The region is heavily timbered, and the roads narrow,and very bad after the least rain.  Such an enemy was not, of course,unprepared with adequate fortifications at convenient intervals all theway back to Richmond, so that when driven from one fortified positionthey would always have another farther to the rear to fall back into.To provision an army, campaigning against so formidable a foe throughsuch a country, from wagons alone seemed almost impossible.  System anddiscipline were both essential to its accomplishment.The Union armies were now divided into nineteen departments, though fourof them in the West had been concentrated into a single militarydivision.  The Army of the Potomac was a separate command and had noterritorial limits.  There were thus seventeen distinct commanders.Before this time these various armies had acted separately andindependently of each other, giving the enemy an opportunity often ofdepleting one command, not pressed, to reinforce another more activelyengaged.  I determined to stop this.  To this end I regarded the Army ofthe Potomac as the centre, and all west to Memphis along the linedescribed as our position at the time, and north of it, the right wing;the Army of the James, under General Butler, as the left wing, and allthe troops south, as a force in rear of the enemy.  Some of these latterwere occupying positions from which they could not render serviceproportionate to their numerical strength.  All such were depleted tothe minimum necessary to hold their positions as a guard againstblockade runners; where they could not do this their positions wereabandoned altogether.  In this way ten thousand men were added to theArmy of the James from South Carolina alone, with General Gillmore incommand.  It was not contemplated that General Gillmore should leave hisdepartment; but as most of his troops were taken, presumably for activeservice, he asked to accompany them and was permitted to do so.Officers and soldiers on furlough, of whom there were many thousands,were ordered to their proper commands; concentration was the order ofthe day, and to have it accomplished in time to advance at the earliestmoment the roads would permit was the problem.As a reinforcement to the Army of the Potomac, or to act in support ofit, the 9th army corps, over twenty thousand strong, under GeneralBurnside, had been rendezvoused at Annapolis, Maryland.  This was anadmirable position for such a reinforcement.  The corps could be broughtat the last moment as a reinforcement to the Army of the Potomac, or itcould be thrown on the sea-coast, south of Norfolk, in Virginia or NorthCarolina, to operate against Richmond from that direction.  In factBurnside and the War Department both thought the 9th corps was intendedfor such an expedition up to the last moment.My general plan now was to concentrate all the force possible againstthe Confederate armies in the field.  There were but two such, as wehave seen, east of the Mississippi River and facing north.  The Army ofNorthern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee commanding, was on the southbank of the Rapidan, confronting the Army of the Potomac; the second,under General Joseph E. Johnston, was at Dalton, Georgia, opposed toSherman who was still at Chattanooga. Beside these main armies theConfederates had to guard the Shenandoah Valley, a great storehouse tofeed their armies from, and their line of communications from Richmondto Tennessee.  Forrest, a brave and intrepid cavalry general, was in theWest with a large force; making a larger command necessary to hold whatwe had gained in Middle and West Tennessee.  We could not abandon anyterritory north of the line held by the enemy because it would lay theNorthern States open to invasion.  But as the Army of the Potomac wasthe principal garrison for the protection of Washington even while itwas moving on Lee, so all the forces to the west, and the Army of theJames, guarded their special trusts when advancing from them as well aswhen remaining at them.  Better indeed, for they forced the enemy toguard his own lines and resources at a greater distance from ours, andwith a greater force.  Little expeditions could not so well be sent outto destroy a bridge or tear up a few miles of railroad track, burn astorehouse, or inflict other little annoyances.  Accordingly I arrangedfor a simultaneous movement all along the line.  Sherman was to movefrom Chattanooga, Johnston's army and Atlanta being his objectivepoints. (*23)  Crook, commanding in West Virginia, was to move from themouth of the Gauley River with a cavalry force and some artillery, theVirginia and Tennessee Railroad to be his objective.  Either the enemywould have to keep a large force to protect their communications, or seethem destroyed and a large amount of forage and provision, which they somuch needed, fall into our hands.  Sigel was in command in the Valley ofVirginia. He was to advance up the valley, covering the North from aninvasion through that channel as well while advancing as by remainingnear Harper's Ferry.  Every mile he advanced also gave us possession ofstores on which Lee relied.  Butler was to advance by the James River,having Richmond and Petersburg as his objective.Before the advance commenced I visited Butler at Fort Monroe. This wasthe first time I had ever met him.  Before giving him any order as tothe part he was to play in the approaching campaign I invited his views.They were very much such as I intended to direct, and as I did direct(*24), in writing, before leaving.General W. F. Smith, who had been promoted to the rank of major-generalshortly after the battle of Chattanooga on my recommendation, had notyet been confirmed.  I found a decided prejudice against hisconfirmation by a majority of the Senate, but I insisted that hisservices had been such that he should be rewarded.  My wishes were nowreluctantly complied with, and I assigned him to the command of one ofthe corps under General Butler.  I was not long in finding out that theobjections to Smith's promotion were well founded.In one of my early interviews with the President I expressed mydissatisfaction with the little that had been accomplished by thecavalry so far in the war, and the belief that it was capable ofaccomplishing much more than it had done if under a thorough leader.  Isaid I wanted the very best man in the army for that command.  Halleckwas present and spoke up, saying: "How would Sheridan do?"  I replied:"The very man I want." The President said I could have anybody I wanted.Sheridan was telegraphed for that day, and on his arrival was assignedto the command of the cavalry corps with the Army of the Potomac.  Thisrelieved General Alfred Pleasonton.  It was not a reflection on thatofficer, however, for I did not know but that he had been as efficientas any other cavalry commander.Banks in the Department of the Gulf was ordered to assemble all thetroops he had at New Orleans in time to join in the general move, Mobileto be his objective.At this time I was not entirely decided as to whether I should move theArmy of the Potomac by the right flank of the enemy, or by his left.Each plan presented advantages. (*25)  If by his right--my left--thePotomac, Chesapeake Bay and tributaries would furnish us an easy haulingdistance of every position the army could occupy from the Rapidan to theJames River.  But Lee could, if he chose, detach or move his whole armynorth on a line rather interior to the one I would have to take infollowing.  A movement by his left--our right--would obviate this; butall that was done would have to be done with the supplies and ammunitionwe started with.  All idea of adopting this latter plan was abandonedwhen the limited quantity of supplies possible to take with us wasconsidered.  The country over which we would have to pass was soexhausted of all food or forage that we would be obliged to carryeverything with us.While these preparations were going on the enemy was not entirely idle.In the West Forrest made a raid in West Tennessee up to the northernborder, capturing the garrison of four or five hundred men at UnionCity, and followed it up by an attack on Paducah, Kentucky, on the banksof the Ohio.  While he was able to enter the city he failed to capturethe forts or any part of the garrison.  On the first intelligence ofForrest's raid I telegraphed Sherman to send all his cavalry againsthim, and not to let him get out of the trap he had put himself into.Sherman had anticipated me by sending troops against him before he gotmy order.Forrest, however, fell back rapidly, and attacked the troops at FortPillow, a station for the protection of the navigation of theMississippi River.  The garrison consisted of a regiment of coloredtroops, infantry, and a detachment of Tennessee cavalry.  These troopsfought bravely, but were overpowered.  I will leave Forrest in hisdispatches to tell what he did with them."The river was dyed," he says, "with the blood of the slaughtered fortwo hundred yards.  The approximate loss was upward of five hundredkilled, but few of the officers escaping.  My loss was about twentykilled.  It is hoped that these facts will demonstrate to the Northernpeople that negro soldiers cannot cope with Southerners."  SubsequentlyForrest made a report in which he left out the part which shockshumanity to read.At the East, also, the rebels were busy.  I had said to Halleck thatPlymouth and Washington, North Carolina, were unnecessary to hold.  Itwould be better to have the garrisons engaged there added to Butler'scommand.  If success attended our arms both places, and others too,would fall into our hands naturally. These places had been occupied byFederal troops before I took command of the armies, and I knew that theExecutive would be reluctant to abandon them, and therefore explained myviews; but before my views were carried out the rebels captured thegarrison at Plymouth.  I then ordered the abandonment of Washington, butdirected the holding of New Berne at all hazards.  This was essentialbecause New Berne was a port into which blockade runners could enter.General Banks had gone on an expedition up the Red River long before mypromotion to general command.  I had opposed the movement strenuously,but acquiesced because it was the order of my superior at the time.  Bydirection of Halleck I had reinforced Banks with a corps of about tenthousand men from Sherman's command.  This reinforcement was wanted backbadly before the forward movement commenced.  But Banks had got so farthat it seemed best that he should take Shreveport on the Red River, andturn over the line of that river to Steele, who commanded in Arkansas,to hold instead of the line of the Arkansas.  Orders were givenaccordingly, and with the expectation that the campaign would be endedin time for Banks to return A. J. Smith's command to where it belongedand get back to New Orleans himself in time to execute his part in thegeneral plan.  But the expedition was a failure.  Banks did not get backin time to take part in the programme as laid down. Nor was Smithreturned until long after the movements of May, 1864, had been begun.The services of forty thousand veteran troops, over and above the numberrequired to hold all that was necessary in the Department of the Gulf,were thus paralyzed. It is but just to Banks, however, to say that hisexpedition was ordered from Washington and he was in no way responsibleexcept for the conduct of it.  I make no criticism on this point.  Heopposed the expedition.By the 27th of April spring had so far advanced as to justify me infixing a day for the great move.  On that day Burnside left Annapolis tooccupy Meade's position between Bull Run and the Rappahannock.  Meadewas notified and directed to bring his troops forward to his advance.On the following day Butler was notified of my intended advance on the4th of May, and he was directed to move the night of the same day andget as far up the James River as possible by daylight, and push on fromthere to accomplish the task given him.  He was also notified thatreinforcements were being collected in Washington City, which would beforwarded to him should the enemy fall back into the trenches atRichmond.  The same day Sherman was directed to get his forces up readyto advance on the 5th.  Sigel was in Winchester and was notified to movein conjunction with the others.The criticism has been made by writers on the campaign from the Rapidanto the James River that all the loss of life could have been obviated bymoving the army there on transports.  Richmond was fortified andintrenched so perfectly that one man inside to defend was more thanequal to five outside besieging or assaulting.  To get possession ofLee's army was the first great object.  With the capture of his armyRichmond would necessarily follow.  It was better to fight him outsideof his stronghold than in it.  If the Army of the Potomac had been movedbodily to the James River by water Lee could have moved a part of hisforces back to Richmond, called Beauregard from the south to reinforceit, and with the balance moved on to Washington. Then, too, I ordered amove, simultaneous with that of the Army of the Potomac, up the JamesRiver by a formidable army already collected at the mouth of the river.While my headquarters were at Culpeper, from the 26th of March to the4th of May, I generally visited Washington once a week to confer withthe Secretary of War and President.  On the last occasion, a few daysbefore moving, a circumstance occurred which came near postponing mypart in the campaign altogether. Colonel John S. Mosby had for a longtime been commanding a partisan corps, or regiment, which operated inthe rear of the Army of the Potomac.  On my return to the field on thisoccasion, as the train approached Warrenton Junction, a heavy cloud ofdust was seen to the east of the road as if made by a body of cavalry ona charge.  Arriving at the junction the train was stopped and inquiriesmade as to the cause of the dust. There was but one man at the station,and he informed us that Mosby had crossed a few minutes before at fullspeed in pursuit of Federal cavalry.  Had he seen our train coming, nodoubt he would have let his prisoners escape to capture the train.  Iwas on a special train, if I remember correctly, without any guard.Since the close of the war I have come to know Colonel Mosby personally,and somewhat intimately.  He is a different man entirely from what I hadsupposed.  He is slender, not tall, wiry, and looks as if he couldendure any amount of physical exercise.  He is able, and thoroughlyhonest and truthful. There were probably but few men in the South whocould have commanded successfully a separate detachment in the rear ofan opposing army, and so near the border of hostilities, as long as hedid without losing his entire command.On this same visit to Washington I had my last interview with thePresident before reaching the James River.  He had of course becomeacquainted with the fact that a general movement had been ordered allalong the line, and seemed to think it a new feature in war.  Iexplained to him that it was necessary to have a great number of troopsto guard and hold the territory we had captured, and to preventincursions into the Northern States.  These troops could perform thisservice just as well by advancing as by remaining still; and byadvancing they would compel the enemy to keep detachments to hold themback, or else lay his own territory open to invasion.  His answer was:"Oh, yes!  I see that.  As we say out West, if a man can't skin he musthold a leg while somebody else does."There was a certain incident connected with the Wilderness campaign ofwhich it may not be out of place to speak; and to avoid a digressionfurther on I will mention it here.A few days before my departure from Culpeper the Honorable E. B.Washburne visited me there, and remained with my headquarters for somedistance south, through the battle in the Wilderness and, I think, toSpottsylvania. He was accompanied by a Mr. Swinton, whom he presented asa literary gentleman who wished to accompany the army with a view ofwriting a history of the war when it was over.  He assured me--and Ihave no doubt Swinton gave him the assurance--that he was not present asa correspondent of the press.  I expressed an entire willingness to havehim (Swinton) accompany the army, and would have allowed him to do so asa correspondent, restricted, however, in the character of theinformation he could give.  We received Richmond papers with about asmuch regularity as if there had been no war, and knew that our paperswere received with equal regularity by the Confederates.  It wasdesirable, therefore, that correspondents should not be privileged spiesof the enemy within our lines.Probably Mr. Swinton expected to be an invited guest at my headquarters,and was disappointed that he was not asked to become so.  At all eventshe was not invited, and soon I found that he was corresponding with somepaper (I have now forgotten which one), thus violating his word eitherexpressed or implied.  He knew of the assurance Washburne had given asto the character of his mission.  I never saw the man from the day ofour introduction to the present that I recollect.  He accompanied us,however, for a time at least.The second night after crossing the Rapidan (the night of the 5th ofMay) Colonel W. R. Rowley, of my staff, was acting as night officer atmy headquarters.  A short time before midnight I gave him verbalinstructions for the night.  Three days later I read in a Richmond papera verbatim report of these instructions.A few nights still later (after the first, and possibly after thesecond, day's fighting in the Wilderness) General Meade came to my tentfor consultation, bringing with him some of his staff officers.  Bothhis staff and mine retired to the camp-fire some yards in front of thetent, thinking our conversation should be private.  There was a stump alittle to one side, and between the front of the tent and camp-fire.One of my staff, Colonel T. S. Bowers, saw what he took to be a manseated on the ground and leaning against the stump, listening to theconversation between Meade and myself.  He called the attention ofColonel Rowley to it.  The latter immediately took the man by theshoulder and asked him, in language more forcible than polite, what hewas doing there.  The man proved to be Swinton, the "historian," and hisreplies to the question were evasive and unsatisfactory, and he waswarned against further eaves-dropping.The next I heard of Mr. Swinton was at Cold Harbor.  General Meade cameto my headquarters saying that General Burnside had arrested Swinton,who at some previous time had given great offence, and had ordered himto be shot that afternoon.  I promptly ordered the prisoner to bereleased, but that he must be expelled from the lines of the army not toreturn again on pain of punishment.CHAPTER XLVIII.COMMENCEMENT OF THE GRAND CAMPAIGN--GENERAL BUTLER'S POSITION--SHERIDAN'S FIRST RAID.The armies were now all ready to move for the accomplishment of a singleobject.  They were acting as a unit so far as such a thing was possibleover such a vast field.  Lee, with the capital of the Confederacy, wasthe main end to which all were working.  Johnston, with Atlanta, was animportant obstacle in the way of our accomplishing the result aimed at,and was therefore almost an independent objective.  It was of lessimportance only because the capture of Johnston and his army would notproduce so immediate and decisive a result in closing the rebellion aswould the possession of Richmond, Lee and his army.  All other troopswere employed exclusively in support of these two movements.  This wasthe plan; and I will now endeavor to give, as concisely as I can, themethod of its execution, outlining first the operations of minordetached but co-operative columns.As stated before, Banks failed to accomplish what he had been sent to doon the Red River, and eliminated the use of forty thousand veteranswhose cooperation in the grand campaign had been expected--ten thousandwith Sherman and thirty thousand against Mobile.Sigel's record is almost equally brief.  He moved out, it is true,according to programme; but just when I was hoping to hear of good workbeing done in the valley I received instead the following announcementfrom Halleck:  "Sigel is in full retreat on Strasburg.  He will donothing but run; never did anything else."  The enemy had interceptedhim about New Market and handled him roughly, leaving him short sixguns, and some nine hundred men out of his six thousand.The plan had been for an advance of Sigel's forces in two columns.Though the one under his immediate command failed ingloriously the otherproved more fortunate.  Under Crook and Averell his western columnadvanced from the Gauley in West Virginia at the appointed time, andwith more happy results. They reached the Virginia and TennesseeRailroad at Dublin and destroyed a depot of supplies, besides tearing upseveral miles of road and burning the bridge over New River.  Havingaccomplished this they recrossed the Alleghanies to Meadow Bluffs andthere awaited further orders.Butler embarked at Fort Monroe with all his command, except the cavalryand some artillery which moved up the south bank of the James River.His steamers moved first up Chesapeake Bay and York River as ifthreatening the rear of Lee's army.  At midnight they turned back, andButler by daylight was far up the James River.  He seized City Point andBermuda Hundred early in the day, without loss and, no doubt, very muchto the surprise of the enemy.This was the accomplishment of the first step contemplated in myinstructions to Butler.  He was to act from here, looking to Richmond ashis objective point.  I had given him to understand that I should aim tofight Lee between the Rapidan and Richmond if he would stand; but shouldLee fall back into Richmond I would follow up and make a junction of thearmies of the Potomac and the James on the James River.  He was directedto secure a footing as far up the south side of the river as he could atas early a date as possible.Butler was in position by the 6th of May and had begun intrenching, andon the 7th he sent out his cavalry from Suffolk to cut the WeldonRailroad.  He also sent out detachments to destroy the railroad betweenPetersburg and Richmond, but no great success attended these latterefforts.  He made no great effort to establish himself on that road andneglected to attack Petersburg, which was almost defenceless.  About the11th he advanced slowly until he reached the works at Drury's Bluff,about half way between Bermuda Hundred and Richmond.  In the mean timeBeauregard had been gathering reinforcements.  On the 16th he attackedButler with great vigor, and with such success as to limit verymaterially the further usefulness of the Army of the James as a distinctfactor in the campaign.  I afterward ordered a portion of it to join theArmy of the Potomac, leaving a sufficient force with Butler to man hisworks, hold securely the footing he had already gained and maintain athreatening front toward the rear of the Confederate capital.The position which General Butler had chosen between the two rivers, theJames and Appomattox, was one of great natural strength, one where alarge area of ground might be thoroughly inclosed by means of a singleintrenched line, and that a very short one in comparison with the extentof territory which it thoroughly protected.  His right was protected bythe James River, his left by the Appomattox, and his rear by theirjunction--the two streams uniting near by.  The bends of the two streamsshortened the line that had been chosen for intrenchments, while itincreased the area which the line inclosed.Previous to ordering any troops from Butler I sent my chief engineer,General Barnard, from the Army of the Potomac to that of the James toinspect Butler's position and ascertain whether I could again safelymake an order for General Butler's movement in co-operation with mine,now that I was getting so near Richmond; or, if I could not, whether hisposition was strong enough to justify me in withdrawing some of histroops and having them brought round by water to White House to join meand reinforce the Army of the Potomac.  General Barnard reported theposition very strong for defensive purposes, and that I could do thelatter with great security; but that General Butler could not move fromwhere he was, in co-operation, to produce any effect. He said that thegeneral occupied a place between the James and Appomattox rivers whichwas of great strength, and where with an inferior force he could hold itfor an indefinite length of time against a superior; but that he coulddo nothing offensively.  I then asked him why Butler could not move outfrom his lines and push across the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad tothe rear and on the south side of Richmond.  He replied that it wasimpracticable, because the enemy had substantially the same line acrossthe neck of land that General Butler had.  He then took out his penciland drew a sketch of the locality, remarking that the position was likea bottle and that Butler's line of intrenchments across the neckrepresented the cork; that the enemy had built an equally strong lineimmediately in front of him across the neck; and it was therefore as ifButler was in a bottle.  He was perfectly safe against an attack; but,as Barnard expressed it, the enemy had corked the bottle and with asmall force could hold the cork in its place.  This struck me as beingvery expressive of his position, particularly when I saw the hastysketch which General Barnard had drawn; and in making my subsequentreport I used that expression without adding quotation marks, neverthinking that anything had been said that would attract attention--asthis did, very much to the annoyance, no doubt, of General Butler and, Iknow, very much to my own.  I found afterwards that this was mentionedin the notes of General Badeau's book, which, when they were shown tome, I asked to have stricken out; yet it was retained there, thoughagainst my wishes.I make this statement here because, although I have often made itbefore, it has never been in my power until now to place it where itwill correct history; and I desire to rectify all injustice that I mayhave done to individuals, particularly to officers who were gallantlyserving their country during the trying period of the war for thepreservation of the Union. General Butler certainly gave his veryearnest support to the war; and he gave his own best efforts personallyto the suppression of the rebellion.The further operations of the Army of the James can best be treated ofin connection with those of the Army of the Potomac, the two being sointimately associated and connected as to be substantially one body inwhich the individuality of the supporting wing is merged.Before giving the reader a summary of Sherman's great Atlanta campaign,which must conclude my description of the various co-operative movementspreparatory to proceeding with that of the operations of the centre, Iwill briefly mention Sheridan's first raid upon Lee's communicationswhich, though an incident of the operations on the main line and notspecifically marked out in the original plan, attained in its brilliantexecution and results all the proportions of an independent campaign.By thus anticipating, in point of time, I will be able to more perfectlyobserve the continuity of events occurring in my immediate front when Ishall have undertaken to describe our advance from the Rapidan.On the 8th of May, just after the battle of the Wilderness and when wewere moving on Spottsylvania I directed Sheridan verbally to cut loosefrom the Army of the Potomac, pass around the left of Lee's army andattack his cavalry:  to cut the two roads--one running west throughGordonsville, Charlottesville and Lynchburg, the other to Richmond, and,when compelled to do so for want of forage and rations, to move on tothe James River and draw these from Butler's supplies.  This move tookhim past the entire rear of Lee's army.  These orders were also given inwriting through Meade.The object of this move was three-fold.  First, if successfullyexecuted, and it was, he would annoy the enemy by cutting his line ofsupplies and telegraphic communications, and destroy or get for his ownuse supplies in store in the rear and coming up.  Second, he would drawthe enemy's cavalry after him, and thus better protect our flanks, rearand trains than by remaining with the army.  Third, his absence wouldsave the trains drawing his forage and other supplies fromFredericksburg, which had now become our base.  He started at daylightthe next morning, and accomplished more than was expected.  It wassixteen days before he got back to the Army of the Potomac.The course Sheridan took was directly to Richmond.  Before night Stuart,commanding the Confederate cavalry, came on to the rear of his command.But the advance kept on, crossed the North Anna, and at Beaver Dam, astation on the Virginia Central Railroad, recaptured four hundred Unionprisoners on their way to Richmond, destroyed the road and used anddestroyed a large amount of subsistence and medical stores.Stuart, seeing that our cavalry was pushing towards Richmond, abandonedthe pursuit on the morning of the 10th and, by a detour and anexhausting march, interposed between Sheridan and Richmond at YellowTavern, only about six miles north of the city.  Sheridan destroyed therailroad and more supplies at Ashland, and on the 11th arrived inStuart's front.  A severe engagement ensued in which the losses wereheavy on both sides, but the rebels were beaten, their leader mortallywounded, and some guns and many prisoners were captured.Sheridan passed through the outer defences of Richmond, and could, nodoubt, have passed through the inner ones.  But having no supports nearhe could not have remained.  After caring for his wounded he struck forthe James River below the city, to communicate with Butler and to resthis men and horses as well as to get food and forage for them.He moved first between the Chickahominy and the James, but in themorning (the 12th) he was stopped by batteries at Mechanicsville.  Hethen turned to cross to the north side of the Chickahominy by MeadowBridge.  He found this barred, and the defeated Confederate cavalry,reorganized, occupying the opposite side.  The panic created by hisfirst entrance within the outer works of Richmond having subsided troopswere sent out to attack his rear.He was now in a perilous position, one from which but few generals couldhave extricated themselves.  The defences of Richmond, manned, were tothe right, the Chickahominy was to the left with no bridge remaining andthe opposite bank guarded, to the rear was a force from Richmond.  Thisforce was attacked and beaten by Wilson's and Gregg's divisions, whileSheridan turned to the left with the remaining division and hastilybuilt a bridge over the Chickahominy under the fire of the enemy, forceda crossing and soon dispersed the Confederates he found there. The enemywas held back from the stream by the fire of the troops not engaged inbridge building.On the 13th Sheridan was at Bottom's Bridge, over the Chickahominy.  Onthe 14th he crossed this stream and on that day went into camp on theJames River at Haxall's Landing.  He at once put himself intocommunication with General Butler, who directed all the supplies hewanted to be furnished.Sheridan had left the Army of the Potomac at Spottsylvania, but did notknow where either this or Lee's army was now.  Great caution thereforehad to be exercised in getting back.  On the 17th, after resting hiscommand for three days, he started on his return.  He moved by the wayof White House.  The bridge over the Pamunkey had been burned by theenemy, but a new one was speedily improvised and the cavalry crossedover it.  On the 22d he was at Aylett's on the Matapony, where helearned the position of the two armies.  On the 24th he joined us on themarch from North Anna to Cold Harbor, in the vicinity of Chesterfield.Sheridan in this memorable raid passed entirely around Lee's army:encountered his cavalry in four engagements, and defeated them in all;recaptured four hundred Union prisoners and killed and captured many ofthe enemy; destroyed and used many supplies and munitions of war;destroyed miles of railroad and telegraph, and freed us from annoyanceby the cavalry of the enemy for more than two weeks.CHAPTER XLIX.SHERMAN'S CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA--SIEGE OF ATLANTA--DEATH OF GENERALMCPHERSON--ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE ANDERSONVILLE--CAPTURE OF ATLANTA.After separating from Sherman in Cincinnati I went on to Washington, asalready stated, while he returned to Nashville to assume the duties ofhis new command.  His military division was now composed of fourdepartments and embraced all the territory west of the AlleghanyMountains and east of the Mississippi River, together with the State ofArkansas in the trans-Mississippi.  The most easterly of these was theDepartment of the Ohio, General Schofield commanding; the next was theDepartment of the Cumberland, General Thomas commanding; the third theDepartment of the Tennessee, General McPherson commanding; and GeneralSteele still commanded the trans-Mississippi, or Department of Arkansas.The last-named department was so far away that Sherman could notcommunicate with it very readily after starting on his spring campaign,and it was therefore soon transferred from his military division to thatof the Gulf, where General Canby, who had relieved General Banks, was incommand.The movements of the armies, as I have stated in a former chapter, wereto be simultaneous, I fixing the day to start when the season should befar enough advanced, it was hoped, for the roads to be in a conditionfor the troops to march.General Sherman at once set himself to work preparing for the task whichwas assigned him to accomplish in the spring campaign.  McPherson lay atHuntsville with about twenty-four thousand men, guarding those points ofTennessee which were regarded as most worth holding; Thomas, with oversixty thousand men of the Army of the Cumberland, was at Chattanooga;and Schofield, with about fourteen thousand men, was at Knoxville. Withthese three armies, numbering about one hundred thousand men in all,Sherman was to move on the day fixed for the general advance, with aview of destroying Johnston's army and capturing Atlanta. He visitedeach of these commands to inform himself as to their condition, and itwas found to be, speaking generally, good.One of the first matters to turn his attention to was that of getting,before the time arrived for starting, an accumulation of suppliesforward to Chattanooga, sufficiently large to warrant a movement.  Hefound, when he got to that place, that the trains over the single-trackrailroad, which was frequently interrupted for a day or two at a time,were only sufficient to meet the daily wants of the troops withoutbringing forward any surplus of any kind.  He found, however, thattrains were being used to transport all the beef cattle, horses for thecavalry, and even teams that were being brought to the front.  He atonce changed all this, and required beef cattle, teams, cavalry horses,and everything that could travel, even the troops, to be marched, andused the road exclusively for transporting supplies.  In this way he wasable to accumulate an abundance before the time finally fixed upon forthe move, the 4th of May.As I have said already, Johnston was at Dalton, which was nearlyone-fourth of the way between Chattanooga and Atlanta. The country ismountainous all the way to Atlanta, abounding in mountain streams, someof them of considerable volume.  Dalton is on ground where water drainstowards Atlanta and into one of the main streams rising north-east fromthere and flowing south-west--this being the general direction which allthe main streams of that section take, with smaller tributaries enteringinto them.  Johnston had been preparing himself for this campaign duringthe entire winter.  The best positions for defence had been selected allthe way from Dalton back to Atlanta, and very strongly intrenched; sothat, as he might be forced to fall back from one position, he wouldhave another to fall into in his rear.  His position at Dalton was sovery strongly intrenched that no doubt he expected, or at least hoped,to hold Sherman there and prevent him from getting any further.  With aless skilful general, and one disposed to take no risks, I have no doubtthat he would have succeeded.Sherman's plan was to start Schofield, who was farthest back, a few daysin advance from Knoxville, having him move on the direct road to Dalton.Thomas was to move out to Ringgold.  It had been Sherman's intention tocross McPherson over the Tennessee River at Huntsville or Decatur, andmove him south from there so as to have him come into the road runningfrom Chattanooga to Atlanta a good distance to the rear of the pointJohnston was occupying; but when that was contemplated it was hoped thatMcPherson alone would have troops enough to cope with Johnston, if thelatter should move against him while unsupported by the balance of thearmy.  In this he was disappointed.  Two of McPherson's veterandivisions had re-enlisted on the express provision that they were tohave a furlough.  This furlough had not yet expired, and they were notback.Then, again, Sherman had lent Banks two divisions under A. J. Smith, thewinter before, to co-operate with the trans-Mississippi forces, and thiswith the express pledge that they should be back by a time specified, soas to be prepared for this very campaign.  It is hardly necessary to saythey were not returned.  That department continued to absorb troops tono purpose to the end of the war.  This left McPherson so weak that thepart of the plan above indicated had to be changed.  He was thereforebrought up to Chattanooga and moved from there on a road to the right ofThomas--the two coming together about Dalton.  The three armies wereabreast, all ready to start promptly on time.Sherman soon found that Dalton was so strongly fortified that it wasuseless to make any attempt to carry it by assault; and even to carry itby regular approaches was impracticable.  There was a narrowing up inthe mountain, between the National and Confederate armies, through whicha stream, a wagon road and a railroad ran.  Besides, the stream had beendammed so that the valley was a lake.  Through this gorge the troopswould have to pass.  McPherson was therefore sent around by the right,to come out by the way of Snake Creek Gap into the rear of the enemy.This was a surprise to Johnston, and about the 13th he decided toabandon his position at Dalton.On the 15th there was very hard fighting about Resaca; but our cavalryhaving been sent around to the right got near the road in the enemy'srear.  Again Johnston fell back, our army pursuing.  The pursuit wascontinued to Kingston, which was reached on the 19th with very littlefighting, except that Newton's division overtook the rear of Johnston'sarmy and engaged it.  Sherman was now obliged to halt for the purpose ofbringing up his railroad trains.  He was depending upon the railroad forall of his supplies, and as of course the railroad was wholly destroyedas Johnston fell back, it had to be rebuilt.  This work was pushedforward night and day, and caused much less delay than most personswould naturally expect in a mountainous country where there were so manybridges to be rebuilt.The campaign to Atlanta was managed with the most consummate skill, theenemy being flanked out of one position after another all the way there.It is true this was not accomplished without a good deal of fighting--some of it very hard fighting, rising to the dignity of very importantbattles--neither were single positions gained in a day.  On thecontrary, weeks were spent at some; and about Atlanta more than a monthwas consumed.It was the 23d of May before the road was finished up to the rear ofSherman's army and the pursuit renewed.  This pursuit brought him up tothe vicinity of Allatoona. This place was very strongly intrenched, andnaturally a very defensible position. An assault upon it was not thoughtof, but preparations were made to flank the enemy out of it.  This wasdone by sending a large force around our right, by the way of Dallas, toreach the rear of the enemy.  Before reaching there, however, they foundthe enemy fortified in their way, and there resulted hard fighting forabout a week at a place called New Hope Church.  On the left our troopsalso were fortified, and as close up to the enemy as they could get.They kept working still farther around to the left toward the railroad.This was the case more particularly with the cavalry.  By the 4th ofJune Johnston found that he was being hemmed in so rapidly that he drewoff and Allatoona was left in our possession.Allatoona, being an important place, was strongly intrenched foroccupation by our troops before advancing farther, and made a secondarybase of supplies.  The railroad was finished up to that point, theintrenchments completed, storehouses provided for food, and the army gotin readiness for a further advance. The rains, however, were falling insuch torrents that it was impossible to move the army by the side roadswhich they would have to move upon in order to turn Johnston out of hisnew position.While Sherman's army lay here, General F. P. Blair returned to it,bringing with him the two divisions of veterans who had been onfurlough.Johnston had fallen back to Marietta and Kenesaw Mountain, where strongintrenchments awaited him.  At this latter place our troops made anassault upon the enemy's lines after having got their own lines up closeto him, and failed, sustaining considerable loss.  But during theprogress of the battle Schofield was gaining ground to the left; and thecavalry on his left were gaining still more toward the enemy's rear.These operations were completed by the 3d of July, when it was foundthat Johnston had evacuated the place.  He was pursued at once.  Shermanhad made every preparation to abandon the railroad, leaving a strongguard in his intrenchments.  He had intended, moving out with twentydays' rations and plenty of ammunition, to come in on the railroad againat the Chattahoochee River.  Johnston frustrated this plan by himselfstarting back as above stated.  This time he fell back to theChattahoochee.About the 5th of July he was besieged again, Sherman getting easypossession of the Chattahoochee River both above and below him.  Theenemy was again flanked out of his position, or so frightened byflanking movements that on the night of the 9th he fell back across theriver.Here Johnston made a stand until the 17th, when Sherman's old tacticsprevailed again and the final movement toward Atlanta began.  Johnstonwas now relieved of the command, and Hood superseded him.Johnston's tactics in this campaign do not seem to have met with muchfavor, either in the eyes of the administration at Richmond, or of thepeople of that section of the South in which he was commanding.  Thevery fact of a change of commanders being ordered under suchcircumstances was an indication of a change of policy, and that now theywould become the aggressors--the very thing our troops wanted.For my own part, I think that Johnston's tactics were right. Anythingthat could have prolonged the war a year beyond the time that it didfinally close, would probably have exhausted the North to such an extentthat they might then have abandoned the contest and agreed to aseparation.Atlanta was very strongly intrenched all the way around in a circleabout a mile and a half outside of the city.  In addition to this, therewere advanced intrenchments which had to be taken before a close siegecould be commenced.Sure enough, as indicated by the change of commanders, the enemy wasabout to assume the offensive.  On the 20th he came out and attacked theArmy of the Cumberland most furiously.  Hooker's corps, and Newton's andJohnson's divisions were the principal ones engaged in this contest,which lasted more than an hour; but the Confederates were then forced tofall back inside their main lines.  The losses were quite heavy on bothsides.  On this day General Gresham, since our Postmaster-General, wasvery badly wounded.  During the night Hood abandoned his outer lines,and our troops were advanced.  The investment had not been relinquishedfor a moment during the day.During the night of the 21st Hood moved out again, passing by our leftflank, which was then in motion to get a position farther in rear ofhim, and a desperate battle ensued, which lasted most of the day of the22d.  At first the battle went very much in favor of the Confederates,our troops being somewhat surprised.  While our troops were advancingthey were struck in flank, and their flank was enveloped.  But they hadbecome too thorough veterans to be thrown into irreparable confusion byan unexpected attack when off their guard, and soon they were in orderand engaging the enemy, with the advantage now of knowing where theirantagonist was.  The field of battle continued to expand until itembraced about seven miles of ground.  Finally, however, and beforenight, the enemy was driven back into the city (*26).It was during this battle that McPherson, while passing from one columnto another, was instantly killed.  In his death the army lost one of itsablest, purest and best generals.Garrard had been sent out with his cavalry to get upon the railroad eastof Atlanta and to cut it in the direction of Augusta. He was successfulin this, and returned about the time of the battle.  Rousseau had alsocome up from Tennessee with a small division of cavalry, having crossedthe Tennessee River about Decatur and made a raid into Alabama. Finally,when hard pressed, he had come in, striking the railroad in rear ofSherman, and reported to him about this time.The battle of the 22d is usually known as the Battle of Atlanta,although the city did not fall into our hands until the 2d of September.Preparations went on, as before, to flank the enemy out of his position.The work was tedious, and the lines that had to be maintained were verylong.  Our troops were gradually worked around to the east until theystruck the road between Decatur and Atlanta. These lines were stronglyfortified, as were those to the north and west of the city--all as closeup to the enemy's lines as practicable--in order to hold them with thesmallest possible number of men, the design being to detach an army tomove by our right and try to get upon the railroad down south ofAtlanta.On the 27th the movement by the right flank commenced.  On the 28th theenemy struck our right flank, General Logan commanding, with greatvigor.  Logan intrenched himself hastily, and by that means was enabledto resist all assaults and inflict a great deal of damage upon theenemy.  These assaults were continued to the middle of the afternoon,and resumed once or twice still later in the day.  The enemy's losses inthese unsuccessful assaults were fearful.During that evening the enemy in Logan's front withdrew into the town.This now left Sherman's army close up to the Confederate lines,extending from a point directly east of the city around by the north andwest of it for a distance of fully ten miles; the whole of this linebeing intrenched, and made stronger every day they remained there.In the latter part of July Sherman sent Stoneman to destroy therailroads to the south, about Macon.  He was then to go east and, ifpossible, release our prisoners about Andersonville. There were painfulstories current at the time about the great hardships these prisonershad to endure in the way of general bad treatment, in the way in whichthey were housed, and in the way in which they were fed.  Great sympathywas felt for them; and it was thought that even if they could be turnedloose upon the country it would be a great relief to them.  But theattempt proved a failure.  McCook, who commanded a small brigade, wasfirst reported to have been captured; but he got back, having inflicteda good deal of damage upon the enemy.  He had also taken some prisoners;but encountering afterwards a largely superior force of the enemy he wasobliged to drop his prisoners and get back as best he could with whatmen he had left.  He had lost several hundred men out of his smallcommand.  On the 4th of August Colonel Adams, commanding a littlebrigade of about a thousand men, returned reporting Stoneman and all buthimself as lost.  I myself had heard around Richmond of the capture ofStoneman, and had sent Sherman word, which he received.  The rumor wasconfirmed there, also, from other sources.  A few days after ColonelAdams's return Colonel Capron also got in with a small detachment andconfirmed the report of the capture of Stoneman with something less thana thousand men.It seems that Stoneman, finding the escape of all his force wasimpossible, had made arrangements for the escape of two divisions.  Hecovered the movement of these divisions to the rear with a force ofabout seven hundred men, and at length surrendered himself and thisdetachment to the commanding Confederate.  In this raid, however, muchdamage was inflicted upon the enemy by the destruction of cars,locomotives, army wagons, manufactories of military supplies, etc.On the 4th and 5th Sherman endeavored to get upon the railroad to ourright, where Schofield was in command, but these attempts failedutterly.  General Palmer was charged with being the cause of thisfailure, to a great extent, by both General Sherman and GeneralSchofield; but I am not prepared to say this, although a question seemsto have arisen with Palmer as to whether Schofield had any right tocommand him.  If he did raise this question while an action was goingon, that act alone was exceedingly reprehensible.About the same time Wheeler got upon our railroad north of Resaca anddestroyed it nearly up to Dalton.  This cut Sherman off fromcommunication with the North for several days.  Sherman responded tothis attack on his lines of communication by directing one upon theirs.Kilpatrick started on the night of the 18th of August to reach the Maconroad about Jonesboro.  He succeeded in doing so, passed entirely aroundthe Confederate lines of Atlanta, and was back again in his formerposition on our left by the 22d.  These little affairs, however,contributed but very little to the grand result.  They annoyed, it istrue, but any damage thus done to a railroad by any cavalry expeditionis soon repaired.Sherman made preparations for a repetition of his tactics; that is, fora flank movement with as large a force as could be got together to somepoint in the enemy's rear.  Sherman commenced this last movement on the25th of August, and on the 1st of September was well up towards therailroad twenty miles south of Atlanta.  Here he found Hardeeintrenched, ready to meet him.  A battle ensued, but he was unable todrive Hardee away before night set in.  Under cover of the night,however, Hardee left of his own accord.  That night Hood blew up hismilitary works, such as he thought would be valuable in our hands, anddecamped.The next morning at daylight General H. W. Slocum, who was commandingnorth of the city, moved in and took possession of Atlanta, and notifiedSherman.  Sherman then moved deliberately back, taking three days toreach the city, and occupied a line extending from Decatur on the leftto Atlanta in the centre, with his troops extending out of the city forsome distance to the right.The campaign had lasted about four months, and was one of the mostmemorable in history.  There was but little if anything in the wholecampaign, now that it is over, to criticise at all, and nothing tocriticise severely.  It was creditable alike to the general whocommanded and the army which had executed it. Sherman had on thiscampaign some bright, wide-awake division and brigade commanders whosealertness added a host to the efficiency of his command.The troops now went to work to make themselves comfortable, and to enjoya little rest after their arduous campaign.  The city of Atlanta wasturned into a military base.  The citizens were all compelled to leave.Sherman also very wisely prohibited the assembling of the army ofsutlers and traders who always follow in the wake of an army in thefield, if permitted to do so, from trading with the citizens and gettingthe money of the soldiers for articles of but little use to them, andfor which they are made to pay most exorbitant prices.  He limited thenumber of these traders to one for each of his three armies.The news of Sherman's success reached the North instantaneously, and setthe country all aglow.  This was the first great political campaign forthe Republicans in their canvass of 1864.  It was followed later bySheridan's campaign in the Shenandoah Valley; and these two campaignsprobably had more effect in settling the election of the followingNovember than all the speeches, all the bonfires, and all the paradingwith banners and bands of music in the North.CHAPTER L.GRAND MOVEMENT OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC--CROSSING THE RAPIDAN--ENTERING THE WILDERNESS--BATTLE OF THE WILDERNESS.Soon after midnight, May 3d-4th, the Army of the Potomac moved out fromits position north Rapidan, to start upon that memorable campaign,destined to result in the capture of the Confederate capital and thearmy defending it.  This was not to be accomplished, however, without asdesperate fighting as the world has ever witnessed; not to beconsummated in a day, a week, a month, single season.  The lossesinflicted, and endured, were destined to be severe; but the armies nowconfronting each other had already been in deadly conflict for a periodof three years, with immense losses in killed, by death from sickness,captured and wounded; and neither had made any real progressaccomplishing the final end.  It is true the Confederates had, so far,held their capital, and they claimed this to be their sole object.  Butpreviously they had boldly proclaimed their intention to capturePhiladelphia, New York, and the National Capital, and had made severalattempts to do so, and once or twice had come fearfully near makingtheir boast good--too near for complacent contemplation by the loyalNorth. They had also come near losing their own capital on at least oneoccasion.  So here was a stand-off.  The campaign now begun was destinedto result in heavier losses, to both armies, in a given time, than anypreviously suffered; but the carnage was to be limited to a single year,and to accomplish all that had been anticipated or desired at thebeginning in that time.  We had to have hard fighting to achieve this.The two armies had been confronting each other so long, without anydecisive result, that they hardly knew which could whip.Ten days' rations, with a supply of forage and ammunition were taken inwagons.  Beef cattle were driven with the trains, and butchered aswanted.  Three days rations in addition, in haversacks, and fifty roundsof cartridges, were carried on the person of each soldier.The country over which the army had to operate, from the Rapidan to thecrossing of the James River, is rather flat, and is cut by numerousstreams which make their way to the Chesapeake Bay.  The crossings ofthese streams by the army were generally made not far above tide-water,and where they formed a considerable obstacle to the rapid advance oftroops even when the enemy did not appear in opposition.  The countryroads were narrow and poor. Most of the country is covered with a denseforest, in places, like the Wilderness and along the Chickahominy,almost impenetrable even for infantry except along the roads.  Allbridges were naturally destroyed before the National troops came tothem.The Army of the Potomac was composed of three infantry and one cavalrycorps, commanded respectively by Generals W. S. Hancock, G. K. Warren,(*27) John Sedgwick and P. H. Sheridan.  The artillery was commanded byGeneral Henry J. Hunt.  This arm was in such abundance that the fourthof it could not be used to advantage in such a country as we weredestined to pass through.  The surplus was much in the way, taking up asit did so much of the narrow and bad roads, and consuming so much of theforage and other stores brought up by the trains.The 5th corps, General Warren commanding, was in advance on the right,and marched directly for Germania Ford, preceded by one division ofcavalry, under General J. H. Wilson.  General Sedgwick followed Warrenwith the 6th corps.  Germania Ford was nine or ten miles below the rightof Lee's line.  Hancock, with the 2d corps, moved by another road,farther east, directly upon Ely's Ford, six miles below Germania,preceded by Gregg's division of cavalry, and followed by the artillery.Torbert's division of cavalry was left north of the Rapidan, for thetime, to picket the river and prevent the enemy from crossing andgetting into our rear.  The cavalry seized the two crossings beforedaylight, drove the enemy's pickets guarding them away, and by sixo'clock A.M. had the pontoons laid ready for the crossing of theinfantry and artillery.  This was undoubtedly a surprise to Lee.  Thefact that the movement was unopposed proves this.Burnside, with the 9th corps, was left back at Warrenton, guarding therailroad from Bull Run forward to preserve control of it in case ourcrossing the Rapidan should be long delayed. He was instructed, however,to advance at once on receiving notice that the army had crossed; and adispatch was sent to him a little after one P.M. giving the informationthat our crossing had been successful.The country was heavily wooded at all the points of crossing,particularly on the south side of the river.  The battle-field from thecrossing of the Rapidan until the final movement from the Wildernesstoward Spottsylvania was of the same character. There were someclearings and small farms within what might be termed the battle-field;but generally the country was covered with a dense forest.  The roadswere narrow and bad.  All the conditions were favorable for defensiveoperations.There are two roads, good for that part of Virginia, running from OrangeCourt House to the battle-field.  The most southerly of these roads isknown as the Orange Court House Plank Road, the northern one as theOrange Turnpike.  There are also roads from east of the battle-fieldrunning to Spottsylvania Court House, one from Chancellorsville,branching at Aldrich's; the western branch going by Piney Branch Church,Alsop's, thence by the Brock Road to Spottsylvania; the east branch goesby Gates's, thence to Spottsylvania.  The Brock Road runs from GermaniaFord through the battle-field and on to the Court House.  AsSpottsylvania is approached the country is cut up with numerous roads,some going to the town direct, and others crossing so as to connect thefarms with roads going there.Lee's headquarters were at Orange Court House.  From there toFredericksburg he had the use of the two roads above described runningnearly parallel to the Wilderness.  This gave him unusual facilities,for that country, for concentrating his forces to his right.  Theseroads strike the road from Germania Ford in the Wilderness.As soon as the crossing of the infantry was assured, the cavalry pushedforward, Wilson's division by Wilderness Tavern to Parker's store, onthe Orange Plank Road; Gregg to the left towards Chancellorsville.Warren followed Wilson and reached the Wilderness Tavern by noon, tookposition there and intrenched.  Sedgwick followed Warren.  He was acrossthe river and in camp on the south bank, on the right of Warren, bysundown.  Hancock, with the 2d corps, moved parallel with Warren andcamped about six miles east of him.  Before night all the troops, and bythe evening of the 5th the trains of more than four thousand wagons,were safely on the south side of the river.There never was a corps better organized than was the quartermaster'scorps with the Army of the Potomac in 1864. With a wagon-train thatwould have extended from the Rapidan to Richmond, stretched along insingle file and separated as the teams necessarily would be when moving,we could still carry only three days' forage and about ten to twelvedays' rations, besides a supply of ammunition.  To overcome alldifficulties, the chief quartermaster, General Rufus Ingalls, had markedon each wagon the corps badge with the division color and the number ofthe brigade.  At a glance, the particular brigade to which any wagonbelonged could be told.  The wagons were also marked to note thecontents:  if ammunition, whether for artillery or infantry; if forage,whether grain or hay; if rations, whether, bread, pork, beans, rice,sugar, coffee or whatever it might be.  Empty wagons were never allowedto follow the army or stay in camp.  As soon as a wagon was empty itwould return to the base of supply for a load of precisely the samearticle that had been taken from it.  Empty trains were obliged to leavethe road free for loaded ones.  Arriving near the army they would beparked in fields nearest to the brigades they belonged to.  Issues,except of ammunition, were made at night in all cases.  By this systemthe hauling of forage for the supply train was almost wholly dispensedwith.  They consumed theirs at the depots.I left Culpeper Court House after all the troops had been put in motion,and passing rapidly to the front, crossed the Rapidan in advance ofSedgwick's corps; and established headquarters for the afternoon andnight in a deserted house near the river.Orders had been given, long before this movement began, to cut down thebaggage of officers and men to the lowest point possible.Notwithstanding this I saw scattered along the road from Culpeper toGermania Ford wagon-loads of new blankets and overcoats, thrown away bythe troops to lighten their knapsacks; an improvidence I had neverwitnessed before.Lee, while his pickets and signal corps must have discovered at a veryearly hour on the morning of the 4th of May, that the Army of thePotomac was moving, evidently did not learn until about one o'clock inthe afternoon by what route we would confront his army.  This I judgefrom the fact that at 1.15 P.M., an hour and a quarter after Warren hadreached Old Wilderness Tavern, our officers took off rebel signalswhich, when translated, were seen to be an order to his troops to occupytheir intrenchments at Mine Run.Here at night dispatches were received announcing that Sherman, Butlerand Crook had moved according to programme.On discovering the advance of the Army of the Potomac, Lee ordered Hill,Ewell and Longstreet, each commanding corps, to move to the right toattack us, Hill on the Orange Plank Road, Longstreet to follow on thesame road.  Longstreet was at this time--middle of the afternoon--atGordonsville, twenty or more miles away.  Ewell was ordered by theOrange Pike.  He was near by and arrived some four miles east of MineRun before bivouacking for the night.My orders were given through General Meade for an early advance on themorning of the 5th.  Warren was to move to Parker's store, and Wilson'scavalry--then at Parker's store--to move on to Craig's meeting-house.Sedgwick followed Warren, closing in on his right.  The Army of thePotomac was facing to the west, though our advance was made to thesouth, except when facing the enemy.  Hancock was to move south-westwardto join on the left of Warren, his left to reach to Shady Grove Church.At six o'clock, before reaching Parker's store, Warren discovered theenemy.  He sent word back to this effect, and was ordered to halt andprepare to meet and attack him.  Wright, with his division of Sedgwick'scorps, was ordered, by any road he could find, to join on to Warren'sright, and Getty with his division, also of Sedgwick's corps, wasordered to move rapidly by Warren's rear and get on his left.  This wasthe speediest way to reinforce Warren who was confronting the enemy onboth the Orange plank and turnpike roads.Burnside had moved promptly on the 4th, on receiving word that the Armyof the Potomac had safely crossed the Rapidan.  By making a night march,although some of his troops had to march forty miles to reach the river,he was crossing with the head of his column early on the morning of the5th.  Meade moved his headquarters on to Old Wilderness Tavern, fourmiles south of the river, as soon as it was light enough to see theroad.  I remained to hasten Burnside's crossing and to put him inposition.  Burnside at this time was not under Meade's command, and washis senior in rank.  Getting information of the proximity of the enemy,I informed Meade, and without waiting to see Burnside, at once movedforward my headquarters to where Meade was.It was my plan then, as it was on all other occasions, to take theinitiative whenever the enemy could be drawn from his intrenchments ifwe were not intrenched ourselves.  Warren had not yet reached the pointwhere he was to halt, when he discovered the enemy near by.  Neitherparty had any advantage of position.  Warren was, therefore, ordered toattack as soon as he could prepare for it.  At nine o'clock Hancock wasordered to come up to the support of Getty.  He himself arrived atGetty's front about noon, but his troops were yet far in the rear.Getty was directed to hold his position at all hazards until relieved.About this hour Warren was ready, and attacked with favorable though notdecisive results.  Getty was somewhat isolated from Warren and was in aprecarious condition for a time.  Wilson, with his division of cavalry,was farther south, and was cut off from the rest of the army.  At twoo'clock Hancock's troops began to arrive, and immediately he was orderedto join Getty and attack the enemy.  But the heavy timber and narrowroads prevented him from getting into position for attack as promptly ashe generally did when receiving such orders.  At four o'clock he againreceived his orders to attack, and General Getty received orders fromMeade a few minutes later to attack whether Hancock was ready or not.He met the enemy under Heth within a few hundred yards.Hancock immediately sent two divisions, commanded by Birney and Mott,and later two brigades, Carroll's and Owen's, to the support of Getty.This was timely and saved Getty.  During the battle Getty and Carrollwere wounded, but remained on the field.  One of Birney's most gallantbrigade commanders--Alexander Hays--was killed.I had been at West Point with Hays for three years, and had served withhim through the Mexican war, a portion of the time in the same regiment.He was a most gallant officer, ready to lead his command whereverordered.  With him it was "Come, boys," not "Go."Wadsworth's division and Baxter's brigade of the 2d division were sentto reinforce Hancock and Getty; but the density of the interveningforest was such that, there being no road to march upon, they did notget up with the head of column until night, and bivouacked where theywere without getting into position.During the afternoon Sheridan sent Gregg's division of cavalry to Todd'sTavern in search of Wilson.  This was fortunate.  He found Wilsonengaged with a superior force under General Rosser, supported byinfantry, and falling back before it.  Together they were strong enoughto turn the tables upon the enemy and themselves become aggressive.They soon drove the rebel cavalry back beyond Corbin's Bridge.Fighting between Hancock and Hill continued until night put a close toit.  Neither side made any special progress.After the close of the battle of the 5th of May my orders were given forthe following morning.  We knew Longstreet with 12,000 men was on hisway to join Hill's right, near the Brock Road, and might arrive duringthe night.  I was anxious that the rebels should not take the initiativein the morning, and therefore ordered Hancock to make an assault at 4.30o'clock.  Meade asked to have the hour changed to six.  Deferring to hiswishes as far as I was willing, the order was modified and five wasfixed as the hour to move.Hancock had now fully one-half of the Army of the Potomac. Wadsworthwith his division, which had arrived the night before, lay in a lineperpendicular to that held by Hill, and to the right of Hancock.  He wasdirected to move at the same time, and to attack Hill's left.Burnside, who was coming up with two divisions, was directed to get inbetween Warren and Wadsworth, and attack as soon as he could get inposition to do so.  Sedgwick and Warren were to make attacks in theirfront, to detain as many of the enemy as they could and to takeadvantage of any attempt to reinforce Hill from that quarter.  Burnsidewas ordered if he should succeed in breaking the enemy's centre, toswing around to the left and envelop the right of Lee's army.  Hancockwas informed of all the movements ordered.Burnside had three divisions, but one of them--a colored division--wassent to guard the wagon train, and he did not see it again until July.Lee was evidently very anxious that there should be no battle on hisright until Longstreet got up.  This is evident from the fact thatnotwithstanding the early hour at which I had ordered the assault, bothfor the purpose of being the attacking party and to strike beforeLongstreet got up, Lee was ahead in his assault on our right.  Hispurpose was evident, but he failed.Hancock was ready to advance by the hour named, but learning in timethat Longstreet was moving a part of his corps by the Catharpin Road,thus threatening his left flank, sent a division of infantry, commandedby General Barlow, with all his artillery, to cover the approaches bywhich Longstreet was expected.  This disposition was made in time toattack as ordered.  Hancock moved by the left of the Orange Plank Road,and Wadsworth by the right of it. The fighting was desperate for aboutan hour, when the enemy began to break up in great confusion.I believed then, and see no reason to change that opinion now, that ifthe country had been such that Hancock and his command could have seenthe confusion and panic in the lines of the enemy, it would have beentaken advantage of so effectually that Lee would not have made anotherstand outside of his Richmond defences.Gibbon commanded Hancock's left, and was ordered to attack, but was notable to accomplish much.On the morning of the 6th Sheridan was sent to connect with Hancock'sleft and attack the enemy's cavalry who were trying to get on our leftand rear.  He met them at the intersection of the Furnace and Brockroads and at Todd's Tavern, and defeated them at both places.  Later hewas attacked, and again the enemy was repulsed.Hancock heard the firing between Sheridan and Stuart, and thinking theenemy coming by that road, still further reinforced his positionguarding the entrance to the Brock Road.  Another incident happenedduring the day to further induce Hancock to weaken his attacking column.Word reached him that troops were seen moving towards him from thedirection of Todd's Tavern, and Brooke's brigade was detached to meetthis new enemy; but the troops approaching proved to be several hundredconvalescents coming from Chancellorsville, by the road Hancock hadadvanced upon, to join their respective commands.  At 6.50 o'clock A.M.,Burnside, who had passed Wilderness Tavern at six o'clock, was orderedto send a division to the support of Hancock, but to continue with theremainder of his command in the execution of his previous order.  Thedifficulty of making a way through the dense forests prevented Burnsidefrom getting up in time to be of any service on the forenoon of thesixth.Hancock followed Hill's retreating forces, in the morning, a mile ormore.  He maintained this position until, along in the afternoon,Longstreet came upon him.  The retreating column of Hill meetingreinforcements that had not yet been engaged, became encouraged andreturned with them.  They were enabled, from the density of the forest,to approach within a few hundred yards of our advance before beingdiscovered.  Falling upon a brigade of Hancock's corps thrown to theadvance, they swept it away almost instantly.  The enemy followed up hisadvantage and soon came upon Mott's division, which fell back in greatconfusion.  Hancock made dispositions to hold his advanced position, butafter holding it for a time, fell back into the position that he hadheld in the morning, which was strongly intrenched.  In this engagementthe intrepid Wadsworth while trying to rally his men was mortallywounded and fell into the hands of the enemy.  The enemy followed up,but made no immediate attack.The Confederate General Jenkins was killed and Longstreet seriouslywounded in this engagement.  Longstreet had to leave the field, not toresume command for many weeks.  His loss was a severe one to Lee, andcompensated in a great measure for the mishap, or misapprehensions,which had fallen to our lot during the day.After Longstreet's removal from the field Lee took command of his rightin person.  He was not able, however, to rally his men to attackHancock's position, and withdrew from our front for the purpose ofreforming.  Hancock sent a brigade to clear his front of all remnantsthat might be left of Longstreet's or Hill's commands.  This brigadehaving been formed at right angles to the intrenchments held byHancock's command, swept down the whole length of them from left toright.  A brigade of the enemy was encountered in this move; but itbroke and disappeared without a contest.Firing was continued after this, but with less fury.  Burnside had notyet been able to get up to render any assistance.  But it was now onlyabout nine in the morning, and he was getting into position on Hancock'sright.At 4.15 in the afternoon Lee attacked our left.  His line moved up towithin a hundred yards of ours and opened a heavy fire. This status wasmaintained for about half an hour.  Then a part of Mott's division andWard's brigade of Birney's division gave way and retired in disorder.The enemy under R. H. Anderson took advantage of this and pushed throughour line, planting their flags on a part of the intrenchments not onfire.  But owing to the efforts of Hancock, their success was buttemporary.  Carroll, of Gibbon's division, moved at a double quick withhis brigade and drove back the enemy, inflicting great loss.  Fightinghad continued from five in the morning sometimes along the whole line,at other times only in places. The ground fought over had varied inwidth, but averaged three-quarters of a mile.  The killed, and many ofthe severely wounded, of both armies, lay within this belt where it wasimpossible to reach them.  The woods were set on fire by the burstingshells, and the conflagration raged.  The wounded who had not strengthto move themselves were either suffocated or burned to death.  Finallythe fire communicated with our breastworks, in places.  Beingconstructed of wood, they burned with great fury.  But the battle stillraged, our men firing through the flames until it became too hot toremain longer.Lee was now in distress.  His men were in confusion, and his personalefforts failed to restore order.  These facts, however, were learnedsubsequently, or we would have taken advantage of his condition and nodoubt gained a decisive success.  His troops were withdrawn now, but Irevoked the order, which I had given previously to this assault, forHancock to attack, because his troops had exhausted their ammunition anddid not have time to replenish from the train, which was at somedistance.Burnside, Sedgwick, and Warren had all kept up an assault during allthis time; but their efforts had no other effect than to prevent theenemy from reinforcing his right from the troops in their front.I had, on the 5th, ordered all the bridges over the Rapidan to be takenup except one at Germania Ford.The troops on Sedgwick's right had been sent to enforce our left.  Thisleft our right in danger of being turned, and us of being cut off fromall present base of supplies.  Sedgwick had refused his right andintrenched it for protection against attack.  But late in the afternoonof the 6th Early came out from his lines in considerable force and gotin upon Sedgwick's right, notwithstanding the precautions taken, andcreated considerable confusion.  Early captured several hundredprisoners, among them two general officers.  The defence, however, wasvigorous; and night coming on, the enemy was thrown into as muchconfusion as our troops, engaged, were.  Early says in his Memoirs thatif we had discovered the confusion in his lines we might have broughtfresh troops to his great discomfort.  Many officers, who had not beenattacked by Early, continued coming to my headquarters even afterSedgwick had rectified his lines a little farther to the rear, with newsof the disaster, fully impressed with the idea that the enemy waspushing on and would soon be upon me.During the night all of Lee's army withdrew within their intrenchments.On the morning of the 7th General Custer drove the enemy's cavalry fromCatharpin Furnace to Todd's Tavern. Pickets and skirmishers were sentalong our entire front to find the position of the enemy.  Some went asfar as a mile and a half before finding him. But Lee showed nodisposition to come out of his Works.  There was no battle during theday, and but little firing except in Warren's front; he being directedabout noon to make a reconnoissance in force.  This drew some sharpfiring, but there was no attempt on the part of Lee to drive him back.This ended the Battle of the Wilderness.CHAPTER LI.AFTER THE BATTLE--TELEGRAPH AND SIGNAL SERVICE--MOVEMENT BY THE LEFTFLANK.More desperate fighting has not been witnessed on this continent thanthat of the 5th and 6th of May.  Our victory consisted in havingsuccessfully crossed a formidable stream, almost in the face of anenemy, and in getting the army together as a unit. We gained anadvantage on the morning of the 6th, which, if it had been followed up,must have proven very decisive.  In the evening the enemy gained anadvantage; but was speedily repulsed.  As we stood at the close, the twoarmies were relatively in about the same condition to meet each other aswhen the river divided them.  But the fact of having safely crossed wasa victory.Our losses in the Wilderness were very severe.  Those of theConfederates must have been even more so; but I have no means ofspeaking with accuracy upon this point.  The Germania Ford bridge wastransferred to Ely's Ford to facilitate the transportation of thewounded to Washington.It may be as well here as elsewhere to state two things connected withall movements of the Army of the Potomac:  first, in every change ofposition or halt for the night, whether confronting the enemy or not,the moment arms were stacked the men intrenched themselves.  For thispurpose they would build up piles of logs or rails if they could befound in their front, and dig a ditch, throwing the dirt forward on thetimber.  Thus the digging they did counted in making a depression tostand in, and increased the elevation in front of them.  It waswonderful how quickly they could in this way construct defences ofconsiderable strength.  When a halt was made with the view of assaultingthe enemy, or in his presence, these would be strengthened or theirpositions changed under the direction of engineer officers.  The secondwas, the use made of the telegraph and signal corps.  Nothing could bemore complete than the organization and discipline of this body of braveand intelligent men.  Insulated wires--insulated so that they wouldtransmit messages in a storm, on the ground or under water--were woundupon reels, making about two hundred pounds weight of wire to each reel.Two men and one mule were detailed to each reel.  The pack-saddle onwhich this was carried was provided with a rack like a sawbuck placedcrosswise of the saddle, and raised above it so that the reel, with itswire, would revolve freely.  There was a wagon, supplied with atelegraph operator, battery and telegraph instruments for each division,each corps, each army, and one for my headquarters.  There were wagonsalso loaded with light poles, about the size and length of a wall tentpole, supplied with an iron spike in one end, used to hold the wires upwhen laid, so that wagons and artillery would not run over them.  Themules thus loaded were assigned to brigades, and always kept with thecommand they were assigned to.  The operators were also assigned toparticular headquarters, and never changed except by special orders.The moment the troops were put in position to go into camp all the menconnected with this branch of service would proceed to put up theirwires.  A mule loaded with a coil of wire would be led to the rear ofthe nearest flank of the brigade he belonged to, and would be led in aline parallel thereto, while one man would hold an end of the wire anduncoil it as the mule was led off.  When he had walked the length of thewire the whole of it would be on the ground.  This would be done in rearof every brigade at the same time.  The ends of all the wires would thenbe joined, making a continuous wire in the rear of the whole army.  Themen, attached to brigades or divisions, would all commence at onceraising the wires with their telegraph poles. This was done by making aloop in the wire and putting it over the spike and raising the pole to aperpendicular position.  At intervals the wire would be attached totrees, or some other permanent object, so that one pole was sufficientat a place. In the absence of such a support two poles would have to beused, at intervals, placed at an angle so as to hold the wire firm inits place.  While this was being done the telegraph wagons would taketheir positions near where the headquarters they belonged to were to beestablished, and would connect with the wire. Thus, in a few minuteslonger time than it took a mule to walk the length of its coil,telegraphic communication would be effected between all the headquartersof the army.  No orders ever had to be given to establish the telegraph.The signal service was used on the march.  The men composing this corpswere assigned to specified commands.  When movements were made, theywould go in advance, or on the flanks, and seize upon high points ofground giving a commanding view of the country, if cleared, or wouldclimb tall trees on the highest points if not cleared, and would denote,by signals, the positions of different parts of our own army, and oftenthe movements of the enemy.  They would also take off the signals of theenemy and transmit them.  It would sometimes take too long a time tomake translations of intercepted dispatches for us to receive anybenefit from them.  But sometimes they gave useful information.On the afternoon of the 7th I received news from Washington announcingthat Sherman had probably attacked Johnston that day, and that Butlerhad reached City Point safely and taken it by surprise on the 5th.  Ihad given orders for a movement by the left flank, fearing that Leemight move rapidly to Richmond to crush Butler before I could get there.My order for this movement was as follows:HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S., May 7, 1864, 6.30 A.M.MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Commanding A. P.Make all preparations during the day for a night march to take positionat Spottsylvania C. H. with one army corps, at Todd's Tavern with one,and another near the intersection of the Piney Branch and Spottsylvaniaroad with the road from Alsop's to Old Court House.  If this move ismade the trains should be thrown forward early in the morning to the NyRiver.I think it would be advisable in making the change to leave Hancockwhere he is until Warren passes him.  He could then follow and becomethe right of the new line.  Burnside will move to Piney Branch Church.Sedgwick can move along the pike to Chancellorsville and on to hisdestination.  Burnside will move on the plank road to the intersectionof it with the Orange and Fredericksburg plank road, then followSedgwick to his place of destination.All vehicles should be got out of hearing of the enemy before the troopsmove, and then move off quietly.It is more than probable that the enemy concentrate for a heavy attackon Hancock this afternoon.  In case they do we must be prepared toresist them, and follow up any success we may gain, with our wholeforce.  Such a result would necessarily modify these instructions.All the hospitals should be moved to-day to Chancellorsville.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.During the 7th Sheridan had a fight with the rebel cavalry at Todd'sTavern, but routed them, thus opening the way for the troops that wereto go by that route at night.  Soon after dark Warren withdrew from thefront of the enemy, and was soon followed by Sedgwick.  Warren's marchcarried him immediately behind the works where Hancock's command lay onthe Brock Road.  With my staff and a small escort of cavalry I precededthe troops.  Meade with his staff accompanied me.  The greatestenthusiasm was manifested by Hancock's men as we passed by.  No doubt itwas inspired by the fact that the movement was south. It indicated tothem that they had passed through the "beginning of the end" in thebattle just fought.  The cheering was so lusty that the enemy must havetaken it for a night attack.  At all events it drew from him a furiousfusillade of artillery and musketry, plainly heard but not felt by us.Meade and I rode in advance.  We had passed but a little way beyond ourleft when the road forked.  We looked to see, if we could, which roadSheridan had taken with his cavalry during the day.  It seemed to be theright-hand one, and accordingly we took it.  We had not gone far,however, when Colonel C. B. Comstock, of my staff, with the instinct ofthe engineer, suspecting that we were on a road that would lead us intothe lines of the enemy, if he, too, should be moving, dashed by at arapid gallop and all alone.  In a few minutes he returned and reportedthat Lee was moving, and that the road we were on would bring us intohis lines in a short distance.  We returned to the forks of the road,left a man to indicate the right road to the head of Warren's columnwhen it should come up, and continued our journey to Todd's Tavern,where we arrived after midnight.My object in moving to Spottsylvania was two-fold:  first, I did notwant Lee to get back to Richmond in time to attempt to crush Butlerbefore I could get there; second, I wanted to get between his army andRichmond if possible; and, if not, to draw him into the open field.  ButLee, by accident, beat us to Spottsylvania.  Our wagon trains had beenordered easterly of the roads the troops were to march upon before themovement commenced.  Lee interpreted this as a semi-retreat of the Armyof the Potomac to Fredericksburg, and so informed his government.Accordingly he ordered Longstreet's corps--now commanded by Anderson--tomove in the morning (the 8th) to Spottsylvania.  But the woods beingstill on fire, Anderson could not go into bivouac, and marched directlyon to his destination that night.  By this accident Lee got possessionof Spottsylvania.  It is impossible to say now what would have been theresult if Lee's orders had been obeyed as given; but it is certain thatwe would have been in Spottsylvania, and between him and his capital.My belief is that there would have been a race between the two armies tosee which could reach Richmond first, and the Army of the Potomac wouldhave had the shorter line.  Thus, twice since crossing the Rapidan wecame near closing the campaign, so far as battles were concerned, fromthe Rapidan to the James River or Richmond.  The first failure wascaused by our not following up the success gained over Hill's corps onthe morning of the 6th, as before described:  the second, when firescaused by that battle drove Anderson to make a march during the night ofthe 7th-8th which he was ordered to commence on the morning of the 8th.But accident often decides the fate of battle.Sheridan's cavalry had had considerable fighting during the afternoon ofthe 7th, lasting at Todd's Tavern until after night, with the field hisat the close.  He issued the necessary orders for seizing Spottsylvaniaand holding the bridge over the Po River, which Lee's troops would haveto cross to get to Spottsylvania.  But Meade changed Sheridan's ordersto Merritt--who was holding the bridge--on his arrival at Todd's Tavern,and thereby left the road free for Anderson when he came up.  Wilson,who was ordered to seize the town, did so, with his division of cavalry;but he could not hold it against the Confederate corps which had notbeen detained at the crossing of the Po, as it would have been but forthe unfortunate change in Merritt's orders.  Had he been permitted toexecute the orders Sheridan gave him, he would have been guarding withtwo brigades of cavalry the bridge over the Po River which Anderson hadto cross, and must have detained him long enough to enable Warren toreinforce Wilson and hold the town.Anderson soon intrenched himself--if indeed the intrenchments were notalready made--immediately across Warren's front. Warren was not aware ofhis presence, but probably supposed it was the cavalry which Merritt hadengaged earlier in the day. He assaulted at once, but was repulsed.  Hesoon organized his men, as they were not pursued by the enemy, and madea second attack, this time with his whole corps.  This time he succeededin gaining a position immediately in the enemy's front, where heintrenched.  His right and left divisions--the former Crawford's, thelatter Wadsworth's, now commanded by Cutler--drove the enemy back somedistance.At this time my headquarters had been advanced to Piney Branch Church.I was anxious to crush Anderson before Lee could get a force to hissupport.  To this end Sedgwick who was at Piney Branch Church, wasordered to Warren's support.  Hancock, who was at Todd's Tavern, wasnotified of Warren's engagement, and was directed to be in readiness tocome up.  Burnside, who was with the wagon trains at Aldrich's on ourextreme left, received the same instructions.  Sedgwick was slow ingetting up for some reason--probably unavoidable, because he was neverat fault when serious work was to be done--so that it was near nightbefore the combined forces were ready to attack.  Even then all ofSedgwick's command did not get into the engagement.  Warren led the lastassault, one division at a time, and of course it failed.Warren's difficulty was twofold:  when he received an order to doanything, it would at once occur to his mind how all the balance of thearmy should be engaged so as properly to co-operate with him.  His ideaswere generally good, but he would forget that the person giving himorders had thought of others at the time he had of him.  In like manner,when he did get ready to execute an order, after giving most intelligentinstructions to division commanders, he would go in with one division,holding the others in reserve until he could superintend their movementsin person also, forgetting that division commanders could execute anorder without his presence.  His difficulty was constitutional andbeyond his control.  He was an officer of superior ability, quickperceptions, and personal courage to accomplish anything that could bedone with a small command.Lee had ordered Hill's corps--now commanded by Early--to move by thevery road we had marched upon.  This shows that even early in themorning of the 8th Lee had not yet become acquainted with my move, butstill thought that the Army of the Potomac had gone to Fredericksburg.Indeed, he informed the authorities at Richmond he had possession ofSpottsylvania and was on my flank. Anderson was in possession ofSpottsylvania, through no foresight of Lee, however.  Early only foundthat he had been following us when he ran against Hancock at Todd'sTavern.  His coming detained Hancock from the battle-field ofSpottsylvania for that day; but he, in like manner, kept Early back andforced him to move by another route.Had I ordered the movement for the night of the 7th by my left flank, itwould have put Hancock in the lead.  It would also have given us an houror earlier start.  It took all that time for Warren to get the head ofhis column to the left of Hancock after he had got his troops out oftheir line confronting the enemy.  This hour, and Hancock's capacity touse his whole force when necessary, would, no doubt, have enabled him tocrush Anderson before he could be reinforced.  But the movement made wastactical.  It kept the troops in mass against a possible assault by theenemy.  Our left occupied its intrenchments while the two corps to theright passed.  If an attack had been made by the enemy he would havefound the 2d corps in position, fortified, and, practically, the 5th and6th corps in position as reserves, until his entire front was passed.By a left flank movement the army would have been scattered while stillpassing the front of the enemy, and before the extreme right had got byit would have been very much exposed.  Then, too, I had not yet learnedthe special qualifications of the different corps commanders.  At thattime my judgment was that Warren was the man I would suggest to succeedMeade should anything happen to that gallant soldier to take him fromthe field.  As I have before said, Warren was a gallant soldier, an ableman; and he was beside thoroughly imbued with the solemnity andimportance of the duty he had to perform.CHAPTER LII.BATTLE OF SPOTTSYLVANIA--HANCOCK'S POSITION--ASSAULT OF WARREN'S ANDWRIGHT'S CORPS--UPTON PROMOTED ON THE FIELD--GOOD NEWS FROM BUTLER ANDSHERIDAN.The Mattapony River is formed by the junction of the Mat, the Ta, the Poand the Ny rivers, the last being the northernmost of the four.  Ittakes its rise about a mile south and a little east of the WildernessTavern.  The Po rises south-west of the place, but farther away.Spottsylvania is on the ridge dividing these two streams, and where theyare but a few miles apart.  The Brock Road reaches Spottsylvania withoutcrossing either of these streams. Lee's army coming up by the CatharpinRoad, had to cross the Po at Wooden Bridge.  Warren and Hancock came bythe Brock Road.  Sedgwick crossed the Ny at Catharpin Furnace. Burnsidecoming by Aldrich's to Gates's house, had to cross the Ny near theenemy.  He found pickets at the bridge, but they were soon driven off bya brigade of Willcox's division, and the stream was crossed.  Thisbrigade was furiously attacked; but the remainder of the division comingup, they were enabled to hold their position, and soon fortified it.About the time I received the news of this attack, word came fromHancock that Early had left his front.  He had been forced over to theCatharpin Road, crossing the Po at Corbin's and again at Wooden Bridge.These are the bridges Sheridan had given orders to his cavalry to occupyon the 8th, while one division should occupy Spottsylvania.  Thesemovements of the enemy gave me the idea that Lee was about to make theattempt to get to, or towards, Fredericksburg to cut off my supplies.  Imade arrangements to attack his right and get between him and Richmondif he should try to execute this design.  If he had any such intentionit was abandoned as soon as Burnside was established south of the Ny.The Po and the Ny are narrow little streams, but deep, with abruptbanks, and bordered by heavily wooded and marshy bottoms--at the time wewere there--and difficult to cross except where bridged.  The countryabout was generally heavily timbered, but with occasional clearings.  Itwas a much better country to conduct a defensive campaign in than anoffensive one.By noon of the 9th the position of the two armies was as follows:  Leeoccupied a semicircle facing north, north-west and north-east, inclosingthe town.  Anderson was on his left extending to the Po, Ewell camenext, then Early.  Warren occupied our right, covering the Brock andother roads converging at Spottsylvania; Sedgwick was to his left andBurnside on our extreme left.  Hancock was yet back at Todd's Tavern,but as soon as it was known that Early had left Hancock's front thelatter was ordered up to Warren's right.  He formed a line with threedivisions on the hill overlooking the Po early in the afternoon, and wasordered to cross the Po and get on the enemy's flank.  The fourthdivision of Hancock's corps, Mott commanding, was left at Todd's whenthe corps first came up; but in the afternoon it was brought up andplaced to the left of Sedgwick's--now Wright's--6th corps.  In themorning General Sedgwick had been killed near the right of hisintrenchments by rebel sharpshooters.  His loss was a severe one to theArmy of the Potomac and to the Nation.  General H. G. Wright succeededhim in the command of his corps.Hancock was now, nine P.M. of the 9th of May, across the left flank ofLee's army, but separated from it, and also from the remainder ofMeade's army, by the Po River.  But for the lateness of the hour and thedarkness of the night he would have attempted to cross the river againat Wooden Bridge, thus bringing himself on the same side with bothfriend and foe.The Po at the points where Hancock's corps crossed runs nearly due east.Just below his lower crossing--the troops crossed at three points--itturns due south, and after passing under Wooden Bridge soon resumes amore easterly direction.  During the night this corps built threebridges over the Po; but these were in rear.The position assumed by Hancock's corps forced Lee to reinforce his leftduring the night.  Accordingly on the morning of the 10th, when Hancockrenewed his effort to get over the Po to his front, he found himselfconfronted by some of Early's command, which had been brought from theextreme right of the enemy during the night.  He succeeded in effectinga crossing with one brigade, however, but finding the enemy intrenchedin his front, no more were crossed.Hancock reconnoitred his front on the morning of the 10th, with the viewof forcing a crossing, if it was found that an advantage could begained.  The enemy was found strongly intrenched on the high groundoverlooking the river, and commanding the Wooden Bridge with artillery.Anderson's left rested on the Po, where it turns south; therefore, forHancock to cross over--although it would bring him to the same side ofthe stream with the rest of the army--would still farther isolate himfrom it.  The stream would have to be crossed twice in the face of theenemy to unite with the main body.  The idea of crossing was thereforeabandoned.Lee had weakened the other parts of his line to meet this movement ofHancock's, and I determined to take advantage of it.  Accordingly in themorning, orders were issued for an attack in the afternoon on the centreby Warren's and Wright's corps, Hancock to command all the attackingforce.  Two of his divisions were brought to the north side of the Po.Gibbon was placed to the right of Warren, and Birney in his rear as areserve.  Barlow's division was left south of the stream, and Mott ofthe same corps was still to the left of Wright's corps.  Burnside wasordered to reconnoitre his front in force, and, if an opportunitypresented, to attack with vigor.  The enemy seeing Barlow's divisionisolated from the rest of the army, came out and attacked with fury.Barlow repulsed the assault with great slaughter, and with considerableloss to himself.  But the enemy reorganized and renewed the assault.Birney was now moved to the high ground overlooking the river crossingsbuilt by our troops, and covered the crossings.  The second assault wasrepulsed, again with severe loss to the enemy, and Barlow was withdrawnwithout further molestation. General T. G. Stevenson was killed in thismove.Between the lines, where Warren's assault was to take place, there was aravine grown up with large trees and underbrush, making it almostimpenetrable by man.  The slopes on both sides were also covered with aheavy growth of timber.  Warren, before noon, reconnoitred his fronttwice, the first time with one and the second with two divisions.  Hewas repulsed on both occasions, but gained such information of theground as to induce him to report recommending the assault.Wright also reconnoitred his front and gained a considerably advancedposition from the one he started from.  He then organized a stormingparty, consisting of twelve regiments, and assigned Colonel Emory Upton,of the 121st New York Volunteers, to the command of it.  About fouro'clock in the afternoon the assault was ordered, Warren's and Wright'scorps, with Mott's division of Hancock's corps, to move simultaneously.The movement was prompt, and in a few minutes the fiercest of strugglesbegan.  The battle-field was so densely covered with forest that butlittle could be seen, by any one person, as to the progress made.  Meadeand I occupied the best position we could get, in rear of Warren.Warren was repulsed with heavy loss, General J. C. Rice being among thekilled.  He was not followed, however, by the enemy, and was therebyenabled to reorganize his command as soon as covered from the guns ofthe enemy.  To the left our success was decided, but the advantage waslost by the feeble action of Mott.  Upton with his assaulting partypushed forward and crossed the enemy's intrenchments.  Turning to theright and left he captured several guns and some hundreds of prisoners.Mott was ordered to his assistance but failed utterly.  So much time waslost in trying to get up the troops which were in the right position toreinforce, that I ordered Upton to withdraw; but the officers and men ofhis command were so averse to giving up the advantage they had gainedthat I withdrew the order.  To relieve them, I ordered a renewal of theassault.  By this time Hancock, who had gone with Birney's division torelieve Barlow, had returned, bringing the division with him.  His corpswas now joined with Warren's and Wright's in this last assault.  It wasgallantly made, many men getting up to, and over, the works of theenemy; but they were not able to hold them.  At night they werewithdrawn.  Upton brought his prisoners with him, but the guns he hadcaptured he was obliged to abandon.  Upton had gained an importantadvantage, but a lack in others of the spirit and dash possessed by himlost it to us.  Before leaving Washington I had been authorized topromote officers on the field for special acts of gallantry.  By thisauthority I conferred the rank of brigadier-general upon Upton on thespot, and this act was confirmed by the President.  Upton had been badlywounded in this fight.Burnside on the left had got up to within a few hundred yards ofSpottsylvania Court House, completely turning Lee's right.  He was notaware of the importance of the advantage he had gained, and I, beingwith the troops where the heavy fighting was, did not know of it at thetime.  He had gained his position with but little fighting, and almostwithout loss.  Burnside's position now separated him widely fromWright's corps, the corps nearest to him.  At night he was ordered tojoin on to this.  This brought him back about a mile, and lost to us animportant advantage.  I attach no blame to Burnside for this, but I doto myself for not having had a staff officer with him to report to mehis position.The enemy had not dared to come out of his line at any point to followup his advantage, except in the single instance of his attack on Barlow.Then he was twice repulsed with heavy loss, though he had an entirecorps against two brigades.  Barlow took up his bridges in the presenceof this force.On the 11th there was no battle and but little firing; none except byMott who made a reconnoissance to ascertain if there was a weak point inthe enemy's line.I wrote the following letter to General Halleck:NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H., May 11, 1864--8.30 A.M.MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Chief of Staff of the Army, Washington, D. C.We have now ended the 6th day of very hard fighting.  The result up tothis time is much in our favor.  But our losses have been heavy as wellas those of the enemy.  We have lost to this time eleven generalofficers killed, wounded and missing, and probably twenty thousand men.I think the loss of the enemy must be greater--we having taken over fourthousand prisoners in battle, whilst he has taken from us but few excepta few stragglers.  I am now sending back to Belle Plain all my wagonsfor a fresh supply of provisions and ammunition, and purpose to fight itout on this line if it takes all summer.The arrival of reinforcements here will be very encouraging to the men,and I hope they will be sent as fast as possible, and in as greatnumbers.  My object in having them sent to Belle Plain was to use themas an escort to our supply trains.  If it is more convenient to sendthem out by train to march from the railroad to Belle Plain orFredericksburg, send them so.I am satisfied the enemy are very shaky, and are only kept up to themark by the greatest exertions on the part of their officers, and bykeeping them intrenched in every position they take.Up to this time there is no indication of any portion of Lee's armybeing detached for the defence of Richmond.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.And also, I received information, through the War Department, fromGeneral Butler that his cavalry under Kautz had cut the railroad southof Petersburg, separating Beauregard from Richmond, and had whippedHill, killing, wounding and capturing many.  Also that he wasintrenched, and could maintain himself.  On this same day came news fromSheridan to the effect that he had destroyed ten miles of the railroadand telegraph between Lee and Richmond, one and a half million rations,and most of the medical stores for his army.On the 8th I had directed Sheridan verbally to cut loose from the Armyof the Potomac and pass around the left of Lee's army and attack hiscavalry and communications, which was successfully executed in themanner I have already described.CHAPTER LIII.HANCOCK'S ASSAULT-LOSSES OF THE CONFEDERATES--PROMOTIONS RECOMMENDED--DISCOMFITURE OF THE ENEMY--EWELL'S ATTACK-REDUCING THE ARTILLERY.In the reconnoissance made by Mott on the 11th, a salient was discoveredat the right centre. I determined that an assault should be made at thatpoint. (*28) Accordingly in the afternoon Hancock was ordered to movehis command by the rear of Warren and Wright, under cover of night, toWright's left, and there form it for an assault at four o'clock the nextmorning.  The night was dark, it rained heavily, and the road wasdifficult, so that it was midnight when he reached the point where hewas to halt.  It took most of the night to get the men in position fortheir advance in the morning.  The men got but little rest.  Burnsidewas ordered to attack (*29) on the left of the salient at the same hour.I sent two of my staff officers to impress upon him the importance ofpushing forward vigorously.  Hancock was notified of this.  Warren andWright were ordered to hold themselves in readiness to join in theassault if circumstances made it advisable.  I occupied a centralposition most convenient for receiving information from all points.Hancock put Barlow on his left, in double column, and Birney to hisright.  Mott followed Birney, and Gibbon was held in reserve.The morning of the 12th opened foggy, delaying the start more than halfan hour.The ground over which Hancock had to pass to reach the enemy, wasascending and heavily wooded to within two or three hundred yards of theenemy's intrenchments.  In front of Birney there was also a marsh tocross.  But, notwithstanding all these difficulties, the troops pushedon in quick time without firing a gun, and when within four or fivehundred yards of the enemy's line broke out in loud cheers, and with arush went up to and over the breastworks.  Barlow and Birney enteredalmost simultaneously.  Here a desperate hand-to-hand conflict tookplace.  The men of the two sides were too close together to fire, butused their guns as clubs.  The hand conflict was soon over.  Hancock'scorps captured some four thousand prisoners among them a division and abrigade commander twenty or more guns with their horses, caissons, andammunition, several thousand stand of arms, and many colors.  Hancock,as soon as the hand-to-hand conflict was over, turned the guns of theenemy against him and advanced inside the rebel lines.  About sixo'clock I ordered Warren's corps to the support of Hancock's. Burnside,on the left, had advanced up east of the salient to the very parapet ofthe enemy.  Potter, commanding one of his divisions, got over but wasnot able to remain there.  However, he inflicted a heavy loss upon theenemy; but not without loss in return.This victory was important, and one that Lee could not afford to leaveus in full possession of.  He made the most strenuous efforts to regainthe position he had lost.  Troops were brought up from his left andattacked Hancock furiously.  Hancock was forced to fall back:  but hedid so slowly, with his face to the enemy, inflicting on him heavy loss,until behind the breastworks he had captured.  These he turned, facingthem the other way, and continued to hold.  Wright was ordered up toreinforce Hancock, and arrived by six o'clock.  He was wounded soonafter coming up but did not relinquish the command of his corps,although the fighting lasted until one o'clock the next morning.  Ateight o'clock Warren was ordered up again, but was so slow in making hisdispositions that his orders were frequently repeated, and withemphasis.  At eleven o'clock I gave Meade written orders to relieveWarren from his command if he failed to move promptly. Hancock placedbatteries on high ground in his rear, which he used against the enemy,firing over the heads of his own troops.Burnside accomplished but little on our left of a positive nature, butnegatively a great deal.  He kept Lee from reinforcing his centre fromthat quarter.  If the 5th corps, or rather if Warren, had been as promptas Wright was with the 6th corps, better results might have beenobtained.Lee massed heavily from his left flank on the broken point of his line.Five times during the day he assaulted furiously, but without dislodgingour troops from their new position.  His losses must have been fearful.Sometimes the belligerents would be separated by but a few feet.  In oneplace a tree, eighteen inches in diameter, was cut entirely down bymusket balls.  All the trees between the lines were very much cut topieces by artillery and musketry.  It was three o'clock next morningbefore the fighting ceased.  Some of our troops had then been twentyhours under fire.  In this engagement we did not lose a singleorganization, not even a company.  The enemy lost one division with itscommander, one brigade and one regiment, with heavy losseselsewhere.(*30)  Our losses were heavy, but, as stated, no whole companywas captured.  At night Lee took a position in rear of his former one,and by the following morning he was strongly intrenched in it.Warren's corps was now temporarily broken up, Cutler's division sent toWright, and Griffin's to Hancock.  Meade ordered his chief of staff,General Humphreys, to remain with Warren and the remaining division, andauthorized him to give it orders in his name.During the day I was passing along the line from wing to wingcontinuously.  About the centre stood a house which proved to beoccupied by an old lady and her daughter.  She showed such unmistakablesigns of being strongly Union that I stopped.  She said she had not seena Union flag for so long a time that it did her heart good to look uponit again.  She said her husband and son, being, Union men, had had toleave early in the war, and were now somewhere in the Union army, ifalive.  She was without food or nearly so, so I ordered rations issuedto her, and promised to find out if I could where the husband and sonwere.There was no fighting on the 13th, further than a little skirmishingbetween Mott's division and the enemy.  I was afraid that Lee might bemoving out, and I did not want him to go without my knowing it. Theindications were that he was moving, but it was found that he was onlytaking his new position back from the salient that had been captured.Our dead were buried this day.  Mott's division was reduced to abrigade, and assigned to Birney's division.During this day I wrote to Washington recommending Sherman and Meade(*31) for promotion to the grade of Major-General in the regular army;Hancock for Brigadier-General; Wright, Gibbon and Humphreys to beMajor-Generals of Volunteers; and Upton and Carroll to be Brigadiers.Upton had already been named as such, but the appointment had to beconfirmed by the Senate on the nomination of the President.The night of the 13th Warren and Wright were moved by the rear to theleft of Burnside.  The night was very dark and it rained heavily, theroads were so bad that the troops had to cut trees and corduroy the roada part of the way, to get through.  It was midnight before they got tothe point where they were to halt, and daylight before the troops couldbe organized to advance to their position in line.  They gained theirposition in line, however, without any fighting, except a little inWright's front.  Here Upton had to contend for an elevation which wewanted and which the enemy was not disposed to yield.  Upton first drovethe enemy, and was then repulsed in turn.  Ayres coming to his supportwith his brigade (of Griffin's division, Warren's corps), the positionwas secured and fortified.  There was no more battle during the 14th.This brought our line east of the Court House and running north andsouth and facing west.During the night of the 14th-15th Lee moved to cover this new front.This left Hancock without an enemy confronting him.  He was brought tothe rear of our new centre, ready to be moved in any direction he mightbe wanted.On the 15th news came from Butler and Averill.  The former reported thecapture of the outer works at Drury's Bluff, on the James River, andthat his cavalry had cut the railroad and telegraph south of Richmond onthe Danville road:  and the latter, the destruction of a depot ofsupplies at Dublin, West Virginia, and the breaking of New River Bridgeon the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.  The next day news came fromSherman and Sheridan.  Sherman had forced Johnston out of Dalton,Georgia, and was following him south.  The report from Sheridan embracedhis operations up to his passing the outer defences of Richmond.  Theprospect must now have been dismal in Richmond. The road and telegraphwere cut between the capital and Lee. The roads and wires were cut inevery direction from the rebel capital.  Temporarily that city was cutoff from all communication with the outside except by courier.  Thiscondition of affairs, however, was of but short duration.I wrote Halleck:NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H., May 16, 1864, 8 A.M.MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Washington, D. C.:We have had five days almost constant rain without any prospect yet ofit clearing up.  The roads have now become so impassable that ambulanceswith wounded men can no longer run between here and Fredericksburg.  Alloffensive operations necessarily cease until we can have twenty-fourhours of dry weather.  The army is in the best of spirits, and feel thegreatest confidence of ultimate success. *        *        *        **        * You can assure the President and Secretary of War that theelements alone have suspended hostilities, and that it is in no mannerdue to weakness or exhaustion on our part.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.The condition of the roads was such that nothing was done on the 17th.But that night Hancock and Wright were to make a night march back totheir old positions, and to make an assault at four o'clock in themorning.  Lee got troops back in time to protect his old line, so theassault was unsuccessful.  On this day (18th) the news was almost asdiscouraging to us as it had been two days before in the rebel capital.As stated above, Hancock's and Wright's corps had made an unsuccessfulassault. News came that Sigel had been defeated at New Market, badly,and was retreating down the valley.  Not two hours before, I had sentthe inquiry to Halleck whether Sigel could not get to Staunton to stopsupplies coming from there to Lee.  I asked at once that Sigel might berelieved, and some one else put in his place. Hunter's name wassuggested, and I heartily approved.  Further news from Butler reportedhim driven from Drury's Bluff, but still in possession of the Petersburgroad.  Banks had been defeated in Louisiana, relieved, and Canby put inhis place. This change of commander was not on my suggestion.  All thisnews was very discouraging.  All of it must have been known by the enemybefore it was by me.  In fact, the good news (for the enemy) must havebeen known to him at the moment I thought he was in despair, and hisanguish had been already relieved when we were enjoying his supposeddiscomfiture, But this was no time for repining.  I immediately gaveorders for a movement by the left flank, on towards Richmond, tocommence on the night of the 19th.  I also asked Halleck to secure thecooperation of the navy in changing our base of supplies fromFredericksburg to Port Royal, on the Rappahannock.Up to this time I had received no reinforcements, except six thousandraw troops under Brigadier General Robert O. Tyler, just arrived.  Theyhad not yet joined their command, Hancock's corps, but were on ourright.  This corps had been brought to the rear of the centre, ready tomove in any direction.  Lee, probably suspecting some move on my part,and seeing our right entirely abandoned, moved Ewell's corps about fiveo'clock in the afternoon, with Early's as a reserve, to attack us inthat quarter.  Tyler had come up from Fredericksburg, and had beenhalted on the road to the right of our line, near Kitching's brigade ofWarren's corps.  Tyler received the attack with his raw troops, and theymaintained their position, until reinforced, in a manner worthy ofveterans.Hancock was in a position to reinforce speedily, and was the soldier todo it without waiting to make dispositions.  Birney was thrown toTyler's right and Crawford to his left, with Gibbon as a reserve; andEwell was whirled back speedily and with heavy loss.Warren had been ordered to get on Ewell's flank and in his rear, to cuthim off from his intrenchments.  But his efforts were so feeble thatunder the cover of night Ewell got back with only the loss of a fewhundred prisoners, besides his killed and wounded.  The army beingengaged until after dark, I rescinded the order for the march by ourleft flank that night.As soon as it was discovered that the enemy were coming out to attack, Inaturally supposed they would detach a force to destroy our trains.  Thewithdrawal of Hancock from the right uncovered one road fromSpottsylvania to Fredericksburg over which trains drew our supplies.This was guarded by a division of colored troops, commanded by GeneralFerrero, belonging to Burnside's corps.  Ferrero was therefore promptlynotified, and ordered to throw his cavalry pickets out to the south andbe prepared to meet the enemy if he should come; if he had to retreat todo so towards Fredericksburg.  The enemy did detach as expected, andcaptured twenty-five or thirty wagons which, however, were soon retaken.In consequence of the disasters that had befallen us in the past fewdays, Lee could be reinforced largely, and I had no doubt he would be.Beauregard had come up from the south with troops to guard theConfederate capital when it was in danger.  Butler being driven back,most of the troops could be sent to Lee. Hoke was no longer needed inNorth Carolina; and Sigel's troops having gone back to Cedar Creek,whipped, many troops could be spared from the valley.The Wilderness and Spottsylvania battles convinced me that we had moreartillery than could ever be brought into action at any one time.  Itoccupied much of the road in marching, and taxed the trains in bringingup forage.  Artillery is very useful when it can be brought into action,but it is a very burdensome luxury where it cannot be used.  Beforeleaving Spottsylvania, therefore, I sent back to the defences ofWashington over one hundred pieces of artillery, with the horses andcaissons.  This relieved the roads over which we were to march of morethan two hundred six-horse teams, and still left us more artillery thancould be advantageously used.  In fact, before reaching the James RiverI again reduced the artillery with the army largely.I believed that, if one corps of the army was exposed on the road toRichmond, and at a distance from the main army, Lee would endeavor toattack the exposed corps before reinforcements could come up; in whichcase the main army could follow Lee up and attack him before he had timeto intrench.  So I issued the following orders:NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H., VA., May 18, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac.Before daylight to-morrow morning I propose to draw Hancock and Burnsidefrom the position they now hold, and put Burnside to the left of Wright.Wright and Burnside should then force their way up as close to the enemyas they can get without a general engagement, or with a generalengagement if the enemy will come out of their works to fight, andintrench.  Hancock should march and take up a position as if in supportof the two left corps. To-morrow night, at twelve or one o'clock, hewill be moved south-east with all his force and as much cavalry as canbe given to him, to get as far towards Richmond on the line of theFredericksburg Railroad as he can make, fighting the enemy in whateverforce he can find him.  If the enemy make a general move to meet this,they will be followed by the other three corps of the army, andattacked, if possible, before time is given to intrench.Suitable directions will at once be given for all trains and surplusartillery to conform to this movement.U. S. GRANT.On the 20th, Lee showing no signs of coming out of his lines, orderswere renewed for a left-flank movement, to commence after night.CHAPTER LIV.MOVEMENT BY THE LEFT FLANK--BATTLE OF NORTH ANNA--AN INCIDENT OF THEMARCH--MOVING ON RICHMOND--SOUTH OF THE PAMUNKEY--POSITION OF THENATIONAL ARMY.We were now to operate in a different country from any we had beforeseen in Virginia.  The roads were wide and good, and the country wellcultivated.  No men were seen except those bearing arms, even the blackman having been sent away.  The country, however, was new to us, and wehad neither guides nor maps to tell us where the roads were, or wherethey led to.  Engineer and staff officers were put to the dangerous dutyof supplying the place of both maps and guides.  By reconnoitring theywere enabled to locate the roads in the vicinity of each army corps.Our course was south, and we took all roads leading in that directionwhich would not separate the army too widely.Hancock who had the lead had marched easterly to Guiney's Station, onthe Fredericksburg Railroad, thence southerly to Bowling Green andMilford.  He was at Milford by the night of the 21st.  Here he met adetachment of Pickett's division coming from Richmond to reinforce Lee.They were speedily driven away, and several hundred captured.  Warrenfollowed on the morning of the 21st, and reached Guiney's Station thatnight without molestation.  Burnside and Wright were retained atSpottsylvania to keep up the appearance of an intended assault, and tohold Lee, if possible, while Hancock and Warren should get start enoughto interpose between him and Richmond.Lee had now a superb opportunity to take the initiative either byattacking Wright and Burnside alone, or by following by the TelegraphRoad and striking Hancock's and Warren's corps, or even Hancock's alone,before reinforcements could come up.  But he did not avail himself ofeither opportunity.  He seemed really to be misled as to my designs; butmoved by his interior line--the Telegraph Road--to make sure of keepingbetween his capital and the Army of the Potomac.  He never again hadsuch an opportunity of dealing a heavy blow.The evening of the 21st Burnside, 9th corps, moved out followed byWright, 6th corps.  Burnside was to take the Telegraph Road; but findingStanard's Ford, over the Po, fortified and guarded, he turned east tothe road taken by Hancock and Warren without an attempt to dislodge theenemy.  The night of the 21st I had my headquarters near the 6th corps,at Guiney's Station, and the enemy's cavalry was between us and Hancock.There was a slight attack on Burnside's and Wright's corps as they movedout of their lines; but it was easily repulsed.  The object probably wasonly to make sure that we were not leaving a force to follow upon therear of the Confederates.By the morning of the 22d Burnside and Wright were at Guiney's Station.Hancock's corps had now been marching and fighting continuously forseveral days, not having had rest even at night much of the time.  Theywere, therefore, permitted to rest during the 22d.  But Warren waspushed to Harris's Store, directly west of Milford, and connected withit by a good road, and Burnside was sent to New Bethel Church.  Wright'scorps was still back at Guiney's Station.I issued the following order for the movement of the troops the nextday:NEW BETHEL, VA., May 22, 1864MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac.Direct corps commanders to hold their troops in readiness to march atfive A.M. to-morrow.  At that hour each command will send out cavalryand infantry on all roads to their front leading south, and ascertain,if possible, where the enemy is. If beyond the South Anna, the 5th and6th corps will march to the forks of the road, where one branch leads toBeaver Dam Station, the other to Jericho Bridge, then south by roadsreaching the Anna, as near to and east of Hawkins Creek as they can befound.The 2d corps will move to Chesterfield Ford.  The 9th corps will bedirected to move at the same time to Jericho Bridge.  The map only showstwo roads for the four corps to march upon, but, no doubt, by the use ofplantation roads, and pressing in guides, others can be found, to giveone for each corps.The troops will follow their respective reconnoitring parties. Thetrains will be moved at the same time to Milford Station.Headquarters will follow the 9th corps.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Warren's corps was moved from Harris's Store to Jericho Ford, Wright'sfollowing.  Warren arrived at the ford early in the afternoon, and byfive o'clock effected a crossing under the protection of sharpshooters.The men had to wade in water up to their waists.  As soon as enoughtroops were over to guard the ford, pontoons were laid and the artilleryand the rest of the troops crossed.  The line formed was almostperpendicular to the course of the river--Crawford on the left, next tothe river, Griffin in the centre, and Cutler on the right.  Lee wasfound intrenched along the front of their line.  The whole of Hill'scorps was sent against Warren's right before it had got in position.  Abrigade of Cutler's division was driven back, the enemy following, butassistance coming up the enemy was in turn driven back into his trencheswith heavy loss in killed and wounded, with about five hundred prisonersleft in our hands. By night Wright's corps was up ready to reinforceWarren.On the 23d Hancock's corps was moved to the wooden bridge which spansthe North Anna River just west of where the Fredericksburg Railroadcrosses.  It was near night when the troops arrived. They found thebridge guarded, with troops intrenched, on the north side.  Hancock senttwo brigades, Egan's and Pierce's, to the right and left, and whenproperly disposed they charged simultaneously.  The bridge was carriedquickly, the enemy retreating over it so hastily that many were shovedinto the river, and some of them were drowned.  Several hundredprisoners were captured.  The hour was so late that Hancock did notcross until next morning.Burnside's corps was moved by a middle road running between thosedescribed above, and which strikes the North Anna at Ox Ford, midwaybetween Telegraph Road and Jericho Ford.  The hour of its arrival wastoo late to cross that night.On the 24th Hancock's corps crossed to the south side of the riverwithout opposition, and formed line facing nearly west. The railroad inrear was taken possession of and destroyed as far as possible.  Wright'scorps crossed at Jericho early the same day, and took position to theright of Warren's corps, extending south of the Virginia CentralRailroad.  This road was torn up for a considerable distance to the rear(west), the ties burned, and the rails bent and twisted by heating themover the burning ties.  It was found, however, that Burnside's corpscould not cross at Ox Ford.  Lee had taken a position with his centre onthe river at this point, with the two wings thrown back, his line makingan acute angle where it overlooked the river.Before the exact position of the whole of Lee's line was accuratelyknown, I directed Hancock and Warren each to send a brigade to Ox Fordby the south side of the river.  They found the enemy too strong tojustify a serious attack.  A third ford was found between Ox Ford andJericho.  Burnside was directed to cross a division over this ford, andto send one division to Hancock.  Crittenden was crossed by thisnewly-discovered ford, and formed up the river to connect withCrawford's left.  Potter joined Hancock by way of the wooden bridge.Crittenden had a severe engagement with some of Hill's corps on hiscrossing the river, and lost heavily.  When joined to Warren's corps hewas no further molested.  Burnside still guarded Ox Ford from the northside.Lee now had his entire army south of the North Anna.  Our lines coveredhis front, with the six miles separating the two wings guarded by but asingle division.  To get from one wing to the other the river would haveto be crossed twice.  Lee could reinforce any part of his line from allpoints of it in a very short march; or could concentrate the whole of itwherever he might choose to assault.  We were, for the time, practicallytwo armies besieging.Lee had been reinforced, and was being reinforced, largely. About thistime the very troops whose coming I had predicted, had arrived or werecoming in.  Pickett with a full division from Richmond was up; Hoke fromNorth Carolina had come with a brigade; and Breckinridge was there:  inall probably not less than fifteen thousand men.  But he did not attemptto drive us from the field.On the 22d or 23d I received dispatches from Washington saying thatSherman had taken Kingston, crossed the Etowah River and was advancinginto Georgia.I was seated at the time on the porch of a fine plantation house waitingfor Burnside's corps to pass.  Meade and his staff, besides my ownstaff, were with me.  The lady of the house, a Mrs. Tyler, and anelderly lady, were present.  Burnside seeing us, came up on the porch,his big spurs and saber rattling as he walked.  He touched his hatpolitely to the ladies, and remarked that he supposed they had neverseen so many "live Yankees" before in their lives.  The elderly ladyspoke up promptly saying, "Oh yes, I have; many more."  "Where?" saidBurnside. "In Richmond."  Prisoners, of course, was understood.I read my dispatch aloud, when it was received.  This threw the youngerlady into tears. I found the information she had received (and I supposeit was the information generally in circulation through the South) wasthat Lee was driving us from the State in the most demoralized conditionand that in the South-west our troops were but little better thanprisoners of war.  Seeing our troops moving south was ocular proof thata part of her information was incorrect, and she asked me if my newsfrom Sherman was true.  I assured her that there was no doubt about it.I left a guard to protect the house from intrusion until the troopsshould have all passed, and assured her that if her husband was inhiding she could bring him in and he should be protected also.  But Ipresume he was in the Confederate army.On the 25th I gave orders, through Halleck, to Hunter, who had relievedSigel, to move up the Valley of Virginia, cross over the Blue Ridge toCharlottesville and go as far as Lynchburg if possible, living upon thecountry and cutting the railroads and canal as he went.  After doingthis he could find his way back to his base, or join me.On the same day news was received that Lee was falling back on Richmond.This proved not to be true.  But we could do nothing where we wereunless Lee would assume the offensive. I determined, therefore, to drawout of our present position and make one more effort to get between himand Richmond.  I had no expectation now, however, of succeeding in this;but I did expect to hold him far enough west to enable me to reach theJames River high up.  Sheridan was now again with the Army of thePotomac.On the 26th I informed the government at Washington of the position ofthe two armies; of the reinforcements the enemy had received; of themove I proposed to make (*32); and directed that our base of suppliesshould be shifted to White House, on the Pamunkey.  The wagon train andguards moved directly from Port Royal to White House.  Supplies movedaround by water, guarded by the navy.  Orders had previously been sent,through Halleck, for Butler to send Smith's corps to White House.  Thisorder was repeated on the 25th, with directions that they should belanded on the north side of the Pamunkey, and marched until they joinedthe Army of the Potomac.It was a delicate move to get the right wing of the Army of the Potomacfrom its position south of the North Anna in the presence of the enemy.To accomplish it, I issued the following order:QUARLES' MILLS, VA., May 25, 1864.MAJOR GENERAL MEADE, Commanding A. P.Direct Generals Warren and Wright to withdraw all their teams andartillery, not in position, to the north side of the river to-morrow.Send that belonging to General Wright's corps as far on the road toHanover Town as it can go, without attracting attention to the fact.Send with it Wright's best division or division under his ablestcommander.  Have their places filled up in the line so if possible theenemy will not notice their withdrawal.  Send the cavalry to-morrowafternoon, or as much of it as you may deem necessary, to watch andseize, if they can, Littlepage's Bridge and Taylor's Ford, and to remainon one or other side of the river at these points until the infantry andartillery all pass.  As soon as it is dark to-morrow night start thedivision which you withdraw first from Wright's corps to make a forcedmarch to Hanover Town, taking with them no teams to impede their march.At the same time this division starts commence withdrawing all of the5th and 6th corps from the south side of the river, and march them forthe same place.  The two divisions of the 9th corps not now withHancock, may be moved down the north bank of the river where they willbe handy to support Hancock if necessary, or will be that much on theirroad to follow the 5th and 6th corps.  Hancock should hold his commandin readiness to follow as soon as the way is clear for him. To-morrow itwill leave nothing for him to do, but as soon as he can he should getall his teams and spare artillery on the road or roads which he willhave to take.  As soon as the troops reach Hanover Town they should getpossession of all the crossings they can in that neighborhood.  I thinkit would be well to make a heavy cavalry demonstration on the enemy'sleft, to-morrow afternoon, also.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Wilson's division of cavalry was brought up from the left and moved byour right south to Little River.  Here he manoeuvred to give theimpression that we were going to attack the left flank of Lee's army.Under cover of night our right wing was withdrawn to the north side ofthe river, Lee being completely deceived by Wilson's feint.  On theafternoon of the 26th Sheridan moved, sending Gregg's and Torbert'scavalry to Taylor's and Littlepage's fords towards Hanover.  As soon asit was dark both divisions moved quietly to Hanover Ferry, leaving smallguards behind to keep up the impression that crossings were to beattempted in the morning.  Sheridan was followed by a division ofinfantry under General Russell.  On the morning of the 27th the crossingwas effected with but little loss, the enemy losing thirty or forty,taken prisoners.  Thus a position was secured south of the Pamunkey.Russell stopped at the crossing while the cavalry pushed on to HanoverTown.  Here Barringer's, formerly Gordon's, brigade of rebel cavalry wasencountered, but it was speedily driven away.Warren's and Wright's corps were moved by the rear of Burnside's andHancock's corps.  When out of the way these latter corps followed,leaving pickets confronting the enemy.  Wilson's cavalry followed last,watching all the fords until everything had recrossed; then taking upthe pontoons and destroying other bridges, became the rear-guard.Two roads were traversed by the troops in this move.  The one nearest toand north of the North Anna and Pamunkey was taken by Wright, followedby Hancock.  Warren, followed by Burnside, moved by a road farthernorth, and longer.  The trains moved by a road still farther north, andhad to travel a still greater distance.  All the troops that had crossedthe Pamunkey on the morning of the 27th remained quiet during the restof the day, while the troops north of that stream marched to reach thecrossing that had been secured for them.Lee had evidently been deceived by our movement from North Anna; for onthe morning of the 27th he telegraphed to Richmond: "Enemy crossed tonorth side, and cavalry and infantry crossed at Hanover Town."  Thetroops that had then crossed left his front the night of the 25th.The country we were now in was a difficult one to move troops over.  Thestreams were numerous, deep and sluggish, sometimes spreading out intoswamps grown up with impenetrable growths of trees and underbrush.  Thebanks were generally low and marshy, making the streams difficult toapproach except where there were roads and bridges.Hanover Town is about twenty miles from Richmond.  There are two roadsleading there; the most direct and shortest one crossing theChickahominy at Meadow Bridge, near the Virginia Central Railroad, thesecond going by New and Old Cold Harbor.  A few miles out from HanoverTown there is a third road by way of Mechanicsville to Richmond.  NewCold Harbor was important to us because while there we both covered theroads back to White House (where our supplies came from), and the roadssouth-east over which we would have to pass to get to the James Riverbelow the Richmond defences.On the morning of the 28th the army made an early start, and by noon allhad crossed except Burnside's corps.  This was left on the north sidetemporarily to guard the large wagon train.  A line was at once formedextending south from the river, Wright's corps on the right, Hancock'sin the centre, and Warren's on the left, ready to meet the enemy if heshould come.At the same time Sheridan was directed to reconnoitre towardsMechanicsville to find Lee's position.  At Hawes' Shop, just where themiddle road leaves the direct road to Richmond, he encountered theConfederate cavalry dismounted and partially intrenched.  Gregg attackedwith his division, but was unable to move the enemy.  In the eveningCuster came up with a brigade. The attack was now renewed, the cavalrydismounting and charging as infantry.  This time the assault wassuccessful, both sides losing a considerable number of men.  But ourtroops had to bury the dead, and found that more Confederate than Unionsoldiers had been killed.  The position was easily held, because ourinfantry was near.On the 29th a reconnoissance was made in force, to find the position ofLee.  Wright's corps pushed to Hanover Court House.  Hancock's corpspushed toward Totopotomoy Creek; Warren's corps to the left on the ShadyGrove Church Road, while Burnside was held in reserve. Our advance waspushed forward three miles on the left with but little fighting.  Therewas now an appearance of a movement past our left flank, and Sheridanwas sent to meet it.On the 30th Hancock moved to the Totopotomoy, where he found the enemystrongly fortified.  Wright was moved to the right of Hancock's corps,and Burnside was brought forward and crossed, taking position to theleft of Hancock.  Warren moved up near Huntley Corners on the ShadyGrove Church Road.  There was some skirmishing along the centre, and inthe evening Early attacked Warren with some vigor, driving him back atfirst, and threatening to turn our left flank.  As the best means ofreinforcing the left, Hancock was ordered to attack in his front.  Hecarried and held the rifle-pits.  While this was going on Warren got hismen up, repulsed Early, and drove him more than a mile.On this day I wrote to Halleck ordering all the pontoons in Washingtonto be sent to City Point.In the evening news was received of the arrival of Smith with his corpsat White House.  I notified Meade, in writing, as follows:NEAR HAWES' SHOP, VA., 6.40 P.M., May 30, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Commanding A. P.General Smith will debark his force at the White House tonight and startup the south bank of the Pamunkey at an early hour, probably at 3 A.M.in the morning.  It is not improbable that the enemy, being aware ofSmith's movement, will be feeling to get on our left flank for thepurpose of cutting him off, or by a dash to crush him and get backbefore we are aware of it. Sheridan ought to be notified to watch theenemy's movements well out towards Cold Harbor, and also on theMechanicsville road.  Wright should be got well massed on Hancock'sright, so that, if it becomes necessary, he can take the place of thelatter readily whilst troops are being thrown east of the Totopotomoy ifnecessary.I want Sheridan to send a cavalry force of at least half a brigade, ifnot a whole brigade, at 5 A.M. in the morning, to communicate with Smithand to return with him.  I will send orders for Smith by the messengeryou send to Sheridan with his orders.U. S. GRANT.I also notified Smith of his danger, and the precautions that would betaken to protect him.The night of the 30th Lee's position was substantially from Atlee'sStation on the Virginia Central Railroad south and east to the vicinityof Cold Harbor.  Ours was:  The left of Warren's corps was on the ShadyGrove Road, extending to the Mechanicsville Road and about three milessouth of the Totopotomoy.  Burnside to his right, then Hancock, andWright on the extreme right, extending towards Hanover Court House, sixmiles south-east of it.  Sheridan with two divisions of cavalry waswatching our left front towards Cold Harbor.  Wilson with his divisionon our right was sent to get on the Virginia Central Railroad anddestroy it as far back as possible.  He got possession of Hanover CourtHouse the next day after a skirmish with Young's cavalry brigade.  Theenemy attacked Sheridan's pickets, but reinforcements were sent up andthe attack was speedily repulsed and the enemy followed some distancetowards Cold Harbor.CHAPTER LV.ADVANCE ON COLD HARBOR--AN ANECDOTE OF THE WAR--BATTLE OF COLD HARBOR--CORRESPONDENCE WITH LEE--RETROSPECTIVE.On the 31st Sheridan advanced to near Old Cold Harbor.  He found itintrenched and occupied by cavalry and infantry.  A hard fight ensuedbut the place was carried.  The enemy well knew the importance of ColdHarbor to us, and seemed determined that we should not hold it.  Hereturned with such a large force that Sheridan was about withdrawingwithout making any effort to hold it against such odds; but about thetime he commenced the evacuation he received orders to hold the place atall hazards, until reinforcements could be sent to him.  He speedilyturned the rebel works to face against them and placed his men inposition for defence.  Night came on before the enemy was ready forassault.Wright's corps was ordered early in the evening to march directly toCold Harbor passing by the rear of the army.  It was expected to arriveby daylight or before; but the night was dark and the distance great, sothat it was nine o'clock the 1st of June before it reached itsdestination.  Before the arrival of Wright the enemy had made twoassaults on Sheridan, both of which were repulsed with heavy loss to theenemy.  Wright's corps coming up, there was no further assault on ColdHarbor.Smith, who was coming up from White House, was also directed to marchdirectly to Cold Harbor, and was expected early on the morning of the1st of June; but by some blunder the order which reached Smith directedhim to Newcastle instead of Cold Harbor.  Through this blunder Smith didnot reach his destination until three o'clock in the afternoon, and thenwith tired and worn-out men from their long and dusty march.  He landedtwelve thousand five hundred men from Butler's command, but a divisionwas left at White House temporarily and many men had fallen out of ranksin their long march.Before the removal of Wright's corps from our right, after dark on the31st, the two lines, Federal and Confederate, were so close together atthat point that either side could detect directly any movement made bythe other.  Finding at daylight that Wright had left his front, Leeevidently divined that he had gone to our left.  At all events, soonafter light on the 1st of June Anderson, who commanded the corps onLee's left, was seen moving along Warren's front.  Warren was ordered toattack him vigorously in flank, while Wright was directed to move outand get on his front.  Warren fired his artillery at the enemy; but lostso much time in making ready that the enemy got by, and at three o'clockhe reported the enemy was strongly intrenched in his front, and besideshis lines were so long that he had no mass of troops to move with.  Heseemed to have forgotten that lines in rear of an army hold themselveswhile their defenders are fighting in their front.  Wright reconnoitredsome distance to his front:  but the enemy finding Old Cold Harboralready taken had halted and fortified some distance west.By six o'clock in the afternoon Wright and Smith were ready to make anassault.  In front of both the ground was clear for several hundredyards and then became wooded.  Both charged across this open space andinto the wood, capturing and holding the first line of rifle-pits of theenemy, and also capturing seven or eight hundred prisoners.While this was going on, the enemy charged Warren three separate timeswith vigor, but were repulsed each time with loss.  There was no officermore capable, nor one more prompt in acting, than Warren when the enemyforced him to it.  There was also an attack upon Hancock's andBurnside's corps at the same time; but it was feeble and probably onlyintended to relieve Anderson who was being pressed by Wright and Smith.During the night the enemy made frequent attacks with the view ofdispossessing us of the important position we had gained, but withouteffecting their object.Hancock was moved from his place in line during the night and ordered tothe left of Wright.  I expected to take the offensive on the morning ofthe 2d, but the night was so dark, the heat and dust so excessive andthe roads so intricate and hard to keep, that the head of column onlyreached Old Cold Harbor at six o'clock, but was in position at 7.30 A.M.Preparations were made for an attack in the afternoon, but did not takeplace until the next morning.  Warren's corps was moved to the left toconnect with Smith:  Hancock's corps was got into position to the leftof Wright's, and Burnside was moved to Bethesda Church in reserve. WhileWarren and Burnside were making these changes the enemy came out severaltimes and attacked them, capturing several hundred prisoners.  Theattacks were repulsed, but not followed up as they should have been.  Iwas so annoyed at this that I directed Meade to instruct his corpscommanders that they should seize all such opportunities when theyoccurred, and not wait for orders, all of our manoeuvres being made forthe very purpose of getting the enemy out of his cover.On this day Wilson returned from his raid upon the Virginia CentralRailroad, having damaged it considerably.  But, like ourselves, therebels had become experts in repairing such damage.  Sherman, in hismemoirs, relates an anecdote of his campaign to Atlanta that wellillustrates this point.  The rebel cavalry lurking in his rear to burnbridges and obstruct his communications had become so disgusted athearing trains go whistling by within a few hours after a bridge hadbeen burned, that they proposed to try blowing up some of the tunnels.One of them said, "No use, boys, Old Sherman carries duplicate tunnelswith him, and will replace them as fast as you can blow them up; bettersave your powder."Sheridan was engaged reconnoitring the banks of the Chickahominy, tofind crossings and the condition of the roads.  He reported favorably.During the night Lee moved his left up to make his line correspond toours.  His lines extended now from the Totopotomoy to New Cold Harbor.Mine from Bethesda Church by Old Cold Harbor to the Chickahominy, with adivision of cavalry guarding our right.  An assault was ordered for the3d, to be made mainly by the corps of Hancock, Wright and Smith; butWarren and Burnside were to support it by threatening Lee's left, and toattack with great earnestness if he should either reinforce morethreatened points by drawing from that quarter or if a favorableopportunity should present itself.The corps commanders were to select the points in their respectivefronts where they would make their assaults.  The move was to commenceat half-past four in the morning.  Hancock sent Barlow and Gibbonforward at the appointed hour, with Birney as a reserve.  Barlow pushedforward with great vigor, under a heavy fire of both artillery andmusketry, through thickets and swamps.  Notwithstanding all theresistance of the enemy and the natural obstructions to overcome, hecarried a position occupied by the enemy outside their main line wherethe road makes a deep cut through a bank affording as good a shelter fortroops as if it had been made for that purpose.  Three pieces ofartillery had been captured here, and several hundred prisoners.  Theguns were immediately turned against the men who had just been usingthem.  No (*33) assistance coming to him, he (Barlow) intrenched underfire and continued to hold his place.  Gibbon was not so fortunate inhis front.  He found the ground over which he had to pass cut up withdeep ravines, and a morass difficult to cross.  But his men struggled onuntil some of them got up to the very parapet covering the enemy.Gibbon gained ground much nearer the enemy than that which he left, andhere he intrenched and held fast.Wright's corps moving in two lines captured the outer rifle-pits intheir front, but accomplished nothing more.  Smith's corps also gainedthe outer rifle-pits in its front.  The ground over which this corps(18th) had to move was the most exposed of any over which charges weremade.  An open plain intervened between the contending forces at thispoint, which was exposed both to a direct and a cross fire.  Smith,however, finding a ravine running towards his front, sufficiently deepto protect men in it from cross fire, and somewhat from a direct fire,put Martindale's division in it, and with Brooks supporting him on theleft and Devens on the right succeeded in gaining the outer--probablypicket--rifle-pits.  Warren and Burnside also advanced and gainedground--which brought the whole army on one line.This assault cost us heavily and probably without benefit to compensate:but the enemy was not cheered by the occurrence sufficiently to inducehim to take the offensive.  In fact, nowhere after the battle of theWilderness did Lee show any disposition to leave his defences far behindhim.Fighting was substantially over by half-past seven in the morning.  Ateleven o'clock I started to visit all the corps commanders to see formyself the different positions gained and to get their opinion of thepracticability of doing anything more in their respective fronts.Hancock gave the opinion that in his front the enemy was too strong tomake any further assault promise success.  Wright thought he could gainthe lines of the enemy, but it would require the cooperation ofHancock's and Smith's corps.  Smith thought a lodgment possible, but wasnot sanguine:  Burnside thought something could be done in his front,but Warren differed.  I concluded, therefore to make no more assaults,and a little after twelve directed in the following letter that alloffensive action should cease.COLD HARBOR, June 3, 1864.-12.30 P.M. MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,Commanding A. P.The opinion of corps commanders not being sanguine of success in case anassault is ordered, you may direct a suspension of farther advance forthe present.  Hold our most advanced positions and strengthen them.Whilst on the defensive our line may be contracted from the right ifpracticable.Reconnoissances should be made in front of every corps and advances madeto advantageous positions by regular approaches. To aid the expeditionunder General Hunter it is necessary that we should detain all the armynow with Lee until the former gets well on his way to Lynchburg.  To dothis effectually it will be better to keep the enemy out of theintrenchments of Richmond than to have them go back there.Wright and Hancock should be ready to assault in case the enemy shouldbreak through General Smith's lines, and all should be ready to resistan assault.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.The remainder of the day was spent in strengthening the line we nowheld.  By night we were as strong against Lee as he was against us.During the night the enemy quitted our right front, abandoning some oftheir wounded, and without burying their dead.  These we were able tocare for.  But there were many dead and wounded men between the lines ofthe contending forces, which were now close together, who could not becared for without a cessation of hostilities.So I wrote the following:COLD HARBOR, VA., June 5, 1864.GENERAL R.  E. LEE, Commanding Confederate Army.It is reported to me that there are wounded men, probably of botharmies, now lying exposed and suffering between the lines occupiedrespectively by the two armies.  Humanity would dictate that someprovision should be made to provide against such hardships.  I wouldpropose, therefore, that hereafter, when no battle is raging, eitherparty be authorized to send to any point between the pickets or skirmishlines, unarmed men bearing litters to pick up their dead or wounded,without being fired upon by the other party.  Any other method, equallyfair to both parties, you may propose for meeting the end desired willbe accepted by me.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Lee replied that he feared such an arrangement would lead tomisunderstanding, and proposed that in future, when either party wishedto remove their dead and wounded, a flag of truce be sent.  I answeredthis immediately by saying:COLD HARBOR, VA., June 6, 1864.GENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding Army of N. Va.Your communication of yesterday's date is received.  I will sendimmediately, as you propose, to collect the dead and wounded between thelines of the two armies, and will also instruct that you be allowed todo the same.  I propose that the time for doing this be between thehours of 12 M. and 3 P.M. to-day.  I will direct all parties going outto bear a white flag, and not to attempt to go beyond where we have deador wounded, and not beyond or on ground occupied by your troops.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Lee's response was that he could not consent to the burial of the deadand removal of the wounded in the way I proposed, but when either partydesired such permission it should be asked for by flag of truce and hehad directed that any parties I may have sent out, as mentioned in myletter, to be turned back.  I answered:COLD HARBOR, VA, June 6, 1864.GENERAL R. E. LEE. Commanding Army, N. Va.The knowledge that wounded men are now suffering from want of attention,between the two armies, compels me to ask a suspension of hostilitiesfor sufficient time to collect them in, say two hours.  Permit me to saythat the hours you may fix upon for this will be agreeable to me, andthe same privilege will be extended to such parties as you may wish tosend out on the same duty without further application.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Lee acceded to this; but delays in transmitting the correspondencebrought it to the 7th of June--forty-eight hours after it commenced--before parties were got out to collect the men left upon the field.In the meantime all but two of the wounded had died.  And I wrote toLee:COLD HARBOR, VA., June 7, 1864. 10.30 A.M.GEN. R. E. LEE, Commanding Army of N. Va.I regret that your note of seven P.M. yesterday should have beenreceived at the nearest corps headquarters, to where it was delivered,after the hour which had been given for the removal of the dead andwounded had expired; 10.45 P.M. was the hour at which it was received atcorps headquarters, and between eleven and twelve it reached myheadquarters.  As a consequence, it was not understood by the troops ofthis army that there was a cessation of hostilities for the purpose ofcollecting the dead and wounded, and none were collected.  Two officersand six men of the 8th and 25th North Carolina Regts., who were out insearch of the bodies of officers of their respective regiments, werecaptured and brought into our lines, owing to this want ofunderstanding.  I regret this, but will state that as soon as I learnedthe fact, I directed that they should not be held as prisoners, but mustbe returned to their commands.  These officers and men having beencarelessly brought through our lines to the rear have not determinedwhether they will be sent back the way they came, or whether they willbe sent by some other route.Regretting that all my efforts for alleviating the sufferings of woundedmen left upon the battle-field have been rendered nugatory, I remain,&c.,U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was evermade.  I might say the same thing of the assault of the 22d of May,1863, at Vicksburg.  At Cold Harbor no advantage whatever was gained tocompensate for the heavy loss we sustained.  Indeed, the advantagesother than those of relative losses, were on the Confederate side.Before that, the Army of Northern Virginia seemed to have acquired awholesome regard for the courage, endurance, and soldierly qualitiesgenerally of the Army of the Potomac.  They no longer wanted to fightthem "one Confederate to five Yanks."  Indeed, they seemed to have givenup any idea of gaining any advantage of their antagonist in the openfield.  They had come to much prefer breastworks in their front to theArmy of the Potomac.  This charge seemed to revive their hopestemporarily; but it was of short duration.  The effect upon the Army ofthe Potomac was the reverse.  When we reached the James River, however,all effects of the battle of Cold Harbor seemed to have disappeared.There was more justification for the assault at Vicksburg.  We were in aSouthern climate, at the beginning of the hot season.  The Army of theTennessee had won five successive victories over the garrison ofVicksburg in the three preceding weeks.  They had driven a portion ofthat army from Port Gibson with considerable loss, after having flankedthem out of their stronghold at Grand Gulf.  They had attacked anotherportion of the same army at Raymond, more than fifty miles farther inthe interior of the State, and driven them back into Jackson with greatloss in killed, wounded, captured and missing, besides loss of large andsmall arms:  they had captured the capital of the State of Mississippi,with a large amount of materials of war and manufactures.  Only a fewdays before, they had beaten the enemy then penned up in the town firstat Champion's Hill, next at Big Black River Bridge, inflicting upon hima loss of fifteen thousand or more men (including those cut off fromreturning) besides large losses in arms and ammunition.  The Army of theTennessee had come to believe that they could beat their antagonistunder any circumstances.  There was no telling how long a regular siegemight last.  As I have stated, it was the beginning of the hot season ina Southern climate.  There was no telling what the casualties might beamong Northern troops working and living in trenches, drinking surfacewater filtered through rich vegetation, under a tropical sun.  IfVicksburg could have been carried in May, it would not only have savedthe army the risk it ran of a greater danger than from the bullets ofthe enemy, but it would have given us a splendid army, well equipped andofficered, to operate elsewhere with. These are reasons justifying theassault.  The only benefit we gained--and it was a slight one for sogreat a sacrifice--was that the men worked cheerfully in the trenchesafter that, being satisfied with digging the enemy out.  Had the assaultnot been made, I have no doubt that the majority of those engaged in thesiege of Vicksburg would have believed that had we assaulted it wouldhave proven successful, and would have saved life, health and comfort.CHAPTER LVI.LEFT FLANK MOVEMENT ACROSS THE CHICKAHOMINY AND JAMES--GENERAL LEE--VISIT TO BUTLER--THE MOVEMENT ON PETERSBURG--THE INVESTMENT OFPETERSBURG.Lee's position was now so near Richmond, and the intervening swamps ofthe Chickahominy so great an obstacle to the movement of troops in theface of an enemy, that I determined to make my next left flank movecarry the Army of the Potomac south of the James River. (*34)Preparations for this were promptly commenced. The move was a hazardousone to make:  the Chickahominy River, with its marshy and heavilytimbered approaches, had to be crossed; all the bridges over it east ofLee were destroyed; the enemy had a shorter line and better roads totravel on to confront me in crossing; more than fifty miles intervenedbetween me and Butler, by the roads I should have to travel, with boththe James and the Chickahominy unbridged to cross; and last, the Army ofthe Potomac had to be got out of a position but a few hundred yards fromthe enemy at the widest place.  Lee, if he did not choose to follow me,might, with his shorter distance to travel and his bridges over theChickahominy and the James, move rapidly on Butler and crush him beforethe army with me could come to his relief.  Then too he might sparetroops enough to send against Hunter who was approaching Lynchburg,living upon the country he passed through, and without ammunitionfurther than what he carried with him.But the move had to be made, and I relied upon Lee's not seeing mydanger as I saw it.  Besides we had armies on both sides of the JamesRiver and not far from the Confederate capital.  I knew that its safetywould be a matter of the first consideration with the executive,legislative and judicial branches of the so-called Confederategovernment, if it was not with the military commanders.  But I took allthe precaution I knew of to guard against all dangers.Sheridan was sent with two divisions, to communicate with Hunter and tobreak up the Virginia Central Railroad and the James River Canal, on the7th of June, taking instructions to Hunter to come back with him (*35).Hunter was also informed by way of Washington and the Valley thatSheridan was on the way to meet him.  The canal and Central Road, andthe regions penetrated by them, were of vast importance to the enemy,furnishing and carrying a large per cent. of all the supplies for theArmy of Northern Virginia and the people of Richmond.  Before Sheridangot off on the 7th news was received from Hunter reporting his advanceto Staunton and successful engagement with the enemy near that place onthe 5th, in which the Confederate commander, W. S. Jones, was killed.On the 4th of June the enemy having withdrawn his left corps, Burnsideon our right was moved up between Warren and Smith.  On the 5th Birneyreturned to Hancock, which extended his left now to the Chickahominy,and Warren was withdrawn to Cold Harbor.  Wright was directed to sendtwo divisions to the left to extend down the banks of that stream toBottom's Bridge.  The cavalry extended still farther east to Jones'sBridge.On the 7th Abercrombie--who was in command at White House, and who hadbeen in command at our base of supplies in all the changes made from thestart--was ordered to take up the iron from the York River Railroad andput it on boats, and to be in readiness to move by water to City Point.On the 8th Meade was directed to fortify a line down the bankoverlooking the Chickahominy, under cover of which the army could move.On the 9th Abercrombie was directed to send all organized troopsarriving at White House, without debarking from their transports, toreport to Butler.  Halleck was at this time instructed to send allreinforcements to City Point.On the 11th I wrote:COLD HARBOR, VA., June 11, 1864.MAJOR-GEN. B. F. BUTLER, Commanding Department of Va. and N. C.The movement to transfer this army to the south side of the James Riverwill commence after dark to-morrow night.  Col. Comstock, of my staff,was sent specially to ascertain what was necessary to make your positionsecure in the interval during which the enemy might use most of hisforce against you, and also, to ascertain what point on the river weshould reach to effect a crossing if it should not be practicable toreach this side of the river at Bermuda Hundred.  Colonel Comstock hasnot yet returned, so that I cannot make instructions as definite as Iwould wish, but the time between this and Sunday night being so short inwhich to get word to you, I must do the best I can.  Colonel Dent goesto the Chickahominy to take to you the 18th corps.  The corps will leaveits position in the trenches as early in the evening, tomorrow, aspossible, and make a forced march to Cole's Landing or Ferry, where itshould reach by ten A.M. the following morning.  This corps numbers now15,300 men.  They take with them neither wagons nor artillery; theselatter marching with the balance of the army to the James River.  Theremainder of the army will cross the Chickahominy at Long Bridge and atJones's, and strike the river at the most practicable crossing belowCity Point.I directed several days ago that all reinforcements for the army shouldbe sent to you.  I am not advised of the number that may have gone, butsuppose you have received from six to ten thousand.  General Smith willalso reach you as soon as the enemy could, going by the way of Richmond.The balance of the force will not be more than one day behind, unlessdetained by the whole of Lee's army, in which case you will be strongenough.I wish you would direct the proper staff officers, your chief-engineerand your chief-quartermaster, to commence at once the collection of allthe means in their reach for crossing the army on its arrival.  If thereis a point below City Point where a pontoon bridge can be thrown, haveit laid.Expecting the arrival of the 18th corps by Monday night, if you deem itpracticable from the force you have to seize and hold Petersburg, youmay prepare to start, on the arrival of troops to hold your presentlines.  I do not want Petersburg visited, however, unless it is held,nor an attempt to take it, unless you feel a reasonable degree ofconfidence of success.  If you should go there, I think troops shouldtake nothing with them except what they can carry, depending uponsupplies being sent after the place is secured.  If Colonel Dent shouldnot succeed in securing the requisite amount of transportation for the18th corps before reaching you, please have the balance supplied.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.P. S.--On reflection I will send the 18th corps by way of White House.The distance which they will have to march will be enough shorter toenable them to reach you about the same time, and the uncertainty ofnavigation on the Chickahominy will be avoided.U. S. GRANT.COLD HARBOR, VA., June 11,1864.MAJOR-GENERAL G. G. MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac.Colonel Comstock, who visited the James River for the purpose ofascertaining the best point below Bermuda Hundred to which to march thearmy has not yet returned.  It is now getting so late, however, that allpreparations may be made for the move to-morrow night without waitinglonger.The movement will be made as heretofore agreed upon, that is, the 18thcorps make a rapid march with the infantry alone, their wagons andartillery accompanying the balance of the army to Cole's Landing orFerry, and there embark for City Point, losing no time for rest untilthey reach the latter point.The 5th corps will seize Long Bridge and move out on the Long BridgeRoad to its junction with Quaker Road, or until stopped by the enemy.The other three corps will follow in such order as you may direct, oneof them crossing at Long Bridge, and two at Jones's Bridge.  After thecrossing is effected, the most practicable roads will be taken to reachabout Fort Powhattan.  Of course, this is supposing the enemy makes noopposition to our advance.  The 5th corps, after securing the passage ofthe balance of the army, will join or follow in rear of the corps whichcrosses the same bridge with themselves.  The wagon trains should bekept well east of the troops, and if a crossing can be found, or madelower down than Jones's they should take it.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.P. S.--In view of the long march to reach Cole's Landing, and theuncertainty of being able to embark a large number of men there, thedirection of the 18th corps may be changed to White House.  They shouldbe directed to load up transports, and start them as fast as loadedwithout waiting for the whole corps or even whole divisions to gotogether.U. S. GRANT.About this time word was received (through the Richmond papers of the11th) that Crook and Averell had united and were moving east.  This,with the news of Hunter's successful engagement near Staunton, was nodoubt known to Lee before it was to me. Then Sheridan leaving with twodivisions of cavalry, looked indeed threatening, both to Lee'scommunications and supplies. Much of his cavalry was sent afterSheridan, and Early with Ewell's entire corps was sent to the Valley.Supplies were growing scarce in Richmond, and the sources from which todraw them were in our hands.  People from outside began to pour intoRichmond to help eat up the little on hand.  Consternation reignedthere.On the 12th Smith was ordered to move at night to White House, not tostop until he reached there, and to take boats at once for City Point,leaving his trains and artillery to move by land.Soon after dark some of the cavalry at Long Bridge effected a crossingby wading and floundering through the water and mud, leaving theirhorses behind, and drove away the cavalry pickets.  A pontoon bridge wasspeedily thrown across, over which the remainder of the army soon passedand pushed out for a mile or two to watch and detain any advance thatmight be made from the other side.  Warren followed the cavalry, and bythe morning of the 13th had his whole corps over.  Hancock followedWarren.  Burnside took the road to Jones's Bridge, followed by Wright.Ferrero's division, with the wagon train, moved farther east, by WindowShades and Cole's Ferry, our rear being covered by cavalry.It was known that the enemy had some gunboats at Richmond. These mightrun down at night and inflict great damage upon us before they could besunk or captured by our navy.  General Butler had, in advance, loadedsome vessels with stone ready to be sunk so as to obstruct the channelin an emergency.  On the 13th I sent orders to have these sunk as highup the river as we could guard them, and prevent their removal by theenemy.As soon as Warren's corps was over the Chickahominy it marched out andjoined the cavalry in holding the roads from Richmond while the armypassed.  No attempt was made by the enemy to impede our march, however,but Warren and Wilson reported the enemy strongly fortified in theirfront.  By the evening of the 13th Hancock's corps was at Charles CityCourt House on the James River.  Burnside's and Wright's corps were onthe Chickahominy, and crossed during the night, Warren's corps and thecavalry still covering the army.  The material for a pontoon bridge wasalready at hand and the work of laying it was commenced immediately,under the superintendence of Brigadier-General Benham, commanding theengineer brigade.  On the evening of the 14th the crossing commenced,Hancock in advance, using both the bridge and boats.When the Wilderness campaign commenced the Army of the Potomac,including Burnside's--which was a separate command until the 24th of Maywhen it was incorporated with the main army--numbered about 116,000 men.During the progress of the campaign about 40,000 reinforcements werereceived.  At the crossing of the James River June 14th-15th the armynumbered about 115,000.  Besides the ordinary losses incident to acampaign of six weeks' nearly constant fighting or skirmishing, aboutone-half of the artillery was sent back to Washington, and many men weredischarged by reason of the expiration of their term of service.* Inestimating our strength every enlisted man and every commissionedofficer present is included, no matter how employed; in bands, sick infield hospitals, hospital attendants, company cooks and all.  Operatingin an enemy's country, and being supplied always from a distant base,large detachments had at all times to be sent from the front, not onlyto guard the base of supplies and the roads to it, but all the roadsleading to our flanks and rear.  We were also operating in a countryunknown to us, and without competent guides or maps showing the roadsaccurately.The manner of estimating numbers in the two armies differs materially.In the Confederate army often only bayonets are taken into account,never, I believe, do they estimate more than are handling the guns ofthe artillery and armed with muskets (*36) or carbines.  Generally thelatter are far enough away to be excluded from the count in any onefield.  Officers and details of enlisted men are not included.  In theNorthern armies the estimate is most liberal, taking in all connectedwith the army and drawing pay.Estimated in the same manner as ours, Lee had not less than 80,000 menat the start.  His reinforcements were about equal to ours during thecampaign, deducting the discharged men and those sent back.  He was onthe defensive, and in a country in which every stream, every road, everyobstacle to the movement of troops and every natural defence wasfamiliar to him and his army.  The citizens were all friendly to him andhis cause, and could and did furnish him with accurate reports of ourevery move.  Rear guards were not necessary for him, and having always arailroad at his back, large wagon trains were not required. Allcircumstances considered we did not have any advantage in numbers.General Lee, who had led the Army of Northern Virginia in all thesecontests, was a very highly estimated man in the Confederate army andStates, and filled also a very high place in the estimation of thepeople and press of the Northern States.  His praise was soundedthroughout the entire North after every action he was engaged in:  thenumber of his forces was always lowered and that of the National forcesexaggerated.  He was a large, austere man, and I judge difficult ofapproach to his subordinates.  To be extolled by the entire press of theSouth after every engagement, and by a portion of the press North withequal vehemence, was calculated to give him the entire confidence of histroops and to make him feared by his antagonists.  It was not anuncommon thing for my staff-officers to hear from Eastern officers,"Well, Grant has never met Bobby Lee yet."  There were good and trueofficers who believe now that the Army of Northern Virginia was superiorto the Army of the Potomac man to man.  I do not believe so, except asthe advantages spoken of above made them so.  Before the end I believethe difference was the other way.  The Army of Northern Virginia becamedespondent and saw the end.  It did not please them.  The National armysaw the same thing, and were encouraged by it.The advance of the Army of the Potomac reached the James on the 14th ofJune.  Preparations were at once commenced for laying the pontoonbridges and crossing the river.  As already stated, I had previouslyordered General Butler to have two vessels loaded with stone and carriedup the river to a point above that occupied by our gunboats, where thechannel was narrow, and sunk there so as to obstruct the passage andprevent Confederate gunboats from coming down the river.  Butler had hadthese boats filled and put in position, but had not had them sunk beforemy arrival.  I ordered this done, and also directed that he should turnover all material and boats not then in use in the river to be used inferrying the troops across.I then, on the 14th, took a steamer and ran up to Bermuda Hundred to seeGeneral Butler for the purpose of directing a movement againstPetersburg, while our troops of the Army of the Potomac were crossing.I had sent General W. F. Smith back from Cold Harbor by the way of WhiteHouse, thence on steamers to City Point for the purpose of givingGeneral Butler more troops with which to accomplish this result.General Butler was ordered to send Smith with his troops reinforced, asfar as that could be conveniently done, from other parts of the Army ofthe James.  He gave Smith about six thousand reinforcements, includingsome twenty-five hundred cavalry under Kautz, and about thirty-fivehundred colored infantry under Hinks.The distance which Smith had to move to reach the enemy's lines wasabout six miles, and the Confederate advance line of works was but twomiles outside of Petersburg.  Smith was to move under cover of night, upclose to the enemy's works, and assault as soon as he could afterdaylight.  I believed then, and still believe, that Petersburg couldhave been easily captured at that time.  It only had about 2,500 men inthe defences besides some irregular troops, consisting of citizens andemployees in the city who took up arms in case of emergency.  Smithstarted as proposed, but his advance encountered a rebel forceintrenched between City Point and their lines outside of Petersburg.This position he carried, with some loss to the enemy; but there was somuch delay that it was daylight before his troops really got off fromthere.  While there I informed General Butler that Hancock's corps wouldcross the river and move to Petersburg to support Smith in case thelatter was successful, and that I could reinforce there more rapidlythan Lee could reinforce from his position.I returned down the river to where the troops of the Army of the Potomacnow were, communicated to General Meade, in writing, the directions Ihad given to General Butler and directed him (Meade) to cross Hancock'scorps over under cover of night, and push them forward in the morning toPetersburg; halting them, however, at a designated point until theycould hear from Smith.  I also informed General Meade that I had orderedrations from Bermuda Hundred for Hancock's corps, and desired him toissue them speedily, and to lose no more time than was absolutelynecessary.  The rations did not reach him, however, and Hancock, whilehe got all his corps over during the night, remained until half-past tenin the hope of receiving them.  He then moved without them, and on theroad received a note from General W. F. Smith, asking him to come on.This seems to be the first information that General Hancock had receivedof the fact that he was to go to Petersburg, or that anything particularwas expected of him.  Otherwise he would have been there by four o'clockin the afternoon.Smith arrived in front of the enemy's lines early in the forenoon of the15th, and spent the day until after seven o'clock in the evening inreconnoitering what appeared to be empty works.  The enemy's lineconsisted of redans occupying commanding positions, with rifle-pitsconnecting them.  To the east side of Petersburg, from the Appomattoxback, there were thirteen of these redans extending a distance ofseveral miles, probably three.  If they had been properly manned theycould have held out against any force that could have attacked them, atleast until reinforcements could have got up from the north of Richmond.Smith assaulted with the colored troops, and with success.  By nineo'clock at night he was in possession of five of these redans and, ofcourse, of the connecting lines of rifle-pits. All of them containedartillery, which fell into our hands. Hancock came up and proposed totake any part assigned to him; and Smith asked him to relieve his menwho were in the trenches.Next morning, the 16th, Hancock himself was in command, and capturedanother redan.  Meade came up in the afternoon and succeeded Hancock,who had to be relieved, temporarily, from the command of his corps onaccount of the breaking out afresh of the wound he had received atGettysburg.  During the day Meade assaulted and carried one more redanto his right and two to his left.  In all this we lost very heavily.The works were not strongly manned, but they all had guns in them whichfell into our hands, together with the men who were handling them in theeffort to repel these assaults.Up to this time Beauregard, who had commanded south of Richmond, hadreceived no reinforcements, except Hoke's division from Drury'sBluff,(*37) which had arrived on the morning of the 16th; though he hadurged the authorities very strongly to send them, believing, as he did,that Petersburg would be a valuable prize which we might seek.During the 17th the fighting was very severe and the losses heavy; andat night our troops occupied about the same position they had occupiedin the morning, except that they held a redan which had been captured byPotter during the day.  During the night, however, Beauregard fell backto the line which had been already selected, and commenced fortifyingit.  Our troops advanced on the 18th to the line which he had abandoned,and found that the Confederate loss had been very severe, many of theenemy's dead still remaining in the ditches and in front of them.Colonel J. L. Chamberlain, of the 20th Maine, was wounded on the 18th.He was gallantly leading his brigade at the time, as he had been inthe habit of doing in all the engagements in which he had previouslybeen engaged.  He had several times been recommended for abrigadier-generalcy for gallant and meritorious conduct.  On thisoccasion, however, I promoted him on the spot, and forwarded a copy ofmy order to the War Department, asking that my act might be confirmedand Chamberlain's name sent to the Senate for confirmation without anydelay.  This was done, and at last a gallant and meritorious officerreceived partial justice at the hands of his government, which he hadserved so faithfully and so well.If General Hancock's orders of the 15th had been communicated to him,that officer, with his usual promptness, would undoubtedly have beenupon the ground around Petersburg as early as four o'clock in theafternoon of the 15th.  The days were long and it would have given himconsiderable time before night.  I do not think there is any doubt thatPetersburg itself could have been carried without much loss; or, atleast, if protected by inner detached works, that a line could have beenestablished very much in rear of the one then occupied by the enemy.This would have given us control of both the Weldon and South Siderailroads.  This would also have saved an immense amount of hardfighting which had to be done from the 15th to the 18th, and would havegiven us greatly the advantage in the long siege which ensued.I now ordered the troops to be put under cover and allowed some of therest which they had so long needed.  They remained quiet, except thatthere was more or less firing every day, until the 22d, when GeneralMeade ordered an advance towards the Weldon Railroad.  We were veryanxious to get to that road, and even round to the South Side Railroadif possible.Meade moved Hancock's corps, now commanded by Birney, to the left, witha view to at least force the enemy to stay within the limits of his ownline.  General Wright, with the 6th corps, was ordered by a road farthersouth, to march directly for the Weldon road.  The enemy passed inbetween these two corps and attacked vigorously, and with very seriousresults to the National troops, who were then withdrawn from theiradvanced position.The Army of the Potomac was given the investment of Petersburg, whilethe Army of the James held Bermuda Hundred and all the ground wepossessed north of the James River.  The 9th corps, Burnside's, wasplaced upon the right at Petersburg; the 5th, Warren's, next; the 2d,Birney's, next; then the 6th, Wright's, broken off to the left andsouth.  Thus began the siege of Petersburg.CHAPTER LVII.RAID ON THE VIRGINIA CENTRAL RAILROAD--RAID ON THE WELDON RAILROAD--EARLY 'S MOVEMENT UPON WASHINGTON--MINING THE WORKS BEFORE PETERSBURG--EXPLOSION OF THE MINE BEFORE PETERSBURG--CAMPAIGN IN THE SHENANDOAHVALLEY--CAPTURE OF THE WELDON RAILROAD.On the 7th of June, while at Cold Harbor, I had as already indicatedsent Sheridan with two divisions of cavalry to destroy as much as hecould of the Virginia Central Railroad.  General Hunter had beenoperating up the Shenandoah Valley with some success, having fought abattle near Staunton where he captured a great many prisoners, besideskilling and wounding a good many men.  After the battle he formed ajunction at Staunton with Averell and Crook, who had come up from theKanawha, or Gauley River.  It was supposed, therefore, that GeneralHunter would be about Charlottesville, Virginia, by the time Sheridancould get there, doing on the way the damage that he was sent to do.I gave Sheridan instructions to have Hunter, in case he should meet himabout Charlottesville, join and return with him to the Army of thePotomac.  Lee, hearing of Hunter's success in the valley, startedBreckinridge out for its defence at once. Learning later of Sheridan'sgoing with two divisions, he also sent Hampton with two divisions ofcavalry, his own and Fitz-Hugh Lee's.Sheridan moved to the north side of the North Anna to get out west, andlearned of the movement of these troops to the south side of the samestream almost as soon as they had started. He pushed on to get toTrevilian Station to commence his destruction at that point.  On thenight of the 10th he bivouacked some six or seven miles east ofTrevilian, while Fitz-Hugh Lee was the same night at Trevilian Stationand Hampton but a few miles away.During the night Hampton ordered an advance on Sheridan, hoping, nodoubt, to surprise and very badly cripple him.  Sheridan, however, by acounter move sent Custer on a rapid march to get between the twodivisions of the enemy and into their rear. This he did successfully, sothat at daylight, when the assault was made, the enemy found himself atthe same time resisted in front and attacked in rear, and broke in someconfusion.  The losses were probably very light on both sides in killedand wounded, but Sheridan got away with some five hundred prisoners andsent them to City Point.During that day, the 11th, Sheridan moved into Trevilian Station, andthe following day proceeded to tear up the road east and west.  Therewas considerable fighting during the whole of the day, but the work ofdestruction went on.  In the meantime, at night, the enemy had takenpossession of the crossing which Sheridan had proposed to take to gonorth when he left Trevilian.  Sheridan learned, however, from some ofthe prisoners he had captured here, that General Hunter was aboutLynchburg, and therefore that there was no use of his going on toCharlottesville with a view to meet him.Sheridan started back during the night of the 12th, and made his waynorth and farther east, coming around by the north side of White House,and arriving there on the 21st.  Here he found an abundance of foragefor his animals, food for his men, and security while resting.  He hadbeen obliged to leave about ninety of his own men in the field-hospitalwhich he had established near Trevilian, and these necessarily fell intothe hands of the enemy.White House up to this time had been a depot; but now that our troopswere all on the James River, it was no longer wanted as a store ofsupplies.  Sheridan was, therefore, directed to break it up; which hedid on the 22d of June, bringing the garrison and an immense wagon trainwith him.  All these were over the James River by the 26th of the month,and Sheridan ready to follow.In the meantime Meade had sent Wilson's division on a raid to destroythe Weldon and South Side roads.  Now that Sheridan was safe and Hamptonfree to return to Richmond with his cavalry, Wilson's position becameprecarious.  Meade therefore, on the 27th, ordered Sheridan over theriver to make a demonstration in favor of Wilson.  Wilson got back,though not without severe loss, having struck both roads, but the damagedone was soon repaired.After these events comparative quiet reigned about Petersburg until latein July.  The time, however, was spent in strengthening theintrenchments and making our position generally more secure against asudden attack.  In the meantime I had to look after other portions of mycommand, where things had not been going on so favorably, always, as Icould have wished.General Hunter who had been appointed to succeed Sigel in the ShenandoahValley immediately took up the offensive.  He met the enemy on the 5thof June at Piedmont, and defeated him.  On the 8th he formed a junctionwith Crook and Averell at Staunton, from which place he moved direct onLynchburg, via Lexington, which he reached and invested on the 16th.  Upto this time he was very successful; and but for the difficulty oftaking with him sufficient ordnance stores over so long a march, througha hostile country, he would, no doubt, have captured Lynchburg. Thedestruction of the enemy's supplies and manufactories had been verygreat.  To meet this movement under General Hunter, General Lee sentEarly with his corps, a part of which reached Lynchburg before Hunter.After some skirmishing on the 17th and 18th, General Hunter, owing to awant of ammunition to give battle, retired from before the place.Unfortunately, this want of ammunition left him no choice of route forhis return but by the way of the Gauley and Kanawha rivers, thence upthe Ohio River, returning to Harper's Ferry by way of the Baltimore andOhio Railroad.  A long time was consumed in making this movement.Meantime the valley was left open to Early's troops, and others in thatquarter; and Washington also was uncovered. Early took advantage of thiscondition of affairs and moved on Washington.In the absence of Hunter, General Lew Wallace, with headquarters atBaltimore, commanded the department in which the Shenandoah lay.  Hissurplus of troops with which to move against the enemy was small innumber.  Most of these were raw and, consequently, very much inferior toour veterans and to the veterans which Early had with him; but thesituation of Washington was precarious, and Wallace moved withcommendable promptitude to meet the enemy at the Monocacy.  He couldhardly have expected to defeat him badly, but he hoped to cripple anddelay him until Washington could be put into a state of preparation forhis reception.  I had previously ordered General Meade to send adivision to Baltimore for the purpose of adding to the defences ofWashington, and he had sent Ricketts's division of the 6th corps(Wright's), which arrived in Baltimore on the 8th of July.  Finding thatWallace had gone to the front with his command, Ricketts immediatelytook the cars and followed him to the Monocacy with his entire division.They met the enemy and, as might have been expected, were defeated; butthey succeeded in stopping him for the day on which the battle tookplace.  The next morning Early started on his march to the capital ofthe Nation, arriving before it on the 11th.Learning of the gravity of the situation I had directed General Meade toalso order Wright with the rest of his corps directly to Washington forthe relief of that place, and the latter reached there the very day thatEarly arrived before it.  The 19th corps, which had been stationed inLouisiana, having been ordered up to reinforce the armies aboutRichmond, had about this time arrived at Fortress Monroe, on their wayto join us. I diverted them from that point to Washington, which placethey reached, almost simultaneously with Wright, on the 11th.  The 19thcorps was commanded by Major-General Emory.Early made his reconnoissance with a view of attacking on the followingmorning, the 12th; but the next morning he found our intrenchments,which were very strong, fully manned.  He at once commenced to retreat,Wright following.  There is no telling how much this result wascontributed to by General Lew Wallace's leading what might well beconsidered almost a forlorn hope.  If Early had been but one day earlierhe might have entered the capital before the arrival of thereinforcements I had sent. Whether the delay caused by the battleamounted to a day or not, General Wallace contributed on this occasion,by the defeat of the troops under him a greater benefit to the causethan often falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to renderby means of a victory.Farther west also the troubles were threatening.  Some time before,Forrest had met Sturgis in command of some of our cavalry in Mississippiand handled him very roughly, gaining a very great victory over him.This left Forrest free to go almost where he pleased, and to cut theroads in rear of Sherman who was then advancing.  Sherman was abundantlyable to look after the army that he was immediately with, and all of hismilitary division so long as he could communicate with it; but it was myplace to see that he had the means with which to hold his rear.  Twodivisions under A. J. Smith had been sent to Banks in Louisiana somemonths before.  Sherman ordered these back, with directions to attackForrest.  Smith met and defeated him very badly.  I then directed thatSmith should hang to Forrest and not let him go; and to prevent by allmeans his getting upon the Memphis and Nashville Railroad.  Sherman hadanticipated me in this matter, and given the same orders in substance;but receiving my directions for this order to Smith, he repeated it.On the 25th of June General Burnside had commenced running a mine fromabout the centre of his front under the Confederate works confrontinghim.  He was induced to do this by Colonel Pleasants, of thePennsylvania Volunteers, whose regiment was mostly composed of miners,and who was himself a practical miner.  Burnside had submitted thescheme to Meade and myself, and we both approved of it, as a means ofkeeping the men occupied.  His position was very favorable for carryingon this work, but not so favorable for the operations to follow itscompletion.  The position of the two lines at that point were only abouta hundred yards apart with a comparatively deep ravine intervening.  Inthe bottom of this ravine the work commenced.  The position wasunfavorable in this particular: that the enemy's line at that point wasre-entering, so that its front was commanded by their own lines both tothe right and left.  Then, too, the ground was sloping upward back ofthe Confederate line for a considerable distance, and it was presumablethat the enemy had, at least, a detached work on this highest point.The work progressed, and on the 23d of July the mine was finished readyfor charging; but I had this work of charging deferred until we wereready for it.On the 17th of July several deserters came in and said that there wasgreat consternation in Richmond, and that Lee was coming out to make anattack upon us the object being to put us on the defensive so that hemight detach troops to go to Georgia where the army Sherman wasoperating against was said to be in great trouble.  I put the armycommanders, Meade and Butler, on the lookout, but the attack was notmade.I concluded, then, a few days later, to do something in the way ofoffensive movement myself, having in view something of the same objectthat Lee had had.  Wright's and Emory's corps were in Washington, andwith this reduction of my force Lee might very readily have spared sometroops from the defences to send West.  I had other objects in view,however, besides keeping Lee where he was.  The mine was constructed andready to be exploded, and I wanted to take that occasion to carryPetersburg if I could.  It was the object, therefore, to get as many ofLee's troops away from the south side of the James River as possible.Accordingly, on the 26th, we commenced a movement with Hancock's corpsand Sheridan's cavalry to the north side by the way of Deep Bottom,where Butler had a pontoon bridge laid. The plan, in the main, was tolet the cavalry cut loose and, joining with Kautz's cavalry of the Armyof the James, get by Lee's lines and destroy as much as they could ofthe Virginia Central Railroad, while, in the mean time, the infantry wasto move out so as to protect their rear and cover their retreat backwhen they should have got through with their work.  We were successfulin drawing the enemy's troops to the north side of the James as Iexpected.  The mine was ordered to be charged, and the morning of the30th of July was the time fixed for its explosion.  I gave Meade minuteorders (*38) on the 24th directing how I wanted the assault conducted,which orders he amplified into general instructions for the guidance ofthe troops that were to be engaged.Meade's instructions, which I, of course, approved most heartily, wereall that I can see now was necessary.  The only further precaution whichhe could have taken, and which he could not foresee, would have been tohave different men to execute them.The gallery to the mine was over five hundred feet long from where itentered the ground to the point where it was under the enemy's works,and with a cross gallery of something over eighty feet running undertheir lines.  Eight chambers had been left, requiring a ton of powdereach to charge them.  All was ready by the time I had prescribed; and onthe 29th Hancock and Sheridan were brought back near the James Riverwith their troops.  Under cover of night they started to recross thebridge at Deep Bottom, and to march directly for that part of our linesin front of the mine.Warren was to hold his line of intrenchments with a sufficient number ofmen and concentrate the balance on the right next to Burnside's corps,while Ord, now commanding the 18th corps, temporarily under Meade, wasto form in the rear of Burnside to support him when he went in.  Allwere to clear off the parapets and the _abatis_ in their front so as toleave the space as open as possible, and be able to charge the momentthe mine had been sprung and Burnside had taken possession.  Burnside'scorps was not to stop in the crater at all but push on to the top of thehill, supported on the right and left by Ord's and Warren's corps.Warren and Ord fulfilled their instructions perfectly so far as makingready was concerned.  Burnside seemed to have paid no attention whateverto the instructions, and left all the obstruction in his own front forhis troops to get over in the best way they could.  The four divisionsof his corps were commanded by Generals Potter, Willcox, Ledlie andFerrero.  The last was a colored division; and Burnside selected it tomake the assault.  Meade interfered with this.  Burnside then tookLedlie's division--a worse selection than the first could have been.  Infact, Potter and Willcox were the only division commanders Burnside hadwho were equal to the occasion.  Ledlie besides being otherwiseinefficient, proved also to possess disqualification less common amongsoldiers.There was some delay about the explosion of the mine so that it did notgo off until about five o'clock in the morning.  When it did explode itwas very successful, making a crater twenty feet deep and something likea hundred feet in length.  Instantly one hundred and ten cannon andfifty mortars, which had been placed in the most commanding positionscovering the ground to the right and left of where the troops were toenter the enemy's lines, commenced playing.  Ledlie's division marchedinto the crater immediately on the explosion, but most of the menstopped there in the absence of any one to give directions; theircommander having found some safe retreat to get into before theystarted.  There was some delay on the left and right in advancing, butsome of the troops did get in and turn to the right and left, carryingthe rifle-pits as I expected they would do.There had been great consternation in Petersburg, as we were well aware,about a rumored mine that we were going to explode.  They knew we weremining, and they had failed to cut our mine off by countermining, thoughBeauregard had taken the precaution to run up a line of intrenchments tothe rear of that part of their line fronting where they could see thatour men were at work.  We had learned through deserters who had come inthat the people had very wild rumors about what was going on on ourside.  They said that we had undermined the whole of Petersburg; thatthey were resting upon a slumbering volcano and did not know at whatmoment they might expect an eruption.  I somewhat based my calculationsupon this state of feeling, and expected that when the mine was explodedthe troops to the right and left would flee in all directions, and thatour troops, if they moved promptly, could get in and strengthenthemselves before the enemy had come to a realization of the truesituation.  It was just as I expected it would be.  We could see the menrunning without any apparent object except to get away. It was half anhour before musketry firing, to amount to anything, was opened upon ourmen in the crater.  It was an hour before the enemy got artillery up toplay upon them; and it was nine o'clock before Lee got up reinforcementsfrom his right to join in expelling our troops.The effort was a stupendous failure.  It cost us about four thousandmen, mostly, however, captured; and all due to inefficiency on the partof the corps commander and the incompetency of the division commanderwho was sent to lead the assault.After being fully assured of the failure of the mine, and finding thatmost of that part of Lee's army which had been drawn north of the JamesRiver were still there, I gave Meade directions to send a corps ofinfantry and the cavalry next morning, before Lee could get his forcesback, to destroy fifteen or twenty miles of the Weldon Railroad.  Butmisfortunes never come singly.  I learned during that same afternoonthat Wright's pursuit of Early was feeble because of the constant andcontrary orders he had been receiving from Washington, while I was cutoff from immediate communication by reason of our cable acrossChesapeake Bay being broken.  Early, however, was not aware of the factthat Wright was not pursuing until he had reached Strasburg.  Findingthat he was not pursued he turned back to Winchester, where Crook wasstationed with a small force, and drove him out.  He then pushed northuntil he had reached the Potomac, then he sent McCausland across toChambersburg, Pa., to destroy that town.  Chambersburg was a purelydefenceless town with no garrison whatever, and no fortifications; yetMcCausland, under Early's orders, burned the place and left about threehundred families houseless.  This occurred on the 30th of July.  Irescinded my orders for the troops to go out to destroy the WeldonRailroad, and directed them to embark for Washington City.  Afterburning Chambersburg McCausland retreated, pursued by our cavalry,towards Cumberland.  They were met and defeated by General Kelley anddriven into Virginia.The Shenandoah Valley was very important to the Confederates, because itwas the principal storehouse they now had for feeding their armies aboutRichmond.  It was well known that they would make a desperate struggleto maintain it.  It had been the source of a great deal of trouble to usheretofore to guard that outlet to the north, partly because of theincompetency of some of the commanders, but chiefly because ofinterference from Washington.It seemed to be the policy of General Halleck and Secretary Stanton tokeep any force sent there, in pursuit of the invading army, moving rightand left so as to keep between the enemy and our capital; and, generallyspeaking, they pursued this policy until all knowledge of thewhereabouts of the enemy was lost. They were left, therefore, free tosupply themselves with horses, beef cattle, and such provisions as theycould carry away from Western Maryland and Pennsylvania.  I determinedto put a stop to this.  I started Sheridan at once for that field ofoperation, and on the following day sent another division of hiscavalry.I had previously asked to have Sheridan assigned to that command, butMr. Stanton objected, on the ground that he was too young for soimportant a command.  On the 1st of August when I sent reinforcementsfor the protection of Washington, I sent the following orders:CITY POINT, VA.,August 1, 1864, 11.30 A.M.MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Washington D. C.I am sending General Sheridan for temporary duty whilst the enemy isbeing expelled from the border.  Unless General Hunter is in the fieldin person, I want Sheridan put in command of all the troops in thefield, with instructions to put himself south of the enemy and followhim to the death.  Wherever the enemy goes let our troops go also.  Oncestarted up the valley they ought to be followed until we get possessionof the Virginia Central Railroad.  If General Hunter is in the field,give Sheridan direct command of the 6th corps and cavalry division. Allthe cavalry, I presume, will reach Washington in the course ofto-morrow.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.The President in some way or other got to see this dispatch of minedirecting certain instructions to be given to the commanders in thefield, operating against Early, and sent me the following verycharacteristic dispatch:OFFICE U. S. MILITARY TELEGRAPH, WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C.,August 3, 1864.Cypher. 6 P.M.,LT. GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.I have seen your despatch in which you say, "I want Sheridan put incommand of all the troops in the field, with instructions to put himselfsouth of the enemy, and follow him to the death. Wherever the enemygoes, let our troops go also."  This, I think, is exactly right, as tohow our forces should move.  But please look over the despatches you mayhave received from here, even since you made that order, and discover,if you can, that there is any idea in the head of any one here, of"putting our army south of the enemy," or of "following him to thedeath" in any direction.  I repeat to you it will neither be done norattempted unless you watch it every day, and hour, and force it.A. LINCOLN.I replied to this that "I would start in two hours for Washington," andsoon got off, going directly to the Monocacy without stopping atWashington on my way.  I found General Hunter's army encamped there,scattered over the fields along the banks of the Monocacy, with manyhundreds of cars and locomotives, belonging to the Baltimore and OhioRailroad, which he had taken the precaution to bring back and collect atthat point.  I asked the general where the enemy was.  He replied thathe did not know.  He said the fact was, that he was so embarrassed withorders from Washington moving him first to the right and then to theleft that he had lost all trace of the enemy.I then told the general that I would find out where the enemy was, andat once ordered steam got up and trains made up, giving directions topush for Halltown, some four miles above Harper's Ferry, in theShenandoah Valley.  The cavalry and the wagon trains were to march, butall the troops that could be transported by the cars were to go in thatway.  I knew that the valley was of such importance to the enemy that,no matter how much he was scattered at that time, he would in a veryshort time be found in front of our troops moving south.I then wrote out General Hunter's instructions. (*39)  I told him thatSheridan was in Washington, and still another division was on its way;and suggested that he establish the headquarters of the department atany point that would suit him best, Cumberland, Baltimore, or elsewhere,and give Sheridan command of the troops in the field.  The generalreplied to this, that he thought he had better be relieved entirely.  Hesaid that General Halleck seemed so much to distrust his fitness for theposition he was in that he thought somebody else ought to be there.  Hedid not want, in any way, to embarrass the cause; thus showing apatriotism that was none too common in the army.  There were not manymajor-generals who would voluntarily have asked to have the command of adepartment taken from them on the supposition that for some particularreason, or for any reason, the service would be better performed.  Itold him, "very well then," and telegraphed at once for Sheridan to cometo the Monocacy, and suggested that I would wait and meet him there.Sheridan came at once by special train, but reached there after thetroops were all off.  I went to the station and remained there until hearrived.  Myself and one or two of my staff were about all the Unionpeople, except General Hunter and his staff, who were left at theMonocacy when Sheridan arrived.  I hastily told Sheridan what had beendone and what I wanted him to do, giving him, at the same time, thewritten instructions which had been prepared for General Hunter anddirected to that officer.Sheridan now had about 30,000 men to move with, 8,000 of them beingcavalry.  Early had about the same number, but the superior ability ofthe National commander over the Confederate commander was so great thatall the latter's advantage of being on the defensive was more thancounterbalanced by this circumstance.  As I had predicted, Early wassoon found in front of Sheridan in the valley, and Pennsylvania andMaryland were speedily freed from the invaders.  The importance of thevalley was so great to the Confederates that Lee reinforced Early, butnot to the extent that we thought and feared he would.To prevent as much as possible these reinforcements from being sent outfrom Richmond, I had to do something to compel Lee to retain his forcesabout his capital.  I therefore gave orders for another move to thenorth side of the James River, to threaten Richmond.  Hancock's corps,part of the 10th corps under Birney, and Gregg's division of cavalrywere crossed to the north side of the James during the night of the13th-14th of August.  A threatening position was maintained for a numberof days, with more or less skirmishing, and some tolerably hardfighting; although it was my object and my instructions that anythinglike a battle should be avoided, unless opportunities should presentthemselves which would insure great success. General Meade was left incommand of the few troops around Petersburg, strongly intrenched; andwas instructed to keep a close watch upon the enemy in that quarter, andhimself to take advantage of any weakening that might occur through aneffort on the part of the enemy to reinforce the north side.  There wasno particular victory gained on either side; but during that time nomore reinforcements were sent to the valley.I informed Sheridan of what had been done to prevent reinforcementsbeing sent from Richmond against him, and also that the efforts we hadmade had proven that one of the divisions which we supposed had gone tothe valley was still at Richmond, because we had captured six or sevenhundred prisoners from that division, each of its four brigades havingcontributed to our list of captures.  I also informed him that but onedivision had gone, and it was possible that I should be able to preventthe going of any more.To add to my embarrassment at this time Sherman, who was now nearAtlanta, wanted reinforcements.  He was perfectly willing to take theraw troops then being raised in the North-west, saying that he couldteach them more soldiering in one day among his troops than they wouldlearn in a week in a camp of instruction.  I therefore asked that alltroops in camps of instruction in the North-west be sent to him.Sherman also wanted to be assured that no Eastern troops were moving outagainst him.  I informed him of what I had done and assured him that Iwould hold all the troops there that it was possible for me to hold, andthat up to that time none had gone.  I also informed him that his realdanger was from Kirby Smith, who commanded the trans-MississippiDepartment.  If Smith should escape Steele, and get across theMississippi River, he might move against him.  I had, therefore, askedto have an expedition ready to move from New Orleans against Mobile incase Kirby Smith should get across.  This would have a tendency to drawhim to the defence of that place, instead of going against Sherman.Right in the midst of all these embarrassments Halleck informed me thatthere was an organized scheme on foot in the North to resist the draft,and suggested that it might become necessary to draw troops from thefield to put it down.  He also advised taking in sail, and not going toofast.The troops were withdrawn from the north side of the James River on thenight of the 20th.  Before they were withdrawn, however, and while mostof Lee's force was on that side of the river, Warren had been sent withmost of the 5th corps to capture the Weldon Railroad.  He took up hisline of march well back to the rear, south of the enemy, while thetroops remaining in the trenches extended so as to cover that part ofthe line which he had vacated by moving out.  From our left, near theold line, it was about three miles to the Weldon Railroad.  A divisionwas ordered from the right of the Petersburg line to reinforce Warren,while a division was brought back from the north side of the James Riverto take its place.This road was very important to the enemy.  The limits from which hissupplies had been drawn were already very much contracted, and I knewthat he must fight desperately to protect it.  Warren carried the road,though with heavy loss on both sides.  He fortified his new position,and our trenches were then extended from the left of our main line toconnect with his new one.  Lee made repeated attempts to dislodgeWarren's corps, but without success, and with heavy loss.As soon as Warren was fortified and reinforcements reached him, troopswere sent south to destroy the bridges on the Weldon Railroad; and withsuch success that the enemy had to draw in wagons, for a distance ofabout thirty miles, all the supplies they got thereafter from thatsource.  It was on the 21st that Lee seemed to have given up the WeldonRailroad as having been lost to him; but along about the 24th or 25th hemade renewed attempts to recapture it; again he failed and with veryheavy losses to him as compared with ours.On the night of the 20th our troops on the north side of the James werewithdrawn, and Hancock and Gregg were sent south to destroy the WeldonRailroad.  They were attacked on the 25th at Reams's Station, and afterdesperate fighting a part of our line gave way, losing five pieces ofartillery.  But the Weldon Railroad never went out of our possessionfrom the 18th of August to the close of the war.CHAPTER LVIII.SHERIDAN'S ADVANCE--VISIT TO SHERIDAN--SHERIDAN'S VICTORY IN THESHENANDOAH--SHERIDAN'S RIDE TO WINCHESTER--CLOSE OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR THEWINTER.We had our troops on the Weldon Railroad contending against a largeforce that regarded this road of so much importance that they couldafford to expend many lives in retaking it; Sherman just getting throughto Atlanta with great losses of men from casualties, discharges anddetachments left along as guards to occupy and hold the road in rear ofhim; Washington threatened but a short time before, and now Early beingstrengthened in the valley so as, probably, to renew that attempt.  Itkept me pretty active in looking after all these points.On the 10th of August Sheridan had advanced on Early up the ShenandoahValley, Early falling back to Strasburg.  On the 12th I learned that Leehad sent twenty pieces of artillery, two divisions of infantry and aconsiderable cavalry force to strengthen Early.  It was important thatSheridan should be informed of this, so I sent the information toWashington by telegraph, and directed a courier to be sent from there toget the message to Sheridan at all hazards, giving him the information.The messenger, an officer of the army, pushed through with great energyand reached Sheridan just in time. The officer went through by way ofSnicker's Gap, escorted by some cavalry.  He found Sheridan just makinghis preparations to attack Early in his chosen position.  Now, however,he was thrown back on the defensive.On the 15th of September I started to visit General Sheridan in theShenandoah Valley.  My purpose was to have him attack Early, or drivehim out of the valley and destroy that source of supplies for Lee'sarmy.  I knew it was impossible for me to get orders through Washingtonto Sheridan to make a move, because they would be stopped there and suchorders as Halleck's caution (and that of the Secretary of War) wouldsuggest would be given instead, and would, no doubt, be contradictory tomine.  I therefore, without stopping at Washington, went directlythrough to Charlestown, some ten miles above Harper's Ferry, and waitedthere to see General Sheridan, having sent a courier in advance toinform him where to meet me.When Sheridan arrived I asked him if he had a map showing the positionsof his army and that of the enemy.  He at once drew one out of his sidepocket, showing all roads and streams, and the camps of the two armies.He said that if he had permission he would move so and so (pointing outhow) against the Confederates, and that he could "whip them."  Beforestarting I had drawn up a plan of campaign for Sheridan, which I hadbrought with me; but, seeing that he was so clear and so positive in hisviews and so confident of success, I said nothing about this and did nottake it out of my pocket.Sheridan's wagon trains were kept at Harper's Ferry, where all of hisstores were.  By keeping the teams at that place, their forage did nothave to be hauled to them.  As supplies of ammunition, provisions andrations for the men were wanted, trains would be made up to deliver thestores to the commissaries and quartermasters encamped at Winchester.Knowing that he, in making preparations to move at a given day, wouldhave to bring up wagons trains from Harper's Ferry, I asked him if hecould be ready to get off by the following Tuesday.  This was on Friday."O Yes," he said, he "could be off before daylight on Monday."  I toldhim then to make the attack at that time and according to his own plan;and I immediately started to return to the army about Richmond.  Aftervisiting Baltimore and Burlington, New Jersey, I arrived at City Pointon the 19th.On the way out to Harper's Ferry I had met Mr. Robert Garrett, Presidentof the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.  He seemed very anxious to know whenworkmen might be put upon the road again so as to make repairs and putit in shape for running.  It was a large piece of property to havestanding idle.  I told him I could not answer then positively but wouldtry and inform him before a great while.  On my return Mr. Garrett metme again with the same and I told him I thought that by the Wednesday hemight send his workmen out on his road.  I gave him no furtherinformation however, and he had no suspicion of how I expected to havethe road cleared for his workmen.Sheridan moved at the time he had fixed upon.  He met Early at thecrossing of Opequon Creek, a most decisive victory--one which thecountry.  Early had invited this attack himself by his bad generalshipand made the victory easy.  He had sent G. T. Anderson's division eastof the Blue Ridge before I went to Harper's Ferry; and about the time Iarrived there he started other divisions (leaving but two in theircamps) to march to Martinsburg for the purpose destroying the Baltimoreand Ohio Railroad at that point.  Early here learned that I had beenwith Sheridan and, supposing there was some movement on foot, startedback as soon as he got the information.  But his forces were separatedand, as I have said, he was very badly defeated.  He fell back toFisher's Hill, Sheridan following.The valley is narrow at that point, and Early made another stand there,behind works which extended across.  But Sheridan turned both his flanksand again sent him speeding up the valley, following in hot pursuit.The pursuit was continued up the valley to Mount Jackson and New Market.Sheridan captured about eleven hundred prisoners and sixteen guns.  Thehouses which he passed all along the route were found to be filled withEarly's wounded, and the country swarmed with his deserters.  Finally,on the 25th, Early turned from the valley eastward, leaving Sheridan atHarrisonburg in undisputed possession.Now one of the main objects of the expedition began to be accomplished.Sheridan went to work with his command, gathering in the crops, cattle,and everything in the upper part of the valley required by our troops;and especially taking what might be of use to the enemy.  What he couldnot take away he destroyed, so that the enemy would not be invited tocome back there.  I congratulated Sheridan upon his recent great victoryand had a salute of a hundred guns fired in honor of it, the guns beingaimed at the enemy around Petersburg.  I also notified the othercommanders throughout the country, who also fired salutes in honor ofhis victory.I had reason to believe that the administration was a little afraid tohave a decisive battle at that time, for fear it might go against us andhave a bad effect on the November elections. The convention which hadmet and made its nomination of the Democratic candidate for thepresidency had declared the war a failure.  Treason was talked as boldlyin Chicago at that convention as ever been in Charleston.  It was aquestion whether the government would then have had the power to makearrests and punish those who talked treason.  But this decisive victorywas the most effective campaign argument made in the canvass.Sheridan, in his pursuit, got beyond where they could hear from him inWashington, and the President became very much frightened about him.  Hewas afraid that the hot pursuit had been a little like that of GeneralCass was said to have been, in one of our Indian wars, when he was anofficer of army.  Cass was pursuing the Indians so closely that thefirst thing he knew he found himself in front, and the Indians pursuinghim.  The President was afraid that Sheridan had got on the other sideof Early and that Early was in behind him.  He was afraid that Sheridanwas getting so far away that reinforcements would be sent out fromRichmond to enable Early to beat him.  I replied to the President that Ihad taken steps to prevent Lee from sending reinforcements to Early, byattacking the former where he was.On the 28th of September, to retain Lee in his position, I sent Ord withthe 18th corps and Birney with the 10th corps to make an advance onRichmond, to threaten it.  Ord moved with the left wing up to Chaffin'sBluff; Birney with the 10th corps took a road farther north; while Kautzwith the cavalry took the Darby road, still farther to the north.  Theygot across the river by the next morning, and made an effort to surprisethe enemy.  In that, however, they were unsuccessful.The enemy's lines were very strong and very intricate. Stannard'sdivision of the 18th corps with General Burnham's brigade leading, triedan assault against Fort Harrison and captured it with sixteen guns and agood many prisoners. Burnham was killed in the assault.  Colonel Stevenswho succeeded him was badly wounded; and his successor also fell in thesame way.  Some works to the right and left were also carried with theguns in them--six in number--and a few more prisoners.  Birney's troopsto the right captured the enemy's intrenched picket-lines, but wereunsuccessful in their efforts upon the main line.Our troops fortified their new position, bringing Fort Harrison into thenew line and extending it to the river.  This brought us pretty close tothe enemy on the north side of the James, and the two opposing linesmaintained their relative positions to the close of the siege.In the afternoon a further attempt was made to advance, but it failed.Ord fell badly wounded, and had to be relieved; the command devolvedupon General Heckman, and later General Weitzel was assigned to thecommand of the 18th corps.  During the night Lee reinforced his troopsabout Fort Gilmer, which was at the right of Fort Harrison, by eightadditional brigades from Petersburg, and attempted to retake the workswhich we had captured by concentrating ten brigades against them.  Alltheir efforts failed, their attacks being all repulsed with very heavyloss.  In one of these assaults upon us General Stannard, a gallantofficer who was defending Fort Harrison, lost an arm. Our casualtiesduring these operations amounted to 394 killed, I,554 wounded and 324missing.Whilst this was going on General Meade was instructed to keep up anappearance of moving troops to our extreme left.  Parke and Warren werekept with two divisions, each under arms, ready to move leaving theirenclosed batteries manned, with a scattering line on the otherintrenchments.  The object of this was to prevent reinforcements fromgoing to the north side of the river.  Meade was instructed to watch theenemy closely and, if Lee weakened his lines, to make an attack.On the 30th these troops moved out, under Warren, and captured anadvanced intrenched camp at Peeble's farm, driving the enemy back to themain line.  Our troops followed and made an attack in the hope ofcarrying the enemy's main line; but in this they were unsuccessful andlost a large number of men, mostly captured.  The number of killed andwounded was not large.  The next day our troops advanced again andestablished themselves, intrenching a new line about a mile in front ofthe enemy.  This advanced Warren's position on the Weldon Railroad veryconsiderably.Sheridan having driven the enemy out of the valley, and taken theproductions of the valley so that instead of going there for suppliesthe enemy would have to bring his provisions with him if he againentered it, recommended a reduction of his own force, the surplus to besent where it could be of more use.  I approved of his suggestion, andordered him to send Wright's corps back to the James River.  I furtherdirected him to repair the railroad up the Shenandoah Valley towards theadvanced position which we would hold with a small force.  The troopswere to be sent to Washington by the way of Culpeper, in order to watchthe east side of the Blue Ridge, and prevent the enemy from getting intothe rear of Sheridan while he was still doing his work of destruction.The valley was so very important, however, to the Confederate army that,contrary to our expectations, they determined to make one more strike,and save it if possible before the supplies should be all destroyed.Reinforcements were sent therefore to Early, and this before any of ourtroops had been withdrawn. Early prepared to strike Sheridan atHarrisonburg; but the latter had not remained there.On the 6th of October Sheridan commenced retiring down the valley,taking or destroying all the food and forage and driving the cattlebefore him, Early following.  At Fisher's Hill Sheridan turned hiscavalry back on that of Early, which, under the lead of Rosser, waspursuing closely, and routed it most completely, capturing eleven gunsand a large number of prisoners.  Sheridan lost only about sixty men.His cavalry pursued the enemy back some twenty-five miles.  On the 10thof October the march down the valley was again resumed, Early againfollowing.I now ordered Sheridan to halt, and to improve the opportunity ifafforded by the enemy's having been sufficiently weakened, to move backagain and cut the James River Canal and Virginia Central Railroad.  Butthis order had to go through Washington where it was intercepted; andwhen Sheridan received what purported to be a statement of what I wantedhim to do it was something entirely different.  Halleck informedSheridan that it was my wish for him to hold a forward position as abase from which to act against Charlottesville and Gordonsville; that heshould fortify this position and provision it.Sheridan objected to this most decidedly; and I was impelled totelegraph him, on the 14th, as follows:CITY POINT, VA., October 14, 1864.--12.30 P.M.MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Cedar Creek, Va.What I want is for you to threaten the Virginia Central Railroad andcanal in the manner your judgment tells you is best, holding yourselfready to advance, if the enemy draw off their forces. If you make theenemy hold a force equal to your own for the protection of thosethoroughfares, it will accomplish nearly as much as their destruction.If you cannot do this, then the next best thing to do is to send hereall the force you can.  I deem a good cavalry force necessary for youroffensive, as well as defensive operations.  You need not therefore sendhere more than one division of cavalry.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.Sheridan having been summoned to Washington City, started on the 15thleaving Wright in command.  His army was then at Cedar Creek, sometwenty miles south of Winchester.  The next morning while at FrontRoyal, Sheridan received a dispatch from Wright, saying that a dispatchfrom Longstreet to Early had been intercepted.  It directed the latterto be ready to move and to crush Sheridan as soon as he, Longstreet,arrived.  On the receipt of this news Sheridan ordered the cavalry upthe valley to join Wright.On the 18th of October Early was ready to move, and during the nightsucceeded in getting his troops in the rear of our left flank, whichfled precipitately and in great confusion down the valley, losingeighteen pieces of artillery and a thousand or more prisoners.  Theright under General Getty maintained a firm and steady front, fallingback to Middletown where it took a position and made a stand.  Thecavalry went to the rear, seized the roads leading to Winchester andheld them for the use of our troops in falling back, General Wrighthaving ordered a retreat back to that place.Sheridan having left Washington on the 18th, reached Winchester thatnight.  The following morning he started to join his command.  He hadscarcely got out of town, when he met his men returning in panic fromthe front and also heard heavy firing to the south.  He immediatelyordered the cavalry at Winchester to be deployed across the valley tostop the stragglers.  Leaving members of his staff to take care ofWinchester and the public property there, he set out with a small escortdirectly for the scene of battle.  As he met the fugitives he orderedthem to turn back, reminding them that they were going the wrong way.His presence soon restored confidence.  Finding themselves worsefrightened than hurt the men did halt and turn back.  Many of those whohad run ten miles got back in time to redeem their reputation as gallantsoldiers before night.When Sheridan got to the front he found Getty and Custer still holdingtheir ground firmly between the Confederates and our retreating troops.Everything in the rear was now ordered up. Sheridan at once proceeded tointrench his position; and he awaited an assault from the enemy.  Thiswas made with vigor, and was directed principally against Emory's corps,which had sustained the principal loss in the first attack.  By oneo'clock the attack was repulsed.  Early was so badly damaged that heseemed disinclined to make another attack, but went to work to intrenchhimself with a view to holding the position he had already gained.  Hethought, no doubt, that Sheridan would be glad enough to leave himunmolested; but in this he was mistaken.About the middle of the afternoon Sheridan advanced.  He sent hiscavalry by both flanks, and they penetrated to the enemy's rear.  Thecontest was close for a time, but at length the left of the enemy broke,and disintegration along the whole line soon followed.  Early tried torally his men, but they were followed so closely that they had to giveway very quickly every time they attempted to make a stand.  Ourcavalry, having pushed on and got in the rear of the Confederates,captured twenty-four pieces of artillery, besides retaking what had beenlost in the morning.  This victory pretty much closed the campaigning inthe Valley of Virginia.  All the Confederate troops were sent back toRichmond with the exception of one division of infantry and a littlecavalry.  Wright's corps was ordered back to the Army of the Potomac,and two other divisions were withdrawn from the valley.  Early had lostmore men in killed, wounded and captured in the valley than Sheridan hadcommanded from first to last.On more than one occasion in these engagements General R. B. Hayes, whosucceeded me as President of the United States, bore a very honorablepart.  His conduct on the field was marked by conspicuous gallantry aswell as the display of qualities of a higher order than that of merepersonal daring.  This might well have been expected of one who couldwrite at the time he is said to have done so:  "Any officer fit for dutywho at this crisis would abandon his post to electioneer for a seat inCongress, ought to be scalped."  Having entered the army as a Major ofVolunteers at the beginning of the war, General Hayes attained bymeritorious service the rank of Brevet Major-General before its close.On the north side of the James River the enemy attacked Kautz's cavalryon the 7th of October, and drove it back with heavy loss in killed,wounded and prisoners, and the loss of all the artillery.  This wasfollowed up by an attack on our intrenched infantry line, but wasrepulsed with severe slaughter.  On the 13th a reconnoissance was sentout by General Butler, with a view to drive the enemy from some newworks he was constructing, which resulted in heavy loss to us.On the 24th I ordered General Meade to attempt to get possession of theSouth Side Railroad, and for that purpose to advance on the 27th.  Theattempt proved a failure, however, the most advanced of our troops notgetting nearer than within six miles of the point aimed for.  Seeing theimpossibility of its accomplishment I ordered the troops to withdraw,and they were all back in their former positions the next day.Butler, by my directions, also made a demonstration on the north side ofthe James River in order to support this move, by detaining there theConfederate troops who were on that side. He succeeded in this, butfailed of further results by not marching past the enemy's left beforeturning in on the Darby road and by reason of simply coming up againsttheir lines in place.This closed active operations around Richmond for the winter. Of coursethere was frequent skirmishing between pickets, but no serious battlewas fought near either Petersburg or Richmond. It would prolong thiswork to give a detailed account of all that took place from day to dayaround Petersburg and at other parts of my command, and it would notinterest the general reader if given.  All these details can be found bythe military student in a series of books published by the Scribners,Badeau's history of my campaigns, and also in the publications of theWar Department, including both the National and Confederate reports.In the latter part of November General Hancock was relieved from thecommand of the 2d corps by the Secretary of War and ordered toWashington, to organize and command a corps of veteran troops to bedesignated the 1st corps.  It was expected that this would give him alarge command to co-operate with in the spring.  It was my expectation,at the time, that in the final operations Hancock should move either upthe valley, or else east of the Blue Ridge to Lynchburg; the idea beingto make the spring campaign the close of the war.  I expected, withSherman coming up from the South, Meade south of Petersburg and aroundRichmond, and Thomas's command in Tennessee with depots of suppliesestablished in the eastern part of that State, to move from thedirection of Washington or the valley towards Lynchburg.  We would thenhave Lee so surrounded that his supplies would be cut off entirely,making it impossible for him to support his army.General Humphreys, chief-of-staff of the Army of the Potomac, wasassigned to the command of the 2d corps, to succeed Hancock.CHAPTER LIX.THE CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA--SHERMAN'S MARCH TO THE SEA--WAR ANECDOTES--THEMARCH ON SAVANNAH--INVESTMENT OF SAVANNAH--CAPTURE OF SAVANNAH.Let us now return to the operations in the military division of theMississippi, and accompany Sherman in his march to the sea.The possession of Atlanta by us narrowed the territory of the enemy verymaterially and cut off one of his two remaining lines of roads from eastto west.A short time after the fall of Atlanta Mr. Davis visited Palmetto andMacon and made speeches at each place.  He spoke at Palmetto on the 20thof September, and at Macon on the 22d. Inasmuch as he had relievedJohnston and appointed Hood, and Hood had immediately taken theinitiative, it is natural to suppose that Mr. Davis was disappointedwith General Johnston's policy.  My own judgment is that Johnston actedvery wisely:  he husbanded his men and saved as much of his territory ashe could, without fighting decisive battles in which all might be lost.As Sherman advanced, as I have show, his army became spread out, until,if this had been continued, it would have been easy to destroy it indetail.  I know that both Sherman and I were rejoiced when we heard ofthe change.  Hood was unquestionably a brave, gallant soldier and notdestitute of ability; but unfortunately his policy was to fight theenemy wherever he saw him, without thinking much of the consequences ofdefeat.In his speeches Mr. Davis denounced Governor Brown, of Georgia, andGeneral Johnston in unmeasured terms, even insinuating that theirloyalty to the Southern cause was doubtful.  So far as General Johnstonis concerned, I think Davis did him a great injustice in thisparticular.  I had know the general before the war and strongly believedit would be impossible for him to accept a high commission for thepurpose of betraying the cause he had espoused.  There, as I have said,I think that his policy was the best one that could have been pursued bythe whole South--protract the war, which was all that was necessary toenable them to gain recognition in the end.  The North was alreadygrowing weary, as the South evidently was also, but with thisdifference.  In the North the people governed, and could stophostilities whenever they chose to stop supplies.  The South was amilitary camp, controlled absolutely by the government with soldiers toback it, and the war could have been protracted, no matter to whatextent the discontent reached, up to the point of open mutiny of thesoldiers themselves.  Mr. Davis's speeches were frank appeals to thepeople of Georgia and that portion of the South to come to their relief.He tried to assure his frightened hearers that the Yankees were rapidlydigging their own graves; that measures were already being taken to cutthem off from supplies from the North; and that with a force in front,and cut off from the rear, they must soon starve in the midst of ahostile people.  Papers containing reports of these speeches immediatelyreached the Northern States, and they were republished.  Of course, thatcaused no alarm so long as telegraphic communication was kept up withSherman.When Hood was forced to retreat from Atlanta he moved to the south-westand was followed by a portion of Sherman's army.  He soon appeared uponthe railroad in Sherman's rear, and with his whole army began destroyingthe road.  At the same time also the work was begun in Tennessee andKentucky which Mr. Davis had assured his hearers at Palmetto and Maconwould take place.  He ordered Forrest (about the ablest cavalry generalin the South) north for this purpose; and Forrest and Wheeler carriedout their orders with more or less destruction, occasionally picking upa garrison.  Forrest indeed performed the very remarkable feat ofcapturing, with cavalry, two gunboats and a number of transports,something the accomplishment of which is very hard to account for.Hood's army had been weakened by Governor Brown's withdrawing theGeorgia State troops for the purpose of gathering in the season's cropsfor the use of the people and for the use of the army.  This not onlydepleted Hood's forces but it served a most excellent purpose ingathering in supplies of food and forage for the use of our army in itssubsequent march.  Sherman was obliged to push on with his force and gohimself with portions of it hither and thither, until it was clearlydemonstrated to him that with the army he then had it would beimpossible to hold the line from Atlanta back and leave him any forcewhatever with which to take the offensive.  Had that plan been adheredto, very large reinforcements would have been necessary; and Mr. Davis'sprediction of the destruction of the army would have been realized, orelse Sherman would have been obliged to make a successful retreat, whichMr. Davis said in his speeches would prove more disastrous thanNapoleon's retreat from Moscow.These speeches of Mr. Davis were not long in reaching Sherman. He tookadvantage of the information they gave, and made all the preparationpossible for him to make to meet what now became expected, attempts tobreak his communications.  Something else had to be done:  and toSherman's sensible and soldierly mind the idea was not long in dawningupon him, not only that something else had to be done, but what thatsomething else should be.On September 10th I telegraphed Sherman as follows:CITY POINT, VA., Sept. 10, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, Atlanta, Georgia.So soon as your men are sufficiently rested, and preparations can bemade, it is desirable that another campaign should be commenced.  Wewant to keep the enemy constantly pressed to the end of the war.  If wegive him no peace whilst the war lasts, the end cannot be distant.  Nowthat we have all of Mobile Bay that is valuable, I do not know but itwill be the best move to transfer Canby's troops to act upon Savannah,whilst you move on Augusta. I should like to hear from you, however, inthis matter.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.Sherman replied promptly:"If I could be sure of finding provisions and ammunition at Augusta, orColumbus, Georgia, I can march to Milledgeville, and compel Hood to giveup Augusta or Macon, and then turn on the other.  * * * If you canmanage to take the Savannah River as high up as Augusta, or theChattahoochee as far up as Columbus, I can sweep the whole State ofGeorgia."On the 12th I sent a special messenger, one of my own staff, with aletter inviting Sherman's views about the next campaign.CITY POINT, VA., Sept. 12, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL W. T.  SHERMAN, Commanding Mill Division of theMississippi.I send Lieutenant-Colonel Porter, of my staff, with this. Colonel Porterwill explain to you the exact condition of affairs here better than Ican do in the limits of a letter. Although I feel myself strong enoughfor offensive operations, I am holding on quietly to get advantage ofrecruits and convalescents, who are coming forward very rapidly.  Mylines are necessarily very long, extending from Deep Bottom north of theJames across the peninsula formed by the Appomattox and the James, andsouth of the Appomattox to the Weldon Road.  This line is very stronglyfortified, and can be held with comparatively few men, but from itsgreat length takes many in the aggregate.  I propose, when I do move, toextend my left so as to control what is known as the South Side, orLynchburg and Petersburg Road, then if possible to keep the DanvilleRoad cut.  At the same time this move is made, I want to send a force offrom six to ten thousand men against Wilmington.The way I propose to do this is to land the men north of Fort Fisher,and hold that point.  At the same time a large naval fleet will beassembled there, and the iron-clads will run the batteries as they didat Mobile.  This will give us the same control of the harbor ofWilmington that we now have of the harbor of Mobile. What you are to dowith the forces at your command, I do not see. The difficulties ofsupplying your army, except when you are constantly moving, beyond whereyou are, I plainly see.  If it had not been for Price's movements Canbywould have sent twelve thousand more men to Mobile.  From your commandon the Mississippi an equal number could have been taken.  With theseforces my idea would have been to divide them, sending one half toMobile and the other half to Savannah.  You could then move as proposedin your telegram, so as to threaten Macon and Augusta equally.Whichever was abandoned by the enemy you could take and open up a newbase of supplies.  My object now in sending a staff officer is not somuch to suggest operations for you, as to get your views and have plansmatured by the time everything can be got ready.  It will probably bethe 5th of October before any of the plans herein indicated will beexecuted.If you have any promotions to recommend, send the names forward and Iwill approve them. * * *U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.This reached Sherman on September 20th.On the 25th of September Sherman reported to Washington that Hood'stroops were in his rear.  He had provided against this by sending adivision to Chattanooga and a division to Rome, Georgia, which was inthe rear of Hood, supposing that Hood would fall back in the directionfrom which he had come to reach the railroad.  At the same time Shermanand Hood kept up a correspondence relative to the exchange of prisoners,the treatment of citizens, and other matters suitable to be arrangedbetween hostile commanders in the field.  On the 27th of September Itelegraphed Sherman as follows:CITY POINT, VA., September 27, 1864--10.30 A.M.MAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN:I have directed all recruits and new troops from the Western States tobe sent to Nashville, to receive their further orders from you.  * * *U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.On the 29th Sherman sent Thomas back to Chattanooga, and afterwards toNashville, with another division (Morgan's) of the advanced army.Sherman then suggested that, when he was prepared, his movements shouldtake place against Milledgeville and then to Savannah.  His expectationat that time was, to make this movement as soon as he could get up hissupplies.  Hood was moving in his own country, and was moving light sothat he could make two miles to Sherman's one.  He depended upon thecountry to gather his supplies, and so was not affected by delays.As I have said, until this unexpected state of affairs happened, Mobilehad been looked upon as the objective point of Sherman's army.  It hadbeen a favorite move of mine from 1862, when I first suggested to thethen commander-in-chief that the troops in Louisiana, instead offrittering away their time in the trans-Mississippi, should moveagainst Mobile.  I recommended this from time to time until I came intocommand of the army, the last of March 1864.  Having the power in my ownhands, I now ordered the concentration of supplies, stores and troops,in the department of the Gulf about New Orleans, with a view to a moveagainst Mobile, in support of, and in conjunction with, the other armiesoperating in the field.  Before I came into command, these troops hadbeen scattered over the trans-Mississippi department in such a way thatthey could not be, or were not, gotten back in time to take any part inthe original movement; hence the consideration, which had caused Mobileto be selected as the objective point for Sherman's army to find hisnext base of supplies after having cut loose from Atlanta, no longerexisted.General G. M. Dodge, an exceedingly efficient officer, having been badlywounded, had to leave the army about the first of October. He was incommand of two divisions of the 16th corps, consolidated into one.Sherman then divided his army into the right and left wings the rightcommanded by General O. O. Howard and the left by General Slocum.General Dodge's two divisions were assigned, one to each of these wings.Howard's command embraced the 15th and 17th corps, and Slocum's the 14thand 20th corps, commanded by Generals Jeff. C. Davis and A. S. Williams.Generals Logan and Blair commanded the two corps composing the rightwing.  About this time they left to take part in the presidentialelection, which took place that year, leaving their corps to Osterhausand Ransom.  I have no doubt that their leaving was at the earnestsolicitation of the War Department. General Blair got back in time toresume his command and to proceed with it throughout the march to thesea and back to the grand review at Washington.  General Logan did notreturn to his command until after it reached Savannah.Logan felt very much aggrieved at the transfer of General Howard fromthat portion of the Army of the Potomac which was then with the WesternArmy, to the command of the Army of the Tennessee, with which armyGeneral Logan had served from the battle of Belmont to the fall ofAtlanta--having passed successively through all grades from colonelcommanding a regiment to general commanding a brigade, division and armycorps, until upon the death of McPherson the command of the entire Armyof the Tennessee devolved upon him in the midst of a hotly contestedbattle.  He conceived that he had done his full duty as commander inthat engagement; and I can bear testimony, from personal observation,that he had proved himself fully equal to all the lower positions whichhe had occupied as a soldier.  I will not pretend to question the motivewhich actuated Sherman in taking an officer from another army tosupersede General Logan.  I have no doubt, whatever, that he did thisfor what he considered would be to the good of the service, which wasmore important than that the personal feelings of any individual shouldnot be aggrieved; though I doubt whether he had an officer with him whocould have filled the place as Logan would have done.  Differences ofopinion must exist between the best of friends as to policies in war,and of judgment as to men's fitness.  The officer who has the command,however, should be allowed to judge of the fitness of the officers underhim, unless he is very manifestly wrong.Sherman's army, after all the depletions, numbered about sixty thousandeffective men.  All weak men had been left to hold the rear, and thoseremaining were not only well men, but strong and hardy, so that he hadsixty thousand as good soldiers as ever trod the earth; better than anyEuropean soldiers, because they not only worked like a machine but themachine thought. European armies know very little what they are fightingfor, and care less. Included in these sixty thousand troops, there weretwo small divisions of cavalry, numbering altogether about four thousandmen.  Hood had about thirty-five to forty thousand men, independent ofForrest, whose forces were operating in Tennessee and Kentucky, as Mr.Davis had promised they should.  This part of Mr. Davis's military planwas admirable, and promised the best results of anything he could havedone, according to my judgment. I say this because I have criticised hismilitary judgment in the removal of Johnston, and also in theappointment of Hood.  I am aware, however, that there was high feelingexisting at that time between Davis and his subordinate, whom I regardedas one of his ablest lieutenants.On the 5th of October the railroad back from Atlanta was again verybadly broken, Hood having got on the track with his army. Sherman sawafter night, from a high point, the road burning for miles.  The defenceof the railroad by our troops was very gallant, but they could not holdpoints between their intrenched positions against Hood's whole army; infact they made no attempt to do so; but generally the intrenchedpositions were held, as well as important bridges, and store located atthem. Allatoona, for instance, was defended by a small force of menunder the command of General Corse, one of the very able and efficientvolunteer officers produced by the war.  He, with a small force, was cutoff from the remainder of the National army and was attacked with greatvigor by many times his own number. Sherman from his high position couldsee the battle raging, with the Confederate troops between him and hissubordinate.  He sent men, of course, to raise the temporary siege, butthe time that would be necessarily consumed in reaching Corse, would beso great that all occupying the intrenchments might be dead.  Corse wasa man who would never surrender.  From a high position some of Sherman'ssignal corps discovered a signal flag waving from a hole in the blockhouse at Allatoona.  It was from Corse.  He had been shot through theface, but he signalled to his chief a message which left no doubt of hisdetermination to hold his post at all hazards.  It was at this pointprobably, that Sherman first realized that with the forces at hisdisposal, the keeping open of his line of communication with the Northwould be impossible if he expected to retain any force with which tooperate offensively beyond Atlanta.  He proposed, therefore, to destroythe roads back to Chattanooga, when all ready to move, and leave thelatter place garrisoned.  Yet, before abandoning the railroad, it wasnecessary that he should repair damages already done, and hold the roaduntil he could get forward such supplies, ordnance stores and smallrations, as he wanted to carry with him on his proposed march, and toreturn to the north his surplus artillery; his object being to movelight and to have no more artillery than could be used to advantage onthe field.Sherman thought Hood would follow him, though he proposed to prepare forthe contingency of the latter moving the other way while he was movingsouth, by making Thomas strong enough to hold Tennessee and Kentucky.I, myself, was thoroughly satisfied that Hood would go north, as he did.On the 2d of November I telegraphed Sherman authorizing him definitelyto move according to the plan he had proposed:  that is, cutting loosefrom his base, giving up Atlanta and the railroad back to Chattanooga.To strengthen Thomas he sent Stanley (4th corps) back, and also orderedSchofield, commanding the Army of the Ohio, twelve thousand strong, toreport to him.  In addition to this, A. J. Smith, who, with twodivisions of Sherman's army, was in Missouri aiding Rosecrans in drivingthe enemy from that State, was under orders to return to Thomas and,under the most unfavorable circumstances, might be expected to arrivethere long before Hood could reach Nashville.In addition to this, the new levies of troops that were being raised inthe  North-west went to Thomas as rapidly as enrolled and equipped.Thomas, without any of these additions spoken of, had a garrison atChattanooga which had been strengthened by one division and garrisons atBridgeport, Stevenson, Decatur, Murfreesboro, and Florence.  There werealready with him in Nashville ten thousand soldiers in round numbers,and many thousands of employees in the quartermaster's and otherdepartments who could be put in the intrenchments in front of Nashville,for its defence.  Also, Wilson was there with ten thousand dismountedcavalrymen, who were being equipped for the field.  Thomas had at thistime about forty-five thousand men without any of the reinforcementshere above enumerated.  These reinforcements gave him  altogether aboutseventy thousand men, without counting what might be added by the newlevies already spoken of.About this time Beauregard arrived upon the field, not to supersede Hoodin command, but to take general charge over the entire district in whichHood and Sherman were, or might be, operating.  He made the most franticappeals to the citizens for assistance to be rendered in every way:  bysending reinforcements, by destroying supplies on the line of march ofthe invaders, by destroying the bridges over which they would have tocross, and by, in every way, obstructing the roads to their front. Butit was hard to convince the people of the propriety of destroyingsupplies which were so much needed by themselves, and each one hopedthat his own possessions might escape.Hood soon started north, and went into camp near Decatur, Alabama, wherehe remained until the 29th of October, but without making an attack onthe garrison of that place.The Tennessee River was patrolled by gunboats, from Muscle Shoals east;and, also, below the second shoals out to the Ohio River.  These, withthe troops that might be concentrated from the garrisons along the riverat any point where Hood might choose to attempt to cross, made itimpossible for him to cross the Tennessee at any place where it wasnavigable.  But Muscle Shoals is not navigable, and below them again isanother shoal which also obstructs navigation.  Hood therefore moveddown to a point nearly opposite Florence, Alabama, crossed over andremained there for some time, collecting supplies of food, forage andammunition. All of these had to come from a considerable distance south,because the region in which he was then situated was mountainous, withsmall valleys which produced but little, and what they had produced hadlong since been exhausted.  On the 1st of November I suggested toSherman, and also asked his views thereon, the propriety of destroyingHood before he started on his campaign.On the 2d of November, as stated, I approved definitely his making hisproposed campaign through Georgia, leaving Hood behind to the tendermercy of Thomas and the troops in his command.  Sherman fixed the 10thof November as the day of starting.Sherman started on that day to get back to Atlanta, and on the 15th thereal march to the sea commenced.  The right wing, under Howard, and thecavalry went to Jonesboro, Milledgeville, then the capital of Georgia,being Sherman's objective or stopping place on the way to Savannah.  Theleft wing moved to Stone Mountain, along roads much farther east thanthose taken by the right wing. Slocum was in command, and threatenedAugusta as the point to which he was moving, but he was to turn off andmeet the right wing at Milledgeville.Atlanta was destroyed so far as to render it worthless for militarypurposes before starting, Sherman himself remaining over a day tosuperintend the work, and see that it was well done. Sherman's ordersfor this campaign were perfect.  Before starting, he had sent back allsick, disabled and weak men, retaining nothing but the hardy,well-inured soldiers to accompany him on his long march in prospect.His artillery was reduced to sixty-five guns. The ammunition carriedwith them was two hundred rounds for musket and gun.  Small rations weretaken in a small wagon train, which was loaded to its capacity for rapidmovement.  The army was expected to live on the country, and to alwayskeep the wagons full of forage and provisions against a possible delayof a few days.The troops, both of the right and left wings, made most of their advancealong the line of railroads, which they destroyed.  The method adoptedto perform this work, was to burn and destroy all the bridges andculverts, and for a long distance, at places, to tear up the track andbend the rails.  Soldiers to do this rapidly would form a line along oneside of the road with crowbars and poles, place these under the railsand, hoisting all at once, turn over many rods of road at one time.  Theties would then be placed in piles, and the rails, as they wereloosened, would be carried and put across these log heaps.  When asufficient number of rails were placed upon a pile of ties it would beset on fire.  This would heat the rails very much more in the middle,that being over the main part of the fire, than at the ends, so thatthey would naturally bend of their own weight; but the soldiers, toincrease the damage, would take tongs and, one or two men at each end ofthe rail, carry it with force against the nearest tree and twist itaround, thus leaving rails forming bands to ornament the forest trees ofGeorgia. All this work was going on at the same time, there being asufficient number of men detailed for that purpose. Some piled the logsand built the fire; some put the rails upon the fire; while others wouldbend those that were sufficiently heated: so that, by the time the lastbit of road was torn up, that it was designed to destroy at a certainplace, the rails previously taken up were already destroyed.The organization for supplying the army was very complete.  Each brigadefurnished a company to gather supplies of forage and provisions for thecommand to which they belonged.  Strict injunctions were issued againstpillaging, or otherwise unnecessarily annoying the people; buteverything in shape of food for man and forage for beast was taken.  Thesupplies were turned over to the brigade commissary and quartermaster,and were issued by them to their respective commands precisely the sameas if they had been purchased.  The captures consisted largely ofcattle, sheep, poultry, some bacon, cornmeal, often molasses, andoccasionally coffee or other small rations.The skill of these men, called by themselves and the army "bummers," incollecting their loads and getting back to their respective commands,was marvellous.  When they started out in the morning, they were alwayson foot; but scarcely one of them returned in the evening without beingmounted on a horse or mule. These would be turned in for the general useof the army, and the next day these men would start out afoot and returnagain in the evening mounted.Many of the exploits of these men would fall under the head of romance;indeed, I am afraid that in telling some of their experiences, theromance got the better of the truth upon which the story was founded,and that, in the way many of these anecdotes are told, very little ofthe foundation is left.  I suspect that most of them consist chiefly ofthe fiction added to make the stories better.  In one instance it wasreported that a few men of Sherman's army passed a house where theydiscovered some chickens under the dwelling.  They immediately proceededto capture them, to add to the army's supplies.  The lady of the house,who happened to be at home, made piteous appeals to have these spared,saying they were a few she had put away to save by permission of otherparties who had preceded and who had taken all the others that she had.The soldiers seemed moved at her appeal; but looking at the chickensagain they were tempted and one of them replied:  "The rebellion must besuppressed if it takes the last chicken in the Confederacy," andproceeded to appropriate the last one.Another anecdote characteristic of these times has been told. The South,prior to the rebellion, kept bloodhounds to pursue runaway slaves whotook refuge in the neighboring swamps, and also to hunt convicts.Orders were issued to kill all these animals as they were met with.  Onone occasion a soldier picked up a poodle, the favorite pet of itsmistress, and was carrying it off to execution when the lady made astrong appeal to him to spare it. The soldier replied, "Madam, ourorders are to kill every bloodhound."  "But this is not a bloodhound,"said the lady.  "Well, madam, we cannot tell what it will grow into ifwe leave it behind," said the soldier as he went off with it.Notwithstanding these anecdotes, and the necessary hardship they wouldseem to imply, I do not believe there was much unwarrantable pillagingconsidering that we were in the enemy's territory and without anysupplies except such as the country afforded.On the 23d Sherman, with the left wing, reached Milledgeville. The rightwing was not far off:  but proceeded on its way towards Savannahdestroying the road as it went.  The troops at Milledgeville remainedover a day to destroy factories, buildings used for military purposes,etc., before resuming its march.The governor, who had been almost defying Mr. Davis before this, nowfled precipitately, as did the legislature of the State and all theState officers.  The governor, Sherman says, was careful to carry awayeven his garden vegetables, while he left the archives of the State tofall into our hands.  The only military force that was opposed toSherman's forward march was the Georgia militia, a division under thecommand of General G. W. Smith, and a battalion under Harry Wayne.Neither the quality of the forces nor their numbers was sufficient toeven retard the progress of Sherman's army.The people at the South became so frantic at this time at the successfulinvasion of Georgia that they took the cadets from the military collegeand added them to the ranks of the militia.  They even liberated theState convicts under promise from them that they would serve in thearmy.  I have but little doubt that the worst acts that were attributedto Sherman's army were committed by these convicts, and by otherSouthern people who ought to have been under sentence--such people ascould be found in every community, North and South--who took advantageof their country being invaded to commit crime.  They were in but littledanger of detection, or of arrest even if detected.The Southern papers in commenting upon Sherman's movements pictured himas in the most deplorable condition:  stating that his men werestarving, that they were demoralized and wandering about almost withoutobject, aiming only to reach the sea coast and get under the protectionof our navy.  These papers got to the North and had more or less effectupon the minds of the people, causing much distress to all loyal personsparticularly to those who had husbands, sons or brothers with Sherman.Mr. Lincoln seeing these accounts, had a letter written asking me if Icould give him anything that he could say to the loyal people that wouldcomfort them.  I told him there was not the slightest occasion foralarm; that with 60,000 such men as Sherman had with him, such acommanding officer as he was could not be cut off in the open country.He might possibly be prevented from reaching the point he had startedout to reach, but he would get through somewhere and would finally getto his chosen destination:  and even if worst came to worst he couldreturn North.  I heard afterwards of Mr. Lincoln's saying, to those whowould inquire of him as to what he thought about the safety of Sherman'sarmy, that Sherman was all right:  "Grant says they are safe with such ageneral, and that if they cannot get out where they want to, they cancrawl back by the hole they went in at."While at Milledgeville the soldiers met at the State House, organized alegislature, and proceeded to business precisely as if they were thelegislative body belonging to the State of Georgia. The debates wereexciting, and were upon the subject of the situation the South was in atthat time, particularly the State of Georgia.  They went so far as torepeal, after a spirited and acrimonious debate, the ordinance ofsecession.The next day (24th) Sherman continued his march, going by the way ofWaynesboro and Louisville, Millen being the next objective and where thetwo columns (the right and left wings) were to meet.  The left wingmoved to the left of the direct road, and the cavalry still farther offso as to make it look as though Augusta was the point they were aimingfor.  They moved on all the roads they could find leading in thatdirection.  The cavalry was sent to make a rapid march in hope ofsurprising Millen before the Union prisoners could be carried away; butthey failed in this.The distance from Milledgeville to Millen was about one hundred miles.At this point Wheeler, who had been ordered from Tennessee, arrived andswelled the numbers and efficiency of the troops confronting Sherman.Hardee, a native of Georgia, also came, but brought no troops with him.It was intended that he should raise as large an army as possible withwhich to intercept Sherman's march.  He did succeed in raising sometroops, and with these and those under the command of Wheeler and Wayne,had an army sufficient to cause some annoyance but no great detention.Our cavalry and Wheeler's had a pretty severe engagement, in whichWheeler was driven towards Augusta, thus giving the idea that Shermanwas probably making for that point.Millen was reached on the 3d of December, and the march was resumed thefollowing day for Savannah, the final objective. Bragg had now been sentto Augusta with some troops.  Wade Hampton was there also trying toraise cavalry sufficient to destroy Sherman's army.  If he ever raised aforce it was too late to do the work expected of it.  Hardee's wholeforce probably numbered less than ten thousand men.From Millen to Savannah the country is sandy and poor, and affords butvery little forage other than rice straw, which was then growing.  Thisanswered a very good purpose as forage, and the rice grain was anaddition to the soldier's rations.  No further resistance worthy of notewas met with, until within a few miles of Savannah.  This place wasfound to be intrenched and garrisoned.  Sherman proceeded at once on hisarrival to invest the place, and found that the enemy had placedtorpedoes in the ground, which were to explode when stepped on by man orbeast. One of these exploded under an officer's horse, blowing theanimal to pieces and tearing one of the legs of the officer so badlythat it had to be amputated.  Sherman at once ordered his prisoners tothe front, moving them in a compact body in advance, to either explodethe torpedoes or dig them up.  No further explosion took place.On the 10th of December the siege of Savannah commenced. Sherman then,before proceeding any further with operations for the capture of theplace, started with some troops to open communication with our fleet,which he expected to find in the lower harbor or as near by as the fortsof the enemy would permit. In marching to the coast he encountered FortMcAllister, which it was necessary to reduce before the supplies hemight find on shipboard could be made available.  Fort McAllister wassoon captured by an assault made by General Hazen's division.Communication was then established with the fleet.  The capture ofSavannah then only occupied a few days, and involved no great loss oflife.  The garrison, however, as we shall see, was enabled to escape bycrossing the river and moving eastward.When Sherman had opened communication with the fleet he found there asteamer, which I had forwarded to him, carrying the accumulated mailsfor his army, also supplies which I supposed he would be in need of.General J. G. Foster, who commanded all the troops south of NorthCarolina on the Atlantic sea-board, visited General Sherman before hehad opened communication with the fleet, with the view of ascertainingwhat assistance he could be to him.  Foster returned immediately to hisown headquarters at Hilton Head, for the purpose of sending Shermansiege guns, and also if he should find he had them to spare, supplies ofclothing, hard bread, etc., thinking that these articles might not befound outside.  The mail on the steamer which I sent down, had beencollected by Colonel A. H. Markland of the Post Office Department, whowent in charge of it.  On this same vessel I sent an officer of my staff(Lieutenant Dunn) with the following letter to General Sherman:CITY POINT, VA., Dec. 3, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL W. T.  SHERMAN, Commanding Armies near Savannah, Ga.The little information gleaned from the Southern press, indicating nogreat obstacle to your progress, I have directed your mails (which hadbeen previously collected at Baltimore by Colonel Markland, SpecialAgent of the Post Office Department) to be sent as far as the blockadingsquadron off Savannah, to be forwarded to you as soon as heard from onthe coast.Not liking to rejoice before the victory is assured, I abstain fromcongratulating you and those under your command, until bottom has beenstruck.  I have never had a fear, however, for the result.Since you left Atlanta, no very great progress has been made here. Theenemy has been closely watched though, and prevented from detachingagainst you.  I think not one man has gone from here, except some twelveor fifteen hundred dismounted cavalry.  Bragg has gone from Wilmington.I am trying to take advantage of his absence to get possession of thatplace.  Owing to some preparations Admiral Porter and General Butler aremaking to blow up Fort Fisher (which, while hoping for the best, I donot believe a particle in), there is a delay in getting this expeditionoff.  I hope they will be ready to start by the 7th, and that Bragg willnot have started back by that time.In this letter I do not intend to give you anything like directions forfuture action, but will state a general idea I have, and will get yourviews after you have established yourself on the sea-coast. With yourveteran army I hope to get control of the only two through routes fromeast to west possessed by the enemy before the fall of Atlanta.  Thecondition will be filled by holding Savannah and Augusta, or by holdingany other port to the east of Savannah and Branchville.  If Wilmingtonfalls, a force from there can co-operate with you.Thomas has got back into the defences of Nashville, with Hood close uponhim.  Decatur has been abandoned, and so have all the roads except themain one leading to Chattanooga.  Part of this falling back wasundoubtedly necessary and all of it may have been.  It did not look so,however, to me.  In my opinion, Thomas far outnumbers Hood in infantry.In cavalry, Hood has the advantage in morale and numbers.  I hope yetthat Hood will be badly crippled if not destroyed.  The general news youwill learn from the papers better than I could give it.After all becomes quiet, and roads become so bad up here that there islikely to be a week or two when nothing can be done, I will run down thecoast to see you.  If you desire it, I will ask Mrs. Sherman to go withme.Yours truly, U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-GeneralI quote this letter because it gives the reader a full knowledge of theevents of that period.Sherman now (the 15th) returned to Savannah to complete its investmentand insure the surrender of the garrison.  The country about Savannah islow and marshy, and the city was well intrenched from the river above tothe river below; and assaults could not be made except along acomparatively narrow causeway. For this reason assaults must haveresulted in serious destruction of life to the Union troops, with thechance of failing altogether. Sherman therefore decided upon a completeinvestment of the place.  When he believed this investment completed, hesummoned the garrison to surrender.  General Hardee, who was in command,replied in substance that the condition of affairs was not such asSherman had described.  He said he was in full communication with hisdepartment and was receiving supplies constantly.Hardee, however, was cut off entirely from all communication with thewest side of the river, and by the river itself to the north and south.On the South Carolina side the country was all rice fields, throughwhich it would have been impossible to bring supplies so that Hardee hadno possible communication with the outside world except by a dilapidatedplank road starting from the west bank of the river.  Sherman, receivingthis reply, proceeded in person to a point on the coast, where GeneralFoster had troops stationed under General Hatch, for the purpose ofmaking arrangements with the latter officer to go through by one of thenumerous channels running inland along that part of the coast of SouthCarolina, to the plank road which General Hardee still possessed, andthus to cut him off from the last means he had of getting supplies, ifnot of communication.While arranging for this movement, and before the attempt to execute theplan had been commenced, Sherman received information through one of hisstaff officers that the enemy had evacuated Savannah the night before.This was the night of the 21st of December.  Before evacuating the placeHardee had blown up the navy yard.  Some iron-clads had been destroyed,as well as other property that might have been valuable to us; but heleft an immense amount of stores untouched, consisting of cotton,railroad cars, workshops, numerous pieces of artillery, and severalthousand stands of small arms.A little incident occurred, soon after the fall of Savannah, whichSherman relates in his Memoirs, and which is worthy of repetition.Savannah was one of the points where blockade runners entered. Shortlyafter the city fell into our possession, a blockade runner came sailingup serenely, not doubting but the Confederates were still in possession.It was not molested, and the captain did not find out his mistake untilhe had tied up and gone to the Custom House, where he found a newoccupant of the building, and made a less profitable disposition of hisvessel and cargo than he had expected.As there was some discussion as to the authorship of Sherman's march tothe sea, by critics of his book when it appeared before the public, Iwant to state here that no question upon that subject was ever raisedbetween General Sherman and myself. Circumstances made the plan on whichSherman expected to act impracticable, as as commander of the forces henecessarily had to devise a new on which would give more promise ofsuccess: consequently he recommended the destruction of the railroadback to Chattanooga, and that he should be authorized then to move, ashe did, from Atlanta forward.  His suggestions were finally approved,although they did not immediately find favor in Washington.  Even whenit came to the time of starting, the greatest apprehension, as to thepropriety of the campaign he was about commence, filled the mind of thePresident, induced no doubt by his advisers.  This went so far as tomove the President to ask me to suspend Sherman's march for a day or twountil I could think the matter over.  My recollection is, though I findno record to show it, that out of deference to the President's wish Idid send a dispatch to Sherman asking him to wait a day or two, or elsethe connections between us were already cut so that I could not do so.However this may be, the question of who devised the plan of march fromAtlanta to Savannah is easily answered:  it was clearly Sherman, and tohim also belongs the credit of its brilliant execution.  It was hardlypossible that any one else than those on the spot could have devised anew plan of campaign to supersede one that did not promise success.(*40)I was in favor of Sherman's plan from the time it was first submitted tome.  My chief of staff, however, was very bitterly opposed to it and, asI learned subsequently, finding that he could not move me, he appealedto the authorities at Washington to stop it.CHAPTER LX.THE BATTLE OF FRANKLIN--THE BATTLE OF NASHVILLE.As we have seen, Hood succeeded in crossing the Tennessee River betweenMuscle Shoals and the lower shoals at the end of October, 1864.  Thomassent Schofield with the 4th and 23d corps, together with three brigadesof Wilson's cavalry to Pulaski to watch him.  On the 17th of NovemberHood started and moved in such a manner as to avoid Schofield, therebyturning his position.  Hood had with him three infantry corps, commandedrespectively by Stephen D. Lee, Stewart and Cheatham.  These, with hiscavalry, numbered about forty-five thousand men. Schofield had, of allarms, about thirty thousand.  Thomas's orders were, therefore, forSchofield to watch the movements of the enemy, but not to fight a battleif he could avoid it; but to fall back in case of an advance onNashville, and to fight the enemy, as he fell back, so as to retard theenemy's movements until he could be reinforced by Thomas himself.  Assoon as Schofield saw this movement of Hood's, he sent his trains to therear, but did not fall back himself until the 21st, and then only toColumbia.  At Columbia there was a slight skirmish but no battle.  Fromthis place Schofield then retreated to Franklin.  He had sent his wagonsin advance, and Stanley had gone with them with two divisions to protectthem.  Cheatham's corps of Hood's army pursued the wagon train and wentinto camp at Spring Hill, for the night of the 29th.Schofield retreating from Columbia on the 29th, passed Spring Hill,where Cheatham was bivouacked, during the night without molestation,though within half a mile of where the Confederates were encamped.  Onthe morning of the 30th he had arrived at Franklin.Hood followed closely and reached Franklin in time to make an attack thesame day.  The fight was very desperate and sanguinary.  The Confederategenerals led their men in the repeated charges, and the loss among themwas of unusual proportions.  This fighting continued with great severityuntil long after the night closed in, when the Confederates drew off.General Stanley, who commanded two divisions of the Union troops, andwhose troops bore the brunt of the battle, was wounded in the fight, butmaintained his position.The enemy's loss at Franklin, according to Thomas's report, was 1,750buried upon the field by our troops, 3,800 in the hospital, and 702prisoners besides.  Schofield's loss, as officially reported, was 189killed, 1,033 wounded, and 1,104 captured and missing.Thomas made no effort to reinforce Schofield at Franklin, as it seemedto me at the time he should have done, and fight out the battle there.He simply ordered Schofield to continue his retreat to Nashville, whichthe latter did during that night and the next day.Thomas, in the meantime, was making his preparations to receive Hood.The road to Chattanooga was still well guarded with strong garrisons atMurfreesboro, Stevenson, Bridgeport and Chattanooga.  Thomas hadpreviously given up Decatur and had been reinforced by A. J. Smith's twodivisions just returned from Missouri.  He also had Steedman's divisionand R. S. Granger's, which he had drawn from the front.  Hisquartermaster's men, about ten thousand in number, had been organizedand armed under the command of the chief quartermaster, General J. L.Donaldson, and placed in the fortifications under the generalsupervision of General Z. B. Tower, of the United States Engineers.Hood was allowed to move upon Nashville, and to invest that place almostwithout interference.  Thomas was strongly fortified in his position, sothat he would have been safe against the attack of Hood.  He had troopsenough even to annihilate him in the open field.  To me his delay wasunaccountable--sitting there and permitting himself to be invested, sothat, in the end, to raise the siege he would have to fight the enemystrongly posted behind fortifications.  It is true the weather was verybad.  The rain was falling and freezing as it fell, so that the groundwas covered with a sheet of ice, that made it very difficult to move.But I was afraid that the enemy would find means of moving, elude Thomasand manage to get north of the Cumberland River.  If he did this, Iapprehended most serious results from the campaign in the North, and wasafraid we might even have to send troops from the East to head him offif he got there, General Thomas's movements being always so deliberateand so slow, though effective in defence.I consequently urged Thomas in frequent dispatches sent from CityPoint(*41) to make the attack at once.  The country was alarmed, theadministration was alarmed, and I was alarmed lest the very thing wouldtake place which I have just described that is, Hood would get north.It was all without avail further than to elicit dispatches from Thomassaying that he was getting ready to move as soon as he could, that hewas making preparations, etc.  At last I had to say to General Thomasthat I should be obliged to remove him unless he acted promptly.  Hereplied that he was very sorry, but he would move as soon as he could.General Logan happening to visit City Point about that time, and knowinghim as a prompt, gallant and efficient officer, I gave him an order toproceed to Nashville to relieve Thomas.  I directed him, however, not todeliver the order or publish it until he reached there, and if Thomashad moved, then not to deliver it at all, but communicate with me bytelegraph.  After Logan started, in thinking over the situation, Ibecame restless, and concluded to go myself.  I went as far asWashington City, when a dispatch was received from General Thomasannouncing his readiness at last to move, and designating the time ofhis movement.  I concluded to wait until that time. He did move, and wassuccessful from the start.  This was on the 15th of December.  GeneralLogan was at Louisville at the time this movement was made, andtelegraphed the fact to Washington, and proceeded no farther himself.The battle during the 15th was severe, but favorable to the Uniontroops, and continued until night closed in upon the combat.  The nextday the battle was renewed.  After a successful assault upon Hood's menin their intrenchments the enemy fled in disorder, routed and broken,leaving their dead, their artillery and small arms in great numbers onthe field, besides the wounded that were captured.  Our cavalry hadfought on foot as infantry, and had not their horses with them; so thatthey were not ready to join in the pursuit the moment the enemyretreated.  They sent back, however, for their horses, and endeavored toget to Franklin ahead of Hood's broken army by the Granny White Road,but too much time was consumed in getting started.  They had got but afew miles beyond the scene of the battle when they found the enemy'scavalry dismounted and behind intrenchments covering the road on whichthey were advancing. Here another battle ensued, our men dismounting andfighting on foot, in which the Confederates were again routed and drivenin great disorder.  Our cavalry then went into bivouac, and renewed thepursuit on the following morning.  They were too late.  The enemyalready had possession of Franklin, and was beyond them. It now became achase in which the Confederates had the lead.Our troops continued the pursuit to within a few miles of Columbia,where they found the rebels had destroyed the railroad bridge as well asall other bridges over Duck River.  The heavy rains of a few days beforehad swelled the stream into a mad torrent, impassable except on bridges.Unfortunately, either through a mistake in the wording of the order orotherwise, the pontoon bridge which was to have been sent by rail out toFranklin, to be taken thence with the pursuing column, had gone towardChattanooga.  There was, consequently, a delay of some four days inbuilding bridges out of the remains of the old railroad bridge.  Ofcourse Hood got such a start in this time that farther pursuit wasuseless, although it was continued for some distance, but without comingupon him again.CHAPTER LXI.EXPEDITION AGAINST FORT FISHER--ATTACK ON THE FORT--FAILURE OF THEEXPEDITION--SECOND EXPEDITION AGAINST THE FORT--CAPTURE OF FORT FISHER.Up to January, 1865, the enemy occupied Fort Fisher, at the mouth ofCape Fear River and below the City of Wilmington.  This port was ofimmense importance to the Confederates, because it formed theirprincipal inlet for blockade runners by means of which they brought infrom abroad such supplies and munitions of war as they could not produceat home.  It was equally important to us to get possession of it, notonly because it was desirable to cut off their supplies so as to insurea speedy termination of the war, but also because foreign governments,particularly the British Government, were constantly threatening thatunless ours could maintain the blockade of that coast they should ceaseto recognize any blockade.  For these reasons I determined, with theconcurrence of the Navy Department, in December, to send an expeditionagainst Fort Fisher for the purpose of capturing it.To show the difficulty experienced in maintaining the blockade, I willmention a circumstance that took place at Fort Fisher after its fall.Two English blockade runners came in at night.  Their commanders, notsupposing the fort had fallen, worked their way through all our fleetand got into the river unobserved.  They then signalled the fort,announcing their arrival.  There was a colored man in the fort who hadbeen there before and who understood these signals.  He informed GeneralTerry what reply he should make to have them come in, and Terry did ashe advised.  The vessels came in, their officers entirely unconsciousthat they were falling into the hands of the Union forces.  Even afterthey were brought in to the fort they were entertained in conversationfor some little time before suspecting that the Union troops wereoccupying the fort.  They were finally informed that their vessels andcargoes were prizes.I selected General Weitzel, of the Army of the James, to go with theexpedition, but gave instructions through General Butler.  He commandedthe department within whose geographical limits Fort Fisher wassituated, as well as Beaufort and other points on that coast held by ourtroops; he was, therefore, entitled to the right of fitting out theexpedition against Fort Fisher.General Butler conceived the idea that if a steamer loaded heavily withpowder could be run up to near the shore under the fort and exploded, itwould create great havoc and make the capture an easy matter.  AdmiralPorter, who was to command the naval squadron, seemed to fall in withthe idea, and it was not disapproved of in Washington; the navy wastherefore given the task of preparing the steamer for this purpose.  Ihad no confidence in the success of the scheme, and so expressed myself;but as no serious harm could come of the experiment, and the authoritiesat Washington seemed desirous to have it tried, I permitted it.  Thesteamer was sent to Beaufort, North Carolina, and was there loaded withpowder and prepared for the part she was to play in the reduction ofFort Fisher.General Butler chose to go in command of the expedition himself, and wasall ready to sail by the 9th of December (1864).  Very heavy stormsprevailed, however, at that time along that part of the sea-coast, andprevented him from getting off until the 13th or 14th.  His advancearrived off Fort Fisher on the 15th.  The naval force had been alreadyassembled, or was assembling, but they were obliged to run into Beaufortfor munitions, coal, etc.; then, too, the powder-boat was not yet fullyprepared. The fleet was ready to proceed on the 18th; but Butler, whohad remained outside from the 15th up to that time, now found himselfout of coal, fresh water, etc., and had to put into Beaufort toreplenish.  Another storm overtook him, and several days more were lostbefore the army and navy were both ready at the same time to co-operate.On the night of the 23d the powder-boat was towed in by a gunboat asnear to the fort as it was safe to run.  She was then propelled by herown machinery to within about five hundred yards of the shore.  Therethe clockwork, which was to explode her within a certain length of time,was set and she was abandoned.  Everybody left, and even the vessels putout to sea to prevent the effect of the explosion upon them.  At twoo'clock in the morning the explosion took place--and produced no moreeffect on the fort, or anything else on land, than the bursting of aboiler anywhere on the Atlantic Ocean would have done.  Indeed when thetroops in Fort Fisher heard the explosion they supposed it was thebursting of a boiler in one of the Yankee gunboats.Fort Fisher was situated upon a low, flat peninsula north of Cape FearRiver.  The soil is sandy.  Back a little the peninsula is very heavilywooded, and covered with fresh-water swamps.  The fort ran across thispeninsula, about five hundred yards in width, and extended along the seacoast about thirteen hundred yards.  The fort had an armament of 21 gunsand 3 mortars on the land side, and 24 guns on the sea front.  At thattime it was only garrisoned by four companies of infantry, one lightbattery and the gunners at the heavy guns less than seven hundred menwith a reserve of less than a thousand men five miles up the peninsula.General Whiting of the Confederate army was in command, and GeneralBragg was in command of the force at Wilmington.  Both commenced callingfor reinforcements the moment they saw our troops landing.  The Governorof North Carolina called for everybody who could stand behind a parapetand shoot a gun, to join them.  In this way they got two or threehundred additional men into Fort Fisher; and Hoke's division, five orsix thousand strong, was sent down from Richmond.  A few of these troopsarrived the very day that Butler was ready to advance.On the 24th the fleet formed for an attack in arcs of concentriccircles, their heavy iron-clads going in very close range, being nearestthe shore, and leaving intervals or spaces so that the outer vesselscould fire between them.  Porter was thus enabled to throw one hundredand fifteen shells per minute.  The damage done to the fort by theseshells was very slight, only two or three cannon being disabled in thefort.  But the firing silenced all the guns by making it too hot for themen to maintain their positions about them and compelling them to seekshelter in the bomb-proofs.On the next day part of Butler's troops under General Adelbert Ameseffected a landing out of range of the fort without difficulty.  Thiswas accomplished under the protection of gunboats sent for the purpose,and under cover of a renewed attack upon the fort by the fleet.  Theyformed a line across the peninsula and advanced, part going north andpart toward the fort, covering themselves as they did so.  Curtis pushedforward and came near to Fort Fisher, capturing the small garrison atwhat was called the Flag Pond Battery.  Weitzel accompanied him towithin a half a mile of the works.  Here he saw that the fort had notbeen injured, and so reported to Butler, advising against an assault.Ames, who had gone north in his advance, captured 228 of the reserves.These prisoners reported to Butler that sixteen hundred of Hoke'sdivision of six thousand from Richmond had already arrived and the restwould soon be in his rear.Upon these reports Butler determined to withdraw his troops from thepeninsula and return to the fleet.  At that time there had not been aman on our side injured except by one of the shells from the fleet.Curtis had got within a few yards of the works.  Some of his men hadsnatched a flag from the parapet of the fort, and others had taken ahorse from the inside of the stockade.  At night Butler informed Porterof his withdrawal, giving the reasons above stated, and announced hispurpose as soon as his men could embark to start for Hampton Roads.Porter represented to him that he had sent to Beaufort for moreammunition.  He could fire much faster than he had been doing, and wouldkeep the enemy from showing himself until our men were within twentyyards of the fort, and he begged that Butler would leave some bravefellows like those who had snatched the flag from the parapet and takenthe horse from the fort.Butler was unchangeable.  He got all his troops aboard, except Curtis'sbrigade, and started back.  In doing this, Butler made a fearfulmistake.  My instructions to him, or to the officer who went in commandof the expedition, were explicit in the statement that to effect alanding would be of itself a great victory, and if one should beeffected, the foothold must not be relinquished; on the contrary, aregular siege of the fort must be commenced and, to guard againstinterference by reason of storms, supplies of provisions must be laid inas soon as they could be got on shore.  But General Butler seems to havelost sight of this part of his instructions, and was back at Fort Monroeon the 28th.I telegraphed to the President as follows:CITY POINT, VA., Dec. 28, 1864.--8.30 P.M.The Wilmington expedition has proven a gross and culpable failure.  Manyof the troops are back here.  Delays and free talk of the object of theexpedition enabled the enemy to move troops to Wilmington to defeat it.After the expedition sailed from Fort Monroe, three days of fine weatherwere squandered, during which the enemy was without a force to protecthimself. Who is to blame will, I hope, be known.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.Porter sent dispatches to the Navy Department in which he complainedbitterly of having been abandoned by the army just when the fort wasnearly in our possession, and begged that our troops might be sent backagain to cooperate, but with a different commander.  As soon as I heardthis I sent a messenger to Porter with a letter asking him to hold on.I assured him that I fully sympathized with him in his disappointment,and that I would send the same troops back with a different commander,with some reinforcements to offset those which the enemy had received.I told him it would take some little time to get transportation for theadditional troops; but as soon as it could be had the men should be ontheir way to him, and there would be no delay on my part.  I selected A.H. Terry to command.It was the 6th of January before the transports could be got ready andthe troops aboard.  They sailed from Fortress Monroe on that day.  Theobject and destination of the second expedition were at the time kept asecret to all except a few in the Navy Department and in the army towhom it was necessary to impart the information.  General Terry had notthe slightest idea of where he was going or what he was to do.  Hesimply knew that he was going to sea and that he had his orders withhim, which were to be opened when out at sea.He was instructed to communicate freely with Porter and have entireharmony between army and navy, because the work before them wouldrequire the best efforts of both arms of service. They arrived offBeaufort on the 8th. A heavy storm, however, prevented a landing atForth Fisher until the 13th.  The navy prepared itself for attack aboutas before, and the same time assisted the army in landing, this timefive miles away.  Only iron-clads fired at first; the object being todraw the fire of the enemy's guns so as to ascertain their positions.This object being accomplished, they then let in their shots thick andfast.  Very soon the guns were all silenced, and the fort showed evidentsigns of being much injured.Terry deployed his men across the peninsula as had been done before, andat two o'clock on the following morning was up within two miles of thefort with a respectable abatis in front of his line. His artillery wasall landed on that day, the 14th.  Again Curtis's brigade of Ame'sdivision had the lead. By noon they had carried an unfinished work lessthan a half mile from the fort, and turned it so as to face the otherway.Terry now saw Porter and arranged for an assault on the following day.The two commanders arranged their signals so that they could communicatewith each other from time to time as they might have occasion.  At daylight the fleet commenced its firing.  The time agreed upon for theassault was the middle of the afternoon, and Ames who commanded theassaulting column moved at 3.30.  Porter landed a force of sailors andmarines to move against the sea-front in co-operation with Ames'sassault.  They were under Commander Breese of the navy.  These sailorsand marines had worked their way up to within a couple of hundred yardsof the fort before the assault.  The signal was given and the assaultwas made; but the poor sailors and marines were repulsed and very badlyhandled by the enemy, losing 280 killed and wounded out of their number.Curtis's brigade charged successfully though met by a heavy fire, someof the men having to wade through the swamp up to their waists to reachthe fort.  Many were wounded, of course, and some killed; but they soonreached the palisades.  These they cut away, and pushed on through.  Theother troops then came up, Pennypacker's following Curtis, and Bell, whocommanded the 3d brigade of Ames's division, following Pennypacker.  Butthe fort was not yet captured though the parapet was gained.The works were very extensive.  The large parapet around the work wouldhave been but very little protection to those inside except when theywere close up under it.  Traverses had, therefore, been run until reallythe work was a succession of small forts enclosed by a large one.  Therebels made a desperate effort to hold the fort, and had to be drivenfrom these traverses one by one.  The fight continued till long afternight.  Our troops gained first one traverse and then another, and by 10o'clock at night the place was carried.  During this engagement thesailors, who had been repulsed in their assault on the bastion, renderedthe best service they could by reinforcing Terry's northern line--thusenabling him to send a detachment to the assistance of Ames.  The fleetkept up a continuous fire upon that part of the fort which was stilloccupied by the enemy.  By means of signals they could be informed whereto direct their shots.During the succeeding nights the enemy blew up Fort Caswell on theopposite side of Cape Fear River, and abandoned two extensive works onSmith's Island in the river.Our captures in all amounted to 169 guns, besides small-arms, with fullsupplies of ammunition, and 2,083 prisoners.  In addition to these,there were about 700 dead and wounded left there.  We had lost 110killed and 536 wounded.In this assault on Fort Fisher, Bell, one of the brigade commanders, waskilled, and two, Curtis and Pennypacker, were badly wounded.Secretary Stanton, who was on his way back from Savannah, arrived offFort Fisher soon after it fell.  When he heard the good news he promotedall the officers of any considerable rank for their conspicuousgallantry.  Terry had been nominated for major-general, but had not beenconfirmed.  This confirmed him; and soon after I recommended him for abrigadier-generalcy in the regular army, and it was given to him forthis victory.CHAPTER LXII.SHERMAN'S MARCH NORTH--SHERIDAN ORDERED TO LYNCHBURG--CANBY ORDERED TOMOVE AGAINST MOBILE--MOVEMENTS OF SCHOFIELD AND THOMAS--CAPTURE OFCOLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA--SHERMAN IN THE CAROLINAS.When news of Sherman being in possession of Savannah reached the North,distinguished statesmen and visitors began to pour in to see him.  Amongothers who went was the Secretary of War, who seemed much pleased at theresult of his campaign.  Mr. Draper, the collector of customs of NewYork, who was with Mr. Stanton's party, was put in charge of the publicproperty that had been abandoned and captured.  Savannah was then turnedover to General Foster's command to hold, so that Sherman might have hisown entire army free to operate as might be decided upon in the future.I sent the chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac (General Barnard)with letters to General Sherman.  He remained some time with thegeneral, and when he returned brought back letters, one of whichcontained suggestions from Sherman as to what ought to be done inco-operation with him, when he should have started upon his marchnorthward.I must not neglect to state here the fact that I had no idea originallyof having Sherman march from Savannah to Richmond, or even to NorthCarolina.  The season was bad, the roads impassable for anything exceptsuch an army as he had, and I should not have thought of ordering such amove.  I had, therefore, made preparations to collect transports tocarry Sherman and his army around to the James River by water, and soinformed him.  On receiving this letter he went to work immediately toprepare for the move, but seeing that it would require a long time tocollect the transports, he suggested the idea then of marching up norththrough the Carolinas.  I was only too happy to approve this; for ifsuccessful, it promised every advantage.  His march through Georgia hadthoroughly destroyed all lines of transportation in that State, and hadcompletely cut the enemy off from all sources of supply to the west ofit.  If North and South Carolina were rendered helpless so far ascapacity for feeding Lee's army was concerned, the Confederate garrisonat Richmond would be reduced in territory, from which to draw supplies,to very narrow limits in the State of Virginia; and, although thatsection of the country was fertile, it was already well exhausted ofboth forage and food.  I approved Sherman's suggestion therefore atonce.The work of preparation was tedious, because supplies, to load thewagons for the march, had to be brought from a long distance.  Shermanwould now have to march through a country furnishing fewer provisionsthan that he had previously been operating in during his march to thesea.  Besides, he was confronting, or marching toward, a force of theenemy vastly superior to any his troops had encountered on theirprevious march; and the territory through which he had to pass had nowbecome of such vast importance to the very existence of the Confederatearmy, that the most desperate efforts were to be expected in order tosave it.Sherman, therefore, while collecting the necessary supplies to startwith, made arrangements with Admiral Dahlgren, who commanded that partof the navy on the South Carolina and Georgia coast, and General Foster,commanding the troops, to take positions, and hold a few points on thesea coast, which he (Sherman) designated, in the neighborhood ofCharleston.This provision was made to enable him to fall back upon the sea coast,in case he should encounter a force sufficient to stop his onwardprogress.  He also wrote me a letter, making suggestions as to what hewould like to have done in support of his movement farther north.  Thisletter was brought to City Point by General Barnard at a time when Ihappened to be going to Washington City, where I arrived on the 21st ofJanuary.  I cannot tell the provision I had already made to co-operatewith Sherman, in anticipation of his expected movement, better than bygiving my reply to this letter.HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 21,1865.MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN, Commanding Mill Div. of the Mississippi.GENERAL:--Your letters brought by General Barnard were received at CityPoint, and read with interest.  Not having them with me, however, Icannot say that in this I will be able to satisfy you on all points ofrecommendation.  As I arrived here at one P.M., and must leave at sixP.M., having in the meantime spent over three hours with the Secretaryand General Halleck, I must be brief.  Before your last request to haveThomas make a campaign into the heart of Alabama, I had orderedSchofield to Annapolis, Md., with his corps.  The advance (six thousand)will reach the seaboard by the 23d, the remainder following as rapidlyas railroad transportation can be procured from Cincinnati.  The corpsnumbers over twenty-one thousand men.  I was induced to do this becauseI did not believe Thomas could possibly be got off before spring.  Hispursuit of Hood indicated a sluggishness that satisfied me that he wouldnever do to conduct one of your campaigns.  The command of the advanceof the pursuit was left to subordinates, whilst Thomas followed farbehind.  When Hood had crossed the Tennessee, and those in pursuit hadreached it, Thomas had not much more than half crossed the State, fromwhence he returned to Nashville to take steamer for Eastport. He ispossessed of excellent judgment, great coolness and honesty, but he isnot good on a pursuit.  He also reported his troops fagged, and that itwas necessary to equip up.  This report and a determination to give theenemy no rest determined me to use his surplus troops elsewhere.Thomas is still left with a sufficient force surplus to go to Selmaunder an energetic leader.  He has been telegraphed to, to know whetherhe could go, and, if so, which of the several routes he would select.No reply is yet received.  Canby has been ordered to act offensivelyfrom the sea-coast to the interior, towards Montgomery and Selma.Thomas's forces will move from the north at an early day, or some of histroops will be sent to Canby.  Without further reinforcements Canby willhave a moving column of twenty thousand men.Fort Fisher, you are aware, has been captured.  We have a force there ofeight thousand effective.  At New Bern about half the number.  It isrumored, through deserters, that Wilmington also has fallen.  I aminclined to believe the rumor, because on the 17th we knew the enemywere blowing up their works about Fort Caswell, and that on the 18thTerry moved on Wilmington.If Wilmington is captured, Schofield will go there.  If not, he will besent to New Bern.  In either event, all the surplus forces at the twopoints will move to the interior toward Goldsboro' in co-operation withyour movements.  From either point, railroad communications can be runout, there being here abundance of rolling-stock suited to the gauge ofthose roads.There have been about sixteen thousand men sent from Lee's army south.Of these, you will have fourteen thousand against you, if Wilmington isnot held by the enemy, casualties at Fort Fisher having overtaken abouttwo thousand.All these troops are subject to your orders as you come in communicationwith them.  They will be so instructed.  From about Richmond I willwatch Lee closely, and if he detaches much more, or attempts toevacuate, will pitch in.  In the meantime, should you be brought to ahalt anywhere, I can send two corps of thirty thousand effective men toyour support, from the troops about Richmond.To resume:  Canby is ordered to operate to the interior from the Gulf.A. J. Smith may go from the north, but I think it doubtful.  A force oftwenty-eight or thirty thousand will co-operate with you from New Bernor Wilmington, or both.  You can call for reinforcements.This will be handed you by Captain Hudson, of my staff, who will returnwith any message you may have for me.  If there is anything I can do foryou in the way of having supplies on ship-board, at any point on thesea-coast, ready for you, let me know it.Yours truly, U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.I had written on the 18th of January to General Sherman, giving him thenews of the battle of Nashville.  He was much pleased at the result,although, like myself, he had been very much disappointed at Thomas forpermitting Hood to cross the Tennessee River and nearly the whole Stateof Tennessee, and come to Nashville to be attacked there.  He, however,as I had done, sent Thomas a warm congratulatory letter.On the 10th of January, 1865, the resolutions of thanks to Sherman andhis army passed by Congress were approved.Sherman, after the capture, at once had the debris cleared up,commencing the work by removing the piling and torpedoes from the river,and taking up all obstructions.  He had then intrenched the city, sothat it could be held by a small garrison.  By the middle of January allhis work was done, except the accumulation of supplies to commence hismovement with.He proposed to move in two columns, one from Savannah, going along bythe river of the same name, and the other by roads farther east,threatening Charleston.  He commenced the advance by moving his rightwing to Beaufort, South Carolina, then to Pocotaligo by water.  Thiscolumn, in moving north, threatened Charleston, and, indeed, it was notdetermined at first that they would have a force visit Charleston.South Carolina had done so much to prepare the public mind of the Southfor secession, and had been so active in precipitating the decision ofthe question before the South was fully prepared to meet it, that therewas, at that time, a feeling throughout the North and also largelyentertained by people of the South, that the State of South Carolina,and Charleston, the hot-bed of secession in particular, ought to have aheavy hand laid upon them.  In fact, nothing but the decisive resultsthat followed, deterred the radical portion of the people fromcondemning the movement, because Charleston had been left out.  To passinto the interior would, however, be to insure the evacuation of thecity, and its possession by the navy and Foster's troops.  It is sosituated between two formidable rivers that a small garrison could haveheld it against all odds as long as their supplies would hold out.Sherman therefore passed it by.By the first of February all preparations were completed for the finalmarch, Columbia, South Carolina, being the first objective;Fayetteville, North Carolina, the second; and Goldsboro, orneighborhood, the final one, unless something further should bedetermined upon.  The right wing went from Pocotaligo, and the left fromabout Hardeeville on the Savannah River, both columns taking a prettydirect route for Columbia.  The cavalry, however, were to threatenCharleston on the right, and Augusta on the left.On the 15th of January Fort Fisher had fallen, news of which Sherman hadreceived before starting out on his march.  We already had New Bern andhad soon Wilmington, whose fall followed that of Fort Fisher; as didother points on the sea coast, where the National troops were now inreadiness to co-operate with Sherman's advance when he had passedFayetteville.On the 18th of January I ordered Canby, in command at New Orleans, tomove against Mobile, Montgomery and Selma, Alabama, for the purpose ofdestroying roads, machine shops, etc.  On the 8th of February I orderedSheridan, who was in the Valley of Virginia, to push forward as soon asthe weather would permit and strike the canal west of Richmond at orabout Lynchburg; and on the 20th I made the order to go to Lynchburg assoon as the roads would permit, saying:  "As soon as it is possible totravel, I think you will have no difficulty about reaching Lynchburgwith a cavalry force alone.  From there you could destroy the railroadand canal in every direction, so as to be of no further use to therebellion. * * * This additional raid, with one starting from EastTennessee under Stoneman, numbering about four or five thousand cavalry;one from Eastport, Mississippi, ten thousand cavalry; Canby, from MobileBay, with about eighteen thousand mixed troops--these three latterpushing for Tuscaloosa, Selma and Montgomery; and Sherman with a largearmy eating out the vitals of South Carolina--is all that will be wantedto leave nothing for the rebellion to stand upon.  I would advise you toovercome great obstacles to accomplish this.  Charleston was evacuatedon Tuesday last."On the 27th of February, more than a month after Canby had received hisorders, I again wrote to him, saying that I was extremely anxious tohear of his being in Alabama.  I notified him, also, that I had sentGrierson to take command of his cavalry, he being a very efficientofficer.  I further suggested that Forrest was probably in Mississippi,and if he was there, he would find him an officer of great courage andcapacity whom it would be difficult to get by.  I still further informedhim that Thomas had been ordered to start a cavalry force intoMississippi on the 20th of February, or as soon as possible thereafter.This force did not get off however.All these movements were designed to be in support of Sherman's march,the object being to keep the Confederate troops in the West from leavingthere.  But neither Canby nor Thomas could be got off in time.  I hadsome time before depleted Thomas's army to reinforce Canby, for thereason that Thomas had failed to start an expedition which he had beenordered to send out, and to have the troops where they might dosomething.  Canby seemed to be equally deliberate in all of hismovements.  I ordered him to go in person; but he prepared to send adetachment under another officer.  General Granger had got down to NewOrleans, in some way or other, and I wrote Canby that he must not puthim in command of troops.  In spite of this he asked the War Departmentto assign Granger to the command of a corps.Almost in despair of having adequate service rendered to the cause inthat quarter, I said to Canby:  "I am in receipt of a dispatch * * *informing me that you have made requisitions for a construction corpsand material to build seventy miles of railroad.  I have directed thatnone be sent.  Thomas's army has been depleted to send a force to youthat they might be where they could act in winter, and at least detainthe force the enemy had in the West.  If there had been any idea ofrepairing railroads, it could have been done much better from the North,where we already had the troops.  I expected your movements to beco-operative with Sherman's last.  This has now entirely failed.  Iwrote to you long ago, urging you to push promptly and to live upon thecountry, and destroy railroads, machine shops, etc., not to build them.Take Mobile and hold it, and push your forces to the interior--toMontgomery and to Selma. Destroy railroads, rolling stock, andeverything useful for carrying on war, and, when you have done this,take such positions as can be supplied by water.  By this means aloneyou can occupy positions from which the enemy's roads in the interiorcan be kept broken."Most of these expeditions got off finally, but too late to render anyservice in the direction for which they were designed.The enemy, ready to intercept his advance, consisted of Hardee's troopsand Wheeler's cavalry, perhaps less than fifteen thousand men in all;but frantic efforts were being made in Richmond, as I was sure would bethe case, to retard Sherman's movements. Everything possible was beingdone to raise troops in the South.  Lee dispatched against Sherman thetroops which had been sent to relieve Fort Fisher, which, includingthose of the other defences of the harbor and its neighborhood,amounted, after deducting the two thousand killed, wounded and captured,to fourteen thousand men.  After Thomas's victory at Nashville whatremained, of Hood's army were gathered together and forwarded as rapidlyas possible to the east to co-operate with these forces; and, finally,General Joseph E. Johnston, one of the ablest commanders of the Souththough not in favor with the administration (or at least with Mr.Davis), was put in command of all the troops in North and SouthCarolina.Schofield arrived at Annapolis in the latter part of January, but beforesending his troops to North Carolina I went with him down the coast tosee the situation of affairs, as I could give fuller directions afterbeing on the ground than I could very well have given without.  We soonreturned, and the troops were sent by sea to Cape Fear River.  Both NewBern and Wilmington are connected with Raleigh by railroads which uniteat Goldsboro.  Schofield was to land troops at Smithville, near themouth of the Cape Fear River on the west side, and move up to secure theWilmington and Charlotteville Railroad.  This column took their pontoonbridges with them, to enable them to cross over to the island south ofthe city of Wilmington.  A large body was sent by the north side toco-operate with them.  They succeeded in taking the city on the 22d ofFebruary.  I took the precaution to provide for Sherman's army, in casehe should be forced to turn in toward the sea coast before reachingNorth Carolina, by forwarding supplies to every place where he wasliable to have to make such a deflection from his projected march.  Ialso sent railroad rolling stock, of which we had a great abundance, nowthat we were not operating the roads in Virginia.  The gauge of theNorth Carolina railroads being the same as the Virginia railroads hadbeen altered too; these cars and locomotives were ready for use therewithout any change.On the 31st of January I countermanded the orders given to Thomas tomove south to Alabama and Georgia.  (I had previously reduced his forceby sending a portion of it to Terry.)  I directed in lieu of thismovement, that he should send Stoneman through East Tennessee, and pushhim well down toward Columbia, South Carolina, in support of Sherman.Thomas did not get Stoneman off in time, but, on the contrary, when Ihad supposed he was on his march in support of Sherman I heard of hisbeing in Louisville, Kentucky.  I immediately changed the order, anddirected Thomas to send him toward Lynchburg.  Finally, however, on the12th of March, he did push down through the north-western end of SouthCarolina, creating some consternation.  I also ordered Thomas to sendthe 4th corps (Stanley's) to Bull Gap and to destroy no more roads eastof that.  I also directed him to concentrate supplies at Knoxville, witha view to a probable movement of his army through that way towardLynchburg.Goldsboro is four hundred and twenty-five miles from Savannah. Sherman'smarch was without much incident until he entered Columbia, on the 17thof February.  He was detained in his progress by having to repair andcorduroy the roads, and rebuild the bridges.  There was constantskirmishing and fighting between the cavalry of the two armies, but thisdid not retard the advance of the infantry.  Four days, also, were lostin making complete the destruction of the most important railroads southof Columbia; there was also some delay caused by the high water, and thedestruction of the bridges on the line of the road.  A formidable riverhad to be crossed near Columbia, and that in the face of a smallgarrison under General Wade Hampton.  There was but little delay,however, further than that caused by high water in the stream.  Hamptonleft as Sherman approached, and the city was found to be on fire.There has since been a great deal of acrimony displayed in discussionsof the question as to who set Columbia on fire. Sherman denies it on thepart of his troops, and Hampton denies it on the part of theConfederates.  One thing is certain:  as soon as our troops tookpossession, they at once proceeded to extinguish the flames to the bestof their ability with the limited means at hand.  In any case, theexample set by the Confederates in burning the village of Chambersburg,Pa., a town which was not garrisoned, would seem to make a defence ofthe act of firing the seat of government of the State most responsiblefor the conflict then raging, not imperative.The Confederate troops having vacated the city, the mayor tookpossession, and sallied forth to meet the commander of the Nationalforces for the purpose of surrendering the town, making terms for theprotection of property, etc.  Sherman paid no attention at all to theoverture, but pushed forward and took the town without making anyconditions whatever with its citizens.  He then, however, co-operatedwith the mayor in extinguishing the flames and providing for the peoplewho were rendered destitute by this destruction of their homes.  When heleft there he even gave the mayor five hundred head of cattle to bedistributed among the citizens, to tide them over until some arrangementcould be made for their future supplies.  He remained in Columbia untilthe roads, public buildings, workshops and everything that could beuseful to the enemy were destroyed.  While at Columbia, Sherman learnedfor the first time that what remained of Hood's army was confrontinghim, under the command of General Beauregard.Charleston was evacuated on the 18th of February, and Foster garrisonedthe place.  Wilmington was captured on the 22d. Columbia and Cherawfarther north, were regarded as so secure from invasion that the wealthypeople of Charleston and Augusta had sent much of their valuableproperty to these two points to be stored.  Among the goods sent therewere valuable carpets, tons of old Madeira, silverware, and furniture.I am afraid much of these goods fell into the hands of our troops.There was found at Columbia a large amount of powder, some artillery,small-arms and fixed ammunition.  These, of course were among thearticles destroyed.  While here, Sherman also learned of Johnston'srestoration to command.  The latter was given, as already stated, alltroops in North and South Carolina.  After the completion of thedestruction of public property about Columbia, Sherman proceeded on hismarch and reached Cheraw without any special opposition and withoutincident to relate. The railroads, of course, were thoroughly destroyedon the way.  Sherman remained a day or two at Cheraw; and, finally, onthe 6th of March crossed his troops over the Pedee and advanced straightfor Fayetteville.  Hardee and Hampton were there, and barely escaped.Sherman reached Fayetteville on the 11th of March.  He had dispatchedscouts from Cheraw with letters to General Terry, at Wilmington, askinghim to send a steamer with some supplies of bread, clothing and otherarticles which he enumerated.  The scouts got through successfully, anda boat was sent with the mail and such articles for which Sherman hadasked as were in store at Wilmington; unfortunately, however, thosestores did not contain clothing.Four days later, on the 15th, Sherman left Fayetteville for Goldsboro.The march, now, had to be made with great caution, for he wasapproaching Lee's army and nearing the country that still remained opento the enemy.  Besides, he was confronting all that he had had toconfront in his previous march up to that point, reinforced by thegarrisons along the road and by what remained of Hood's army.  Franticappeals were made to the people to come in voluntarily and swell theranks of our foe.  I presume, however, that Johnston did not have in allover 35,000 or 40,000 men.  The people had grown tired of the war, anddesertions from the Confederate army were much more numerous than thevoluntary accessions.There was some fighting at Averysboro on the 16th between Johnston'stroops and Sherman's, with some loss; and at Bentonville on the 19th and21st of March, but Johnston withdrew from the contest before the morningof the 22d.  Sherman's loss in these last engagements in killed,wounded, and missing, was about sixteen hundred.  Sherman's troops atlast reached Goldsboro on the 23d of the month and went into bivouac;and there his men were destined to have a long rest.  Schofield wasthere to meet him with the troops which had been sent to Wilmington.Sherman was no longer in danger.  He had Johnston confronting him; butwith an army much inferior to his own, both in numbers and morale.  Hehad Lee to the north of him with a force largely superior; but I washolding Lee with a still greater force, and had he made his escape andgotten down to reinforce Johnston, Sherman, with the reinforcements henow had from Schofield and Terry, would have been able to hold theConfederates at bay for an indefinite period.  He was near the sea-shorewith his back to it, and our navy occupied the harbors.  He had arailroad to both Wilmington and New Bern, and his flanks were thoroughlyprotected by streams, which intersect that part of the country anddeepen as they approach the sea.  Then, too, Sherman knew that if Leeshould escape me I would be on his heels, and he and Johnson togetherwould be crushed in one blow if they attempted to make a stand.  Withthe loss of their capital, it is doubtful whether Lee's army would haveamounted to much as an army when it reached North Carolina.  Johnston'sarmy was demoralized by constant defeat and would hardly have made anoffensive movement, even if they could have been induced to remain onduty.  The men of both Lee's and Johnston's armies were, like theirbrethren of the North, as brave as men can be; but no man is so bravethat he may not meet such defeats and disasters as to discourage him anddampen his ardor for any cause, no matter how just he deems it.CHAPTER LXIII.ARRIVAL OF THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS--LINCOLN AND THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS--AN ANECDOTE OF LINCOLN--THE WINTER BEFORE PETERSBURG--SHERIDAN DESTROYSTHE RAILROAD--GORDON CARRIES THE PICKET LINE--PARKE RECAPTURES THE LINE--THE LINE OF BATTLE OF WHITE OAK ROAD.On the last of January, 1865, peace commissioners from the so-calledConfederate States presented themselves on our lines around Petersburg,and were immediately conducted to my headquarters at City Point.  Theyproved to be Alexander H. Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederacy,Judge Campbell, Assistant-Secretary of War, and R. M. T. Hunt, formerlyUnited States Senator and then a member of the Confederate Senate.It was about dark when they reached my headquarters, and I at onceconducted them to the steam Mary Martin, a Hudson River boat which wasvery comfortably fitted up for the use of passengers.  I at oncecommunicated by telegraph with Washington and informed the Secretary ofWar and the President of the arrival of these commissioners and thattheir object was to negotiate terms of peace between he United Statesand, as they termed it, the Confederate Government.  I was instructed toretain them at City Point, until the President, or some one whom hewould designate, should come to meet them.  They remained several daysas guests on board the boat.  I saw them quite frequently, though I haveno recollection of having had any conversation whatever with them on thesubject of their mission.  It was something I had nothing to do with,and I therefore did not wish to express any views on the subject.  Formy own part I never had admitted, and never was ready to admit, thatthey were the representatives of a GOVERNMENT.  There had been too greata waste of blood and treasure to concede anything of the kind.  As longas they remained there, however, our relations were pleasant and I foundthem all very agreeable gentlemen.  I directed the captain to furnishthem with the best the boat afforded, and to administer to their comfortin every way possible.  No guard was placed over them and no restrictionwas put upon their movements; nor was there any pledge asked that theywould not abuse the privileges extended to them.  They were permitted toleave the boat when they felt like it, and did so, coming up on the bankand visiting me at my headquarters.I had never met either of these gentlemen before the war, but knew themwell by reputation and through their public services, and I had been aparticular admirer of Mr. Stephens.  I had always supposed that he was avery small man, but when I saw him in the dusk of the evening I was verymuch surprised to find so large a man as he seemed to be.  When he gotdown on to the boat I found that he was wearing a coarse gray woollenovercoat, a manufacture that had been introduced into the South duringthe rebellion.  The cloth was thicker than anything of the kind I hadever seen, even in Canada.  The overcoat extended nearly to his feet,and was so large that it gave him the appearance of being anaverage-sized man.  He took this off when he reached the cabin of theboat, and I was struck with the apparent change in size, in the coat andout of it.After a few days, about the 2d of February, I received a dispatch fromWashington, directing me to send the commissioners to Hampton Roads tomeet the President and a member of the cabinet.  Mr. Lincoln met themthere and had an interview of short duration.  It was not a great whileafter they met that the President visited me at City Point.  He spoke ofhis having met the commissioners, and said he had told them that therewould be no use in entering into any negotiations unless they wouldrecognize, first:  that the Union as a whole must be forever preserved,and second:  that slavery must be abolished. If they were willing toconcede these two points, then he was ready to enter into negotiationsand was almost willing to hand them a blank sheet of paper with hissignature attached for them to fill in the terms upon which they werewilling to live with us in the Union and be one people.  He alwaysshowed a generous and kindly spirit toward the Southern people, and Inever heard him abuse an enemy.  Some of the cruel things said aboutPresident Lincoln, particularly in the North, used to pierce him to theheart; but never in my presence did he evince a revengeful dispositionand I saw a great deal of him at City Point, for he seemed glad to getaway from the cares and anxieties of the capital.Right here I might relate an anecdote of Mr. Lincoln.  It was on theoccasion of his visit to me just after he had talked with the peacecommissioners at Hampton Roads.  After a little conversation, he askedme if I had seen that overcoat of Stephens's.  I replied that I had."Well," said he, "did you see him take it off?"  I said yes.  "Well,"said he, "didn't you think it was the biggest shuck and the littlest earthat ever you did see?"  Long afterwards I told this story to theConfederate General J. B. Gordon, at the time a member of the Senate.He repeated it to Stephens, and, as I heard afterwards, Stephens laughedimmoderately at the simile of Mr. Lincoln.The rest of the winter, after the departure of the peace commissioners,passed off quietly and uneventfully, except for two or three littleincidents.  On one occasion during this period, while I was visitingWashington City for the purpose of conferring with the administration,the enemy's cavalry under General Wade Hampton, passing our extreme leftand then going to the south, got in east of us.  Before their presencewas known, they had driven off a large number of beef cattle that weregrazing in that section.  It was a fair capture, and they weresufficiently needed by the Confederates.  It was only retaliating forwhat we had done, sometimes for many weeks at a time, when out ofsupplies taking what the Confederate army otherwise would have gotten.As appears in this book, on one single occasion we captured fivethousand head of cattle which were crossing the Mississippi River nearPort Hudson on their way from Texas to supply the Confederate army inthe East.One of the most anxious periods of my experience during the rebellionwas the last few weeks before Petersburg.  I felt that the situation ofthe Confederate army was such that they would try to make an escape atthe earliest practicable moment, and I was afraid, every morning, that Iwould awake from my sleep to hear that Lee had gone, and that nothingwas left but a picket line.  He had his railroad by the way of Danvillesouth, and I was afraid that he was running off his men and all storesand ordnance except such as it would be necessary to carry with him forhis immediate defence.  I knew he could move much more lightly and morerapidly than I, and that, if he got the start, he would leave me behindso that we would have the same army to fight again farther south and thewar might be prolonged another year.I was led to this fear by the fact that I could not see how it waspossible for the Confederates to hold out much longer where they were.There is no doubt that Richmond would have been evacuated much soonerthan it was, if it had not been that it was the capital of the so-calledConfederacy, and the fact of evacuating the capital would, of course,have had a very demoralizing effect upon the Confederate army.  When itwas evacuated (as we shall see further on), the Confederacy at oncebegan to crumble and fade away.  Then, too, desertions were takingplace, not only among those who were with General Lee in theneighborhood of their capital, but throughout the whole Confederacy.  Iremember that in a conversation with me on one occasion long prior tothis, General Butler remarked that the Confederates would find greatdifficulty in getting more men for their army; possibly adding, though Iam not certain as to this, "unless they should arm the slave."The South, as we all knew, were conscripting every able-bodied manbetween the ages of eighteen and forty-five; and now they had passed alaw for the further conscription of boys from fourteen to eighteen,calling them the junior reserves, and men from forty-five to sixty to becalled the senior reserves.  The latter were to hold the necessarypoints not in immediate danger, and especially those in the rear.General Butler, in alluding to this conscription, remarked that theywere thus "robbing both the cradle and the grave," an expression which Iafterwards used in writing a letter to Mr. Washburn.It was my belief that while the enemy could get no more recruits theywere losing at least a regiment a day, taking it throughout the entirearmy, by desertions alone.  Then by casualties of war, sickness, andother natural causes, their losses were much heavier.  It was a merequestion of arithmetic to calculate how long they could hold out whilethat rate of depletion was going on.  Of course long before their armywould be thus reduced to nothing the army which we had in the fieldwould have been able to capture theirs.  Then too I knew from the greatnumber of desertions, that the men who had fought so bravely, sogallantly and so long for the cause which they believed in--and asearnestly, I take it, as our men believed in the cause for which theywere fighting--had lost hope and become despondent.  Many of them weremaking application to be sent North where they might get employmentuntil the war was over, when they could return to their Southern homes.For these and other reasons I was naturally very impatient for the timeto come when I could commence the spring campaign, which I thoroughlybelieved would close the war.There were two considerations I had to observe, however, and whichdetained me.  One was the fact that the winter had been one of heavyrains, and the roads were impassable for artillery and teams.  It wasnecessary to wait until they had dried sufficiently to enable us to movethe wagon trains and artillery necessary to the efficiency of an armyoperating in the enemy's country.  The other consideration was thatGeneral Sheridan with the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac wasoperating on the north side of the James River, having come down fromthe Shenandoah. It was necessary that I should have his cavalry with me,and I was therefore obliged to wait until he could join me south of theJames River.Let us now take account of what he was doing.On the 5th of March I had heard from Sheridan.  He had met Early betweenStaunton and Charlottesville and defeated him, capturing nearly hisentire command.  Early and some of his officers escaped by findingrefuge in the neighboring houses or in the woods.On the 12th I heard from him again.  He had turned east, to come toWhite House.  He could not go to Lynchburg as ordered, because the rainshad been so very heavy and the streams were so very much swollen.  Hehad a pontoon train with him, but it would not reach half way acrosssome of the streams, at their then stage of water, which he would haveto get over in going south as first ordered.I had supplies sent around to White House for him, and kept the depotthere open until he arrived.  We had intended to abandon it because theJames River had now become our base of supplies.Sheridan had about ten thousand cavalry with him, divided into twodivisions commanded respectively by Custer and Devin. General Merrittwas acting as chief of cavalry.  Sheridan moved very light, carryingonly four days' provisions with him, with a larger supply of coffee,salt and other small rations, and a very little else besides ammunition.They stopped at Charlottesville and commenced tearing up the railroadback toward Lynchburg.  He also sent a division along the James RiverCanal to destroy locks, culverts etc.  All mills and factories along thelines of march of his troops were destroyed also.Sheridan had in this way consumed so much time that his making a marchto White House was now somewhat hazardous.  He determined therefore tofight his way along the railroad and canal till he was as near toRichmond as it was possible to get, or until attacked.  He did this,destroying the canal as far as Goochland, and the railroad to a point asnear Richmond as he could get.  On the 10th he was at Columbia.  Negroeshad joined his column to the number of two thousand or more, and theyassisted considerably in the work of destroying the railroads and thecanal.  His cavalry was in as fine a condition as when he started,because he had been able to find plenty of forage. He had captured mostof Early's horses and picked up a good many others on the road.  When hereached Ashland he was assailed by the enemy in force.  He resistedtheir assault with part of his command, moved quickly across the Southand North Anna, going north, and reached White House safely on the 19th.The time for Sherman to move had to be fixed with reference to the timehe could get away from Goldsboro where he then was. Supplies had to begot up to him which would last him through a long march, as there wouldprobably not be much to be obtained in the country through which hewould pass.  I had to arrange, therefore, that he should start fromwhere he was, in the neighborhood of Goldsboro on the 18th of April, theearliest day at which he supposed he could be ready.Sherman was anxious that I should wait where I was until he could comeup, and make a sure thing of it; but I had determined to move as soon asthe roads and weather would admit of my doing so.  I had been tied downsomewhat in the matter of fixing any time at my pleasure for starting,until Sheridan, who was on his way from the Shenandoah Valley to joinme, should arrive, as both his presence and that of his cavalry werenecessary to the execution of the plans which I had in mind.  However,having arrived at White House on the 19th of March, I was enabled tomake my plans.Prompted by my anxiety lest Lee should get away some night before I wasaware of it, and having the lead of me, push into North Carolina to joinwith Johnston in attempting to crush out Sherman, I had, as early as the1st of the month of March, given instructions to the troops aroundPetersburg to keep a sharp lookout to see that such a movement shouldnot escape their notice, and to be ready strike at once if it wasundertaken.It is now known that early in the month of March Mr. Davis and GeneralLee had a consultation about the situation of affairs in and about andPetersburg, and they both agreed places were no longer tenable for them,and that they must get away as soon as possible.  They, too, werewaiting for dry roads, or a condition of the roads which would make itpossible to move.General Lee, in aid of his plan of escape, and to secure a wider openingto enable them to reach the Danville Road with greater security than hewould have in the way the two armies were situated, determined upon anassault upon the right of our lines around Petersburg.  The night of the24th of March was fixed upon for this assault, and General Gordon wasassigned to the execution of the plan.  The point between Fort Stedmanand Battery No. 10, where our lines were closest together, was selectedas the point of his attack.  The attack was to be made at night, and thetroops were to get possession of the higher ground in the rear wherethey supposed we had intrenchments, then sweep to the right and left,create a panic in the lines of our army, and force me to contract mylines.  Lee hoped this would detain me a few days longer and give him anopportunity of escape.  The plan was well conceived and the execution ofit very well done indeed, up to the point of carrying a portion of ourline.Gordon assembled his troops under the cover of night, at the point atwhich they were to make their charge, and got possession of ourpicket-line, entirely without the knowledge of the troops inside of ourmain line of intrenchments; this reduced the distance he would have tocharge over to not much more than fifty yards.  For some time before thedeserters had been coming in with great frequency, often bringing theirarms with them, and this the Confederate general knew.  Taking advantageof this knowledge he sent his pickets, with their arms, creeping throughto ours as if to desert.  When they got to our lines they at once tookpossession and sent our pickets to the rear as prisoners. In the mainline our men were sleeping serenely, as if in great security.  This planwas to have been executed and much damage done before daylight; but thetroops that were to reinforce Gordon had to be brought from the northside of the James River and, by some accident on the railroad on theirway over, they were detained for a considerable time; so that it got tobe nearly daylight before they were ready to make the charge.The charge, however, was successful and almost without loss, the enemypassing through our lines between Fort Stedman and Battery No. 10.  Thenturning to the right and left they captured the fort and the battery,with all the arms and troops in them. Continuing the charge, they alsocarried batteries Eleven and Twelve to our left, which they turnedtoward City Point.Meade happened to be at City Point that night, and this break in hisline cut him off from all communication with his headquarters.  Parke,however, commanding the 9th corps when this breach took place,telegraphed the facts to Meade's headquarters, and learning that thegeneral was away, assumed command himself and with commendablepromptitude made all preparations to drive the enemy back.  GeneralTidball gathered a large number of pieces of artillery and planted themin rear of the captured works so as to sweep the narrow space of groundbetween the lines very thoroughly.  Hartranft was soon out with hisdivision, as also was Willcox.  Hartranft to the right of the breachheaded the rebels off in that direction and rapidly drove them back intoFort Stedman.  On the other side they were driven back into theintrenchments which they had captured, and batteries eleven and twelvewere retaken by Willcox early in the morning.Parke then threw a line around outside of the captured fort andbatteries, and communication was once more established.  The artilleryfire was kept up so continuously that it was impossible for theConfederates to retreat, and equally impossible for reinforcements tojoin them.  They all, therefore, fell captives into our hands.  Thiseffort of Lee's cost him about four thousand men, and resulted in theirkilling, wounding and capturing about two thousand of ours.After the recapture of the batteries taken by the Confederates, ourtroops made a charge and carried the enemy's intrenched picket line,which they strengthened and held.  This, in turn, gave us but a shortdistance to charge over when our attack came to be made a few dayslater.The day that Gordon was making dispositions for this attack (24th ofMarch) I issued my orders for the movement to commence on the 29th.Ord, with three divisions of infantry and Mackenzie's cavalry, was tomove in advance on the night of the 27th, from the north side of theJames River and take his place on our extreme left, thirty miles away.He left Weitzel with the rest of the Army of the James to hold BermudaHundred and the north of the James River.  The engineer brigade was tobe left at City Point, and Parke's corps in the lines about Petersburg.(*42)Ord was at his place promptly.  Humphreys and Warren were then on ourextreme left with the 2d and 5th corps.  They were directed on thearrival of Ord, and on his getting into position in their places, tocross Hatcher's Run and extend out west toward Five Forks, the objectbeing to get into a position from which we could strike the South SideRailroad and ultimately the Danville Railroad.  There was considerablefighting in taking up these new positions for the 2d and 5th corps, inwhich the Army of the James had also to participate somewhat, and thelosses were quite severe.This was what was known as the Battle of White Oak Road.CHAPTER LXIV.INTERVIEW WITH SHERIDAN--GRAND MOVEMENT OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC--SHERIDAN'S ADVANCE ON FIVE FORKS--BATTLE OF FIVE FORKS--PARKE ANDWRIGHT STORM THE ENEMY'S LINE--BATTLES BEFORE PETERSBURG.Sheridan reached City Point on the 26th day of March.  His horses, ofcourse, were jaded and many of them had lost their shoes.  A few days ofrest were necessary to recuperate the animals and also to have them shodand put in condition for moving.  Immediately on General Sheridan'sarrival at City Point I prepared his instructions for the move which Ihad decided upon.  The movement was to commence on the 29th of themonth.After reading the instructions I had given him, Sheridan walked out ofmy tent, and I followed to have some conversation with him by himself--not in the presence of anybody else, even of a member of my staff.  Inpreparing his instructions I contemplated just what took place; that isto say, capturing Five Forks, driving the enemy from Petersburg andRichmond and terminating the contest before separating from the enemy.But the Nation had already become restless and discouraged at theprolongation of the war, and many believed that it would never terminateexcept by compromise.  Knowing that unless my plan proved an entiresuccess it would be interpreted as a disastrous defeat, I provided inthese instructions that in a certain event he was to cut loose from theArmy of the Potomac and his base of supplies, and living upon thecountry proceed south by the way of the Danville Railroad, or near it,across the Roanoke, get in the rear of Johnston, who was guarding thatroad, and cooperate with Sherman in destroying Johnston; then with thesecombined forces to help carry out the instructions which Sherman alreadyhad received, to act in cooperation with the armies around Petersburgand Richmond.I saw that after Sheridan had read his instructions he seemed somewhatdisappointed at the idea, possibly, of having to cut loose again fromthe Army of the Potomac, and place himself between the two main armiesof the enemy.  I said to him: "General, this portion of yourinstructions I have put in merely as a blind;" and gave him the reasonfor doing so, heretofore described.  I told him that, as a matter offact, I intended to close the war right here, with this movement, andthat he should go no farther.  His face at once brightened up, andslapping his hand on his leg he said:  "I am glad to hear it, and we cando it."Sheridan was not however to make his movement against Five Forks untilhe got further instructions from me.One day, after the movement I am about to describe had commenced, andwhen his cavalry was on our extreme left and far to the rear, south,Sheridan rode up to where my headquarters were then established, atDabney's Mills.  He met some of my staff officers outside, and washighly jubilant over the prospects of success, giving reasons why hebelieved this would prove the final and successful effort.  Although mychief-of-staff had urged very strongly that we return to our positionabout City Point and in the lines around Petersburg, he asked Sheridanto come in to see me and say to me what he had been saying to them.Sheridan felt a little modest about giving his advice where it had notbeen asked; so one of my staff came in and told me that Sheridan hadwhat they considered important news, and suggested that I send for him.I did so, and was glad to see the spirit of confidence with which he wasimbued. Knowing as I did from experience, of what great value thatfeeling of confidence by a commander was, I determined to make amovement at once, although on account of the rains which had fallenafter I had started out the roads were still very heavy.  Orders weregiven accordingly.Finally the 29th of March came, and fortunately there having been a fewdays free from rain, the surface of the ground was dry, givingindications that the time had come when we could move.  On that date Imoved out with all the army available after leaving sufficient force tohold the line about Petersburg.  It soon set in raining again however,and in a very short time the roads became practically impassable forteams, and almost so for cavalry.  Sometimes a horse or mule would bestanding apparently on firm ground, when all at once one foot wouldsink, and as he commenced scrambling to catch himself all his feet wouldsink and he would have to be drawn by hand out of the quicksands socommon in that part of Virginia and other southern States.  It becamenecessary therefore to build corduroy roads every foot of the way as weadvanced, to move our artillery upon.  The army had become so accustomedto this kind of work, and were so well prepared for it, that it was donevery rapidly.  The next day, March 30th, we had made sufficient progressto the south-west to warrant me in starting Sheridan with his cavalryover by Dinwiddie with instructions to then come up by the road leadingnorth-west to Five Forks, thus menacing the right of Lee's line.This movement was made for the purpose of extending our lines to thewest as far as practicable towards the enemy's extreme right, or FiveForks.  The column moving detached from the army still in the trencheswas, excluding the cavalry, very small.  The forces in the trenches werethemselves extending to the left flank. Warren was on the extreme leftwhen the extension began, but Humphreys was marched around later andthrown into line between him and Five Forks.My hope was that Sheridan would be able to carry Five Forks, get on theenemy's right flank and rear, and force them to weaken their centre toprotect their right so that an assault in the centre might besuccessfully made.  General Wright's corps had been designated to makethis assault, which I intended to order as soon as information reachedme of Sheridan's success.  He was to move under cover as close to theenemy as he could get.It is natural to suppose that Lee would understand my design to be toget up to the South Side and ultimately to the Danville Railroad, assoon as he had heard of the movement commenced on the 29th.  These roadswere so important to his very existence while he remained in Richmondand Petersburg, and of such vital importance to him even in case ofretreat, that naturally he would make most strenuous efforts to defendthem.  He did on the 30th send Pickett with five brigades to reinforceFive Forks.  He also sent around to the right of his army some two orthree other divisions, besides directing that other troops be held inreadiness on the north side of the James River to come over on call.  Hecame over himself to superintend in person the defence of his rightflank.Sheridan moved back to Dinwiddie Court-House on the night of the 30th,and then took a road leading north-west to Five Forks.  He had only hiscavalry with him.  Soon encountering the rebel cavalry he met with avery stout resistance.  He gradually drove them back however until inthe neighborhood of Five Forks.  Here he had to encounter other troopsbesides those he had been contending with, and was forced to give way.In this condition of affairs he notified me of what had taken place andstated that he was falling back toward Dinwiddie gradually and slowly,and asked me to send Wright's corps to his assistance.  I replied to himthat it was impossible to send Wright's corps because that corps wasalready in line close up to the enemy, where we should want to assaultwhen the proper time came, and was besides a long distance from him; butthe 2d (Humphreys's) and 5th (Warren's) corps were on our extreme leftand a little to the rear of it in a position to threaten the left flankof the enemy at Five Forks, and that I would send Warren.Accordingly orders were sent to Warren to move at once that night (the31st) to Dinwiddie Court House and put himself in communication withSheridan as soon as possible, and report to him.  He was very slow inmoving, some of his troops not starting until after 5 o'clock nextmorning.  When he did move it was done very deliberately, and onarriving at Gravelly Run he found the stream swollen from the recentrains so that he regarded it as not fordable.  Sheridan of course knewof his coming, and being impatient to get the troops up as soon aspossible, sent orders to him to hasten.  He was also hastened or atleast ordered to move up rapidly by General Meade.  He now felt that hecould not cross that creek without bridges, and his orders were changedto move so as to strike the pursuing enemy in flank or get in theirrear; but he was so late in getting up that Sheridan determined to moveforward without him.  However, Ayres's division of Warren's corpsreached him in time to be in the fight all day, most of the timeseparated from the remainder of the 5th corps and fighting directlyunder Sheridan.Warren reported to Sheridan about 11 o'clock on the 1st, but the wholeof his troops were not up so as to be much engaged until late in theafternoon.  Griffin's division in backing to get out of the way of asevere cross fire of the enemy was found marching away from thefighting.  This did not continue long, however; the division was broughtback and with Ayres's division did most excellent service during theday.  Crawford's division of the same corps had backed still fartheroff, and although orders were sent repeatedly to bring it up, it waslate before it finally got to where it could be of material assistance.Once there it did very excellent service.Sheridan succeeded by the middle of the afternoon or a little later, inadvancing up to the point from which to make his designed assault uponFive Forks itself.  He was very impatient to make the assault and haveit all over before night, because the ground he occupied would beuntenable for him in bivouac during the night.  Unless the assault wasmade and was successful, he would be obliged to return to DinwiddieCourt-House, or even further than that for the night.It was at this junction of affairs that Sheridan wanted to getCrawford's division in hand, and he also wanted Warren.  He sent staffofficer after staff officer in search of Warren, directing that generalto report to him, but they were unable to find him.  At all eventsSheridan was unable to get that officer to him.  Finally he wenthimself.  He issued an order relieving Warren and assigning Griffin tothe command of the 5th corps. The troops were then brought up and theassault successfully made.I was so much dissatisfied with Warren's dilatory movements in thebattle of White Oak Road and in his failure to reach Sheridan in time,that I was very much afraid that at the last moment he would failSheridan.  He was a man of fine intelligence, great earnestness, quickperception, and could make his dispositions as quickly as any officer,under difficulties where he was forced to act.  But I had beforediscovered a defect which was beyond his control, that was veryprejudicial to his usefulness in emergencies like the one just beforeus.  He could see every danger at a glance before he had encountered it.He would not only make preparations to meet the danger which mightoccur, but he would inform his commanding officer what others should dowhile he was executing his move.I had sent a staff officer to General Sheridan to call his attention tothese defects, and to say that as much as I liked General Warren, nowwas not a time when we could let our personal feelings for any one standin the way of success; and if his removal was necessary to success, notto hesitate.  It was upon that authorization that Sheridan removedWarren.  I was very sorry that it had been done, and regretted stillmore that I had not long before taken occasion to assign him to anotherfield of duty.It was dusk when our troops under Sheridan went over the parapets of theenemy.  The two armies were mingled together there for a time in suchmanner that it was almost a question which one was going to demand thesurrender of the other.  Soon, however, the enemy broke and ran in everydirection; some six thousand prisoners, besides artillery and small-armsin large quantities, falling into our hands.  The flying troops werepursued in different directions, the cavalry and 5th corps underSheridan pursuing the larger body which moved north-west.This pursuit continued until about nine o'clock at night, when Sheridanhalted his troops, and knowing the importance to him of the part of theenemy's line which had been captured, returned, sending the 5th corpsacross Hatcher's Run to just south-west of Petersburg, and facing themtoward it.  Merritt, with the cavalry, stopped and bivouacked west ofFive Forks.This was the condition which affairs were in on the night of the 1st ofApril.  I then issued orders for an assault by Wright and Parke at fouro'clock on the morning of the 2d.  I also ordered the 2d corps, GeneralHumphreys, and General Ord with the Army of the James, on the left, tohold themselves in readiness to take any advantage that could be takenfrom weakening in their front.I notified Mr. Lincoln at City Point of the success of the day; in factI had reported to him during the day and evening as I got news, becausehe was so much interested in the movements taking place that I wanted torelieve his mind as much as I could.  I notified Weitzel on the northside of the James River, directing him, also, to keep close up to theenemy, and take advantage of the withdrawal of troops from there topromptly enter the city of Richmond.I was afraid that Lee would regard the possession of Five Forks as of somuch importance that he would make a last desperate effort to retake it,risking everything upon the cast of a single die.  It was for thisreason that I had ordered the assault to take place at once, as soon asI had received the news of the capture of Five Forks.  The corpscommanders, however, reported that it was so dark that the men could notsee to move, and it would be impossible to make the assault then. But wekept up a continuous artillery fire upon the enemy around the whole lineincluding that north of the James River, until it was light enough tomove, which was about a quarter to five in the morning.At that hour Parke's and Wright's corps moved out as directed, brushedthe abatis from their front as they advanced under a heavy fire ofmusketry and artillery, and went without flinching directly on till theymounted the parapets and threw themselves inside of the enemy's line.Parke, who was on the right, swept down to the right and captured a veryconsiderable length of line in that direction, but at that point theouter was so near the inner line which closely enveloped the city ofPetersburg that he could make no advance forward and, in fact, had avery serious task to turn the lines which he had captured to the defenceof his own troops and to hold them; but he succeeded in this.Wright swung around to his left and moved to Hatcher's Run, sweepingeverything before him.  The enemy had traverses in rear of his capturedline, under cover of which he made something of a stand, from one toanother, as Wright moved on; but the latter met no serious obstacle.  Asyou proceed to the left the outer line becomes gradually much fartherfrom the inner one, and along about Hatcher's Run they must be nearlytwo miles apart. Both Parke and Wright captured a considerable amount ofartillery and some prisoners--Wright about three thousand of them.In the meantime Ord and Humphreys, in obedience to the instructions theyhad received, had succeeded by daylight, or very early in the morning,in capturing the intrenched picket-lines in their front; and beforeWright got up to that point, Ord had also succeeded in getting inside ofthe enemy's intrenchments.  The second corps soon followed; and theouter works of Petersburg were in the hands of the National troops,never to be wrenched from them again.  When Wright reached Hatcher'sRun, he sent a regiment to destroy the South Side Railroad just outsideof the city.My headquarters were still at Dabney's saw-mills.  As soon as I receivedthe news of Wright's success, I sent dispatches announcing the fact toall points around the line, including the troops at Bermuda Hundred andthose on the north side of the James, and to the President at CityPoint.  Further dispatches kept coming in, and as they did I sent theadditional news to these points.  Finding at length that they were allin, I mounted my horse to join the troops who were inside the works.When I arrived there I rode my horse over the parapet just as Wright'sthree thousand prisoners were coming out.  I was soon joined inside byGeneral Meade and his staff.Lee made frantic efforts to recover at least part of the lost ground.Parke on our right was repeatedly assaulted, but repulsed every effort.Before noon Longstreet was ordered up from the north side of the JamesRiver thus bringing the bulk of Lee's army around to the support of hisextreme right.  As soon as I learned this I notified Weitzel anddirected him to keep up close to the enemy and to have Hartsuff,commanding the Bermuda Hundred front, to do the same thing, and if theyfound any break to go in; Hartsuff especially should do so, for thiswould separate Richmond and Petersburg.Sheridan, after he had returned to Five Forks, swept down to Petersburg,coming in on our left.  This gave us a continuous line from theAppomattox River below the city to the same river above.  At eleveno'clock, not having heard from Sheridan, I reinforced Parke with twobrigades from City Point.  With this additional force he completed hiscaptured works for better defence, and built back from his right, so asto protect his flank.  He also carried in and made an abatis betweenhimself and the enemy.  Lee brought additional troops and artilleryagainst Parke even after this was done, and made several assaults withvery heavy losses.The enemy had in addition to their intrenched line close up toPetersburg, two enclosed works outside of it, Fort Gregg and FortWhitworth.  We thought it had now become necessary to carry them byassault.  About one o'clock in the day, Fort Gregg was assaulted byFoster's division of the 24th corps (Gibbon's), supported by twobrigades from Ord's command.  The battle was desperate and the Nationaltroops were repulsed several times; but it was finally carried, andimmediately the troops in Fort Whitworth evacuated the place.  The gunsof Fort Gregg were turned upon the retreating enemy, and the commandingofficer with some sixty of the men of Fort Whitworth surrendered.I had ordered Miles in the morning to report to Sheridan.  In moving toexecute this order he came upon the enemy at the intersection of theWhite Oak Road and the Claiborne Road.  The enemy fell back toSutherland Station on the South Side Road and were followed by Miles.This position, naturally a strong and defensible one, was also stronglyintrenched.  Sheridan now came up and Miles asked permission from him tomake the assault, which Sheridan gave.  By this time Humphreys had gotthrough the outer works in his front, and came up also and assumedcommand over Miles, who commanded a division in his corps.  I had sentan order to Humphreys to turn to his right and move towards Petersburg.This order he now got, and started off, thus leaving Miles alone.  Thelatter made two assaults, both of which failed, and he had to fall backa few hundred yards.Hearing that Miles had been left in this position, I directed Humphreysto send a division back to his relief.  He went himself.Sheridan before starting to sweep down to Petersburg had sent Merrittwith his cavalry to the west to attack some Confederate cavalry that hadassembled there.  Merritt drove them north to the Appomattox River.Sheridan then took the enemy at Sutherland Station on the reverse sidefrom where Miles was, and the two together captured the place, with alarge number of prisoners and some pieces of artillery, and put theremainder, portions of three Confederate corps, to flight.  Sheridanfollowed, and drove them until night, when further pursuit was stopped.Miles bivouacked for the night on the ground which he with Sheridan hadcarried so handsomely by assault.  I cannot explain the situation herebetter than by giving my dispatch to City Point that evening:BOYDTON ROAD, NEAR PETERSBURG, April 2, 1865.--4.40 P.M.COLONEL T. S. BOWERS, City Point.We are now up and have a continuous line of troops, and in a few hourswill be intrenched from the Appomattox below Petersburg to the riverabove.  Heth's and Wilcox's divisions, such part of them as were notcaptured, were cut off from town, either designedly on their part orbecause they could not help it. Sheridan with the cavalry and 5th corpsis above them.  Miles's division, 2d corps, was sent from the White OakRoad to Sutherland Station on the South Side Railroad, where he metthem, and at last accounts was engaged with them.  Not knowing whetherSheridan would get up in time, General Humphreys was sent with anotherdivision from here.  The whole captures since the army started outgunning will amount to not less than twelve thousand men, and probablyfifty pieces of artillery.  I do not know the number of men and gunsaccurately however.  * * *  I think the President might come out and payus a visit tomorrow.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.During the night of April 2d our line was intrenched from the riverabove to the river below.  I ordered a bombardment to be commenced thenext morning at five A.M., to be followed by an assault at six o'clock;but the enemy evacuated Petersburg early in the morning.CHAPTER LXV.THE CAPTURE OF PETERSBURG--MEETING PRESIDENT LINCOLN IN PETERSBURG--THECAPTURE OF RICHMOND--PURSUING THE ENEMY--VISIT TO SHERIDAN AND MEADE.General Meade and I entered Petersburg on the morning of the 3d and tooka position under cover of a house which protected us from the enemy'smusketry which was flying thick and fast there.  As we wouldoccasionally look around the corner we could see the streets and theAppomattox bottom, presumably near the bridge, packed with theConfederate army.  I did not have artillery brought up, because I wassure Lee was trying to make his escape, and I wanted to push immediatelyin pursuit.  At all events I had not the heart to turn the artilleryupon such a mass of defeated and fleeing men, and I hoped to capturethem soon.Soon after the enemy had entirely evacuated Petersburg, a man came inwho represented himself to be an engineer of the Army of NorthernVirginia.  He said that Lee had for some time been at work preparing astrong enclosed intrenchment, into which he would throw himself whenforced out of Petersburg, and fight his final battle there; that he wasactually at that time drawing his troops from Richmond, and falling backinto this prepared work. This statement was made to General Meade andmyself when we were together.  I had already given orders for themovement up the south side of the Appomattox for the purpose of headingoff Lee; but Meade was so much impressed by this man's story that hethought we ought to cross the Appomattox there at once and move againstLee in his new position.  I knew that Lee was no fool, as he would havebeen to have put himself and his army between two formidable streamslike the James and Appomattox rivers, and between two such armies asthose of the Potomac and the James. Then these streams coming togetheras they did to the east of him, it would be only necessary to close upin the west to have him thoroughly cut off from all supplies orpossibility of reinforcement.  It would only have been a question ofdays, and not many of them, if he had taken the position assigned to himby the so-called engineer, when he would have been obliged to surrenderhis army.  Such is one of the ruses resorted to in war to deceive yourantagonist.  My judgment was that Lee would necessarily have to evacuateRichmond, and that the only course for him to pursue would be to followthe Danville Road. Accordingly my object was to secure a point on thatroad south of Lee, and I told Meade this.  He suggested that if Lee wasgoing that way we would follow him.  My reply was that we did not wantto follow him; we wanted to get ahead of him and cut him off, and if hewould only stay in the position he (Meade) believed him to be in at thattime, I wanted nothing better; that when we got in possession of theDanville Railroad, at its crossing of the Appomattox River, if we stillfound him between the two rivers, all we had to do was to move eastwardand close him up.  That we would then have all the advantage we couldpossibly have by moving directly against him from Petersburg, even if heremained in the position assigned him by the engineer officer.I had held most of the command aloof from the intrenchments, so as tostart them out on the Danville Road early in the morning, supposing thatLee would be gone during the night.  During the night I strengthenedSheridan by sending him Humphreys's corps.Lee, as we now know, had advised the authorities at Richmond, during theday, of the condition of affairs, and told them it would be impossiblefor him to hold out longer than night, if he could hold out that long.Davis was at church when he received Lee's dispatch.  The congregationwas dismissed with the notice that there would be no evening service.The rebel government left Richmond about two o'clock in the afternoon ofthe 2d.At night Lee ordered his troops to assemble at Amelia Court House, hisobject being to get away, join Johnston if possible, and to try to crushSherman before I could get there.  As soon as I was sure of this Inotified Sheridan and directed him to move out on the Danville Railroadto the south side of the Appomattox River as speedily as possible.  Hereplied that he already had some of his command nine miles out.  I thenordered the rest of the Army of the Potomac under Meade to follow thesame road in the morning.  Parke's corps followed by the same road, andthe Army of the James was directed to follow the road which ranalongside of the South Side Railroad to Burke's Station, and to repairthe railroad and telegraph as they proceeded.  That road was a 5 feetgauge, while our rolling stock was all of the 4 feet 8 1/2 inches gauge;consequently the rail on one side of the track had to be taken upthroughout the whole length and relaid so as to conform to the gauge ofour cars and locomotives.Mr. Lincoln was at City Point at the time, and had been for some days.I would have let him know what I contemplated doing, only while I felt astrong conviction that the move was going to be successful, yet it mightnot prove so; and then I would have only added another to the manydisappointments he had been suffering for the past three years.  Butwhen we started out he saw that we were moving for a purpose, andbidding us Godspeed, remained there to hear the result.The next morning after the capture of Petersburg, I telegraphed Mr.Lincoln asking him to ride out there and see me, while I would await hisarrival.  I had started all the troops out early in the morning, so thatafter the National army left Petersburg there was not a soul to be seen,not even an animal in the streets.  There was absolutely no one there,except my staff officers and, possibly, a small escort of cavalry.  Wehad selected the piazza of a deserted house, and occupied it until thePresident arrived.About the first thing that Mr. Lincoln said to me, after warmcongratulations for the victory, and thanks both to myself and to thearmy which had accomplished it, was:  "Do you know, general, that I havehad a sort of a sneaking idea for some days that you intended to dosomething like this."  Our movements having been successful up to thispoint, I no longer had any object in concealing from the President allmy movements, and the objects I had in view.  He remained for some daysnear City Point, and I communicated with him frequently and fully bytelegraph.Mr. Lincoln knew that it had been arranged for Sherman to join me at afixed time, to co-operate in the destruction of Lee's army.  I told himthat I had been very anxious to have the Eastern armies vanquish theirold enemy who had so long resisted all their repeated and gallantattempts to subdue them or drive them from their capital.  The Westernarmies had been in the main successful until they had conquered all theterritory from the Mississippi River to the State of North Carolina, andwere now almost ready to knock at the back door of Richmond, askingadmittance.  I said to him that if the Western armies should be evenupon the field, operating against Richmond and Lee, the credit would begiven to them for the capture, by politicians and non-combatants fromthe section of country which those troops hailed from.  It might lead todisagreeable bickerings between members of Congress of the East andthose of the West in some of their debates.  Western members might bethrowing it up to the members of the East that in the suppression of therebellion they were not able to capture an army, or to accomplish muchin the way of contributing toward that end, but had to wait until theWestern armies had conquered all the territory south and west of them,and then come on to help them capture the only army they had beenengaged with.Mr. Lincoln said he saw that now, but had never thought of it before,because his anxiety was so great that he did not care where the aid camefrom so the work was done.The Army of the Potomac has every reason to be proud of its four years'record in the suppression of the rebellion.  The army it had to fightwas the protection to the capital of a people which was attempting tofound a nation upon the territory of the United States.  Its loss wouldbe the loss of the cause.  Every energy, therefore, was put forth by theConfederacy to protect and maintain their capital.  Everything elsewould go if it went. Lee's army had to be strengthened to enable it tomaintain its position, no matter what territory was wrested from theSouth in another quarter.I never expected any such bickering as I have indicated, between thesoldiers of the two sections; and, fortunately, there has been nonebetween the politicians.  Possibly I am the only one who thought of theliability of such a state of things in advance.When our conversation was at an end Mr. Lincoln mounted his horse andstarted on his return to City Point, while I and my staff started tojoin the army, now a good many miles in advance.  Up to this time I hadnot received the report of the capture of Richmond.Soon after I left President Lincoln I received a dispatch from GeneralWeitzel which notified me that he had taken possession of Richmond atabout 8.15 o'clock in the morning of that day, the 3d, and that he hadfound the city on fire in two places. The city was in the most utterconfusion.  The authorities had taken the precaution to empty all theliquor into the gutter, and to throw out the provisions which theConfederate government had left, for the people to gather up.  The cityhad been deserted by the authorities, civil and military, without anynotice whatever that they were about to leave.  In fact, up to the veryhour of the evacuation the people had been led to believe that Lee hadgained an important victory somewhere around Petersburg.Weitzel's command found evidence of great demoralization in Lee's army,there being still a great many men and even officers in the town.  Thecity was on fire.  Our troops were directed to extinguish the flames,which they finally succeeded in doing. The fire had been started by someone connected with the retreating army.  All authorities deny that itwas authorized, and I presume it was the work of excited men who wereleaving what they regarded as their capital and may have felt that itwas better to destroy it than have it fall into the hands of theirenemy.  Be that as it may, the National troops found the city in flames,and used every effort to extinguish them.The troops that had formed Lee's right, a great many of them, were cutoff from getting back into Petersburg, and were pursued by our cavalryso hotly and closely that they threw away caissons, ammunition,clothing, and almost everything to lighten their loads, and pushed alongup the Appomattox River until finally they took water and crossed over.I left Mr. Lincoln and started, as I have already said, to join thecommand, which halted at Sutherland Station, about nine miles out.  Wehad still time to march as much farther, and time was an object; but theroads were bad and the trains belonging to the advance corps had blockedup the road so that it was impossible to get on.  Then, again, ourcavalry had struck some of the enemy and were pursuing them; and theorders were that the roads should be given up to the cavalry wheneverthey appeared.  This caused further delay.General Wright, who was in command of one of the corps which were leftback, thought to gain time by letting his men go into bivouac and tryingto get up some rations for them, and clearing out the road, so that whenthey did start they would be uninterrupted.  Humphreys, who was farahead, was also out of rations.  They did not succeed in getting them upthrough the night; but the Army of the Potomac, officers and men, wereso elated by the reflection that at last they were following up avictory to its end, that they preferred marching without rations torunning a possible risk of letting the enemy elude them.  So the marchwas resumed at three o'clock in the morning.Merritt's cavalry had struck the enemy at Deep Creek, and driven themnorth to the Appomattox, where, I presume, most of them were forced tocross.On the morning of the 4th I learned that Lee had ordered rations up fromDanville for his famishing army, and that they were to meet him atFarmville.  This showed that Lee had already abandoned the idea offollowing the railroad down to Danville, but had determined to gofarther west, by the way of Farmville.  I notified Sheridan of this anddirected him to get possession of the road before the supplies couldreach Lee.  He responded that he had already sent Crook's division toget upon the road between Burkesville and Jetersville, then to facenorth and march along the road upon the latter place; and he thoughtCrook must be there now.  The bulk of the army moved directly forJetersville by two roads.After I had received the dispatch from Sheridan saying that Crook was onthe Danville Road, I immediately ordered Meade to make a forced marchwith the Army of the Potomac, and to send Parke's corps across from theroad they were on to the South Side Railroad, to fall in the rear of theArmy of the James and to protect the railroad which that army wasrepairing as it went along.Our troops took possession of Jetersville and in the telegraph office,they found a dispatch from Lee, ordering two hundred thousand rationsfrom Danville.  The dispatch had not been sent, but Sheridan sent aspecial messenger with it to Burkesville and had it forwarded fromthere.  In the meantime, however, dispatches from other sources hadreached Danville, and they knew there that our army was on the line ofthe road; so that they sent no further supplies from that quarter.At this time Merritt and Mackenzie, with the cavalry, were off betweenthe road which the Army of the Potomac was marching on and theAppomattox River, and were attacking the enemy in flank.  They picked upa great many prisoners and forced the abandonment of some property.Lee intrenched himself at Amelia Court House, and also his advance northof Jetersville, and sent his troops out to collect forage.  The countrywas very poor and afforded but very little.  His foragers scattered agreat deal; many of them were picked up by our men, and many othersnever returned to the Army of Northern Virginia.Griffin's corps was intrenched across the railroad south of Jetersville,and Sheridan notified me of the situation.  I again ordered Meade upwith all dispatch, Sheridan having but the one corps of infantry with alittle cavalry confronting Lee's entire army.  Meade, always prompt inobeying orders, now pushed forward with great energy, although he washimself sick and hardly able to be out of bed.  Humphreys moved at two,and Wright at three o'clock in the morning, without rations, as I havesaid, the wagons being far in the rear.I stayed that night at Wilson's Station on the South Side Railroad.  Onthe morning of the 5th I sent word to Sheridan of the progress Meade wasmaking, and suggested that he might now attack Lee.  We had now no otherobjective than the Confederate armies, and I was anxious to close thething up at once.On the 5th I marched again with Ord's command until within about tenmiles of Burkesville, where I stopped to let his army pass. I thenreceived from Sheridan the following dispatch:"The whole of Lee's army is at or near Amelia Court House, and on thisside of it.  General Davies, whom I sent out to Painesville on theirright flank, has just captured six pieces of artillery and some wagons.We can capture the Army of Northern Virginia if force enough can bethrown to this point, and then advance upon it.  My cavalry was atBurkesville yesterday, and six miles beyond, on the Danville Road, lastnight.  General Lee is at Amelia Court House in person.  They are out ofrations, or nearly so.  They were advancing up the railroad towardsBurkesville yesterday, when we intercepted them at this point."It now became a life and death struggle with Lee to get south to hisprovisions.Sheridan, thinking the enemy might turn off immediately towardsFarmville, moved Davies's brigade of cavalry out to watch him. Daviesfound the movement had already commenced.  He attacked and drove awaytheir cavalry which was escorting wagons to the west, capturing andburning 180 wagons.  He also captured five pieces of artillery.  TheConfederate infantry then moved against him and probably would havehandled him very roughly, but Sheridan had sent two more brigades ofcavalry to follow Davies, and they came to his relief in time.  A sharpengagement took place between these three brigades of cavalry and theenemy's infantry, but the latter was repulsed.Meade himself reached Jetersville about two o'clock in the afternoon,but in advance of all his troops.  The head of Humphreys's corpsfollowed in about an hour afterwards. Sheridan stationed the troops asthey came up, at Meade's request, the latter still being very sick.  Heextended two divisions of this corps off to the west of the road to theleft of Griffin's corps, and one division to the right.  The cavalry bythis time had also come up, and they were put still farther off to theleft, Sheridan feeling certain that there lay the route by which theenemy intended to escape.  He wanted to attack, feeling that if time wasgiven, the enemy would get away; but Meade prevented this, preferring towait till his troops were all up.At this juncture Sheridan sent me a letter which had been handed to himby a colored man, with a note from himself saying that he wished I wasthere myself.  The letter was dated Amelia Court House, April 5th, andsigned by Colonel Taylor.  It was to his mother, and showed thedemoralization of the Confederate army. Sheridan's note also gave me theinformation as here related of the movements of that day.  I received asecond message from Sheridan on the 5th, in which he urged moreemphatically the importance of my presence.  This was brought to me by ascout in gray uniform.  It was written on tissue paper, and wrapped upin tin-foil such as chewing tobacco is folded in.  This was a precautiontaken so that if the scout should be captured he could take thistin-foil out of his pocket and putting it into his mouth, chew it.  Itwould cause no surprise at all to see a Confederate soldier chewingtobacco. It was nearly night when this letter was received.  I gave Orddirections to continue his march to Burkesville and there intrenchhimself for the night, and in the morning to move west to cut off allthe roads between there and Farmville.I then started with a few of my staff and a very small escort ofcavalry, going directly through the woods, to join Meade's army.  Thedistance was about sixteen miles; but the night being dark our progresswas slow through the woods in the absence of direct roads.  However, wegot to the outposts about ten o'clock in the evening, and after somelittle parley convinced the sentinels of our identity and were conductedin to where Sheridan was bivouacked.  We talked over the situation forsome little time, Sheridan explaining to me what he thought Lee wastrying to do, and that Meade's orders, if carried out, moving to theright flank, would give him the coveted opportunity of escaping us andputting us in rear of him.We then together visited Meade, reaching his headquarters aboutmidnight.  I explained to Meade that we did not want to follow theenemy; we wanted to get ahead of him, and that his orders would allowthe enemy to escape, and besides that, I had no doubt that Lee wasmoving right then.  Meade changed his orders at once.  They were nowgiven for an advance on Amelia Court House, at an early hour in themorning, as the army then lay; that is, the infantry being across therailroad, most of it to the west of the road, with the cavalry swung outstill farther to the left.CHAPTER LXVI.BATTLE OF SAILOR'S CREEK--ENGAGEMENT AT FARMVILLE--CORRESPONDENCE WITHGENERAL LEE--SHERIDAN INTERCEPTS THE ENEMY.The Appomattox, going westward, takes a long sweep to the south-westfrom the neighborhood of the Richmond and Danville Railroad bridge, andthen trends north-westerly.  Sailor's Creek, an insignificant stream,running northward, empties into the Appomattox between the High Bridgeand Jetersville.  Near the High Bridge the stage road from Petersburg toLynchburg crosses the Appomattox River, also on a bridge.  The railroadruns on the north side of the river to Farmville, a few miles west, andfrom there, recrossing, continues on the south side of it.  The roadscoming up from the south-east to Farmville cross the Appomattox Riverthere on a bridge and run on the north side, leaving the Lynchburg andPetersburg Railroad well to the left.Lee, in pushing out from Amelia Court House, availed himself of all theroads between the Danville Road and Appomattox River to move upon, andnever permitted the head of his columns to stop because of any fightingthat might be going on in his rear.  In this way he came very nearsucceeding in getting to his provision trains and eluding us with atleast part of his army.As expected, Lee's troops had moved during the night before, and ourarmy in moving upon Amelia Court House soon encountered them.  There wasa good deal of fighting before Sailor's Creek was reached.  Our cavalrycharged in upon a body of theirs which was escorting a wagon train inorder to get it past our left.  A severe engagement ensued, in which wecaptured many prisoners, and many men also were killed and wounded.There was as much gallantry displayed by some of the Confederates inthese little engagements as was displayed at any time during the war,notwithstanding the sad defeats of the past week.The armies finally met on Sailor's Creek, when a heavy engagement tookplace, in which infantry, artillery and cavalry were all brought intoaction.  Our men on the right, as they were brought in against theenemy, came in on higher ground, and upon his flank, giving us everyadvantage to be derived from the lay of the country.  Our firing wasalso very much more rapid, because the enemy commenced his retreatwestward and in firing as he retreated had to turn around every time hefired.  The enemy's loss was very heavy, as well in killed and woundedas in captures.  Some six general officers fell into our hands in thisengagement, and seven thousand men were made prisoners.  This engagementwas commenced in the middle of the afternoon of the 6th, and the retreatand pursuit were continued until nightfall, when the armies bivouackedupon the ground where the night had overtaken them.When the move towards Amelia Court House had commenced that morning, Iordered Wright's corps, which was on the extreme right, to be moved tothe left past the whole army, to take the place of Griffin's, andordered the latter at the same time to move by and place itself on theright.  The object of this movement was to get the 6th corps, Wright's,next to the cavalry, with which they had formerly served so harmoniouslyand so efficiently in the valley of Virginia.The 6th corps now remained with the cavalry and under Sheridan's directcommand until after the surrender.Ord had been directed to take possession of all the roads southwardbetween Burkesville and the High Bridge.  On the morning of the 6th hesent Colonel Washburn with two infantry regiments with instructions todestroy High Bridge and to return rapidly to Burkesville Station; and heprepared himself to resist the enemy there.  Soon after Washburn hadstarted Ord became a little alarmed as to his safety and sent ColonelRead, of his staff, with about eighty cavalrymen, to overtake him andbring him back.  Very shortly after this he heard that the head of Lee'scolumn had got up to the road between him and where Washburn now was,and attempted to send reinforcements, but the reinforcements could notget through.  Read, however, had got through ahead of the enemy.  Herode on to Farmville and was on his way back again when he found hisreturn cut off, and Washburn confronting apparently the advance of Lee'sarmy.  Read drew his men up into line of battle, his force nowconsisting of less than six hundred men, infantry and cavalry, and rodealong their front, making a speech to his men to inspire them with thesame enthusiasm that he himself felt.  He then gave the order to charge.This little band made several charges, of course unsuccessful ones, butinflicted a loss upon the enemy more than equal to their own entirenumber.  Colonel Read fell mortally wounded, and then Washburn; and atthe close of the conflict nearly every officer of the command and mostof the rank and file had been either killed or wounded.  The remainderthen surrendered.  The Confederates took this to be only the advance ofa larger column which had headed them off, and so stopped to intrench;so that this gallant band of six hundred had checked the progress of astrong detachment of the Confederate army.This stoppage of Lee's column no doubt saved to us the trains following.Lee himself pushed on and crossed the wagon road bridge near the HighBridge, and attempted to destroy it.  He did set fire to it, but theflames had made but little headway when Humphreys came up with his corpsand drove away the rear-guard which had been left to protect it while itwas being burned up.  Humphreys forced his way across with some loss,and followed Lee to the intersection of the road crossing at Farmvillewith the one from Petersburg.  Here Lee held a position which was verystrong, naturally, besides being intrenched.  Humphreys was alone,confronting him all through the day, and in a very hazardous position.He put on a bold face, however, and assaulted with some loss, but wasnot assaulted in return.Our cavalry had gone farther south by the way of Prince Edward's CourtHouse, along with the 5th corps (Griffin's), Ord falling in betweenGriffin and the Appomattox.  Crook's division of cavalry and Wright'scorps pushed on west of Farmville.  When the cavalry reached Farmvillethey found that some of the Confederates were in ahead of them, and hadalready got their trains of provisions back to that point; but ourtroops were in time to prevent them from securing anything to eat,although they succeeded in again running the trains off, so that we didnot get them for some time.  These troops retreated to the north side ofthe Appomattox to join Lee, and succeeded in destroying the bridge afterthem.  Considerable fighting ensued there between Wright's corps and aportion of our cavalry and the Confederates, but finally the cavalryforded the stream and drove them away.  Wright built a foot-bridge forhis men to march over on and then marched out to the junction of theroads to relieve Humphreys, arriving there that night.  I had stoppedthe night before at Burkesville Junction.  Our troops were then prettymuch all out of the place, but we had a field hospital there, and Ord'scommand was extended from that point towards Farmville.Here I met Dr. Smith, a Virginian and an officer of the regular army,who told me that in a conversation with General Ewell, one of theprisoners and a relative of his, Ewell had said that when we had gotacross the James River he knew their cause was lost, and it was the dutyof their authorities to make the best terms they could while they stillhad a right to claim concessions. The authorities thought differently,however.  Now the cause was lost and they had no right to claimanything.  He said further, that for every man that was killed afterthis in the war somebody is responsible, and it would be but very littlebetter than murder.  He was not sure that Lee would consent to surrenderhis army without being able to consult with the President, but he hopedhe would.I rode in to Farmville on the 7th, arriving there early in the day.Sheridan and Ord were pushing through, away to the south.  Meade wasback towards the High Bridge, and Humphreys confronting Lee as beforestated.  After having gone into bivouac at Prince Edward's Court House,Sheridan learned that seven trains of provisions and forage were atAppomattox, and determined to start at once and capture them; and aforced march was necessary in order to get there before Lee's army couldsecure them.  He wrote me a note telling me this.  This fact, togetherwith the incident related the night before by Dr. Smith, gave me theidea of opening correspondence with General Lee on the subject of thesurrender of his army.  I therefore wrote to him on this day, asfollows:HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S., 5 P.M., April 7, 1865.GENERAL R. E. LEE Commanding C. S. A.The result of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness offurther resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia in thisstruggle.  I feel that it is so, and regard it as my duty to shift frommyself the responsibility of any further effusion of blood, by asking ofyou the surrender of that portion of the Confederate States army knownas the Army of Northern Virginia.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Lee replied on the evening of the same day as follows:April 7, 1865.GENERAL:  I have received your note of this day.  Though notentertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of furtherresistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia, I reciprocateyour desire to avoid useless effusion of blood, and therefore beforeconsidering your proposition, ask the terms you will offer on conditionof its surrender.R. E. LEE, General.LIEUT.-GENERAL U. S. GRANT, Commanding Armies of the U. S.This was not satisfactory, but I regarded it as deserving another letterand wrote him as follows:April 8, 1865.GENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding C. S. A.Your note of last evening in reply to mine of same date, asking thecondition on which I will accept the surrender of the Army of NorthernVirginia is just received.  In reply I would say that, peace being mygreat desire, there is but one condition I would insist upon, namely:that the men and officers surrendered shall be disqualified for takingup arms again against the Government of the United States until properlyexchanged.  I will meet you, or will designate officers to meet anyofficers you may name for the same purpose, at any point agreeable toyou, for the purpose of arranging definitely the terms upon which thesurrender of the Army of Northern Virginia will be received.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Lee's army was rapidly crumbling.  Many of his soldiers had enlistedfrom that part of the State where they now were, and were continuallydropping out of the ranks and going to their homes.  I know that Ioccupied a hotel almost destitute of furniture at Farmville, which hadprobably been used as a Confederate hospital.  The next morning when Icame out I found a Confederate colonel there, who reported to me andsaid that he was the proprietor of that house, and that he was a colonelof a regiment that had been raised in that neighborhood.  He said thatwhen he came along past home, he found that he was the only man of theregiment remaining with Lee's army, so he just dropped out, and nowwanted to surrender himself.  I told him to stay there and he would notbe molested.  That was one regiment which had been eliminated from Lee'sforce by this crumbling process.Although Sheridan had been marching all day, his troops moved withalacrity and without any straggling.  They began to see the end of whatthey had been fighting four years for.  Nothing seemed to fatigue them.They were ready to move without rations and travel without rest untilthe end.  Straggling had entirely ceased, and every man was now a rivalfor the front.  The infantry marched about as rapidly as the cavalrycould.Sheridan sent Custer with his division to move south of AppomattoxStation, which is about five miles south-west of the Court House, to getwest of the trains and destroy the roads to the rear.  They got therethe night of the 8th, and succeeded partially; but some of the train menhad just discovered the movement of our troops and succeeded in runningoff three of the trains.  The other four were held by Custer.The head of Lee's column came marching up there on the morning of the9th, not dreaming, I suppose, that there were any Union soldiers near.The Confederates were surprised to find our cavalry had possession ofthe trains.  However, they were desperate and at once assaulted, hopingto recover them.  In the melee that ensued they succeeded in burning oneof the trains, but not in getting anything from it.  Custer then orderedthe other trains run back on the road towards Farmville, and the fightcontinued.So far, only our cavalry and the advance of Lee's army were engaged.Soon, however, Lee's men were brought up from the rear, no doubtexpecting they had nothing to meet but our cavalry.  But our infantryhad pushed forward so rapidly that by the time the enemy got up theyfound Griffin's corps and the Army of the James confronting them.  Asharp engagement ensued, but Lee quickly set up a white flag.CHAPTER LXVII.NEGOTIATIONS AT APPOMATTOX--INTERVIEW WITH LEE AT MCLEAN'S HOUSE--THETERMS OF SURRENDER--LEE'S SURRENDER--INTERVIEW WITH LEE AFTER THESURRENDER.On the 8th I had followed the Army of the Potomac in rear of Lee.  I wassuffering very severely with a sick headache, and stopped at a farmhouseon the road some distance in rear of the main body of the army.  I spentthe night in bathing my feet in hot water and mustard, and puttingmustard plasters on my wrists and the back part of my neck, hoping to becured by morning. During the night I received Lee's answer to my letterof the 8th, inviting an interview between the lines on the followingmorning. (*43)  But it was for a different purpose from that ofsurrendering his army, and I answered him as follows:HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S., April 9, 1865.GENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding C. S. A.Your note of yesterday is received.  As I have no authority to treat onthe subject of peace, the meeting proposed for ten A.M. to-day couldlead to no good.  I will state, however, General, that I am equallyanxious for peace with yourself, and the whole North entertains the samefeeling.  The terms upon which peace can be had are well understood.  Bythe South laying down their arms they will hasten that most desirableevent, save thousands of human lives and hundreds of millions ofproperty not yet destroyed.  Sincerely hoping that all our difficultiesmay be settled without the loss of another life, I subscribe myself,etc.,U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.I proceeded at an early hour in the morning, still suffering with theheadache, to get to the head of the column.  I was not more than two orthree miles from Appomattox Court House at the time, but to go direct Iwould have to pass through Lee's army, or a portion of it.  I hadtherefore to move south in order to get upon a road coming up fromanother direction.When the white flag was put out by Lee, as already described, I was inthis way moving towards Appomattox Court House, and consequently couldnot be communicated with immediately, and be informed of what Lee haddone.  Lee, therefore, sent a flag to the rear to advise Meade and oneto the front to Sheridan, saying that he had sent a message to me forthe purpose of having a meeting to consult about the surrender of hisarmy, and asked for a suspension of hostilities until I could becommunicated with.  As they had heard nothing of this until the fightinghad got to be severe and all going against Lee, both of these commandershesitated very considerably about suspending hostilities at all.  Theywere afraid it was not in good faith, and we had the Army of NorthernVirginia where it could not escape except by some deception.  They,however, finally consented to a suspension of hostilities for two hoursto give an opportunity of communicating with me in that time, ifpossible.  It was found that, from the route I had taken, they wouldprobably not be able to communicate with me and get an answer backwithin the time fixed unless the messenger should pass through the rebellines.Lee, therefore, sent an escort with the officer bearing this messagethrough his lines to me.April 9, 1865.GENERAL:  I received your note of this morning on the picket-linewhither I had come to meet you and ascertain definitely what terms wereembraced in your proposal of yesterday with reference to the surrenderof this army.  I now request an interview in accordance with the offercontained in your letter of yesterday for that purpose.R. E. LEE, General.LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT Commanding U. S. Armies.When the officer reached me I was still suffering with the sickheadache, but the instant I saw the contents of the note I was cured.  Iwrote the following note in reply and hastened on:April 9, 1865.GENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding C. S. Armies.Your note of this date is but this moment (11.50 A.M.) received, inconsequence of my having passed from the Richmond and Lynchburg road tothe Farmville and Lynchburg road.  I am at this writing about four mileswest of Walker's Church and will push forward to the front for thepurpose of meeting you. Notice sent to me on this road where you wishthe interview to take place will meet me.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.I was conducted at once to where Sheridan was located with his troopsdrawn up in line of battle facing the Confederate army near by.  Theywere very much excited, and expressed their view that this was all aruse employed to enable the Confederates to get away.  They said theybelieved that Johnston was marching up from North Carolina now, and Leewas moving to join him; and they would whip the rebels where they nowwere in five minutes if I would only let them go in.  But I had no doubtabout the good faith of Lee, and pretty soon was conducted to where hewas.  I found him at the house of a Mr. McLean, at Appomattox CourtHouse, with Colonel Marshall, one of his staff officers, awaiting myarrival.  The head of his column was occupying a hill, on a portion ofwhich was an apple orchard, beyond a little valley which separated itfrom that on the crest of which Sheridan's forces were drawn up in lineof battle to the south.Before stating what took place between General Lee and myself, I willgive all there is of the story of the famous apple tree.Wars produce many stories of fiction, some of which are told until theyare believed to be true.  The war of the rebellion was no exception tothis rule, and the story of the apple tree is one of those fictionsbased on a slight foundation of fact. As I have said, there was an appleorchard on the side of the hill occupied by the Confederate forces.Running diagonally up the hill was a wagon road, which, at one point,ran very near one of the trees, so that the wheels of vehicles had, onthat side, cut off the roots of this tree, leaving a little embankment.General Babcock, of my staff, reported to me that when he first metGeneral Lee he was sitting upon this embankment with his feet in theroad below and his back resting against the tree.  The story had noother foundation than that.  Like many other stories, it would be verygood if it was only true.I had known General Lee in the old army, and had served with him in theMexican War; but did not suppose, owing to the difference in our age andrank, that he would remember me, while I would more naturally rememberhim distinctly, because he was the chief of staff of General Scott inthe Mexican War.When I had left camp that morning I had not expected so soon the resultthat was then taking place, and consequently was in rough garb.  I waswithout a sword, as I usually was when on horseback on the field, andwore a soldier's blouse for a coat, with the shoulder straps of my rankto indicate to the army who I was. When I went into the house I foundGeneral Lee.  We greeted each other, and after shaking hands took ourseats.  I had my staff with me, a good portion of whom were in the roomduring the whole of the interview.What General Lee's feelings were I do not know.  As he was a man of muchdignity, with an impassible face, it was impossible to say whether hefelt inwardly glad that the end had finally come, or felt sad over theresult, and was too manly to show it. Whatever his feelings, they wereentirely concealed from my observation; but my own feelings, which hadbeen quite jubilant on the receipt of his letter, were sad anddepressed.  I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfallof a foe who had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so muchfor a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst forwhich a people ever fought, and one for which there was the leastexcuse.  I do not question, however, the sincerity of the great mass ofthose who were opposed to us.General Lee was dressed in a full uniform which was entirely new, andwas wearing a sword of considerable value, very likely the sword whichhad been presented by the State of Virginia; at all events, it was anentirely different sword from the one that would ordinarily be worn inthe field.  In my rough traveling suit, the uniform of a private withthe straps of a lieutenant-general, I must have contrasted verystrangely with a man so handsomely dressed, six feet high and offaultless form. But this was not a matter that I thought of untilafterwards.We soon fell into a conversation about old army times.  He remarked thathe remembered me very well in the old army; and I told him that as amatter of course I remembered him perfectly, but from the difference inour rank and years (there being about sixteen years' difference in ourages), I had thought it very likely that I had not attracted hisattention sufficiently to be remembered by him after such a longinterval.  Our conversation grew so pleasant that I almost forgot theobject of our meeting.  After the conversation had run on in this stylefor some time, General Lee called my attention to the object of ourmeeting, and said that he had asked for this interview for the purposeof getting from me the terms I proposed to give his army.  I said that Imeant merely that his army should lay down their arms, not to take themup again during the continuance of the war unless duly and properlyexchanged.  He said that he had so understood my letter.Then we gradually fell off again into conversation about matters foreignto the subject which had brought us together.  This continued for somelittle time, when General Lee again interrupted the course of theconversation by suggesting that the terms I proposed to give his armyought to be written out. I called to General Parker, secretary on mystaff, for writing materials, and commenced writing out the followingterms:APPOMATTOX C. H., VA.,Ap 19th, 1865.GEN. R. E. LEE, Comd'g C. S. A.GEN:  In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the 8thinst., I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of N. Va. on thefollowing terms, to wit:  Rolls of all the officers and men to be madein duplicate.  One copy to be given to an officer designated by me, theother to be retained by such officer or officers as you may designate.The officers to give their individual paroles not to take up armsagainst the Government of the United States until properly exchanged,and each company or regimental commander sign a like parole for the menof their commands.  The arms, artillery and public property to be parkedand stacked, and turned over to the officer appointed by me to receivethem.  This will not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor theirprivate horses or baggage.  This done, each officer and man will beallowed to return to their homes, not to be disturbed by United Statesauthority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in forcewhere they may reside.Very respectfully, U. S. GRANT, Lt. Gen.When I put my pen to the paper I did not know the first word that Ishould make use of in writing the terms.  I only knew what was in mymind, and I wished to express it clearly, so that there could be nomistaking it.  As I wrote on, the thought occurred to me that theofficers had their own private horses and effects, which were importantto them, but of no value to us; also that it would be an unnecessaryhumiliation to call upon them to deliver their side arms.No conversation, not one word, passed between General Lee and myself,either about private property, side arms, or kindred subjects.  Heappeared to have no objections to the terms first proposed; or if he hada point to make against them he wished to wait until they were inwriting to make it.  When he read over that part of the terms about sidearms, horses and private property of the officers, he remarked, withsome feeling, I thought, that this would have a happy effect upon hisarmy.Then, after a little further conversation, General Lee remarked to meagain that their army was organized a little differently from the armyof the United States (still maintaining by implication that we were twocountries); that in their army the cavalrymen and artillerists ownedtheir own horses; and he asked if he was to understand that the men whoso owned their horses were to be permitted to retain them.  I told himthat as the terms were written they would not; that only the officerswere permitted to take their private property.  He then, after readingover the terms a second time, remarked that that was clear.I then said to him that I thought this would be about the last battle ofthe war--I sincerely hoped so; and I said further I took it that most ofthe men in the ranks were small farmers. The whole country had been soraided by the two armies that it was doubtful whether they would be ableto put in a crop to carry themselves and their families through the nextwinter without the aid of the horses they were then riding.  The UnitedStates did not want them and I would, therefore, instruct the officers Ileft behind to receive the paroles of his troops to let every man of theConfederate army who claimed to own a horse or mule take the animal tohis home.  Lee remarked again that this would have a happy effect.He then sat down and wrote out the following letter:HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865.GENERAL:--I received your letter of this date containing the terms ofthe surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.  Asthey are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the8th inst., they are accepted.  I will proceed to designate the properofficers to carry the stipulations into effect.R. E. LEE, General. LIEUT.-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.While duplicates of the two letters were being made, the Union generalspresent were severally presented to General Lee.The much talked of surrendering of Lee's sword and my handing it back,this and much more that has been said about it is the purest romance.The word sword or side arms was not mentioned by either of us until Iwrote it in the terms.  There was no premeditation, and it did not occurto me until the moment I wrote it down.  If I had happened to omit it,and General Lee had called my attention to it, I should have put it inthe terms precisely as I acceded to the provision about the soldiersretaining their horses.General Lee, after all was completed and before taking his leave,remarked that his army was in a very bad condition for want of food, andthat they were without forage; that his men had been living for somedays on parched corn exclusively, and that he would have to ask me forrations and forage.  I told him "certainly," and asked for how many menhe wanted rations.  His answer was "about twenty-five thousand;" and Iauthorized him to send his own commissary and quartermaster toAppomattox Station, two or three miles away, where he could have, out ofthe trains we had stopped, all the provisions wanted.  As for forage, wehad ourselves depended almost entirely upon the country for that.Generals Gibbon, Griffin and Merritt were designated by me to carry intoeffect the paroling of Lee's troops before they should start for theirhomes--General Lee leaving Generals Longstreet, Gordon and Pendleton forthem to confer with in order to facilitate this work.  Lee and I thenseparated as cordially as we had met, he returning to his own lines, andall went into bivouac for the night at Appomattox.Soon after Lee's departure I telegraphed to Washington as follows:HEADQUARTERS APPOMATTOX C. H., VA., April 9th, 1865, 4.30 P.M.HON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War, Washington.General Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia this afternoon onterms proposed by myself.  The accompanying additional correspondencewill show the conditions fully.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.When news of the surrender first reached our lines our men commencedfiring a salute of a hundred guns in honor of the victory.  I at oncesent word, however, to have it stopped.  The Confederates were now ourprisoners, and we did not want to exult over their downfall.I determined to return to Washington at once, with a view to putting astop to the purchase of supplies, and what I now deemed other uselessoutlay of money.  Before leaving, however, I thought I (*44) would liketo see General Lee again; so next morning I rode out beyond our linestowards his headquarters, preceded by a bugler and a staff-officercarrying a white flag.Lee soon mounted his horse, seeing who it was, and met me.  We had therebetween the lines, sitting on horseback, a very pleasant conversation ofover half an hour, in the course of which Lee said to me that the Southwas a big country and that we might have to march over it three or fourtimes before the war entirely ended, but that we would now be able to doit as they could no longer resist us.  He expressed it as his earnesthope, however, that we would not be called upon to cause more loss andsacrifice of life; but he could not foretell the result.  I thensuggested to General Lee that there was not a man in the Confederacywhose influence with the soldiery and the whole people was as great ashis, and that if he would now advise the surrender of all the armies Ihad no doubt his advice would be followed with alacrity.  But Lee said,that he could not do that without consulting the President first.  Iknew there was no use to urge him to do anything against his ideas ofwhat was right.I was accompanied by my staff and other officers, some of whom seemed tohave a great desire to go inside the Confederate lines.  They finallyasked permission of Lee to do so for the purpose of seeing some of theirold army friends, and the permission was granted.  They went over, had avery pleasant time with their old friends, and brought some of them backwith them when they returned.When Lee and I separated he went back to his lines and I returned to thehouse of Mr. McLean.  Here the officers of both armies came in greatnumbers, and seemed to enjoy the meeting as much as though they had beenfriends separated for a long time while fighting battles under the sameflag.  For the time being it looked very much as if all thought of thewar had escaped their minds.  After an hour pleasantly passed in thisway I set out on horseback, accompanied by my staff and a small escort,for Burkesville Junction, up to which point the railroad had by thistime been repaired.CHAPTER LXVIII.MORALE OF THE TWO ARMIES--RELATIVE CONDITIONS OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH--PRESIDENT LINCOLN VISITS RICHMOND--ARRIVAL AT WASHINGTON--PRESIDENTLINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION--PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S POLICY.After the fall of Petersburg, and when the armies of the Potomac and theJames were in motion to head off Lee's army, the morale of the Nationaltroops had greatly improved.  There was no more straggling, no more rearguards.  The men who in former times had been falling back, were now, asI have already stated, striving to get to the front.  For the first timein four weary years they felt that they were now nearing the time whenthey could return to their homes with their country saved.  On the otherhand, the Confederates were more than correspondingly depressed.  Theirdespondency increased with each returning day, and especially after thebattle of Sailor's Creek.  They threw away their arms in constantlyincreasing numbers, dropping out of the ranks and betaking themselves tothe woods in the hope of reaching their homes.  I have already instancedthe case of the entire disintegration of a regiment whose colonel I metat Farmville.  As a result of these and other influences, when Leefinally surrendered at Appomattox, there were only 28,356 officers andmen left to be paroled, and many of these were without arms.  It wasprobably this latter fact which gave rise to the statement sometimesmade, North and South, that Lee surrendered a smaller number of men thanwhat the official figures show.  As a matter of official record, and inaddition to the number paroled as given above, we captured between March29th and the date of surrender 19,132 Confederates, to say nothing ofLee's other losses, killed, wounded and missing, during the series ofdesperate conflicts which marked his headlong and determined flight.The same record shows the number of cannon, including those atAppomattox, to have been 689 between the dates named.There has always been a great conflict of opinion as to the number oftroops engaged in every battle, or all important battles, fought betweenthe sections, the South magnifying the number of Union troops engagedand belittling their own. Northern writers have fallen, in manyinstances, into the same error.  I have often heard gentlemen, who werethoroughly loyal to the Union, speak of what a splendid fight the Southhad made and successfully continued for four years before yielding, withtheir twelve million of people against our twenty, and of the twelvefour being colored slaves, non-combatants.  I will add to theirargument.  We had many regiments of brave and loyal men who volunteeredunder great difficulty from the twelve million belonging to the South.But the South had rebelled against the National government.  It was notbound by any constitutional restrictions.  The whole South was amilitary camp.  The occupation of the colored people was to furnishsupplies for the army.  Conscription was resorted to early, and embracedevery male from the age of eighteen to forty-five, excluding only thosephysically unfit to serve in the field, and the necessary number ofcivil officers of State and intended National government.  The old andphysically disabled furnished a good portion of these.  The slaves, thenon-combatants, one-third of the whole, were required to work in thefield without regard to sex, and almost without regard to age.  Childrenfrom the age of eight years could and did handle the hoe; they were notmuch older when they began to hold the plough.  The four million ofcolored non-combatants were equal to more than three times their numberin the North, age for age and sex for sex, in supplying food from thesoil to support armies.  Women did not work in the fields in the North,and children attended school.The arts of peace were carried on in the North.  Towns and cities grewduring the war.  Inventions were made in all kinds of machinery toincrease the products of a day's labor in the shop, and in the field.In the South no opposition was allowed to the government which had beenset up and which would have become real and respected if the rebellionhad been successful.  No rear had to be protected.  All the troops inservice could be brought to the front to contest every inch of groundthreatened with invasion.  The press of the South, like the people whoremained at home, were loyal to the Southern cause.In the North, the country, the towns and the cities presented about thesame appearance they do in time of peace.  The furnace was in blast, theshops were filled with workmen, the fields were cultivated, not only tosupply the population of the North and the troops invading the South,but to ship abroad to pay a part of the expense of the war.  In theNorth the press was free up to the point of open treason.  The citizencould entertain his views and express them.  Troops were necessary inthe Northern States to prevent prisoners from the Southern army beingreleased by outside force, armed and set at large to destroy by fire ourNorthern cities.  Plans were formed by Northern and Southern citizens toburn our cities, to poison the water supplying them, to spread infectionby importing clothing from infected regions, to blow up our river andlake steamers--regardless of the destruction of innocent lives.  Thecopperhead disreputable portion of the press magnified rebel successes,and belittled those of the Union army.  It was, with a large following,an auxiliary to the Confederate army.  The North would have been muchstronger with a hundred thousand of these men in the Confederate ranksand the rest of their kind thoroughly subdued, as the Union sentimentwas in the South, than we were as the battle was fought.As I have said, the whole South was a military camp.  The coloredpeople, four million in number, were submissive, and worked in the fieldand took care of the families while the able-bodied white men were atthe front fighting for a cause destined to defeat.  The cause waspopular, and was enthusiastically supported by the young men.  Theconscription took all of them.  Before the war was over, furtherconscriptions took those between fourteen and eighteen years of age asjunior reserves, and those between forty-five and sixty as seniorreserves.  It would have been an offence, directly after the war, andperhaps it would be now, to ask any able-bodied man in the South, whowas between the ages of fourteen and sixty at any time during the war,whether he had been in the Confederate army.  He would assert that hehad, or account for his absence from the ranks.  Under suchcircumstances it is hard to conceive how the North showed such asuperiority of force in every battle fought.  I know they did not.During 1862 and '3, John H. Morgan, a partisan officer, of no militaryeducation, but possessed of courage and endurance, operated in the rearof the Army of the Ohio in Kentucky and Tennessee.  He had no base ofsupplies to protect, but was at home wherever he went.  The armyoperating against the South, on the contrary, had to protect its linesof communication with the North, from which all supplies had to come tothe front.  Every foot of road had to be guarded by troops stationed atconvenient distances apart.  These guards could not render assistancebeyond the points where stationed.  Morgan Was foot-loose and couldoperate where, his information--always correct--led him to believe hecould do the greatest damage.  During the time he was operating in thisway he killed, wounded and captured several times the number he ever hadunder his command at any one time.  He destroyed many millions ofproperty in addition. Places he did not attack had to be guarded as ifthreatened by him.  Forrest, an abler soldier, operated farther west,and held from the National front quite as many men as could be sparedfor offensive operations.  It is safe to say that more than half theNational army was engaged in guarding lines of supplies, or were onleave, sick in hospital or on detail which prevented their bearing arms.Then, again, large forces were employed where no Confederate armyconfronted them.  I deem it safe to say that there were no largeengagements where the National numbers compensated for the advantage ofposition and intrenchment occupied by the enemy.While I was in pursuit of General Lee, the President went to Richmond incompany with Admiral Porter, and on board his flagship.  He found thepeople of that city in great consternation.  The leading citizens amongthe people who had remained at home surrounded him, anxious thatsomething should be done to relieve them from suspense.  General Weitzelwas not then in the city, having taken offices in one of the neighboringvillages after his troops had succeeded in subduing the conflagrationwhich they had found in progress on entering the Confederate capital.The President sent for him, and, on his arrival, a short interview washad on board the vessel, Admiral Porter and a leading citizen ofVirginia being also present. After this interview the President wrote anorder in about these words, which I quote from memory:  "General Weitzelis authorized to permit the body calling itself the Legislature ofVirginia to meet for the purpose of recalling the Virginia troops fromthe Confederate armies."Immediately some of the gentlemen composing that body wrote out a callfor a meeting and had it published in their papers.  This call, however,went very much further than Mr. Lincoln had contemplated, as he did notsay the "Legislature of Virginia" but "the body which called itself theLegislature of Virginia." Mr. Stanton saw the call as published in theNorthern papers the very next issue and took the liberty ofcountermanding the order authorizing any meeting of the Legislature, orany other body, and this notwithstanding the fact that the President wasnearer the spot than he was.This was characteristic of Mr. Stanton.  He was a man who neverquestioned his own authority, and who always did in war time what hewanted to do.  He was an able constitutional lawyer and jurist; but theConstitution was not an impediment to him while the war lasted.  In thislatter particular I entirely agree with the view he evidently held.  TheConstitution was not framed with a view to any such rebellion as that of1861-5.  While it did not authorize rebellion it made no provisionagainst it.  Yet the right to resist or suppress rebellion is asinherent as the right of self-defence, and as natural as the right of anindividual to preserve his life when in jeopardy.  The Constitution wastherefore in abeyance for the time being, so far as it in any wayaffected the progress and termination of the war.Those in rebellion against the government of the United States were notrestricted by constitutional provisions, or any other, except the actsof their Congress, which was loyal and devoted to the cause for whichthe South was then fighting.  It would be a hard case when one-third ofa nation, united in rebellion against the national authority, isentirely untrammeled, that the other two-thirds, in their efforts tomaintain the Union intact, should be restrained by a Constitutionprepared by our ancestors for the express purpose of insuring thepermanency of the confederation of the States.After I left General Lee at Appomattox Station, I went with my staff anda few others directly to Burkesville Station on my way to Washington.The road from Burkesville back having been newly repaired and the groundbeing soft, the train got off the track frequently, and, as a result, itwas after midnight of the second day when I reached City Point.  As soonas possible I took a dispatch-boat thence to Washington City.While in Washington I was very busy for a time in preparing thenecessary orders for the new state of affairs; communicating with mydifferent commanders of separate departments, bodies of troops, etc.But by the 14th I was pretty well through with this work, so as to beable to visit my children, who were then in Burlington, New Jersey,attending school.  Mrs. Grant was with me in Washington at the time, andwe were invited by President and Mrs. Lincoln to accompany them to thetheatre on the evening of that day.  I replied to the President's verbalinvitation to the effect, that if we were in the city we would takegreat pleasure in accompanying them; but that I was very anxious to getaway and visit my children, and if I could get through my work duringthe day I should do so.  I did get through and started by the eveningtrain on the 14th, sending Mr. Lincoln word, of course, that I would notbe at the theatre.At that time the railroad to New York entered Philadelphia on BroadStreet; passengers were conveyed in ambulances to the Delaware River,and then ferried to Camden, at which point they took the cars again.When I reached the ferry, on the east side of the City of Philadelphia,I found people awaiting my arrival there; and also dispatches informingme of the assassination of the President and Mr. Seward, and of theprobable assassination of the Vice President, Mr. Johnson, andrequesting my immediate return.It would be impossible for me to describe the feeling that overcame meat the news of these assassinations, more especially the assassinationof the President.  I knew his goodness of heart, his generosity, hisyielding disposition, his desire to have everybody happy, and above allhis desire to see all the people of the United States enter again uponthe full privileges of citizenship with equality among all.  I knew alsothe feeling that Mr. Johnson had expressed in speeches and conversationagainst the Southern people, and I feared that his course towards themwould be such as to repel, and make them unwilling citizens; and if theybecame such they would remain so for a long while.  I felt thatreconstruction had been set back, no telling how far.I immediately arranged for getting a train to take me back to WashingtonCity; but Mrs. Grant was with me; it was after midnight and Burlingtonwas but an hour away.  Finding that I could accompany her to our houseand return about as soon as they would be ready to take me from thePhiladelphia station, I went up with her and returned immediately by thesame special train.  The joy that I had witnessed among the people inthe street and in public places in Washington when I left there, hadbeen turned to grief; the city was in reality a city of mourning.  Ihave stated what I believed then the effect of this would be, and myjudgment now is that I was right.  I believe the South would have beensaved from very much of the hardness of feeling that was engendered byMr. Johnson's course towards them during the first few months of hisadministration.  Be this as it may, Mr. Lincoln's assassination wasparticularly unfortunate for the entire nation.Mr. Johnson's course towards the South did engender bitterness offeeling.  His denunciations of treason and his ever-ready remark,"Treason is a crime and must be made odious," was repeated to all thosemen of the South who came to him to get some assurances of safety sothat they might go to work at something with the feeling that what theyobtained would be secure to them.  He uttered his denunciations withgreat vehemence, and as they were accompanied with no assurances ofsafety, many Southerners were driven to a point almost beyond endurance.The President of the United States is, in a large degree, or ought tobe, a representative of the feeling, wishes and judgment of those overwhom he presides; and the Southerners who read the denunciations ofthemselves and their people must have come to the conclusion that heuttered the sentiments of the Northern people; whereas, as a matter offact, but for the assassination of Mr. Lincoln, I believe the greatmajority of the Northern people, and the soldiers unanimously, wouldhave been in favor of a speedy reconstruction on terms that would be theleast humiliating to the people who had rebelled against theirgovernment.  They believed, I have no doubt, as I did, that besidesbeing the mildest, it was also the wisest, policy.The people who had been in rebellion must necessarily come back into theUnion, and be incorporated as an integral part of the nation.  Naturallythe nearer they were placed to an equality with the people who had notrebelled, the more reconciled they would feel with their oldantagonists, and the better citizens they would be from the beginning.They surely would not make good citizens if they felt that they had ayoke around their necks.I do not believe that the majority of the Northern people at that timewere in favor of negro suffrage.  They supposed that it would naturallyfollow the freedom of the negro, but that there would be a time ofprobation, in which the ex-slaves could prepare themselves for theprivileges of citizenship before the full right would be conferred; butMr. Johnson, after a complete revolution of sentiment, seemed to regardthe South not only as an oppressed people, but as the people bestentitled to consideration of any of our citizens.  This was more thanthe people who had secured to us the perpetuation of the Union wereprepared for, and they became more radical in their views.  TheSoutherners had the most power in the executive branch, Mr. Johnsonhaving gone to their side; and with a compact South, and such sympathyand support as they could get from the North, they felt that they wouldbe able to control the nation at once, and already many of them acted asif they thought they were entitled to do so.Thus Mr. Johnson, fighting Congress on the one hand, and receiving thesupport of the South on the other, drove Congress, which wasoverwhelmingly republican, to the passing of first one measure and thenanother to restrict his power.  There being a solid South on one sidethat was in accord with the political party in the North which hadsympathized with the rebellion, it finally, in the judgment of Congressand of the majority of the legislatures of the States, became necessaryto enfranchise the negro, in all his ignorance.  In this work, I shallnot discuss the question of how far the policy of Congress in thisparticular proved a wise one.  It became an absolute necessity, however,because of the foolhardiness of the President and the blindness of theSouthern people to their own interest.  As to myself, while stronglyfavoring the course that would be the least humiliating to the peoplewho had been in rebellion, I gradually worked up to the point where,with the majority of the people, I favored immediate enfranchisement.CHAPTER LXIX.SHERMAN AND JOHNSTON--JOHNSTON'S SURRENDER TO SHERMAN--CAPTURE OFMOBILE--WILSON'S EXPEDITION--CAPTURE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS--GENERALTHOMAS'S QUALITIES--ESTIMATE OF GENERAL CANBY.When I left Appomattox I ordered General Meade to proceed leisurely backto Burkesville Station with the Army of the Potomac and the Army of theJames, and to go into camp there until further orders from me.  GeneralJohnston, as has been stated before, was in North Carolina confrontingGeneral Sherman.  It could not be known positively, of course, whetherJohnston would surrender on the news of Lee's surrender, though Isupposed he would; and if he did not, Burkesville Station was thenatural point from which to move to attack him.  The army which I couldhave sent against him was superior to his, and that with which Shermanconfronted him was also superior; and between the two he wouldnecessarily have been crushed, or driven away.  With the loss of theircapital and the Army of Northern Virginia it was doubtful whetherJohnston's men would have the spirit to stand.  My belief was that hewould make no such attempt; but I adopted this course as a precautionagainst what might happen, however improbable.Simultaneously with my starting from City Point, I sent a messenger toNorth Carolina by boat with dispatches to General Sherman, informing himof the surrender of Lee and his army; also of the terms which I hadgiven him; and I authorized Sherman to give the same terms to Johnstonif the latter chose to accept them.  The country is familiar with theterms that Sherman agreed to CONDITIONALLY, because they embraced apolitical question as well as a military one and he would therefore haveto confer with the government before agreeing to them definitely.General Sherman had met Mr. Lincoln at City Point while visiting thereto confer with me about our final movement, and knew what Mr. Lincolnhad said to the peace commissioners when he met them at Hampton Roads,viz.:  that before he could enter into negotiations with them they wouldhave to agree to two points: one being that the Union should bepreserved, and the other that slavery should be abolished; and if theywere ready to concede these two points he was almost ready to sign hisname to a blank piece of paper and permit them to fill out the balanceof the terms upon which we would live together.  He had also seennotices in the newspapers of Mr. Lincoln's visit to Richmond, and hadread in the same papers that while there he had authorized the conveningof the Legislature of Virginia.Sherman thought, no doubt, in adding to the terms that I had made withgeneral Lee, that he was but carrying out the wishes of the President ofthe United States.  But seeing that he was going beyond his authority,he made it a point that the terms were only conditional.  They signedthem with this understanding, and agreed to a truce until the termscould be sent to Washington for approval; if approved by the properauthorities there, they would then be final; if not approved, then hewould give due notice, before resuming hostilities.  As the world knows,Sherman, from being one of the most popular generals of the land(Congress having even gone so far as to propose a bill providing for asecond lieutenant-general for the purpose of advancing him to thatgrade), was denounced by the President and Secretary of War in verybitter terms.  Some people went so far as to denounce him as a traitor--a most preposterous term to apply to a man who had rendered so muchservice as he had, even supposing he had made a mistake in granting suchterms as he did to Johnston and his army.  If Sherman had takenauthority to send Johnston with his army home, with their arms to be putin the arsenals of their own States, without submitting the question tothe authorities at Washington, the suspicions against him might havesome foundation.  But the feeling against Sherman died out very rapidly,and it was not many weeks before he was restored to the fullestconfidence of the American people.When, some days after my return to Washington, President Johnson and theSecretary of war received the terms which General Sherman had forwardedfor approval, a cabinet meeting was immediately called and I was sentfor.  There seemed to be the greatest consternation, lest Sherman wouldcommit the government to terms which they were not willing to accede toand which he had no right to grant.  A message went out directing thetroops in the South not to obey General Sherman.  I was ordered toproceed at once to North Carolina and take charge of matter theremyself. Of course I started without delay, and reached there as soon aspossible.  I repaired to Raleigh, where Sherman was, as quietly aspossible, hoping to see him without even his army learning of mypresence.When I arrived I went to Sherman's headquarters, and we were at oncecloseted together.  I showed him the instruction and orders under whichI visited him.  I told him that I wanted him to notify General Johnstonthat the terms which they had conditionally agreed upon had not beenapproved in Washington, and that he was authorized to offer the sameterms I had given General Lee.  I sent Sherman to do this himself.  Idid not wish the knowledge of my presence to be known to the armygenerally; so I left it to Sherman to negotiate the terms of thesurrender solely by himself, and without the enemy knowing that I wasanywhere near the field.  As soon as possible I started to get away, toleave Sherman quite free and untrammelled.At Goldsboro', on my way back, I met a mail, containing the lastnewspapers, and I found in them indications of great excitement in theNorth over the terms Sherman had given Johnston; and harsh orders thathad been promulgated by the President and Secretary of War.  I knew thatSherman must see these papers, and I fully realized what greatindignation they would cause him, though I do not think his feelingscould have been more excited than were my own.  But like the true andloyal soldier that he was, he carried out the instructions I had givenhim, obtained the surrender of Johnston's army, and settled down in hiscamp about Raleigh, to await final orders.There were still a few expeditions out in the South that could not becommunicated with, and had to be left to act according to the judgmentof their respective commanders.  With these it was impossible to tellhow the news of the surrender of Lee and Johnston, of which they musthave heard, might affect their judgment as to what was best to do.The three expeditions which I had tried so hard to get off from thecommands of Thomas and Canby did finally get off:  one under Canbyhimself, against Mobile, late in March; that under Stoneman from EastTennessee on the 20th; and the one under Wilson, starting from Eastport,Mississippi, on the 22d of March.  They were all eminently successful,but without any good result. Indeed much valuable property was destroyedand many lives lost at a time when we would have liked to spare them.The war was practically over before their victories were gained.  Theywere so late in commencing operations, that they did not hold any troopsaway that otherwise would have been operating against the armies whichwere gradually forcing the Confederate armies to a surrender.  The onlypossible good that we may have experienced from these raids was byStoneman's getting near Lynchburg about the time the armies of thePotomac and the James were closing in on Lee at Appomattox.Stoneman entered North Carolina and then pushed north to strike theVirginia and Tennessee Railroad.  He got upon that road, destroyed itsbridges at different places and rendered the road useless to the enemyup to within a few miles of Lynchburg.  His approach caused theevacuation of that city about the time we were at Appomattox, and wasthe cause of a commotion we heard of there.  He then pushed south, andwas operating in the rear of Johnston's army about the time thenegotiations were going on between Sherman and Johnston for the latter'ssurrender.  In this raid Stoneman captured and destroyed a large amountof stores, while fourteen guns and nearly two thousand prisoners werethe trophies of his success.Canby appeared before Mobile on the 27th of March.  The city of Mobilewas protected by two forts, besides other intrenchments--Spanish Fort,on the east side of the bay, and Fort Blakely, north of the city.  Theseforts were invested.  On the night of the 8th of April, the Nationaltroops having carried the enemy's works at one point, Spanish Fort wasevacuated; and on the 9th, the very day of Lee's surrender, Blakely wascarried by assault, with a considerable loss to us.  On the 11th thecity was evacuated.I had tried for more than two years to have an expedition sent againstMobile when its possession by us would have been of great advantage.  Itfinally cost lives to take it when its possession was of no importance,and when, if left alone, it would within a few days have fallen into ourhands without any bloodshed whatever.Wilson moved out with full 12,000 men, well equipped and well armed.  Hewas an energetic officer and accomplished his work rapidly.  Forrest wasin his front, but with neither his old-time army nor his old-timeprestige.  He now had principally conscripts.  His conscripts weregenerally old men and boys.  He had a few thousand regular cavalry left,but not enough to even retard materially the progress of Wilson'scavalry.  Selma fell on the 2d of April, with a large number ofprisoners and a large quantity of war material, machine shops, etc., tobe disposed of by the victors.  Tuscaloosa, Montgomery and West Pointfell in quick succession.  These were all important points to the enemyby reason of their railroad connections, as depots of supplies, andbecause of their manufactories of war material.  They were fortified orintrenched, and there was considerable fighting before they werecaptured.  Macon surrendered on the 21st of April.  Here news wasreceived of the negotiations for the surrender of Johnston's army.Wilson belonged to the military division commanded by Sherman, and ofcourse was bound by his terms.  This stopped all fighting.General Richard Taylor had now become the senior Confederate officerstill at liberty east of the Mississippi River, and on the 4th of May hesurrendered everything within the limits of this extensive command.General E. Kirby Smith surrendered the trans-Mississippi department onthe 26th of May, leaving no other Confederate army at liberty tocontinue the war.Wilson's raid resulted in the capture of the fugitive president of thedefunct confederacy before he got out of the country. This occurred atIrwinsville, Georgia, on the 11th of May.  For myself, and I believe Mr.Lincoln shared the feeling, I would have been very glad to have seen Mr.Davis succeed in escaping, but for one reason:  I feared that if notcaptured, he might get into the trans-Mississippi region and there setup a more contracted confederacy.  The young men now out of homes andout of employment might have rallied under his standard and protractedthe war yet another year.  The Northern people were tired of the war,they were tired of piling up a debt which would be a further mortgageupon their homes.Mr. Lincoln, I believe, wanted Mr. Davis to escape, because he did notwish to deal with the matter of his punishment.  He knew there would bepeople clamoring for the punishment of the ex-Confederate president, forhigh treason.  He thought blood enough had already been spilled to atonefor our wickedness as a nation.  At all events he did not wish to be thejudge to decide whether more should be shed or not.  But his own lifewas sacrificed at the hands of an assassin before the ex-president ofthe Confederacy was a prisoner in the hands of the government which hehad lent all his talent and all his energies to destroy.All things are said to be wisely directed, and for the best interest ofall concerned.  This reflection does not, however, abate in theslightest our sense of bereavement in the untimely loss of so good andgreat a man as Abraham Lincoln.He would have proven the best friend the South could have had, and savedmuch of the wrangling and bitterness of feeling brought out byreconstruction under a President who at first wished to revenge himselfupon Southern men of better social standing than himself, but who stillsought their recognition, and in a short time conceived the idea andadvanced the proposition to become their Moses to lead them triumphantlyout of all their difficulties.The story of the legislation enacted during the reconstruction period tostay the hands of the President is too fresh in the minds of the peopleto be told now.  Much of it, no doubt, was unconstitutional; but it washoped that the laws enacted would serve their purpose before thequestion of constitutionality could be submitted to the judiciary and adecision obtained. These laws did serve their purpose, and now remain "adead letter" upon the statute books of the United States, no one takinginterest enough in them to give them a passing thought.Much was said at the time about the garb Mr. Davis was wearing when hewas captured.  I cannot settle this question from personal knowledge ofthe facts; but I have been under the belief, from information given tome by General Wilson shortly after the event, that when Mr. Davislearned that he was surrounded by our cavalry he was in his tent dressedin a gentleman's dressing gown.  Naturally enough, Mr. Davis wanted toescape, and would not reflect much how this should be accomplishedprovided it might be done successfully.  If captured, he would be noordinary prisoner.  He represented all there was of that hostility tothe government which had caused four years of the bloodiest war--and themost costly in other respects of which history makes any record.  Everyone supposed he would be tried for treason if captured, and that hewould be executed.  Had he succeeded in making his escape in anydisguise it would have been adjudged a good thing afterwards by hisadmirers.As my official letters on file in the War Department, as well as myremarks in this book, reflect upon General Thomas by dwelling somewhatupon his tardiness, it is due to myself, as well as to him, that I givemy estimate of him as a soldier.  The same remark will apply also in thecase of General Canby.  I had been at West Point with Thomas one year,and had known him later in the old army.  He was a man of commandingappearance, slow and deliberate in speech and action; sensible, honestand brave.  He possessed valuable soldierly qualities in an eminentdegree.  He gained the confidence of all who served under him, andalmost their love.  This implies a very valuable quality.  It is aquality which calls out the most efficient services of the troopsserving under the commander possessing it.Thomas's dispositions were deliberately made, and always good. He couldnot be driven from a point he was given to hold.  He was not as good,however, in pursuit as he was in action.  I do not believe that he couldever have conducted Sherman's army from Chattanooga to Atlanta againstthe defences and the commander guarding that line in 1864.  On the otherhand, if it had been given him to hold the line which Johnston tried tohold, neither that general nor Sherman, nor any other officer could havedone it better.Thomas was a valuable officer, who richly deserved, as he has received,the plaudits of his countrymen for the part he played in the greattragedy of 1861-5.General Canby was an officer of great merit.  He was naturally studious,and inclined to the law.  There have been in the army but very few, ifany, officers who took as much interest in reading and digesting everyact of Congress and every regulation for the government of the army ashe.  His knowledge gained in this way made him a most valuable staffofficer, a capacity in which almost all his army services were renderedup to the time of his being assigned to the Military Division of theGulf.  He was an exceedingly modest officer, though of great talent andlearning.  I presume his feelings when first called upon to command alarge army against a fortified city, were somewhat like my own whenmarching a regiment against General Thomas Harris in Missouri in 1861.Neither of us would have felt the slightest trepidation in going intobattle with some one else commanding.  Had Canby been in otherengagements afterwards, he would, I have no doubt, have advanced withoutany fear arising from a sense of the responsibility.  He was afterwardskilled in the lava beds of Southern Oregon, while in pursuit of thehostile Modoc Indians.  His character was as pure as his talent andlearning were great.  His services were valuable during the war, butprincipally as a bureau officer.  I have no idea that it was from choicethat his services were rendered in an office, but because of hissuperior efficiency there.CHAPTER LXX.THE END OF THE WAR--THE MARCH TO WASHINGTON--ONE OF LINCOLN'S ANECDOTES--GRAND REVIEW AT WASHINGTON--CHARACTERISTICS OF LINCOLN AND STANTON--ESTIMATE OF THE DIFFERENT CORPS COMMANDERS.Things began to quiet down, and as the certainty that there would be nomore armed resistance became clearer, the troops in North Carolina andVirginia were ordered to march immediately to the capital, and go intocamp there until mustered out.  Suitable garrisons were left at theprominent places throughout the South to insure obedience to the lawsthat might be enacted for the government of the several States, and toinsure security to the lives and property of all classes.  I do not knowhow far this was necessary, but I deemed it necessary, at that time,that such a course should be pursued.  I think now that these garrisonswere continued after they ceased to be absolutely required; but it isnot to be expected that such a rebellion as was fought between thesections from 1861 to 1865 could terminate without leaving many seriousapprehensions in the mind of the people as to what should be done.Sherman marched his troops from Goldsboro, up to Manchester, on thesouth side of the James River, opposite Richmond, and there put them incamp, while he went back to Savannah to see what the situation wasthere.It was during this trip that the last outrage was committed upon him.Halleck had been sent to Richmond to command Virginia, and had issuedorders prohibiting even Sherman's own troops from obeying his,Sherman's, orders.  Sherman met the papers on his return, containingthis order of Halleck, and very justly felt indignant at the outrage.On his arrival at Fortress Monroe returning from Savannah, Shermanreceived an invitation from Halleck to come to Richmond and be hisguest.  This he indignantly refused, and informed Halleck, furthermore,that he had seen his order.  He also stated that he was coming up totake command of his troops, and as he marched through it would probablybe as well for Halleck not to show himself, because he (Sherman) wouldnot be responsible for what some rash person might do throughindignation for the treatment he had received.  Very soon after that,Sherman received orders from me to proceed to Washington City, and to gointo camp on the south side of the city pending the mustering-out of thetroops.There was no incident worth noting in the march northward fromGoldsboro, to Richmond, or in that from Richmond to Washington City.The army, however, commanded by Sherman, which had been engaged in allthe battles of the West and had marched from the Mississippi through theSouthern States to the sea, from there to Goldsboro, and thence toWashington City, had passed over many of the battle-fields of the Armyof the Potomac, thus having seen, to a greater extent than any otherbody of troops, the entire theatre of the four years' war for thepreservation of the Union.The march of Sherman's army from Atlanta to the sea and north toGoldsboro, while it was not accompanied with the danger that wasanticipated, yet was magnificent in its results, and equally magnificentin the way it was conducted.  It had an important bearing, in variousways, upon the great object we had in view, that of closing the war.All the States east of the Mississippi River up to the State of Georgia,had felt the hardships of the war.  Georgia, and South Carolina, andalmost all of North Carolina, up to this time, had been exempt frominvasion by the Northern armies, except upon their immediate sea coasts.Their newspapers had given such an account of Confederate success, thatthe people who remained at home had been convinced that the Yankees hadbeen whipped from first to last, and driven from pillar to post, andthat now they could hardly be holding out for any other purpose than tofind a way out of the war with honor to themselves.Even during this march of Sherman's the newspapers in his front wereproclaiming daily that his army was nothing better than a mob of men whowere frightened out of their wits and hastening, panic-stricken, to tryto get under the cover of our navy for protection against the Southernpeople.  As the army was seen marching on triumphantly, however, theminds of the people became disabused and they saw the true state ofaffairs.  In turn they became disheartened, and would have been glad tosubmit without compromise.Another great advantage resulting from this march, and which wascalculated to hasten the end, was the fact that the great storehouse ofGeorgia was entirely cut off from the Confederate armies.  As the troopsadvanced north from Savannah, the destruction of the railroads in SouthCarolina and the southern part of North Carolina, further cut off theirresources and left the armies still in Virginia and North Carolinadependent for supplies upon a very small area of country, already verymuch exhausted of food and forage.In due time the two armies, one from Burkesville Junction and the otherfrom the neighborhood of Raleigh, North Carolina, arrived and went intocamp near the Capital, as directed.  The troops were hardy, being inuredto fatigue, and they appeared in their respective camps as ready and fitfor duty as they had ever been in their lives.  I doubt whether an equalbody of men of any nation, take them man for man, officer for officer,was ever gotten together that would have proved their equal in a greatbattle.The armies of Europe are machines; the men are brave and the officerscapable; but the majority of the soldiers in most of the nations ofEurope are taken from a class of people who are not very intelligent andwho have very little interest in the contest in which they are calledupon to take part.  Our armies were composed of men who were able toread, men who knew what they were fighting for, and could not be inducedto serve as soldiers, except in an emergency when the safety of thenation was involved, and so necessarily must have been more than equalto men who fought merely because they were brave and because they werethoroughly drilled and inured to hardships.There was nothing of particular importance occurred during the timethese troops were in camp before starting North.I remember one little incident which I will relate as an anecdotecharacteristic of Mr. Lincoln.  It occurred a day after I reachedWashington, and about the time General Meade reached Burkesville withthe army.  Governor Smith of Virginia had left Richmond with theConfederate States government, and had gone to Danville.  Supposing Iwas necessarily with the army at Burkesville, he addressed a letter tome there informing me that, as governor of the Commonwealth of the Stateof Virginia, he had temporarily removed the State capital from Richmondto Danville, and asking if he would be permitted to perform thefunctions of his office there without molestation by the Federalauthorities.  I give this letter only in substance.  He also inquired ofme whether in case he was not allowed to perform the duties of hisoffice, he with a few others might not be permitted to leave the countryand go abroad without interference.  General Meade being informed that aflag of truce was outside his pickets with a letter to me, at once sentout and had the letter brought in without informing the officer whobrought it that I was not present.  He read the letter and telegraphedme its contents. Meeting Mr. Lincoln shortly after receiving thisdispatch, I repeated its contents to him.  Mr. Lincoln, supposing I wasasking for instructions, said, in reply to that part of Governor Smith'sletter which inquired whether he with a few friends would be permittedto leave the country unmolested, that his position was like that of acertain Irishman (giving the name) he knew in Springfield who was verypopular with the people, a man of considerable promise, and very muchliked.  Unfortunately he had acquired the habit of drinking, and hisfriends could see that the habit was growing on him.  These friendsdetermined to make an effort to save him, and to do this they drew up apledge to abstain from all alcoholic drinks.  They asked Pat to jointhem in signing the pledge, and he consented.  He had been so long outof the habit of using plain water as a beverage that he resorted tosoda-water as a substitute.  After a few days this began to growdistasteful to him.  So holding the glass behind him, he said:  "Doctor,couldn't you drop a bit of brandy in that unbeknownst to myself."I do not remember what the instructions were the President gave me, butI know that Governor Smith was not permitted to perform the duties ofhis office.  I also know that if Mr. Lincoln had been spared, therewould have been no efforts made to prevent any one from leaving thecountry who desired to do so.  He would have been equally willing topermit the return of the same expatriated citizens after they had timeto repent of their choice.On the 18th of May orders were issued by the adjutant-general for agrand review by the President and his cabinet of Sherman's and Meade'sarmies.  The review commenced on the 23d and lasted two days.  Meade'sarmy occupied over six hours of the first day in passing the grand standwhich had been erected in front of the President's house.  Shermanwitnessed this review from the grand stand which was occupied by thePresident and his cabinet.  Here he showed his resentment for the crueland harsh treatment that had unnecessarily been inflicted upon him bythe Secretary of War, by refusing to take his extended hand.Sherman's troops had been in camp on the south side of the Potomac.During the night of the 23d he crossed over and bivouacked not far fromthe Capitol.  Promptly at ten o'clock on the morning of the 24th, histroops commenced to pass in review.  Sherman's army made a differentappearance from that of the Army of the Potomac.  The latter had beenoperating where they received directly from the North full supplies offood and clothing regularly:  the review of this army therefore was thereview of a body of 65,000 well-drilled, well-disciplined and orderlysoldiers inured to hardship and fit for any duty, but without theexperience of gathering their own food and supplies in an enemy'scountry, and of being ever on the watch. Sherman's army was not sowell-dressed as the Army of the Potomac, but their marching could notbe excelled; they gave the appearance of men who had been thoroughlydrilled to endure hardships, either by long and continuous marches orthrough exposure to any climate, without the ordinary shelter of a camp.They exhibited also some of the order of march through Georgia where the"sweet potatoes sprung up from the ground" as Sherman's army wentmarching through.  In the rear of a company there would be a capturedhorse or mule loaded with small cooking utensils, captured chickens andother food picked up for the use of the men.  Negro families who hadfollowed the army would sometimes come along in the rear of a company,with three or four children packed upon a single mule, and the motherleading it.The sight was varied and grand:  nearly all day for two successive days,from the Capitol to the Treasury Building, could be seen a mass oforderly soldiers marching in columns of companies.  The National flagwas flying from almost every house and store; the windows were filledwith spectators; the door-steps and side-walks were crowded with coloredpeople and poor whites who did not succeed in securing better quartersfrom which to get a view of the grand armies.  The city was about asfull of strangers who had come to see the sights as it usually is oninauguration day when a new President takes his seat.It may not be out of place to again allude to President Lincoln and theSecretary of War, Mr. Stanton, who were the great conspicuous figures inthe executive branch of the government. There is no great difference ofopinion now, in the public mind, as to the characteristics of thePresident.  With Mr. Stanton the case is different.  They were the veryopposite of each other in almost every particular, except that eachpossessed great ability.  Mr. Lincoln gained influence over men bymaking them feel that it was a pleasure to serve him.  He preferredyielding his own wish to gratify others, rather than to insist uponhaving his own way.  It distressed him to disappoint others.  In mattersof public duty, however, he had what he wished, but in the leastoffensive way.  Mr. Stanton never questioned his own authority tocommand, unless resisted.  He cared nothing for the feeling of others.In fact it seemed to be pleasanter to him to disappoint than to gratify.He felt no hesitation in assuming the functions of the executive, or inacting without advising with him.  If his act was not sustained, hewould change it--if he saw the matter would be followed up until he didso.It was generally supposed that these two officials formed the complementof each other.  The Secretary was required to prevent the President'sbeing imposed upon.  The President was required in the more responsibleplace of seeing that injustice was not done to others.  I do not knowthat this view of these two men is still entertained by the majority ofthe people.  It is not a correct view, however, in my estimation.  Mr.Lincoln did not require a guardian to aid him in the fulfilment of apublic trust.Mr. Lincoln was not timid, and he was willing to trust his generals inmaking and executing their plans.  The Secretary was very timid, and itwas impossible for him to avoid interfering with the armies covering thecapital when it was sought to defend it by an offensive movement againstthe army guarding the Confederate capital.  He could see our weakness,but he could not see that the enemy was in danger.  The enemy would nothave been in danger if Mr. Stanton had been in the field.  Thesecharacteristics of the two officials were clearly shown shortly afterEarly came so near getting into the capital.Among the army and corps commanders who served with me during the warbetween the States, and who attracted much public attention, but ofwhose ability as soldiers I have not yet given any estimate, are Meade,Hancock, Sedgwick, Burnside, Terry and Hooker.  There were others ofgreat merit, such as Griffin, Humphreys, Wright and Mackenzie.  Of thosefirst named, Burnside at one time had command of the Army of thePotomac, and later of the Army of the Ohio.  Hooker also commanded theArmy of the Potomac for a short time.General Meade was an officer of great merit, with drawbacks to hisusefulness that were beyond his control.  He had been an officer of theengineer corps before the war, and consequently had never served withtroops until he was over forty-six years of age.  He never had, Ibelieve, a command of less than a brigade.  He saw clearly anddistinctly the position of the enemy, and the topography of the countryin front of his own position.  His first idea was to take advantage ofthe lay of the ground, sometimes without reference to the direction wewanted to move afterwards.  He was subordinate to his superiors in rankto the extent that he could execute an order which changed his own planswith the same zeal he would have displayed if the plan had been his own.He was brave and conscientious, and commanded the respect of all whoknew him.  He was unfortunately of a temper that would get beyond hiscontrol, at times, and make him speak to officers of high rank in themost offensive manner.  No one saw this fault more plainly than hehimself, and no one regretted it more.  This made it unpleasant attimes, even in battle, for those around him to approach him even withinformation.  In spite of this defect he was a most valuable officer anddeserves a high place in the annals of his country.General Burnside was an officer who was generally liked and respected.He was not, however, fitted to command an army.  No one knew this betterthan himself.  He always admitted his blunders, and extenuated those ofofficers under him beyond what they were entitled to.  It was hardly hisfault that he was ever assigned to a separate command.Of Hooker I saw but little during the war.  I had known him very wellbefore, however.  Where I did see him, at Chattanooga, his achievementin bringing his command around the point of Lookout Mountain and intoChattanooga Valley was brilliant.  I nevertheless regarded him as adangerous man.  He was not subordinate to his superiors.  He wasambitious to the extent of caring nothing for the rights of others.  Hisdisposition was, when engaged in battle, to get detached from the mainbody of the army and exercise a separate command, gathering to hisstandard all he could of his juniors.Hancock stands the most conspicuous figure of all the general officerswho did not exercise a separate command.  He commanded a corps longerthan any other one, and his name was never mentioned as having committedin battle a blunder for which he was responsible.  He was a man of veryconspicuous personal appearance.  Tall, well-formed and, at the time ofwhich I now write, young and fresh-looking, he presented an appearancethat would attract the attention of an army as he passed.  His genialdisposition made him friends, and his personal courage and his presencewith his command in the thickest of the fight won for him the confidenceof troops serving under him.  No matter how hard the fight, the 2d corpsalways felt that their commander was looking after them.Sedgwick was killed at Spottsylvania before I had an opportunity offorming an estimate of his qualifications as a soldier from personalobservation.  I had known him in Mexico when both of us werelieutenants, and when our service gave no indication that either of uswould ever be equal to the command of a brigade. He stood very high inthe army, however, as an officer and a man. He was brave andconscientious.  His ambition was not great, and he seemed to dreadresponsibility.  He was willing to do any amount of battling, but alwayswanted some one else to direct. He declined the command of the Army ofthe Potomac once, if not oftener.General Alfred H. Terry came into the army as a volunteer without amilitary education.  His way was won without political influence up toan important separate command--the expedition against Fort Fisher, inJanuary, 1865.  His success there was most brilliant, and won for himthe rank of brigadier-general in the regular army and of major-generalof volunteers.  He is a man who makes friends of those under him by hisconsideration of their wants and their dues.  As a commander, he wontheir confidence by his coolness in action and by his clearness ofperception in taking in the situation under which he was placed at anygiven time.Griffin, Humphreys, and Mackenzie were good corps commanders, but cameinto that position so near to the close of the war as not to attractpublic attention.  All three served as such, in the last campaign of thearmies of the Potomac and the James, which culminated at AppomattoxCourt House, on the 9th of April, 1865.  The sudden collapse of therebellion monopolized attention to the exclusion of almost everythingelse.  I regarded Mackenzie as the most promising young officer in thearmy.  Graduating at West Point, as he did, during the second year ofthe war, he had won his way up to the command of a corps before itsclose.  This he did upon his own merit and without influence.CONCLUSION.The cause of the great War of the Rebellion against the United Statuswill have to be attributed to slavery.  For some years before the warbegan it was a trite saying among some politicians that "A state halfslave and half free cannot exist."  All must become slave or all free,or the state will go down.  I took no part myself in any such view ofthe case at the time, but since the war is over, reviewing the wholequestion, I have come to the conclusion that the saying is quite true.Slavery was an institution that required unusual guarantees for itssecurity wherever it existed; and in a country like ours where thelarger portion of it was free territory inhabited by an intelligent andwell-to-do population, the people would naturally have but littlesympathy with demands upon them for its protection.  Hence the people ofthe South were dependent upon keeping control of the general governmentto secure the perpetuation of their favorite institution.  They wereenabled to maintain this control long after the States where slaveryexisted had ceased to have the controlling power, through the assistancethey received from odd men here and there throughout the NorthernStates.  They saw their power waning, and this led them to encroach uponthe prerogatives and independence of the Northern States by enactingsuch laws as the Fugitive Slave Law.  By this law every Northern manwas obliged, when properly summoned, to turn out and help apprehendthe runaway slave of a Southern man.  Northern marshals becameslave-catchers, and Northern courts had to contribute to the supportand protection of the institution.This was a degradation which the North would not permit any longer thanuntil they could get the power to expunge such laws from the statutebooks.  Prior to the time of these encroachments the great majority ofthe people of the North had no particular quarrel with slavery, so longas they were not forced to have it themselves.  But they were notwilling to play the role of police for the South in the protection ofthis particular institution.In the early days of the country, before we had railroads, telegraphsand steamboats--in a word, rapid transit of any sort--the States wereeach almost a separate nationality.  At that time the subject of slaverycaused but little or no disturbance to the public mind.  But the countrygrew, rapid transit was established, and trade and commerce between theStates got to be so much greater than before, that the power of theNational government became more felt and recognized and, therefore, hadto be enlisted in the cause of this institution.It is probably well that we had the war when we did.  We are better offnow than we would have been without it, and have made more rapidprogress than we otherwise should have made.  The civilized nations ofEurope have been stimulated into unusual activity, so that commerce,trade, travel, and thorough acquaintance among people of differentnationalities, has become common; whereas, before, it was but the fewwho had ever had the privilege of going beyond the limits of their owncountry or who knew anything about other people.  Then, too, ourrepublican institutions were regarded as experiments up to the breakingout of the rebellion, and monarchical Europe generally believed that ourrepublic was a rope of sand that would part the moment the slighteststrain was brought upon it.  Now it has shown itself capable of dealingwith one of the greatest wars that was ever made, and our people haveproven themselves to be the most formidable in war of any nationality.But this war was a fearful lesson, and should teach us the necessity ofavoiding wars in the future.The conduct of some of the European states during our troubles shows thelack of conscience of communities where the responsibility does not comeupon a single individual.  Seeing a nation that extended from ocean toocean, embracing the better part of a continent, growing as we weregrowing in population, wealth and intelligence, the European nationsthought it would be well to give us a check.  We might, possibly, aftera while threaten their peace, or, at least, the perpetuity of theirinstitutions.  Hence, England was constantly finding fault with theadministration at Washington because we were not able to keep up aneffective blockade.  She also joined, at first, with France and Spain insetting up an Austrian prince upon the throne in Mexico, totallydisregarding any rights or claims that Mexico had of being treated as anindependent power.  It is true they trumped up grievances as a pretext,but they were only pretexts which can always be found when wanted.Mexico, in her various revolutions, had been unable to give thatprotection to the subjects of foreign nations which she would have likedto give, and some of her revolutionary leaders had forced loans fromthem.  Under pretence of protecting their citizens, these nations seizedupon Mexico as a foothold for establishing a European monarchy upon ourcontinent, thus threatening our peace at home.  I, myself, regarded thisas a direct act of war against the United States by the powers engaged,and supposed as a matter of course that the United States would treat itas such when their hands were free to strike.  I often spoke of thematter to Mr. Lincoln and the Secretary of War, but never heard anyspecial views from them to enable me to judge what they thought or feltabout it.  I inferred that they felt a good deal as I did, but wereunwilling to commit themselves while we had our own troubles upon ourhands.All of the powers except France very soon withdrew from the armedintervention for the establishment of an Austrian prince upon the throneof Mexico; but the governing people of these countries continued to theclose of the war to throw obstacles in our way.  After the surrender ofLee, therefore, entertaining the opinion here expressed, I sent Sheridanwith a corps to the Rio Grande to have him where he might aid Juarez inexpelling the French from Mexico.  These troops got off before theycould be stopped; and went to the Rio Grande, where Sheridan distributedthem up and down the river, much to the consternation of the troops inthe quarter of Mexico bordering on that stream.  This soon led to arequest from France that we should withdraw our troops from the RioGrande and to negotiations for the withdrawal of theirs.  FinallyBazaine was withdrawn from Mexico by order of the French Government.From that day the empire began to totter.  Mexico was then able tomaintain her independence without aid from us.France is the traditional ally and friend of the United States.  I didnot blame France for her part in the scheme to erect a monarchy upon theruins of the Mexican Republic.  That was the scheme of one man, animitator without genius or merit.  He had succeeded in stealing thegovernment of his country, and made a change in its form against thewishes and instincts of his people.  He tried to play the part of thefirst Napoleon, without the ability to sustain that role.  He sought bynew conquests to add to his empire and his glory; but the signal failureof his scheme of conquest was the precursor of his own overthrow.Like our own war between the States, the Franco-Prussian war was anexpensive one; but it was worth to France all it cost her people.  Itwas the completion of the downfall of Napoleon III.  The beginning waswhen he landed troops on this continent.  Failing here, the prestige ofhis name--all the prestige he ever had--was gone.  He must achieve asuccess or fall.  He tried to strike down his neighbor, Prussia--andfell.I never admired the character of the first Napoleon; but I recognize hisgreat genius.  His work, too, has left its impress for good on the faceof Europe.  The third Napoleon could have no claim to having done a goodor just act.To maintain peace in the future it is necessary to be prepared for war.There can scarcely be a possible chance of a conflict, such as the lastone, occurring among our own people again; but, growing as we are, inpopulation, wealth and military power, we may become the envy of nationswhich led us in all these particulars only a few years ago; and unlesswe are prepared for it we may be in danger of a combined movement beingsome day made to crush us out.  Now, scarcely twenty years after thewar, we seem to have forgotten the lessons it taught, and are going onas if in the greatest security, without the power to resist an invasionby the fleets of fourth-rate European powers for a time until we couldprepare for them.We should have a good navy, and our sea-coast defences should be put inthe finest possible condition.  Neither of these cost much when it isconsidered where the money goes, and what we get in return.  Moneyexpended in a fine navy, not only adds to our security and tends toprevent war in the future, but is very material aid to our commerce withforeign nations in the meantime.  Money spent upon sea-coast defences isspent among our own people, and all goes back again among the people.The work accomplished, too, like that of the navy, gives us a feeling ofsecurity.England's course towards the United States during the rebellionexasperated the people of this country very much against the mothercountry.  I regretted it.  England and the United States are naturalallies, and should be the best of friends.  They speak one language, andare related by blood and other ties.  We together, or even eitherseparately, are better qualified than any other people to establishcommerce between all the nationalities of the world.England governs her own colonies, and particularly those embracingthe people of different races from her own, better than any othernation.  She is just to the conquered, but rigid.  She makes themself-supporting, but gives the benefit of labor to the laborer.  Shedoes not seem to look upon the colonies as outside possessions which sheis at liberty to work for the support and aggrandizement of the homegovernment.The hostility of England to the United States during our rebellion wasnot so much real as it was apparent.  It was the hostility of theleaders of one political party.  I am told that there was no time duringthe civil war when they were able to get up in England a demonstrationin favor of secession, while these were constantly being gotten up infavor of the Union, or, as they called it, in favor of the North.  Evenin Manchester, which suffered so fearfully by having the cotton cut offfrom her mills, they had a monster demonstration in favor of the Northat the very time when their workmen were almost famishing.It is possible that the question of a conflict between races may come upin the future, as did that between freedom and slavery before.  Thecondition of the colored man within our borders may become a source ofanxiety, to say the least.  But he was brought to our shores bycompulsion, and he now should be considered as having as good a right toremain here as any other class of our citizens.  It was looking to asettlement of this question that led me to urge the annexation of SantoDomingo during the time I was President of the United States.Santo Domingo was freely offered to us, not only by the administration,but by all the people, almost without price. The island is upon ourshores, is very fertile, and is capable of supporting fifteen millionsof people.  The products of the soil are so valuable that labor in herfields would be so compensated as to enable those who wished to go thereto quickly repay the cost of their passage.  I took it that the coloredpeople would go there in great numbers, so as to have independent statesgoverned by their own race.  They would still be States of the Union,and under the protection of the General Government; but the citizenswould be almost wholly colored.By the war with Mexico, we had acquired, as we have seen, territoryalmost equal in extent to that we already possessed. It was seen thatthe volunteers of the Mexican war largely composed the pioneers tosettle up the Pacific coast country. Their numbers, however, werescarcely sufficient to be a nucleus for the population of the importantpoints of the territory acquired by that war.  After our rebellion, whenso many young men were at liberty to return to their homes, they foundthey were not satisfied with the farm, the store, or the work-shop ofthe villages, but wanted larger fields.  The mines of the mountainsfirst attracted them; but afterwards they found that rich valleys andproductive grazing and farming lands were there.  This territory, thegeography of which was not known to us at the close of the rebellion, isnow as well mapped as any portion of our country.  Railroads traverse itin every direction, north, south, east, and west.  The mines are worked.The high lands are used for grazing purposes, and rich agriculturallands are found in many of the valleys.  This is the work of thevolunteer.  It is probable that the Indians would have had control ofthese lands for a century yet but for the war.  We must conclude,therefore, that wars are not always evils unmixed with some good.Prior to the rebellion the great mass of the people were satisfied toremain near the scenes of their birth.  In fact an immense majority ofthe whole people did not feel secure against coming to want should theymove among entire strangers.  So much was the country divided into smallcommunities that localized idioms had grown up, so that you could almosttell what section a person was from by hearing him speak.  Before, newterritories were settled by a "class"; people who shunned contact withothers; people who, when the country began to settle up around them,would push out farther from civilization.  Their guns furnished meat,and the cultivation of a very limited amount of the soil, their breadand vegetables.  All the streams abounded with fish.  Trapping wouldfurnish pelts to be brought into the States once a year, to pay fornecessary articles which they could not raise--powder, lead, whiskey,tobacco and some store goods.  Occasionally some little articles ofluxury would enter into these purchases--a quarter of a pound of tea,two or three pounds of coffee, more of sugar, some playing cards, and ifanything was left over of the proceeds of the sale, more whiskey.Little was known of the topography of the country beyond the settlementsof these frontiersmen.  This is all changed now. The war begot a spiritof independence and enterprise.  The feeling now is, that a youth mustcut loose from his old surroundings to enable him to get up in theworld.  There is now such a commingling of the people that particularidioms and pronunciation are no longer localized to any great extent;the country has filled up "from the centre all around to the sea";railroads connect the two oceans and all parts of the interior; maps,nearly perfect, of every part of the country are now furnished thestudent of geography.The war has made us a nation of great power and intelligence. We havebut little to do to preserve peace, happiness and prosperity at home,and the respect of other nations.  Our experience ought to teach us thenecessity of the first; our power secures the latter.I feel that we are on the eve of a new era, when there is to be greatharmony between the Federal and Confederate.  I cannot stay to be aliving witness to the correctness of this prophecy; but I feel it withinme that it is to be so.  The universally kind feeling expressed for meat a time when it was supposed that each day would prove my last, seemedto me the beginning of the answer to "Let us have peace."The expression of these kindly feelings were not restricted to a sectionof the country, nor to a division of the people.  They came fromindividual citizens of all nationalities; from all denominations--theProtestant, the Catholic, and the Jew; and from the various societies ofthe land--scientific, educational, religious or otherwise.  Politics didnot enter into the matter at all.I am not egotist enough to suppose all this significance should be givenbecause I was the object of it.  But the war between the States was avery bloody and a very costly war.  One side or the other had to yieldprinciples they deemed dearer than life before it could be brought to anend.  I commanded the whole of the mighty host engaged on the victoriousside.  I was, no matter whether deservedly so or not, a representativeof that side of the controversy.  It is a significant and gratifyingfact that Confederates should have joined heartily in this spontaneousmove.  I hope the good feeling inaugurated may continue to the end.APPENDIX.REPORT OF LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT, OF THE UNITED STATES ARMIES1864-65.HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, WASHINGTON, D. C., July 22,1865.HON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.SIR:  I have the honor to submit the following report of the operationsof the Armies of the United States from the date of my appointment tocommand the same.From an early period in the rebellion I had been impressed with the ideathat active and continuous operations of all the troops that could bebrought into the field, regardless of season and weather, were necessaryto a speedy termination of the war.  The resources of the enemy and hisnumerical strength were far inferior to ours; but as an offset to this,we had a vast territory, with a population hostile to the government, togarrison, and long lines of river and railroad communications toprotect, to enable us to supply the operating armies.The armies in the East and West acted independently and without concert,like a balky team, no two ever pulling together, enabling the enemy touse to great advantage his interior lines of communication fortransporting troops from East to West, reinforcing the army mostvigorously pressed, and to furlough large numbers, during seasons ofinactivity on our part, to go to their homes and do the work ofproducing, for the support of their armies.  It was a question whetherour numerical strength and resources were not more than balanced bythese disadvantages and the enemy's superior position.From the first, I was firm in the conviction that no peace could be hadthat would be stable and conducive to the happiness of the people, bothNorth and South, until the military power of the rebellion was entirelybroken.I therefore determined, first, to use the greatest number of troopspracticable against the armed force of the enemy; preventing him fromusing the same force at different seasons against first one and thenanother of our armies, and the possibility of repose for refitting andproducing necessary supplies for carrying on resistance.  Second, tohammer continuously against the armed force of the enemy and hisresources, until by mere attrition, if in no other way, there should benothing left to him but an equal submission with the loyal section ofour common country to the constitution and laws of the land.These views have been kept constantly in mind, and orders given andcampaigns made to carry them out.  Whether they might have been betterin conception and execution is for the people, who mourn the loss offriends fallen, and who have to pay the pecuniary cost, to say.  All Ican say is, that what I have done has been done conscientiously, to thebest of my ability, and in what I conceived to be for the best interestsof the whole country.At the date when this report begins, the situation of the contendingforces was about as follows:  The Mississippi River was stronglygarrisoned by Federal troops, from St.  Louis, Missouri, to its mouth.The line of the Arkansas was also held, thus giving us armed possessionof all west of the Mississippi, north of that stream.  A few points inSouthern Louisiana, not remote from the river, were held by us, togetherwith a small garrison at and near the mouth of the Rio Grande.  All thebalance of the vast territory of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas was inthe almost undisputed possession of the enemy, with an army of probablynot less than eighty thousand effective men, that could have beenbrought into the field had there been sufficient opposition to havebrought them out.  The let-alone policy had demoralized this force sothat probably but little more than one-half of it was ever present ingarrison at any one time.  But the one-half, or forty thousand men, withthe bands of guerillas scattered through Missouri, Arkansas, and alongthe Mississippi River, and the disloyal character of much of thepopulation, compelled the use of a large number of troops to keepnavigation open on the river, and to protect the loyal people to thewest of it.  To the east of the Mississippi we held substantially withthe line of the Tennessee and Holston rivers, running eastward toinclude nearly all of the State of Tennessee.  South of Chattanooga, asmall foothold had been obtained in Georgia, sufficient to protect EastTennessee from incursions from the enemy's force at Dalton, Georgia.West Virginia was substantially within our lines.  Virginia, with theexception of the northern border, the Potomac River, a small area aboutthe mouth of James River, covered by the troops at Norfolk and FortMonroe, and the territory covered by the Army of the Potomac lying alongthe Rapidan, was in the possession of the enemy.  Along the sea-coastfootholds had been obtained at Plymouth, Washington, and New Bern, inNorth Carolina; Beaufort, Folly and Morris Islands, Hilton Head, FortPulaski, and Port Royal, in South Carolina; Fernandina and St.Augustine, in Florida. Key West and Pensacola were also in ourpossession, while all the important ports were blockaded by the navy.The accompanying map, a copy of which was sent to General Sherman andother commanders in March, 1864, shows by red lines the territoryoccupied by us at the beginning of the rebellion, and at the opening ofthe campaign of 1864, while those in blue are the lines which it wasproposed to occupy.Behind the Union lines there were many bands of guerillas and a largepopulation disloyal to the government, making it necessary to guardevery foot of road or river used in supplying our armies.  In the South,a reign of military despotism prevailed, which made every man and boycapable of bearing arms a soldier; and those who could not bear arms inthe field acted as provosts for collecting deserters and returning them.This enabled the enemy to bring almost his entire strength into thefield.The enemy had concentrated the bulk of his forces east of theMississippi into two armies, commanded by Generals R. E. Lee and J. E.Johnston, his ablest and best generals.  The army commanded by Leeoccupied the south bank of the Rapidan, extending from Mine Runwestward, strongly intrenched, covering and defending Richmond, therebel capital, against the Army of the Potomac. The army under Johnstonoccupied a strongly intrenched position at Dalton, Georgia, covering anddefending Atlanta, Georgia, a place of great importance as a railroadcentre, against the armies under Major-General W. T. Sherman.  Inaddition to these armies he had a large cavalry force under Forrest, inNorth-east Mississippi; a considerable force, of all arms, in theShenandoah Valley, and in the western part of Virginia and extremeeastern part of Tennessee; and also confronting our sea-coast garrisons,and holding blockaded ports where we had no foothold upon land.These two armies, and the cities covered and defended by them, were themain objective points of the campaign.Major-General W. T. Sherman, who was appointed to the command of theMilitary Division of the Mississippi, embracing all the armies andterritory east of the Mississippi River to the Alleghanies and theDepartment of Arkansas, west of the Mississippi, had the immediatecommand of the armies operating against Johnston.Major-General George G. Meade had the immediate command of the Army ofthe Potomac, from where I exercised general supervision of the movementsof all our armies.General Sherman was instructed to move against Johnston's army, to breakit up, and to go into the interior of the enemy's country as far as hecould, inflicting all the damage he could upon their war resources.  Ifthe enemy in his front showed signs of joining Lee, to follow him up tothe full extent of his ability, while I would prevent the concentrationof Lee upon him, if it was in the power of the Army of the Potomac to doso.  More specific written instructions were not given, for the reasonthat I had talked over with him the plans of the campaign, and wassatisfied that he understood them and would execute them to the fullestextent possible.Major-General N. P. Banks, then on an expedition up Red River againstShreveport, Louisiana (which had been organized previous to myappointment to command), was notified by me on the 15th of March, of theimportance it was that Shreveport should be taken at the earliestpossible day, and that if he found that the taking of it would occupyfrom ten to fifteen days' more time than General Sherman had given histroops to be absent from their command, he would send them back at thetime specified by General Sherman, even if it led to the abandonment ofthe main object of the Red River expedition, for this force wasnecessary to movements east of the Mississippi; that should hisexpedition prove successful, he would hold Shreveport and the Red Riverwith such force as he might deem necessary, and return the balance ofhis troops to the neighborhood of New Orleans, commencing no move forthe further acquisition of territory, unless it was to make that thenheld by him more easily held; that it might be a part of the springcampaign to move against Mobile; that it certainly would be, if troopsenough could be obtained to make it without embarrassing othermovements; that New Orleans would be the point of departure for such anexpedition; also, that I had directed General Steele to make a real movefrom Arkansas, as suggested by him (General Banks), instead of ademonstration, as Steele thought advisable.On the 31st of March, in addition to the foregoing notification anddirections, he was instructed as follows:"1st.  If successful in your expedition against Shreveport, that youturn over the defence of the Red River to General Steele and the navy."2d.  That you abandon Texas entirely, with the exception of your holdupon the Rio Grande.  This can be held with four thousand men, if theywill turn their attention immediately to fortifying their positions.  Atleast one-half of the force required for this service might be takenfrom the colored troops."3d.  By properly fortifying on the Mississippi River, the force toguard it from Port Hudson to New Orleans can be reduced to ten thousandmen, if not to a less number.  Six thousand more would then hold all therest of the territory necessary to hold until active operations canagain be resumed west of the river. According to your last return, thiswould give you a force of over thirty thousand effective men with whichto move against Mobile.  To this I expect to add five thousand men fromMissouri.  If however, you think the force here stated too small to holdthe territory regarded as necessary to hold possession of, I would sayconcentrate at least twenty-five thousand men of your present commandfor operations against Mobile.  With these and such additions as I cangive you from elsewhere, lose no time in making a demonstration, to befollowed by an attack upon Mobile.  Two or more iron-clads will beordered to report to Admiral Farragut.  This gives him a strong navalfleet with which to co-operate.  You can make your own arrangements withthe admiral for his co-operation, and select your own line of approach.My own idea of the matter is that Pascagoula should be your base; but,from your long service in the Gulf Department, you will know best aboutthe matter.  It is intended that your movements shall be co-operativewith movements elsewhere, and you cannot now start too soon.  All Iwould now add is, that you commence the concentration of your forces atonce.  Preserve a profound secrecy of what you intend doing, and startat the earliest possible moment."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL N. P. BANKS."Major-General Meade was instructed that Lee's army would be hisobjective point; that wherever Lee went he would go also.  For hismovement two plans presented themselves:  One to cross the Rapidan belowLee, moving by his right flank; the other above, moving by his left.Each presented advantages over the other, with corresponding objections.By crossing above, Lee would be cut off from all chance of ignoringRichmond or going north on a raid.  But if we took this route, all wedid would have to be done whilst the rations we started with held out;besides, it separated us from Butler, so that he could not be directedhow to cooperate.  If we took the other route, Brandy Station could beused as a base of supplies until another was secured on the York orJames rivers.  Of these, however, it was decided to take the lowerroute.The following letter of instruction was addressed to Major-General B. F.Butler:"FORT MONROE, VIRGINIA, April 2, 1864."GENERAL:-In the spring campaign, which it is desirable shall commenceat as early a day as practicable, it is proposed to have cooperativeaction of all the armies in the field, as far as this object can beaccomplished."It will not be possible to unite our armies into two or three largeones to act as so many units, owing to the absolute necessity of holdingon to the territory already taken from the enemy.  But, generallyspeaking, concentration can be practically effected by armies moving tothe interior of the enemy's country from the territory they have toguard.  By such movement, they interpose themselves between the enemyand the country to be guarded, thereby reducing the number necessary toguard important points, or at least occupy the attention of a part ofthe enemy's force, if no greater object is gained. Lee's army andRichmond being the greater objects towards which our attention must bedirected in the next campaign, it is desirable to unite all the force wecan against them.  The necessity of covering Washington with the Army ofthe Potomac, and of covering your department with your army, makes itimpossible to unite these forces at the beginning of any move. Ipropose, therefore, what comes nearest this of anything that seemspracticable:  The Army of the Potomac will act from its present base,Lee's army being the objective point.  You will collect all the forcesfrom your command that can be spared from garrison duty--I should saynot less than twenty thousand effective men--to operate on the southside of James River, Richmond being your objective point.  To the forceyou already have will be added about ten thousand men from SouthCarolina, under Major-General Gillmore, who will command them in person.Major-General W. F. Smith is ordered to report to you, to command thetroops sent into the field from your own department."General Gillmore will be ordered to report to you at Fortress Monroe,with all the troops on transports, by the 18th instant, or as soonthereafter as practicable.  Should you not receive notice by that timeto move, you will make such disposition of them and your other forces asyou may deem best calculated to deceive the enemy as to the real move tobe made."When you are notified to move, take City Point with as much force aspossible.  Fortify, or rather intrench, at once, and concentrate allyour troops for the field there as rapidly as you can.  From City Pointdirections cannot be given at this time for your further movements."The fact that has already been stated--that is, that Richmond is to beyour objective point, and that there is to be co-operation between yourforce and the Army of the Potomac--must be your guide.  This indicatesthe necessity of your holding close to the south bank of the James Riveras you advance.  Then, should the enemy be forced into his intrenchmentsin Richmond, the Army of the Potomac would follow, and by means oftransports the two armies would become a unit."All the minor details of your advance are left entirely to yourdirection. If, however, you think it practicable to use your cavalrysouth of you, so as to cut the railroad about Hicksford, about the timeof the general advance, it would be of immense advantage."You will please forward for my information, at the earliest practicableday, all orders, details, and instructions you may give for theexecution of this order."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL B. F. BUTLER."On the 16th these instructions were substantially reiterated. On the19th, in order to secure full co-operation between his army and that ofGeneral Meade, he was informed that I expected him to move from FortMonroe the same day that General Meade moved from Culpeper.  The exacttime I was to telegraph him as soon as it was fixed, and that it wouldnot be earlier than the 27th of April; that it was my intention to fightLee between Culpeper and Richmond, if he would stand.  Should he,however, fall back into Richmond, I would follow up and make a junctionwith his (General Butler's) army on the James River; that, could I becertain he would be able to invest Richmond on the south side, so as tohave his left resting on the James, above the city, I would form thejunction there; that circumstances might make this course advisableanyhow; that he should use every exertion to secure footing as far upthe south side of the river as he could, and as soon as possible afterthe receipt of orders to move; that if he could not carry the city, heshould at least detain as large a force there as possible.In co-operation with the main movements against Lee and Johnston, I wasdesirous of using all other troops necessarily kept in departmentsremote from the fields of immediate operations, and also those kept inthe background for the protection of our extended lines between theloyal States and the armies operating against them.A very considerable force, under command of Major-General Sigel, was soheld for the protection of West Virginia, and the frontiers of Marylandand Pennsylvania.  Whilst these troops could not be withdrawn to distantfields without exposing the North to invasion by comparatively smallbodies of the enemy, they could act directly to their front, and givebetter protection than if lying idle in garrison.  By such a movementthey would either compel the enemy to detach largely for the protectionof his supplies and lines of communication, or he would lose them.General Sigel was therefore directed to organize all his available forceinto two expeditions, to move from Beverly and Charleston, under commandof Generals Ord and Crook, against the East Tennessee and VirginiaRailroad. Subsequently, General Ord having been relieved at his ownrequest, General Sigel was instructed at his own suggestion, to give upthe expedition by Beverly, and to form two columns, one under GeneralCrook, on the Kanawha, numbering about ten thousand men, and one on theShenandoah, numbering about seven thousand men.  The one on theShenandoah to assemble between Cumberland and the Shenandoah, and theinfantry and artillery advanced to Cedar Creek with such cavalry ascould be made available at the moment, to threaten the enemy in theShenandoah Valley, and advance as far as possible; while General Crookwould take possession of Lewisburg with part of his force and move downthe Tennessee Railroad, doing as much damage as he could, destroying theNew River Bridge and the salt-works, at Saltville, Va.Owing to the weather and bad condition of the roads, operations weredelayed until the 1st of May, when, everything being in readiness andthe roads favorable, orders were given for a general movement of all thearmies not later than the 4th of May.My first object being to break the military power of the rebellion, andcapture the enemy's important strongholds, made me desirous that GeneralButler should succeed in his movement against Richmond, as that wouldtend more than anything else, unless it were the capture of Lee's army,to accomplish this desired result in the East. If he failed, it was mydetermination, by hard fighting, either to compel Lee to retreat, or toso cripple him that he could not detach a large force to go north, andstill retain enough for the defence of Richmond.  It was wellunderstood, by both Generals Butler and Meade, before starting on thecampaign, that it was my intention to put both their armies south of theJames River, in case of failure to destroy Lee without it.Before giving General Butler his instructions, I visited him at FortMonroe, and in conversation pointed out the apparent importance ofgetting possession of Petersburg, and destroying railroad communicationas far south as possible.  Believing, however, in the practicability ofcapturing Richmond unless it was reinforced, I made that the objectivepoint of his operations.  As the Army of the Potomac was to movesimultaneously with him, Lee could not detach from his army with safety,and the enemy did not have troops elsewhere to bring to the defence ofthe city in time to meet a rapid movement from the north of James River.I may here state that, commanding all the armies as I did, I tried, asfar as possible, to leave General Meade in independent command of theArmy of the Potomac.  My instructions for that army were all throughhim, and were general in their nature, leaving all the details and theexecution to him.  The campaigns that followed proved him to be theright man in the right place.  His commanding always in the presence ofan officer superior to him in rank, has drawn from him much of thatpublic attention that his zeal and ability entitle him to, and which hewould otherwise have received.The movement of the Army of the Potomac commenced early on the morningof the 4th of May, under the immediate direction and orders ofMajor-General Meade, pursuant to instructions.  Before night, the wholearmy was across the Rapidan (the fifth and sixth corps crossing atGermania Ford, and the second corps at Ely's Ford, the cavalry, underMajor-General Sheridan, moving in advance,) with the greater part of itstrains, numbering about four thousand wagons, meeting with but slightopposition.  The average distance travelled by the troops that day wasabout twelve miles.  This I regarded as a great success, and it removedfrom my mind the most serious apprehensions I had entertained, that ofcrossing the river in the face of an active, large, well-appointed, andably commanded army, and how so large a train was to be carried througha hostile country, and protected.  Early on the 5th, the advance corps(the fifth, Major-General G. K. Warren commanding) met and engaged theenemy outside his intrenchments near Mine Run.  The battle ragedfuriously all day, the whole army being brought into the fight as fastas the corps could be got upon the field, which, considering the densityof the forest and narrowness of the roads, was done with commendablepromptness.General Burnside, with the ninth corps, was, at the time the Army of thePotomac moved, left with the bulk of his corps at the crossing of theRappahannock River and Alexandria Railroad, holding the road back toBull Run, with instructions not to move until he received notice that acrossing of the Rapidan was secured, but to move promptly as soon assuch notice was received.  This crossing he was apprised of on theafternoon of the 4th.  By six o'clock of the morning of the 6th he wasleading his corps into action near the Wilderness Tavern, some of histroops having marched a distance of over thirty miles, crossing both theRappahannock and Rapidan rivers.  Considering that a large proportion,probably two-thirds of his command, was composed of new troops,unaccustomed to marches, and carrying the accoutrements of a soldier,this was a remarkable march.The battle of the Wilderness was renewed by us at five o'clock on themorning of the 6th, and continued with unabated fury until darkness setin, each army holding substantially the same position that they had onthe evening of the 5th.  After dark, the enemy made a feeble attempt toturn our right flank, capturing several hundred prisoners and creatingconsiderable confusion.  But the promptness of General Sedgwick, who waspersonally present and commanded that part of our line, soon reformed itand restored order.  On the morning of the 7th, reconnoissances showedthat the enemy had fallen behind his intrenched lines, with pickets tothe front, covering a part of the battle-field.  From this it wasevident to my mind that the two days' fighting had satisfied him of hisinability to further maintain the contest in the open field,notwithstanding his advantage of position, and that he would wait anattack behind his works. I therefore determined to push on and put mywhole force between him and Richmond; and orders were at once issued fora movement by his right flank.  On the night of the 7th, the march wascommenced towards Spottsylvania Court House, the fifth corps moving onthe most direct road.  But the enemy having become apprised of ourmovement, and having the shorter line, was enabled to reach there first.On the 8th, General Warren met a force of the enemy, which had been sentout to oppose and delay his advance, to gain time to fortify the linetaken up at Spottsylvania.  This force was steadily driven back on themain force, within the recently constructed works, after considerablefighting, resulting in severe loss to both sides.  On the morning of the9th, General Sheridan started on a raid against the enemy's lines ofcommunication with Richmond.  The 9th, 10th, and 11th were spent inmanoeuvring and fighting, without decisive results.  Among the killed onthe 9th was that able and distinguished soldier Major-General JohnSedgwick, commanding the sixth army corps.  Major-General H. G. Wrightsucceeded him in command.  Early on the morning of the 12th a generalattack was made on the enemy in position.  The second corps,Major-General Hancock commanding, carried a salient of his line,capturing most of Johnson's division of Ewell's corps and twenty piecesof artillery.  But the resistance was so obstinate that the advantagegained did not prove decisive.  The 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, and18th, were consumed in manoeuvring and awaiting the arrival ofreinforcements from Washington.  Deeming it impracticable to make anyfurther attack upon the enemy at Spottsylvania Court House, orders wereissued on the 15th with a view to a movement to the North Anna, tocommence at twelve o'clock on the night of the 19th.  Late in theafternoon of the 19th, Ewell's corps came out of its works on ourextreme right flank; but the attack was promptly repulsed, with heavyloss. This delayed the movement to the North Anna until the night of the21st, when it was commenced.  But the enemy again, having the shorterline, and being in possession of the main roads, was enabled to reachthe North Anna in advance of us, and took position behind it.  The fifthcorps reached the North Anna on the afternoon of the 23d, closelyfollowed by the sixth corps. The second and ninth corps got up about thesame time, the second holding the railroad bridge, and the ninth lyingbetween that and Jericho Ford.  General Warren effected a crossing thesame afternoon, and got a position without much opposition. Soon aftergetting into position he was violently attacked, but repulsed the enemywith great slaughter.  On the 25th, General Sheridan rejoined the Armyof the Potomac from the raid on which he started from Spottsylvania,having destroyed the depots at Beaver Dam and Ashland stations, fourtrains of cars, large supplies of rations, and many miles ofrailroad-track; recaptured about four hundred of our men on their way toRichmond as prisoners of war; met and defeated the enemy's cavalry atYellow Tavern; carried the first line of works around Richmond (butfinding the second line too strong to be carried by assault), recrossedto the north bank of the Chickahominy at Meadow Bridge under heavy fire,and moved by a detour to Haxall's Landing, on the James River, where hecommunicated with General Butler.  This raid had the effect of drawingoff the whole of the enemy's cavalry force, making it comparatively easyto guard our trains.General Butler moved his main force up the James River, in pursuance ofinstructions, on the 4th of May, General Gillmore having joined him withthe tenth corps.  At the same time he sent a force of one thousand eighthundred cavalry, by way of West Point, to form a junction with himwherever he might get a foothold, and a force of three thousand cavalry,under General Kautz, from Suffolk, to operate against the road south ofPetersburg and Richmond.  On the 5th, he occupied, without opposition,both City Point and Bermuda Hundred, his movement being a completesurprise.  On the 6th, he was in position with his main army, andcommenced intrenching.  On the 7th he made a reconnoissance against thePetersburg and Richmond Railroad, destroying a portion of it after somefighting.  On the 9th he telegraphed as follows:"HEADQUARTERS, NEAR BERMUDA LANDING, May 9, 1864."HON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War."Our operations may be summed up in a few words.  With one thousandseven hundred cavalry we have advanced up the Peninsula, forced theChickahominy, and have safely, brought them to their present position.These were colored cavalry, and are now holding our advance picketstowards Richmond."General Kautz, with three thousand cavalry from Suffolk, on the sameday with our movement up James River, forced the Black Water, burned therailroad bridge at Stony Creek, below Petersburg, cutting intoBeauregard's force at that point."We have landed here, intrenched ourselves, destroyed many miles ofrailroad, and got a position which, with proper supplies, we can holdout against the whole of Lee's army.  I have ordered up the supplies."Beauregard, with a large portion of his force, was left south by thecutting of the railroads by Kautz.  That portion which reachedPetersburg under Hill I have whipped to-day, killing and wounding many,and taking many prisoners, after a severe and well-contested fight."General Grant will not be troubled with any further reinforcements toLee from Beauregard's force."BENJ. F. BUTLER, Major-General."On the evening of the 13th and morning of the 14th he carried a portionof the enemy's first line of defences at Drury's Bluff, or Fort Darling,with small loss.  The time thus consumed from the 6th lost to us thebenefit of the surprise and capture of Richmond and Petersburg,enabling, as it did, Beauregard to collect his loose forces in North andSouth Carolina, and bring them to the defence of those places.  On the16th, the enemy attacked General Butler in his position in front ofDrury's Bluff.  He was forced back, or drew back, into his intrenchmentsbetween the forks of the James and Appomattox rivers, the enemyintrenching strongly in his front, thus covering his railroads, thecity, and all that was valuable to him.  His army, therefore, though ina position of great security, was as completely shut off from furtheroperations directly against Richmond as if it had been in a bottlestrongly corked.  It required but a comparatively small force of theenemy to hold it there.On the 12th, General Kautz, with his cavalry, was started on a raidagainst the Danville Railroad, which he struck at Coalfield, Powhatan,and Chula Stations, destroying them, the railroad-track, two freighttrains, and one locomotive, together with large quantities of commissaryand other stores; thence, crossing to the South Side Road, struck it atWilson's, Wellsville, and Black's and White's Stations, destroying theroad and station-houses; thence he proceeded to City Point, which hereached on the 18th.On the 19th of April, and prior to the movement of General Butler, theenemy, with a land force under General Hoke and an iron-clad ram,attacked Plymouth, N. C., commanded by General H. W. Wessells, and ourgunboats there, and, after severe fighting, the place was carried byassault, and the entire garrison and armament captured.  The gunboatSmithfield was sunk, and the Miami disabled.The army sent to operate against Richmond having hermetically sealeditself up at Bermuda Hundred, the enemy was enabled to bring the most,if not all, the reinforcements brought from the south by Beauregardagainst the Army of the Potomac. In addition to this reinforcement, avery considerable one, probably not less than fifteen thousand men, wasobtained by calling in the scattered troops under Breckinridge from thewestern part of Virginia.The position of Bermuda Hundred was as easy to defend as it wasdifficult to operate from against the enemy.  I determined, therefore,to bring from it all available forces, leaving enough only to securewhat had been gained; and accordingly, on the 22d, I directed that theybe sent forward, under command of Major-General W. F. Smith, to join theArmy of the Potomac.On the 24th of May, the 9th army corps, commanded by Major-General A. E.Burnside, was assigned to the Army of the Potomac, and from this timeforward constituted a portion of Major-General Meade's command.Finding the enemy's position on the North Anna stronger than either ofhis previous ones, I withdrew on the night of the 26th to the north bankof the North Anna, and moved via Hanover Town to turn the enemy'sposition by his right.Generals Torbert's and Merritt's divisions of cavalry, under Sheridan,and the 6th corps, led the advance, crossed the Pamunkey River atHanover Town, after considerable fighting, and on the 28th the twodivisions of cavalry had a severe, but successful engagement with theenemy at Hawes's Shop.  On the 29th and 30th we advanced, with heavyskirmishing, to the Hanover Court House and Cold Harbor Road, anddeveloped the enemy's position north of the Chickahominy.  Late on theevening of the last day the enemy came out and attacked our left, butwas repulsed with very considerable loss.  An attack was immediatelyordered by General Meade, along his whole line, which resulted indriving the enemy from a part of his intrenched skirmish line.On the 31st, General Wilson's division of cavalry destroyed the railroadbridges over the South Anna River, after defeating the enemy's cavalry.General Sheridan, on the same day, reached Cold Harbor, and held ituntil relieved by the 6th corps and General Smith's command, which hadjust arrived, via White House, from General Butler's army.On the 1st day of June an attack was made at five P.M. by the 6th corpsand the troops under General Smith, the other corps being held inreadiness to advance on the receipt of orders. This resulted in ourcarrying and holding the enemy's first line of works in front of theright of the 6th corps, and in front of General Smith.  During theattack the enemy made repeated assaults on each of the corps not engagedin the main attack, but was repulsed with heavy loss in every instance.That night he made several assaults to regain what he had lost in theday, but failed.  The 2d was spent in getting troops into position foran attack on the 3d.  On the 3d of June we again assaulted the enemy'sworks, in the hope of driving him from his position.  In this attemptour loss was heavy, while that of the enemy, I have reason to believe,was comparatively light.  It was the only general attack made from theRapidan to the James which did not inflict upon the enemy losses tocompensate for our own losses.  I would not be understood as saying thatall previous attacks resulted in victories to our arms, or accomplishedas much as I had hoped from them; but they inflicted upon the enemysevere losses, which tended, in the end, to the complete overthrow ofthe rebellion.From the proximity of the enemy to his defences around Richmond, it wasimpossible, by any flank movement, to interpose between him and thecity.  I was still in a condition to either move by his left flank, andinvest Richmond from the north side, or continue my move by his rightflank to the south side of the James.  While the former might have beenbetter as a covering for Washington, yet a full survey of all the groundsatisfied me that it would be impracticable to hold a line north andeast of Richmond that would protect the Fredericksburg Railroad, a long,vulnerable line, which would exhaust much of our strength to guard, andthat would have to be protected to supply the army, and would leave opento the enemy all his lines of communication on the south side of theJames.  My idea, from the start, had been to beat Lee's army north ofRichmond, if possible.  Then, after destroying his lines ofcommunication north of the James River, to transfer the army to thesouth side, and besiege Lee in Richmond, or follow him south if heshould retreat.  After the battle of the Wilderness, it was evident thatthe enemy deemed it of the first importance to run no risks with thearmy he then had.  He acted purely on the defensive, behind breastworks,or feebly on the offensive immediately in front of them, and where, incase of repulse, he could easily retire behind them.  Without a greatersacrifice of life than I was willing to make, all could not beaccomplished that I had designed north of Richmond.  I thereforedetermined to continue to hold substantially the ground we thenoccupied, taking advantage of any favorable circumstances that mightpresent themselves, until the cavalry could be sent to Charlottesvilleand Gordonsville to effectually break up the railroad connection betweenRichmond and the Shenandoah Valley and Lynchburg; and when the cavalrygot well off, to move the army to the south side of the James River, bythe enemy's right flank, where I felt I could cut off all his sources ofsupply, except by the canal.On the 7th, two divisions of cavalry, under General Sheridan, got off onthe expedition against the Virginia Central Railroad, with instructionsto Hunter, whom I hoped he would meet near Charlottesville, to join hisforces to Sheridan's, and after the work laid out for them wasthoroughly done, to join the Army of the Potomac by the route laid downin Sheridan's instructions.On the 10th of June, General Butler sent a force of infantry, underGeneral Gillmore, and of cavalry under General Kautz, to capturePetersburg, if possible, and destroy the railroad and common bridgesacross the Appomattox.  The cavalry carried the works on the south side,and penetrated well in towards the town, but were forced to retire.General Gillmore, finding the works which he approached very strong, anddeeming an assault impracticable, returned to Bermuda Hundred withoutattempting one.Attaching great importance to the possession of Petersburg, I sent backto Bermuda Hundred and City Point, General Smith's command by water, viathe White House, to reach there in advance of the Army of the Potomac.This was for the express purpose of securing Petersburg before theenemy, becoming aware of our intention, could reinforce the place.The movement from Cold Harbor commenced after dark on the evening of the12th.  One division of cavalry, under General Wilson, and the 5th corps,crossed the Chickahominy at Long Bridge, and moved out to White OakSwamp, to cover the crossings of the other corps.  The advance corpsreached James River, at Wilcox's Landing and Charles City Court House,on the night of the 13th.During three long years the Armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginiahad been confronting each other.  In that time they had fought moredesperate battles than it probably ever before fell to the lot of twoarmies to fight, without materially changing the vantage ground ofeither.  The Southern press and people, with more shrewdness than wasdisplayed in the North, finding that they had failed to captureWashington and march on to New York, as they had boasted they would do,assumed that they only defended their Capital and Southern territory.Hence, Antietam, Gettysburg, and all the other battles that had beenfought, were by them set down as failures on our part, and victories forthem.  Their army believed this.  It produced a morale which could onlybe overcome by desperate and continuous hard fighting.  The battles ofthe Wilderness, Spottsylvania, North Anna and Cold Harbor, bloody andterrible as they were on our side, were even more damaging to the enemy,and so crippled him as to make him wary ever after of taking theoffensive.  His losses in men were probably not so great, owing to thefact that we were, save in the Wilderness, almost invariably theattacking party; and when he did attack, it was in the open field.  Thedetails of these battles, which for endurance and bravery on the part ofthe soldiery, have rarely been surpassed, are given in the report ofMajor-General Meade, and the subordinate reports accompanying it.During the campaign of forty-three days, from the Rapidan to the JamesRiver, the army had to be supplied from an ever-shifting base, bywagons, over narrow roads, through a densely wooded country, with a lackof wharves at each new base from which to conveniently dischargevessels.  Too much credit cannot, therefore, be awarded to thequartermaster and commissary departments for the zeal and efficiencydisplayed by them. Under the general supervision of the chiefquartermaster, Brigadier-General R. Ingalls, the trains were made tooccupy all the available roads between the army and our water-base, andbut little difficulty was experienced in protecting them.The movement in the Kanawha and Shenandoah valleys, under General Sigel,commenced on the 1st of May.  General Crook, who had the immediatecommand of the Kanawha expedition, divided his forces into two columns,giving one, composed of cavalry, to General Averell.  They crossed themountains by separate routes. Averell struck the Tennessee and VirginiaRailroad, near Wytheville, on the 10th, and proceeding to New River andChristiansburg, destroyed the road, several important bridges anddepots, including New River Bridge, forming a junction with Crook atUnion on the 15th.  General Sigel moved up the Shenandoah Valley, metthe enemy at New Market on the 15th, and, after a severe engagement, wasdefeated with heavy loss, and retired behind Cedar Creek.  Not regardingthe operations of General Sigel as satisfactory, I asked his removalfrom command, and Major-General Hunter appointed to supersede him.  Hisinstructions were embraced in the following dispatches to Major-GeneralH. W. Halleck, chief of staff of the army:"NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE, VA. "May 20, 1864.*        *        *        *        *        *        * "The enemy areevidently relying for supplies greatly on such as are brought over thebranch road running through Staunton.  On the whole, therefore, I thinkit would be better for General Hunter to move in that direction; reachStaunton and Gordonsville or Charlottesville, if he does not meet toomuch opposition.  If he can hold at bay a force equal to his own, hewill be doing good service.  * * *"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.""JERICHO FORD, VA., May 25, 1864."If Hunter can possibly get to Charlottesville and Lynchburg, he shoulddo so, living on the country.  The railroads and canal should bedestroyed beyond possibility of repairs for weeks. Completing this, hecould find his way back to his original base, or from about Gordonsvillejoin this army."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK."General Hunter immediately took up the offensive, and, moving up theShenandoah Valley, met the enemy on the 5th of June at Piedmont, and,after a battle of ten hours, routed and defeated him, capturing on thefield of battle one thousand five hundred men, three pieces ofartillery, and three hundred stand of small arms.  On the 8th of thesame month he formed a junction with Crook and Averell at Staunton, fromwhich place he moved direct on Lynchburg, via Lexington, which place hereached and invested on the 16th day of June.  Up to this time he wasvery successful; and but for the difficulty of taking with himsufficient ordnance stores over so long a march, through a hostilecountry, he would, no doubt, have captured that, to the enemy important,point.  The destruction of the enemy's supplies and manufactories wasvery great.  To meet this movement under General Hunter, General Leesent a force, perhaps equal to a corps, a part of which reachedLynchburg a short time before Hunter.  After some skirmishing on the17th and 18th, General Hunter, owing to a want of ammunition to givebattle, retired from before the place.  Unfortunately, this want ofammunition left him no choice of route for his return but by way ofKanawha. This lost to us the use of his troops for several weeks fromthe defence of the North.Had General Hunter moved by way of Charlottesville, instead ofLexington, as his instructions contemplated, he would have been in aposition to have covered the Shenandoah Valley against the enemy, shouldthe force he met have seemed to endanger it.  If it did not, he wouldhave been within easy distance of the James River Canal, on the mainline of communication between Lynchburg and the force sent for itsdefence.  I have never taken exception to the operations of GeneralHunter, and am not now disposed to find fault with him, for I have nodoubt he acted within what he conceived to be the spirit of hisinstructions and the interests of the service.  The promptitude of hismovements and his gallantry should entitle him to the commendation ofhis country.To return to the Army of the Potomac:  The 2d corps commenced crossingthe James River on the morning of the 14th by ferry-boats at Wilcox'sLanding.  The laying of the pontoon-bridge was completed about midnightof the 14th, and the crossing of the balance of the army was rapidlypushed forward by both bridge and ferry.After the crossing had commenced, I proceeded by steamer to BermudaHundred to give the necessary orders for the immediate capture ofPetersburg.The instructions to General Butler were verbal, and were for him to sendGeneral Smith immediately, that night, with all the troops he could givehim without sacrificing the position he then held.  I told him that Iwould return at once to the Army of the Potomac, hasten its crossing andthrow it forward to Petersburg by divisions as rapidly as it could bedone, that we could reinforce our armies more rapidly there than theenemy could bring troops against us.  General Smith got off as directed,and confronted the enemy's pickets near Petersburg before daylight nextmorning, but for some reason that I have never been able tosatisfactorily understand, did not get ready to assault his main linesuntil near sundown.  Then, with a part of his command only, he made theassault, and carried the lines north-east of Petersburg from theAppomattox River, for a distance of over two and a half miles, capturingfifteen pieces of artillery and three hundred prisoners.  This was aboutseven P.M. Between the line thus captured and Petersburg there were noother works, and there was no evidence that the enemy had reinforcedPetersburg with a single brigade from any source. The night was clearthe moon shining brightly and favorable to further operations.  GeneralHancock, with two divisions of the 2d corps, reached General Smith justafter dark, and offered the service of these troops as he (Smith) mightwish, waiving rank to the named commander, who he naturally supposedknew best the position of affairs, and what to do with the troops.  Butinstead of taking these troops and pushing at once into Petersburg, herequested General Hancock to relieve a part of his line in the capturedworks, which was done before midnight.By the time I arrived the next morning the enemy was in force. An attackwas ordered to be made at six o'clock that evening by the troops underSmith and the 2d and 9th corps.  It required until that time for the 9thcorps to get up and into position. The attack was made as ordered, andthe fighting continued with but little intermission until six o'clockthe next morning, and resulted in our carrying the advance and some ofthe main works of the enemy to the right (our left) of those previouslycaptured by General Smith, several pieces of artillery, and over fourhundred prisoners.The 5th corps having got up, the attacks were renewed and persisted inwith great vigor on the 17th and 18th, but only resulted in forcing theenemy into an interior line, from which he could not be dislodged.  Theadvantages of position gained by us were very great.  The army thenproceeded to envelop Petersburg towards the South Side Railroad as faras possible without attacking fortifications.On the 16th the enemy, to reinforce Petersburg, withdrew from a part ofhis intrenchment in front of Bermuda Hundred, expecting, no doubt, toget troops from north of the James to take the place of those withdrawnbefore we could discover it.  General Butler, taking advantage of this,at once moved a force on the railroad between Petersburg and Richmond.As soon as I was apprised of the advantage thus gained, to retain it Iordered two divisions of the 6th corps, General Wright commanding, thatwere embarking at Wilcox's Landing, under orders for City Point, toreport to General Butler at Bermuda Hundred, of which General Butler wasnotified, and the importance of holding a position in advance of hispresent line urged upon him.About two o'clock in the afternoon General Butler was forced back to theline the enemy had withdrawn from in the morning. General Wright, withhis two divisions, joined General Butler on the forenoon of the 17th,the latter still holding with a strong picket-line the enemy's works.But instead of putting these divisions into the enemy's works to holdthem, he permitted them to halt and rest some distance in the rear ofhis own line. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon the enemyattacked and drove in his pickets and re-occupied his old line.On the night of the 20th and morning of the 21st a lodgment was effectedby General Butler, with one brigade of infantry, on the north bank ofthe James, at Deep Bottom, and connected by pontoon-bridge with BermudaHundred.On the 19th, General Sheridan, on his return from his expedition againstthe Virginia Central Railroad, arrived at the White House just as theenemy's cavalry was about to attack it, and compelled it to retire.  Theresult of this expedition was, that General Sheridan met the enemy'scavalry near Trevilian Station, on the morning of the 11th of June, whomhe attacked, and after an obstinate contest drove from the field incomplete rout.  He left his dead and nearly all his wounded in ourhands, and about four hundred prisoners and several hundred horses.  Onthe 12th he destroyed the railroad from Trevilian Station to LouisaCourt House.  This occupied until three o'clock P.M., when he advancedin the direction of Gordonsville.  He found the enemy reinforced byinfantry, behind well-constructed rifle-pits, about five miles from thelatter place and too strong to successfully assault.  On the extremeright, however, his reserve brigade carried the enemy's works twice, andwas twice driven therefrom by infantry.  Night closed the contest.  Nothaving sufficient ammunition to continue the engagement, and his animalsbeing without forage (the country furnishing but inferior grazing), andhearing nothing from General Hunter, he withdrew his command to thenorth side of the North Anna, and commenced his return march, reachingWhite House at the time before stated.  After breaking up the depot atthat place, he moved to the James River, which he reached safely afterheavy fighting.  He commenced crossing on the 25th, near Fort Powhatan,without further molestation, and rejoined the Army of the Potomac.On the 22d, General Wilson, with his own division of cavalry of the Armyof the Potomac, and General Kautz's division of cavalry of the Army ofthe James moved against the enemy's railroads south of Richmond.Striking the Weldon Railroad at Reams's Station, destroying the depotand several miles of the road, and the South Side road about fifteenmiles from Petersburg, to near Nottoway Station, where he met anddefeated a force of the enemy's cavalry.  He reached Burkesville Stationon the afternoon of the 23d, and from there destroyed the DanvilleRailroad to Roanoke Bridge, a distance of twenty-five miles, where hefound the enemy in force, and in a position from which he could notdislodge him.  He then commenced his return march, and on the 28th metthe enemy's cavalry in force at the Weldon Railroad crossing of StonyCreek, where he had a severe but not decisive engagement.  Thence hemade a detour from his left with a view of reaching Reams's Station(supposing it to be in our possession).  At this place he was met by theenemy's cavalry, supported by infantry, and forced to retire, with theloss of his artillery and trains.  In this last encounter, GeneralKautz, with a part of his command, became separated, and made his wayinto our lines.  General Wilson, with the remainder of his force,succeeded in crossing the Nottoway River and coming in safely on ourleft and rear.  The damage to the enemy in this expedition more thancompensated for the losses we sustained.  It severed all connection byrailroad with Richmond for several weeks.With a view of cutting the enemy's railroad from near Richmond to theAnna rivers, and making him wary of the situation of his army in theShenandoah, and, in the event of failure in this, to take advantage ofhis necessary withdrawal of troops from Petersburg, to explode a minethat had been prepared in front of the 9th corps and assault the enemy'slines at that place, on the night of the 26th of July the 2d corps andtwo divisions of the cavalry corps and Kautz's cavalry were crossed tothe north bank of the James River and joined the force General Butlerhad there.  On the 27th the enemy was driven from his intrenchedposition, with the loss of four pieces of artillery.  On the 28th ourlines were extended from Deep Bottom to New Market Road, but in gettingthis position were attacked by the enemy in heavy force.  The fightinglasted for several hours, resulting in considerable loss to both sides.The first object of this move having failed, by reason of the very largeforce thrown there by the enemy, I determined to take advantage of thediversion made, by assaulting Petersburg before he could get his forceback there.  One division of the 2d corps was withdrawn on the night ofthe 28th, and moved during the night to the rear of the 18th corps, torelieve that corps in the line, that it might be foot-loose in theassault to be made.  The other two divisions of the 2d corps andSheridan's cavalry were crossed over on the night of the 29th and movedin front of Petersburg.  On the morning of the 30th, between four andfive o'clock, the mine was sprung, blowing up a battery and most of aregiment, and the advance of the assaulting column, formed of the 9thcorps, immediately took possession of the crater made by the explosion,and the line for some distance to the right and left of it, and adetached line in front of it, but for some cause failed to advancepromptly to the ridge beyond.  Had they done this, I have every reasonto believe that Petersburg would have fallen.  Other troops wereimmediately pushed forward, but the time consumed in getting them upenabled the enemy to rally from his surprise (which had been complete),and get forces to this point for its defence.  The captured line thusheld being untenable, and of no advantage to us, the troops werewithdrawn, but not without heavy loss.  Thus terminated in disaster whatpromised to be the most successful assault of the campaign.Immediately upon the enemy's ascertaining that General Hunter wasretreating from Lynchburg by way of the Kanawha River, thus laying theShenandoah Valley open for raid into Maryland and Pennsylvania, hereturned northward and moved down that valley.  As soon as this movementof the enemy was ascertained, General Hunter, who had reached theKanawha River, was directed to move his troops without delay, by riverand railroad, to Harper's Ferry; but owing to the difficulty ofnavigation by reason of low water and breaks in the railroad, greatdelay was experienced in getting there.  It became necessary, therefore,to find other troops to check this movement of the enemy.  For thispurpose the 6th corps was taken from the armies operating againstRichmond, to which was added the 19th corps, then fortunately beginningto arrive in Hampton Roads from the Gulf Department, under orders issuedimmediately after the ascertainment of the result of the Red Riverexpedition.  The garrisons of Baltimore and Washington were at this timemade up of heavy-artillery regiments, hundred days' men, and detachmentsfrom the invalid corps.  One division under command of General Ricketts,of the 6th corps, was sent to Baltimore, and the remaining two divisionsof the 6th corps, under General Wright, were subsequently sent toWashington.  On the 3d of July the enemy approached Martinsburg.General Sigel, who was in command of our forces there, retreated acrossthe Potomac at Shepherdtown; and General Weber, commanding at Harper'sFerry, crossed the occupied Hagerstown, moving a strong column towardsFrederick City.  General Wallace, with Rickett's division and his owncommand, the latter mostly new and undisciplined troops, pushed out fromBaltimore with great promptness, and met the enemy in force on theMonocacy, near the crossing of the railroad bridge.  His force was notsufficient to insure success, but he fought the enemy nevertheless, andalthough it resulted in a defeat to our arms, yet it detained the enemy,and thereby served to enable General Wright to reach Washington with twodivision of the 6th corps, and the advance of the 19th corps, beforehim.  From Monocacy the enemy moved on Washington, his cavalry advancereaching Rockville on the evening of the 10th.  On the 12th areconnoissance was thrown out in front of Fort Stevens, to ascertain theenemy's position and force.  A severe skirmish ensued, in which we lostabout two hundred and eighty in killed and wounded.  The enemy's losswas probably greater.  He commenced retreating during the night.Learning the exact condition of affairs at Washington, I requested bytelegraph, at forty-five minutes past eleven P.M., on the 12th, theassignment of Major-General H. G. Wright to the command of all thetroops that could be made available to operate in the field against theenemy, and directed that he should get outside of the trenches with allthe force he could, and push Early to the last moment.  General Wrightcommenced the pursuit on the 13th; on the 18th the enemy was overtakenat Snicker's Ferry, on the Shenandoah, when a sharp skirmish occurred;and on the 20th, General Averell encountered and defeated a portion ofthe rebel army at Winchester, capturing four pieces of artillery andseveral hundred prisoners.Learning that Early was retreating south towards Lynchburg or Richmond,I directed that the 6th and 19th corps be got back to the armiesoperating against Richmond, so that they might be used in a movementagainst Lee before the return of the troops sent by him into the valley;and that Hunter should remain in the Shenandoah Valley, keeping betweenany force of the enemy and Washington, acting on the defensive as muchas possible.  I felt that if the enemy had any notion of returning, thefact would be developed before the 6th and 19th corps could leaveWashington.  Subsequently, the 19th corps was excepted form the order toreturn to the James.About the 25th it became evident that the enemy was again advancing uponMaryland and Pennsylvania, and the 6th corps, then at Washington, wasordered back to the vicinity of Harper's Ferry.  The rebel force moveddown the valley, and sent a raiding party into Pennsylvania which on the30th burned Chambersburg, and then retreated, pursued by our cavalry,towards Cumberland.  They were met and defeated by General Kelley, andwith diminished numbers escaped into the mountains of West Virginia.From the time of the first raid the telegraph wires were frequently downbetween Washington and City Point, making it necessary to transmitmessages a part of the way by boat.  It took from twenty-four tothirty-six hours to get dispatches through and return answers would bereceived showing a different state of facts from those on which theywere based, causing confusion and apparent contradiction of orders thatmust have considerably embarrassed those who had to execute them, andrendered operations against the enemy less effective than they otherwisewould have been. To remedy this evil, it was evident to my mind thatsome person should have the supreme command of all the forces in theDepartment of West Virginia, Washington, Susquehanna, and the MiddleDepartment, and I so recommended.On the 2d of August, I ordered General Sheridan to report in person toMajor-General Halleck, chief of staff, at Washington, with a view to hisassignment to the command of all the forces against Early.  At this timethe enemy was concentrated in the neighborhood of Winchester, while ourforces, under General Hunter, were concentrated on the Monocacy, at thecrossing of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, leaving open to the enemyWestern Maryland and Southern Pennsylvania.  From where I was, Ihesitated to give positive orders for the movement of our forces atMonocacy, lest by so doing I should expose Washington. Therefore, on the4th, I left City Point to visit Hunter's command, and determine formyself what was best to be done.  On arrival there, and afterconsultation with General Hunter, I issued to him the followinginstructions:"MONOCACY BRIDGE, MARYLAND, August 5, 1864--8 P.M."GENERAL:--Concentrate all your available force without delay in thevicinity of Harper's Ferry, leaving only such railroad guards andgarrisons for public property as may be necessary.  Use, in thisconcentrating, the railroad, if by so doing time can be saved.  FromHarper's Ferry, if it is found that the enemy has moved north of thePotomac in large force, push north, following him and attacking himwherever found; follow him, if driven south of the Potomac, as long asit is safe to do so.  If it is ascertained that the enemy has but asmall force north of the Potomac, then push south with the main force,detaching under a competent commander, a sufficient force to look afterthe raiders, and drive them to their homes.  In detaching such a force,the brigade of the cavalry now en route from Washington via Rockvillemay be taken into account."There are now on their way to join you three other brigades of the bestcavalry, numbering at least five thousand men and horses.  These will beinstructed, in the absence of further orders, to join you by the southside of the Potomac.  One brigade will probably start to-morrow.  Inpushing up the Shenandoah Valley, where it is expected you will have togo first or last, it is desirable that nothing should be left to invitethe enemy to return.  Take all provisions, forage, and stock wanted forthe use of your command; such as cannot be consumed, destroy.  It is notdesirable that the buildings should be destroyed--they should rather beprotected; but the people should be informed that, so long as an armycan subsist among them, recurrence of theses raids must be expected, andwe are determined to stop them at all hazards."Bear in mind, the object is to drive the enemy south; and to do thisyou want to keep him always in sight.  Be guided in your course by thecourse he takes."Make your own arrangements for supplies of all kinds, giving regularvouchers for such as may be taken from loyal citizens in the countrythrough which you march."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL D. HUNTER."The troops were immediately put in motion, and the advance reachedHalltown that night.General Hunter having, in our conversation, expressed a willingness tobe relieved from command, I telegraphed to have General Sheridan, thenat Washington, sent to Harper's Ferry by the morning train, with ordersto take general command of all the troops in the field, and to call onGeneral Hunter at Monocacy, who would turn over to him my letter ofinstructions.  I remained at Monocacy until General Sheridan arrived, onthe morning of the 6th, and, after a conference with him in relation tomilitary affairs in that vicinity, I returned to City Point by way ofWashington.On the 7th of August, the Middle Department, and the Departments of WestVirginia, Washington, and Susquehanna, were constituted into the "MiddleMilitary Division," and  Major-General Sheridan was assigned totemporary command of the same.Two divisions of cavalry, commanded by Generals Torbert and Wilson, weresent to Sheridan from the Army of the Potomac. The first reached him atHarper's Ferry about the 11th of August.His operations during the month of August and the fore part of Septemberwere both of an offensive and defensive character, resulting in manysevere skirmishes, principally by the cavalry, in which we weregenerally successful, but no general engagement took place.  The twoarmies lay in such a position--the enemy on the west bank of the OpequonCreek covering Winchester, and our forces in front of Berryville--thateither could bring on a battle at any time.  Defeat to us would lay opento the enemy the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania for long distancesbefore another army could be interposed to check him.  Under thesecircumstances I hesitated about allowing the initiative to be taken.Finally, the use of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the Chesapeakeand Ohio Canal, which were both obstructed by the enemy, became soindispensably necessary to us, and the importance of relievingPennsylvania and Maryland from continuously threatened invasion sogreat, that I determined the risk should be taken.  But fearing totelegraph the order for an attack without knowing more than I did ofGeneral Sheridan's feelings as to what would be the probable result, Ileft City Point on the 15th of September to visit him at hisheadquarters, to decide, after conference with him, what should be done.I met him at Charlestown, and he pointed out so distinctly how each armylay; what he could do the moment he was authorized, and expressed suchconfidence of success, that I saw there were but two words ofinstructions necessary--Go in!  For the conveniences of forage, theteams for supplying the army were kept at Harper's Ferry.  I asked himif he could get out his teams and supplies in time to make an attack onthe ensuing Tuesday morning.  His reply was, that he could beforedaylight on Monday.  He was off promptly to time, and I may here add,that the result was such that I have never since deemed it necessary tovisit General Sheridan before giving him orders.Early on the morning of the 19th, General Sheridan attacked GeneralEarly at the crossing on the Opequon Creek, and after a most sanguinaryand bloody battle, lasting until five o'clock in the evening, defeatedhim with heavy loss, carrying his entire position from Opequon Creek toWinchester, capturing several thousand prisoners and five pieces ofartillery.  The enemy rallied, and made a stand in a strong position atFisher's Hill, where he was attacked, and again defeated with heavy losson the 20th [22d].  Sheridan pursued him with great energy throughHarrisonburg, Staunton, and the gaps of the Blue Ridge.  After strippingthe upper valley of most of the supplies and provisions for the rebelarmy, he returned to Strasburg, and took position on the north side ofCedar Creek.Having received considerable reinforcements, General Early againreturned to the valley, and, on the 9th of October, his cavalryencountered ours near Strasburg, where the rebels were defeated, withthe loss of eleven pieces of artillery and three hundred and fiftyprisoners.  On the night of the 18th, the enemy crossed the mountainswhich separate the branches of the Shenandoah, forded the North Fork,and early on the morning of the 19th, under cover of the darkness andthe fog, surprised and turned our left flank, and captured the batterieswhich enfiladed our whole line.  Our troops fell back with heavy lossand in much confusion, but were finally rallied between Middletown andNewtown.  At this juncture, General Sheridan, who was at Winchester whenthe battle commenced arrived on the field, arranged his lines just intime to repulse a heavy attack of the enemy, and immediately assumingthe offensive, he attacked in turn with great vigor.  The enemy wasdefeated with great slaughter, and the loss of most of his artillery andtrains, and the trophies he had captured in the morning.  The wreck ofhis army escaped during the night, and fled in the direction of Stauntonand Lynchburg.  Pursuit was made to Mount Jackson. Thus ended this, theenemy's last attempt to invade the North via the Shenandoah Valley.  Iwas now enabled to return the 6th corps to the Army of the Potomac, andto send one division from Sheridan's army to the Army of the James, andanother to Savannah, Georgia, to hold Sherman's new acquisitions on thesea-coast, and thus enable him to move without detaching from his forcefor that purpose.Reports from various sources led me to believe that the enemy haddetached three divisions from Petersburg to reinforce Early in theShenandoah Valley.  I therefore sent the 2d corps and Gregg's divisionof cavalry, of the Army of the Potomac, and a force of General Butler'sarmy, on the night of the 13th of August, to threaten Richmond from thenorth side of the James, to prevent him from sending troops away, and,if possible, to draw back those sent.  In this move we captured sixpieces of artillery and several hundred prisoners, detained troops thatwere under marching orders, and ascertained that but one division(Kershaw's), of the three reputed detached, had gone.The enemy having withdrawn heavily from Petersburg to resist thismovement, the 5th corps, General Warren commanding, was moved out on the18th, and took possession of the Weldon Railroad.  During the day he hadconsiderable fighting.  To regain possession of the road, the enemy maderepeated and desperate assaults, but was each time repulsed with greatloss.  On the night of the 20th, the troops on the north side of theJames were withdrawn, and Hancock and Gregg returned to the front atPetersburg.  On the 25th, the 2d corps and Gregg's division of cavalry,while at Reams's Station destroying the railroad, were attacked, andafter desperate fighting, a part of our line gave way, and five piecesof artillery fell into the hands of the enemy.By the 12th of September, a branch railroad was completed from the CityPoint and Petersburg Railroad to the Weldon Railroad, enabling us tosupply, without difficulty, in all weather, the army in front ofPetersburg.The extension of our lines across the Weldon Railroad compelled theenemy to so extend his, that it seemed he could have but few troopsnorth of the James for the defence of Richmond.  On the night of the28th, the 10th corps, Major-General Birney, and the 18th corps,Major-General Ord commanding, of General Butler's army, were crossed tothe north side of the James, and advanced on the morning of the 29th,carrying the very strong fortifications and intrenchments belowChaffin's Farm, known as Fort Harrison, capturing fifteen pieces ofartillery, and the New Market Road and intrenchments.  This success wasfollowed up by a gallant assault upon Fort Gilmer, immediately in frontof the Chaffin Farm fortifications, in which we were repulsed with heavyloss.  Kautz's cavalry was pushed forward on the road to the right ofthis, supported by infantry, and reached the enemy's inner line, but wasunable to get further.  The position captured from the enemy was sothreatening to Richmond, that I determined to hold it.  The enemy madeseveral desperate attempts to dislodge us, all of which wereunsuccessful, and for which he paid dearly.  On the morning of the 30th,General Meade sent out a reconnoissance with a view to attacking theenemy's line, if it was found sufficiently weakened by withdrawal oftroops to the north side.  In this reconnoissance we captured and heldthe enemy's works near Poplar Spring Church.  In the afternoon, troopsmoving to get to the left of the point gained were attacked by the enemyin heavy force, and compelled to fall back until supported by the forcesholding the captured works. Our cavalry under Gregg was also attacked,but repulsed the enemy with great loss.On the 7th of October, the enemy attacked Kautz's cavalry north of theJames, and drove it back with heavy loss in killed, wounded, andprisoners, and the loss of all the artillery eight or nine pieces.  Thishe followed up by an attack on our intrenched infantry line, but wasrepulsed with severe slaughter.  On the 13th, a reconnoissance was sentout by General Butler, with a view to drive the enemy from some newworks he was constructing, which resulted in very heavy loss to us.On the 27th, the Army of the Potomac, leaving only sufficient men tohold its fortified line, moved by the enemy's right flank.  The 2dcorps, followed by two divisions of the 5th corps, with the cavalry inadvance and covering our left flank, forced a passage of Hatcher's Run,and moved up the south side of it towards the South Side Railroad, untilthe 2d corps and part of the cavalry reached the Boydton Plank Roadwhere it crosses Hatcher's Run.  At this point we were six miles distantfrom the South Side Railroad, which I had hoped by this movement toreach and hold.  But finding that we had not reached the end of theenemy's fortifications, and no place presenting itself for a successfulassault by which he might be doubled up and shortened, I determined towithdraw to within our fortified line.  Orders were given accordingly.Immediately upon receiving a report that General Warren had connectedwith General Hancock, I returned to my headquarters.  Soon after I leftthe enemy moved out across Hatcher's Run, in the gap between GeneralsHancock and Warren, which was not closed as reported, and made adesperate attack on General Hancock's right and rear.  General Hancockimmediately faced his corps to meet it, and after a bloody combat drovethe enemy within his works, and withdrew that night to his old position.In support of this movement, General Butler made a demonstration on thenorth side of the James, and attacked the enemy on the WilliamsburgRoad, and also on the York River Railroad.  In the former he wasunsuccessful; in the latter he succeeded in carrying a work which wasafterwards abandoned, and his forces withdrawn to their formerpositions.From this time forward the operations in front of Petersburg andRichmond, until the spring campaign of 1865, were confined to thedefence and extension of our lines, and to offensive movements forcrippling the enemy's lines of communication, and to prevent hisdetaching any considerable force to send south.  By the 7th of February,our lines were extended to Hatcher's Run, and the Weldon Railroad hadbeen destroyed to Hicksford.General Sherman moved from Chattanooga on the 6th of May, with theArmies of the Cumberland, Tennessee, and Ohio, commanded, respectively,by Generals Thomas McPherson, and Schofield, upon Johnston's army atDalton; but finding the enemy's position at Buzzard's Roost, coveringDalton, too strong to be assaulted, General McPherson was sent throughSnake Gap to turn it, while Generals Thomas and Schofield threatened itin front and on the north.  This movement was successful.  Johnston,finding his retreat likely to be cut off, fell back to his fortifiedposition at Resaca, where he was attacked on the afternoon of May 15th.A heavy battle ensued.  During the night the enemy retreated south.Late on the 17th, his rear-guard was overtaken near Adairsville, andheavy skirmishing followed.  The next morning, however, he had againdisappeared.  He was vigorously pursued, and was overtaken at Cassvilleon the 19th, but during the ensuing night retreated across the Etowah.While these operations were going on, General Jefferson C. Davis'sdivision of Thomas's army was sent to Rome, capturing it with its fortsand artillery, and its valuable mills and foundries.  General Sherman,having give his army a few days' rest at this point, again put it inmotion on the 23d, for Dallas, with a view of turning the difficult passat Allatoona.  On the afternoon of the 25th, the advance, under GeneralHooker, had a severe battle with the enemy, driving him back to New HopeChurch, near Dallas.  Several sharp encounters occurred at this point.The most important was on the 28th, when the enemy assaulted GeneralMcPherson at Dallas, but received a terrible and bloody repulse.On the 4th of June, Johnston abandoned his intrenched position at NewHope Church, and retreated to the strong positions of Kenesaw, Pine, andLost mountains.  He was forced to yield the two last-named places, andconcentrate his army on Kenesaw, where, on the 27th, Generals Thomas andMcPherson made a determined but unsuccessful assault.  On the night ofthe 2d of July, Sherman commenced moving his army by the right flank,and on the morning of the 3d, found that the enemy, in consequence ofthis movement, had abandoned Kenesaw and retreated across theChattahoochee.General Sherman remained on the Chattahoochee to give his men rest andget up stores until the 17th of July, when he resumed his operations,crossed the Chattahoochee, destroyed a large portion of the railroad toAugusta, and drove the enemy back to Atlanta. At this place General Hoodsucceeded General Johnston in command of the rebel army, and assumingthe offensive-defensive policy, made several severe attacks upon Shermanin the vicinity of Atlanta, the most desperate and determined of whichwas on the 22d of July.  About one P.M. of this day the brave,accomplished, and noble-hearted McPherson was killed.  General Logansucceeded him, and commanded the Army of the Tennessee through thisdesperate battle, and until he was superseded by Major-General Howard,on the 26th, with the same success and ability that had characterizedhim in the command of a corps or division.In all these attacks the enemy was repulsed with great loss. Finding itimpossible to entirely invest the place, General Sherman, after securinghis line of communications across the Chattahoochee, moved his mainforce round by the enemy's left flank upon the Montgomery and Maconroads, to draw the enemy from his fortifications.  In this he succeeded,and after defeating the enemy near Rough-and-Ready, Jonesboro, andLovejoy's, forcing him to retreat to the south, on the 2d of Septemberoccupied Atlanta, the objective point of his campaign.About the time of this move, the rebel cavalry, under Wheeler, attemptedto cut his communications in the rear, but was repulsed at Dalton, anddriven into East Tennessee, whence it proceeded west to McMinnville,Murfreesboro, and Franklin, and was finally driven south of theTennessee.  The damage done by this raid was repaired in a few days.During the partial investment of Atlanta, General Rousseau joinedGeneral Sherman with a force of cavalry from Decatur, having made asuccessful raid upon the Atlanta and Montgomery Railroad, and itsbranches near Opelika. Cavalry raids were also made by Generals McCook,Garrard, and Stoneman, to cut the remaining Railroad communication withAtlanta.  The first two were successful the latter, disastrous.General Sherman's movement from Chattanooga to Atlanta was prompt,skilful, and brilliant.  The history of his flank movements and battlesduring that memorable campaign will ever be read with an interestunsurpassed by anything in history.His own report, and those of his subordinate commanders, accompanyingit, give the details of that most successful campaign.He was dependent for the supply of his armies upon a single-trackrailroad from Nashville to the point where he was operating.  Thispassed the entire distance through a hostile country, and every foot ofit had to be protected by troops. The cavalry force of the enemy underForrest, in Northern Mississippi, was evidently waiting for Sherman toadvance far enough into the mountains of Georgia, to make a retreatdisastrous, to get upon this line and destroy it beyond the possibilityof further use.  To guard against this danger, Sherman left what hesupposed to be a sufficient force to operate against Forrest in WestTennessee.  He directed General Washburn, who commanded there, to sendBrigadier-General S. D. Sturgis in command of this force to attack him.On the morning of the 10th of June, General Sturgis met the enemy nearGuntown, Mississippi, was badly beaten, and driven back in utter routand confusion to Memphis, a distance of about one hundred miles, hotlypursued by the enemy.  By this, however, the enemy was defeated in hisdesigns upon Sherman's line of communications. The persistency withwhich he followed up this success exhausted him, and made a season forrest and repairs necessary.  In the meantime, Major-General A. J. Smith,with the troops of the Army of the Tennessee that had been sent byGeneral Sherman to General Banks, arrived at Memphis on their returnfrom Red River, where they had done most excellent service.  He wasdirected by General Sherman to immediately take the offensive againstForrest.  This he did with the promptness and effect which hascharacterized his whole military career.  On the 14th of July, he metthe enemy at Tupelo, Mississippi, and whipped him badly.  The fightingcontinued through three days.  Our loss was small compared with that ofthe enemy.  Having accomplished the object of his expedition, GeneralSmith returned to Memphis.During the months of March and April this same force under Forrestannoyed us considerably.  On the 24th of March it captured Union City,Kentucky, and its garrison, and on the 24th attacked Paducah, commandedby Colonel S. G. Hicks, 40th Illinois Volunteers.  Colonel H., havingbut a small force, withdrew to the forts near the river, from where herepulsed the enemy and drove him from the place.On the 13th of April, part of this force, under the rebel GeneralBuford, summoned the garrison of Columbus, Kentucky, to surrender, butreceived for reply from Colonel Lawrence, 34th New Jersey Volunteers,that being placed there by his Government with adequate force to holdhis post and repel all enemies from it, surrender was out of thequestion.On the morning of the same day Forrest attacked Fort Pillow, Tennessee,garrisoned by a detachment of Tennessee cavalry and the 1st RegimentAlabama colored troops, commanded by Major Booth.  The garrison foughtbravely until about three o'clock in the afternoon, when the enemycarried the works by assault; and, after our men threw down their arms,proceeded to an inhuman and merciless massacre of the garrison.On the 14th, General Buford, having failed at Columbus, appeared beforePaducah, but was again driven off.Guerillas and raiders, seemingly emboldened by Forrest's operations,were also very active in Kentucky.  The most noted of these was Morgan.With a force of from two to three thousand cavalry, he entered the Statethrough Pound Gap in the latter part of May.  On the 11th of June theyattacked and captured Cynthiana, with its entire garrison.  On the 12thhe was overtaken by General Burbridge, and completely routed with heavyloss, and was finally driven out of the State.  This notorious guerillawas afterwards surprised and killed near Greenville, Tennessee, and hiscommand captured and dispersed by General Gillem.In the absence of official reports of the commencement of the Red Riverexpedition, except so far as relates to the movements of the troops sentby General Sherman under General A. J. Smith, I am unable to give thedate of its starting.  The troops under General Smith, comprising twodivisions of the 16th and a detachment of the 17th army corps, leftVicksburg on the 10th of March, and reached the designated point on RedRiver one day earlier than that appointed by General Banks.  The rebelforces at Fort de Russy, thinking to defeat him, left the fort on the14th to give him battle in the open field; but, while occupying theenemy with skirmishing and demonstrations, Smith pushed forward to Fortde Russy, which had been left with a weak garrison, and captured it withits garrison about three hundred and fifty men, eleven pieces ofartillery, and many small-arms.  Our loss was but slight.  On the 15thhe pushed forward to Alexandria, which place he reached on the 18th.  Onthe 21st he had an engagement with the enemy at Henderson's Hill, inwhich he defeated him, capturing two hundred and ten prisoners and fourpieces of artillery.On the 28th, he again attacked and defeated the enemy under the rebelGeneral Taylor, at Cane River.  By the 26th, General Banks had assembledhis whole army at Alexandria, and pushed forward to Grand Ecore.  On themorning of April 6th he moved from Grand Ecore.  On the afternoon of the7th, he advanced and met the enemy near Pleasant Hill, and drove himfrom the field.  On the same afternoon the enemy made a stand eightmiles beyond Pleasant Hill, but was again compelled to retreat.  On the8th, at Sabine Cross Roads and Peach Hill, the enemy attacked anddefeated his advance, capturing nineteen pieces of artillery and animmense amount of transportation and stores.  During the night, GeneralBanks fell back to Pleasant Hill, where another battle was fought on the9th, and the enemy repulsed with great loss.  During the night, GeneralBanks continued his retrograde movement to Grand Ecore, and thence toAlexandria, which he reached on the 27th of April.  Here a seriousdifficulty arose in getting Admiral Porter's fleet which accompanied theexpedition, over the rapids, the water having fallen so much since theypassed up as to prevent their return.  At the suggestion of Colonel (nowBrigadier-General) Bailey, and under his superintendence, wing-dams wereconstructed, by which the channel was contracted so that the fleetpassed down the rapids in safety.The army evacuated Alexandria on the 14th of May, after considerableskirmishing with the enemy's advance, and reached Morganzia and PointCoupee near the end of the month.  The disastrous termination of thisexpedition, and the lateness of the season, rendered impracticable thecarrying out of my plans of a movement in force sufficient to insure thecapture of Mobile.On the 23d of March, Major-General Steele left Little Rock with the 7tharmy corps, to  cooperate with General Banks's expedition on the RedRiver, and reached Arkadelphia on the 28th.  On the 16th of April, afterdriving the enemy before him, he was joined, near Elkin's Ferry, inWashita County, by General Thayer, who had marched from Fort Smith.After several severe skirmishes, in which the enemy was defeated,General Steele reached Camden, which he occupied about the middle ofApril.On learning the defeat and consequent retreat of General Banks on RedRiver, and the loss of one of his own trains at Mark's Mill, in DallasCounty, General Steele determined to fall back to the Arkansas River.He left Camden on the 26th of April, and reached Little Rock on the 2dof May.  On the 30th of April, the enemy attacked him while crossingSaline River at Jenkins's Ferry, but was repulsed with considerableloss.  Our loss was about six hundred in killed, wounded and prisoners.Major-General Canby, who had been assigned to the command of the"Military Division of the West Mississippi," was therefore directed tosend the 19th army corps to join the armies operating against Richmond,and to limit the remainder of his command to such operations as might benecessary to hold the positions and lines of communications he thenoccupied.Before starting General A. J. Smith's troops back to Sherman, GeneralCanby sent a part of it to disperse a force of the enemy that wascollecting near the Mississippi River.  General Smith met and defeatedthis force near Lake Chicot on the 5th of June.  Our loss was aboutforty killed and seventy wounded.In the latter part of July, General Canby sent Major-General GordonGranger, with such forces as he could collect, to co-operate withAdmiral Farragut against the defences of Mobile Bay.  On the 8th ofAugust, Fort Gaines surrendered to the combined naval and land forces.Fort Powell was blown up and abandoned.On the 9th, Fort Morgan was invested, and, after a severe bombardment,surrendered on the 23d.  The total captures amounted to one thousandfour hundred and sixty-four prisoners, and one hundred and four piecesof artillery.About the last of August, it being reported that the rebel GeneralPrice, with a force of about ten thousand men, had reached Jacksonport,on his way to invade Missouri, General A. J. Smith's command, then enroute from Memphis to join Sherman, was ordered to Missouri.  A cavalryforce was also, at the same time, sent from Memphis, under command ofColonel Winslow.  This made General Rosecrans's forces superior to thoseof Price, and no doubt was entertained he would be able to check Priceand drive him back; while the forces under General Steele, in Arkansas,would cut off his retreat.  On the 26th day of September, Price attackedPilot Knob and forced the garrison to retreat, and thence moved north tothe Missouri River, and continued up that river towards Kansas.  GeneralCurtis, commanding Department of Kansas, immediately collected suchforces as he could to repel the invasion of Kansas, while GeneralRosecrans's cavalry was operating in his rear.The enemy was brought to battle on the Big Blue and defeated, with theloss of nearly all his artillery and trains and a large number ofprisoners.  He made a precipitate retreat to Northern Arkansas.  Theimpunity with which Price was enabled to roam over the State of Missourifor a long time, and the incalculable mischief done by him, show to howlittle purpose a superior force may be used.  There is no reason whyGeneral Rosecrans should not have concentrated his forces, and beatenand driven Price before the latter reached Pilot Knob.September 20th, the enemy's cavalry, under Forrest, crossed theTennessee near Waterloo, Alabama, and on the 23d attacked the garrisonat Athens, consisting of six hundred men, which capitulated on the 24th.Soon after the surrender two regiments of reinforcements arrived, andafter a severe fight were compelled to surrender.  Forrest destroyed therailroad westward, captured the garrison at Sulphur Branch trestle,skirmished with the garrison at Pulaski on the 27th, and on the same daycut the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad near Tullahoma and Dechard.On the morning of the 30th, one column of Forrest's command, underBuford, appeared before Huntsville, and summoned the surrender of thegarrison.  Receiving an answer in the negative, he remained in thevicinity of the place until next morning, when he again summoned itssurrender, and received the same reply as on the night before.  Hewithdrew in the direction of Athens which place had been regarrisoned,and attacked it on the afternoon of the 1st of October, but withoutsuccess.  On the morning of the 2d he renewed his attack, but washandsomely repulsed.Another column under Forrest appeared before Columbia on the morning ofthe 1st, but did not make an attack.  On the morning of the 3d he movedtowards Mount Pleasant.  While these operations were going on, everyexertion was made by General Thomas to destroy the forces under Forrestbefore he could recross the Tennessee, but was unable to prevent hisescape to Corinth, Mississippi.In September, an expedition under General Burbridge was sent to destroythe saltworks at Saltville, Virginia. He met the enemy on the 2d ofOctober, about three miles and a half from Saltville, and drove him intohis strongly intrenched position around the salt-works, from which hewas unable to dislodge him.  During the night he withdrew his commandand returned to Kentucky.General Sherman, immediately after the fall of Atlanta, put his armiesin camp in and about the place, and made all preparations for refittingand supplying them for future service.  The great length of road fromAtlanta to the Cumberland River, however, which had to be guarded,allowed the troops but little rest.During this time Jefferson Davis made a speech in Macon, Georgia, whichwas reported in the papers of the South, and soon became known to thewhole country, disclosing the plans of the enemy, thus enabling GeneralSherman to fully meet them.  He exhibited the weakness of supposing thatan army that had been beaten and fearfully decimated in a vain attemptat the defensive, could successfully undertake the offensive against thearmy that had so often defeated it.In execution of this plan, Hood, with this army, was soon reported tothe south-west of Atlanta. Moving far to Sherman's right, he succeededin reaching the railroad about Big Shanty, and moved north on it.General Sherman, leaving a force to hold Atlanta, with the remainder ofhis army fell upon him and drove him to Gadsden, Alabama. Seeing theconstant annoyance he would have with the roads to his rear if heattempted to hold Atlanta, General Sherman proposed the abandonment anddestruction of that place, with all the railroads leading to it, andtelegraphed me as follows:"CENTREVILLE, GEORGIA", October 10--noon."Dispatch about Wilson just received.  Hood is now crossing Coosa River,twelve miles below Rome, bound west.  If he passes over the Mobile andOhio road, had I not better execute the plan of my letter sent byColonel Porter, and leave General Thomas with the troops now inTennessee to defend the State?  He will have an ample force when thereinforcements ordered reach Nashville."W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General."LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT."For a full understanding of the plan referred to in this dispatch, Iquote from the letter sent by Colonel Porter:"I will therefore give my opinion, that your army and Canby's should bereinforced to the maximum; that after you get Wilmington, you strike forSavannah and the river; that Canby be instructed to hold the MississippiRiver, and send a force to get Columbus, Georgia, either by the way ofthe Alabama or the Appalachicola, and that I keep Hood employed and putmy army in final order for a march on Augusta, Columbia, and Charleston,to be ready as soon as Wilmington is sealed as to commerce and the cityof Savannah is in our possession."  This was in reply to a letter ofmine of date September 12th, in answer to a dispatch of his containingsubstantially the same proposition, and in which I informed him of aproposed movement against Wilmington, and of the situation in Virginia,etc."CITY POINT, VIRGINIA,"October 11, 1864--11 A.M."Your dispatch of October 10th received.  Does it not look as if Hoodwas going to attempt the invasion of Middle Tennessee, using the Mobileand Ohio and Memphis and Charleston roads to supply his base on theTennessee River, about Florence or Decatur?  If he does this, he oughtto be met and prevented from getting north of the Tennessee River.  Ifyou were to cut loose, I do not believe you would meet Hood's army, butwould be bushwhacked by all the old men and little boys, and suchrailroad guards as are still left at home.  Hood would probably strikefor Nashville, thinking that by going north he could inflict greaterdamage upon us than we could upon the rebels by going south.  If thereis any way of getting at Hood's army, I would prefer that, but I musttrust to your own judgment.  I find I shall not be able to send a forcefrom here to act with you on Savannah. Your movements, therefore, willbe independent of mine; at least until the fall of Richmond takes place.I am afraid Thomas, with such lines of road as he has to protect, couldnot prevent Hood from going north.  With Wilson turned loose, with allyour cavalry, you will find the rebels put much more on the defensivethan heretofore."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.""KINGSTON, GEORGIA, "October 11--11 A.M."Hood moved his army from Palmetto Station across by Dallas andCedartown, and is now on the Coosa River, south of Rome.  He threw onecorps on my road at Acworth, and I was forced to follow.  I hold Atlantawith the 20th corps, and have strong detachments along my line.  Thisreduces my active force to a comparatively small army.  We cannot remainhere on the defensive.  With the twenty-five thousand men, and the boldcavalry he has, he can constantly break my roads.  I would infinitelyprefer to make a wreck of the road, and of the country from Chattanoogato Atlanta including the latter city send back all my wounded andworthless, and with my effective army, move through Georgia, smashingthings, to the sea. Hood may turn into Tennessee and Kentucky, but Ibelieve he will be forced to follow me.  Instead of my being on thedefensive, I would be on the offensive; instead of guessing at what hemeans to do, he would have to guess at my plans.  The difference in waris full twenty-five per cent.  I can make Savannah, Charleston, or themouth of the Chattahoochee."Answer quick, as I know we will not have the telegraph long."W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General."LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT.""CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, "October 11,1864--11.30 P.M."Your dispatch of to-day received.  If you are satisfied the trip to thesea-coast can be made, holding the line of the Tennessee River firmly,you may make it, destroying all the railroad south of Dalton orChattanooga, as you think best."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN."It was the original design to hold Atlanta, and by getting through tothe coast, with a garrison left on the southern railroads, leading eastand west, through Georgia, to effectually sever the east from the west.In other words, cut the would-be Confederacy in two again, as it hadbeen cut once by our gaining possession of the Mississippi River.General Sherman's plan virtually effected this object.General Sherman commenced at once his preparations for his proposedmovement, keeping his army in position in the meantime to watch Hood.Becoming satisfied that Hood had moved westward from Gadsden across SandMountain, General Sherman sent the 4th corps,  Major-General Stanleycommanding, and the 23d corps, Major-General Schofield commanding, backto Chattanooga to report to Major-General Thomas, at Nashville, whom hehad placed in command of all the troops of his military division, savethe four army corps and cavalry division he designed to move withthrough Georgia. With the troops thus left at his disposal, there waslittle doubt that General Thomas could hold the line of the Tennessee,or, in the event Hood should force it, would be able to concentrate andbeat him in battle.  It was therefore readily consented to that Shermanshould start for the sea-coast.Having concentrated his troops at Atlanta by the 14th of November, hecommenced his march, threatening both Augusta and Macon.  His coming-outpoint could not be definitely fixed. Having to gather his subsistence ashe marched through the country, it was not impossible that a forceinferior to his own might compel him to head for such point as he couldreach, instead of such as he might prefer.  The blindness of the enemy,however, in ignoring his movement, and sending Hood's army, the onlyconsiderable force he had west of Richmond and east of the MississippiRiver, northward on an offensive campaign, left the whole country open,and Sherman's route to his own choice.How that campaign was conducted, how little opposition was met with, thecondition of the country through which the armies passed, the capture ofFort McAllister, on the Savannah River, and the occupation of Savannahon the 21st of December, are all clearly set forth in General Sherman'sadmirable report.Soon after General Sherman commenced his march from Atlanta, twoexpeditions, one from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and one from Vicksburg,Mississippi, were started by General Canby to cut the enemy's lines ofcommunication with Mobile and detain troops in that field.  GeneralFoster, commanding Department of the South, also sent an expedition, viaBroad River, to destroy the railroad between Charleston and Savannah.The expedition from Vicksburg, under command of Brevet Brigadier-GeneralE. D. Osband (colonel 3d United States colored cavalry), captured, onthe 27th of November, and destroyed the Mississippi Central Railroadbridge and trestle-work over Big Black River, near Canton, thirty milesof the road, and two locomotives, besides large amounts of stores.  Theexpedition from Baton Rouge was without favorable results.  Theexpedition from the Department of the South, under the immediate commandof Brigadier-General John P. Hatch, consisting of about five thousandmen of all arms, including a brigade from the navy, proceeded up BroadRiver and debarked at Boyd's Neck on the 29th of November, from where itmoved to strike the railroad at Grahamsville.  At Honey Hill, aboutthree miles from Grahamsville, the enemy was found and attacked in astrongly fortified position, which resulted, after severe fighting, inour repulse with a loss of seven hundred and forty-six in killed,wounded, and missing.  During the night General Hatch withdrew.  On the6th of December General Foster obtained a position covering theCharleston and Savannah Railroad, between the Coosawhatchie andTulifinny rivers.Hood, instead of following Sherman, continued his move northward, whichseemed to me to be leading to his certain doom.  At all events, had Ihad the power to command both armies, I should not have changed theorders under which he seemed to be acting.  On the 26th of October, theadvance of Hood's army attacked the garrison at Decatur, Alabama, butfailing to carry the place, withdrew towards Courtland, and succeeded,in the face of our cavalry, in effecting a lodgment on the north side ofthe Tennessee River, near Florence.  On the 28th, Forrest reached theTennessee, at Fort Heiman, and captured a gunboat and three transports.On the 2d of November he planted batteries above and below Johnsonville,on the opposite side of the river, isolating three gunboats and eighttransports.  On the 4th the enemy opened his batteries upon the place,and was replied to from the gunboats and the garrison.  The gunboatsbecoming disabled were set on fire, as also were the transports, toprevent their falling into the hands of the enemy.  About a million anda half dollars' worth of store and property on the levee and instorehouses was consumed by fire.  On the 5th the enemy disappeared andcrossed to the north side of the Tennessee River, above Johnsonville,moving towards Clifton, and subsequently joined Hood.  On the night ofthe 5th, General Schofield, with the advance of the 23d corps, reachedJohnsonville, but finding the enemy gone, was ordered to Pulaski, andwas put in command of all the troopers there, with instruction to watchthe movements of Hood and retard his advance, but not to risk a generalengagement until the arrival of General A. J. Smith's command fromMissouri, and until General Wilson could get his cavalry remounted.On the 19th, General Hood continued his advance.  General Thomas,retarding him as much as possible, fell back towards Nashville for thepurpose of concentrating his command and gaining time for the arrival ofreinforcements.  The enemy coming up with our main force, commanded byGeneral Schofield, at Franklin, on the 30th, assaulted our worksrepeatedly during the afternoon until late at night, but were in everyinstance repulsed.  His loss in this battle was one thousand sevenhundred and fifty killed, seven hundred and two prisoners, and threethousand eight hundred wounded.  Among his losses were six generalofficers killed, six wounded, and one captured.  Our entire loss was twothousand three hundred.  This was the first serious opposition the enemymet with, and I am satisfied was the fatal blow to all his expectations.During the night, General Schofield fell back towards Nashville.  Thisleft the field to the enemy--not lost by battle, but voluntarilyabandoned--so that General Thomas's whole force might be broughttogether.  The enemy followed up and commenced the establishment of hisline in front of Nashville on the 2d of December.As soon as it was ascertained that Hood was crossing the TennesseeRiver, and that Price was going out of Missouri, General Rosecrans wasordered to send to General Thomas the troops of General A. J. Smith'scommand, and such other troops as he could spare.  The advance of thisreinforcement reached Nashville on the 30th of November.On the morning of the 15th December, General Thomas attacked Hood inposition, and, in a battle lasting two days, defeated and drove him fromthe field in the utmost confusion, leaving in our hand most of hisartillery and many thousand prisoners, including four general officers.Before the battle of Nashville I grew very impatient over, as itappeared to me, the unnecessary delay.  This impatience was increasedupon learning that the enemy had sent a force of cavalry across theCumberland into Kentucky.  I feared Hood would cross his whole army andgive us great trouble there. After urging upon General Thomas thenecessity of immediately assuming the offensive, I started West tosuperintend matters there in person.  Reaching Washington City, Ireceived General Thomas's dispatch announcing his attack upon the enemy,and the result as far as the battle had progressed.  I was delighted.All fears and apprehensions were dispelled.  I am not yet satisfied butthat General Thomas, immediately upon the appearance of Hood beforeNashville, and before he had time to fortify, should have moved out withhis whole force and given him battle, instead of waiting to remount hiscavalry, which delayed him until the inclemency of the weather made itimpracticable to attack earlier than he did.  But his final defeat ofHood was so complete, that it will be accepted as a vindication of thatdistinguished officer's judgment.After Hood's defeat at Nashville he retreated, closely pursued bycavalry and infantry, to the Tennessee River, being forced to abandonmany pieces of artillery and most of his transportation.  On the 28th ofDecember our advanced forces ascertained that he had made good hisescape to the south side of the river.About this time, the rains having set in heavily in Tennessee and NorthAlabama, making it difficult to move army transportation and artillery,General Thomas stopped the pursuit by his main force at the TennesseeRiver.  A small force of cavalry, under Colonel W. J. Palmer, 15thPennsylvania Volunteers, continued to follow Hood for some distance,capturing considerable transportation and all the enemy'spontoon-bridge.  The details of these operations will be foundclearly set forth in General Thomas's report.A cavalry expedition, under Brevet Major-General Grierson, started fromMemphis on the 21st of December.  On the 25th he surprised and capturedForrest's dismounted camp at Verona, Mississippi, on the Mobile and OhioRailroad, destroyed the railroad, sixteen cars loaded with wagons andpontoons for Hood's army, four thousand new English carbines, and largeamounts of public stores.  On the morning of the 28th he attacked andcaptured a force of the enemy at Egypt, and destroyed a train offourteen cars; thence turning to the south-west, he struck theMississippi Central Railroad at Winona, destroyed the factories andlarge amounts of stores at Bankston, and the machine-shops and publicproperty at Grenada, arriving at Vicksburg January 5th.During the operations in Middle Tennessee, the enemy, with a force underGeneral Breckinridge, entered East Tennessee.  On the 13th of Novemberhe attacked General Gillem, near Morristown, capturing his artillery andseveral hundred prisoners.  Gillem, with what was left of his command,retreated to Knoxville.  Following up his success, Breckinridge moved tonear Knoxville, but withdrew on the 18th, followed by General Ammen.Under the directions of General Thomas, General Stoneman concentratedthe commands of Generals Burbridge and Gillem near Bean's Station tooperate against Breckinridge, and destroy or drive him into Virginia--destroy the salt-works at Saltville, and the railroad into Virginiaas far as he could go without endangering his command.  On the 12th ofDecember he commenced his movement, capturing and dispersing the enemy'sforces wherever he met them.  On the 16th he struck the enemy, underVaughn, at Marion, completely routing and pursuing him to Wytheville,capturing all his artillery, trains, and one hundred and ninety-eightprisoners; and destroyed Wytheville, with its stores and supplies, andthe extensive lead-works near there. Returning to Marion, he met a forceunder Breckinridge, consisting, among other troops, of the garrison ofSaltville, that had started in pursuit.  He at once made arrangements toattack it the next morning; but morning found Breckinridge gone.  Hethen moved directly to Saltville, and destroyed the extensive salt-worksat that place, a large amount of stores, and captured eight pieces ofartillery.  Having thus successfully executed his instructions, hereturned General Burbridge to Lexington and General Gillem to Knoxville.Wilmington, North Carolina, was the most important sea-coast port leftto the enemy through which to get supplies from abroad, and send cottonand other products out by blockade-runners, besides being a place ofgreat strategic value.  The navy had been making strenuous exertions toseal the harbor of Wilmington, but with only partial effect.  The natureof the outlet of Cape Fear River was such, that it required watching forso great a distance that, without possession of the land north of NewInlet, or Fort Fisher, it was impossible for the navy to entirely closethe harbor against the entrance of blockade-runners.To secure the possession of this land required the co-operation of aland force, which I agreed to furnish.  Immediately commenced theassemblage in Hampton Roads, under Admiral D. D. Porter, of the mostformidable armada ever collected for concentration upon one given point.This necessarily attracted the attention of the enemy, as well as thatof the loyal North; and through the imprudence of the public press, andvery likely of officers of both branches of service, the exact object ofthe expedition became a subject of common discussion in the newspapersboth North and South.  The enemy, thus warned, prepared to meet it.This caused a postponement of the expedition until the later part ofNovember, when, being again called upon by Hon. G. V. Fox, AssistantSecretary of the Navy, I agreed to furnish the men required at once, andwent myself, in company with Major-General Butler, to Hampton Roads,where we had a conference with Admiral Porter as to the force requiredand the time of starting.  A force of six thousand five hundred men wasregarded as sufficient.  The time of starting was not definitelyarranged, but it was thought all would be ready by the 6th of December,if not before.  Learning, on the 30th of November, that Bragg had goneto Georgia, taking with him most of the forces about Wilmington, Ideemed it of the utmost importance that the expedition should reach itsdestination before the return of Bragg, and directed General Butler tomake all arrangements for the departure of Major-General Weitzel, whohad been designated to command the land forces, so that the navy mightnot be detained one moment.On the 6th of December, the following instructions were given:"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, December 6, 1864."GENERAL:  The first object of the expedition under General Weitzel isto close to the enemy the port of Wilmington.  If successful in this,the second will be to capture Wilmington itself.  There are reasonablegrounds to hope for success, if advantage can be taken of the absence ofthe greater part of the enemy's forces now looking after Sherman inGeorgia.  The directions you have given for the numbers and equipment ofthe expedition are all right, except in the unimportant matter of wherethey embark and the amount of intrenching tools to be taken.  The objectof the expedition will be gained by effecting a landing on the main landbetween Cape Fear River and the Atlantic, north of the north entrance tothe river.  Should such landing be effected while the enemy still holdsFort Fisher and the batteries guarding the entrance to the river, thenthe troops should intrench themselves, and, by co-operating with thenavy, effect the reduction and capture of those places.  These in ourhands, the navy could enter the harbor, and the port of Wilmington wouldbe sealed.  Should Fort Fisher and the point of land on which it isbuilt fall into the hands of our troops immediately on landing, then itwill be worth the attempt to capture Wilmington by a forced march andsurprise.  If time is consumed in gaining the first object of theexpedition, the second will become a matter of after consideration."The details for execution are intrusted to you and the officerimmediately in command of the troops."Should the troops under General Weitzel fail to effect a landing at ornear Fort Fisher, they will be returned to the armies operating againstRichmond without delay."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL B. F. BUTLER."General Butler commanding the army from which the troops were taken forthis enterprise, and the territory within which they were to operate,military courtesy required that all orders and instructions should gothrough him.  They were so sent, but General Weitzel has sinceofficially informed me that he never received the foregoinginstructions, nor was he aware of their existence, until he read GeneralButler's published official report of the Fort Fisher failure, with myindorsement and papers accompanying it.  I had no idea of GeneralButler's accompanying the expedition until the evening before it got offfrom Bermuda Hundred, and then did not dream but that General Weitzelhad received all the instructions, and would be in command.  I ratherformed the idea that General Butler was actuated by a desire to witnessthe effect of the explosion of the powder-boat.  The expedition wasdetained several days at Hampton Roads, awaiting the loading of thepowder-boat.The importance of getting the Wilmington expedition off without anydelay, with or without the powder-boat, had been urged upon GeneralButler, and he advised to so notify Admiral Porter.The expedition finally got off on the 13th of December, and arrived atthe place of rendezvous, off New Inlet, near Fort Fisher, on the eveningof the 15th.  Admiral Porter arrived on the evening of the 18th, havingput in at Beaufort to get ammunition for the monitors.  The sea becomingrough, making it difficult to land troops, and the supply of water andcoal being about exhausted, the transport fleet put back to Beaufort toreplenish; this, with the state of the weather, delayed the return tothe place of rendezvous until the 24th.  The powder-boat was exploded onthe morning of the 24th, before the return of General Butler fromBeaufort; but it would seem, from the notice taken of it in the Southernnewspapers, that the enemy were never enlightened as to the object ofthe explosion until they were informed by the Northern press.On the 25th a landing was effected without opposition, and areconnoissance, under Brevet Brigadier-General Curtis, pushed up towardsthe fort.  But before receiving a full report of the result of thisreconnoissance, General Butler, in direct violation of the instructionsgiven, ordered the re-embarkation of the troops and the return of theexpedition.  The re-embarkation was accomplished by the morning of the27th.On the return of the expedition officers and men among them BrevetMajor-General (then Brevet Brigadier-General) N. M. Curtis,First-Lieutenant G. W. Ross, 117th Regiment New York Volunteers,First-Lieutenant William H. Walling, and Second-Lieutenant GeorgeSimpson, 142d New York Volunteers voluntarily reported to me that whenrecalled they were nearly into the fort, and, in their opinion, it couldhave been taken without much loss.Soon after the return of the expedition, I received a dispatch from theSecretary of the Navy, and a letter from Admiral Porter, informing methat the fleet was still off Fort Fisher, and expressing the convictionthat, under a proper leader, the place could be taken.  The naturalsupposition with me was, that when the troops abandoned the expedition,the navy would do so also.  Finding it had not, however, I answered onthe 30th of December, advising Admiral Porter to hold on, and that Iwould send a force and make another attempt to take the place.  Thistime I selected Brevet Major-General (now Major-General) A. H. Terry tocommand the expedition.  The troops composing it consisted of the samethat composed the former, with the addition of a small brigade,numbering about one thousand five hundred, and a small siege train.  Thelatter it was never found necessary to land.  I communicated direct tothe commander of the expedition the following instructions:"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, January 3, 1865."GENERAL:  The expedition intrusted to your command has been fitted outto renew the attempt to capture Fort Fisher, N. C., and Wilmingtonultimately, if the fort falls.  You will then proceed with as littledelay as possible to the naval fleet lying off Cape Fear River, andreport the arrival of yourself and command to Admiral D. D. Porter,commanding North Atlantic Blockading Squadron."It is exceedingly desirable that the most complete understanding shouldexist between yourself and the naval commander.  I suggest, therefore,that you consult with Admiral Porter freely, and get from him the partto be performed by each branch of the public service, so that there maybe unity of action.  It would be well to have the whole programme laiddown in writing.  I have served with Admiral Porter, and know that youcan rely on his judgment and his nerve to undertake what he proposes.  Iwould, therefore, defer to him as much as is consistent with your ownresponsibilities.  The first object to be attained is to get a firmposition on the spit of land on which Fort Fisher is built, from whichyou can operate against that fort.  You want to look to thepracticability of receiving your supplies, and to defending yourselfagainst superior forces sent against you by any of the avenues left opento the enemy. If such a position can be obtained, the siege of FortFisher will not be abandoned until its reduction is accomplished, oranother plan of campaign is ordered from these headquarters."My own views are, that if you effect a landing, the navy ought to run aportion of their fleet into Cape Fear River, while the balance of itoperates on the outside.  Land forces cannot invest Fort Fisher, or cutit off from supplies or reinforcements, while the river is in possessionof the enemy."A siege-train will be loaded on vessels and sent to Fort Monroe, inreadiness to be sent to you if required.  All other supplies can bedrawn from Beaufort as you need them."Keep the fleet of vessels with you until your position is assured.When you find they can be spared, order them back, or such of them asyou can spare, to Fort Monroe, to report for orders."In case of failure to effect a landing, bring your command back toBeaufort, and report to these headquarters for further instructions.You will not debark at Beaufort until so directed."General Sheridan has been ordered to send a division of troops toBaltimore and place them on sea-going vessels.  These troops will bebrought to Fort Monroe and kept there on the vessels until you are heardfrom.  Should you require them, they will be sent to you."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."BREVET MAJOR-GENERAL A. H. TERRY."Lieutenant-Colonel C. B. Comstock, aide-de-camp (now brevetbrigadier-general), who accompanied the former expedition,was assigned, in orders, as chief-engineer to this.It will be seen that these instructions did not differ materially fromthose given for the first expedition, and that in neither instance wasthere an order to assault Fort Fisher. This was a matter left entirelyto the discretion of the commanding officer.The expedition sailed from Fort Monroe on the morning of the 6th,arriving at the rendezvous, off Beaufort, on the 8th, where, owing tothe difficulties of the weather, it lay until the morning of the 12th,when it got under way and reached its destination that evening.  Undercover of the fleet, the disembarkation of the troops commenced on themorning of the 13th, and by three o'clock P.M. was completed withoutloss.  On the 14th a reconnoissance was pushed to within five hundredyards of Fort Fisher, and a small advance work taken possession of andturned into a defensive line against any attempt that might be made fromthe fort.  This reconnoissance disclosed the fact that the front of thework had been seriously injured by the navy fire.  In the afternoon ofthe 15th the fort was assaulted, and after most desperate fighting wascaptured, with its entire garrison and armament.  Thus was secured, bythe combined efforts of the navy and army, one of the most importantsuccesses of the war.  Our loss was:  killed, one hundred and ten;wounded, five hundred and thirty-six.  On the 16th and the 17th theenemy abandoned and blew up Fort Caswell and the works on Smith'sIsland, which were immediately occupied by us.  This gave us entirecontrol of the mouth of the Cape Fear River.At my request, Mayor-General B. F. Butler was relieved, andMajor-General E. O. C. Ord assigned to the Department of Virginia andNorth Carolina.The defence of the line of the Tennessee no longer requiring the forcewhich had beaten and nearly destroyed the only army now threatening it,I determined to find other fields of operation for General Thomas'ssurplus troops--fields from which they would co-operate with othermovements.  General Thomas was therefore directed to collect all troops,not essential to hold his communications at Eastport, in readiness fororders.  On the 7th of January, General Thomas was directed, if he wasassured of the departure of Hood south from Corinth, to send GeneralSchofield with his corps east with as little delay as possible.  Thisdirection was promptly complied with, and the advance of the corpsreached Washington on the 23d of the same month, whence it was sent toFort Fisher and New Bern.  On the 26th he was directed to send GeneralA. J. Smith's command and a division of cavalry to report to GeneralCanby.  By the 7th of February the whole force was en route for itsdestination.The State of North Carolina was constituted into a military department,and General Schofield assigned to command, and placed under the ordersof Major-General Sherman.  The following instructions were given him:"CITY POINT, VA., January 31, 1865."GENERAL:-- *    *    *    Your movements are intended as co-operativewith Sherman's through the States of South and North Carolina.  Thefirst point to be attained is to secure Wilmington.  Goldsboro' willthen be your objective point, moving either from Wilmington or New Bern,or both, as you deem best.  Should you not be able to reach Goldsboro',you will advance on the line or lines of railway connecting that placewith the sea-coast--as near to it as you can, building the road behindyou.  The enterprise under you has two objects:  the first is to giveGeneral Sherman material aid, if needed, in his march north; the second,to open a base of supplies for him on his line of march.  As soon,therefore, as you can determine which of the two points, Wilmington orNew Bern, you can best use for throwing supplies from, to the interior,you will commence the accumulation of twenty days' rations and foragefor sixty thousand men and twenty thousand animals.  You will get ofthese as many as you can house and protect to such point in the interioras you may be able to occupy.  I believe General Palmer has receivedsome instructions direct from General Sherman on the subject of securingsupplies for his army.  You will learn what steps he has taken, and begoverned in your requisitions accordingly.  A supply of ordnance storeswill also be necessary."Make all requisitions upon the chiefs of their respective departmentsin the field with me at City Point.  Communicate with me by everyopportunity, and should you deem it necessary at any time, send aspecial boat to Fortress Monroe, from which point you can communicate bytelegraph."The supplies referred to in these instructions are exclusive of thoserequired for your own command."The movements of the enemy may justify, or even make it your imperativeduty, to cut loose from your base, and strike for the interior to aidSherman.  In such case you will act on your own judgment without waitingfor instructions.  You will report, however, what you purpose doing.The details for carrying out these instructions are necessarily left toyou.  I would urge, however, if I did not know that you are alreadyfully alive to the importance of it, prompt action.  Sherman may belooked for in the neighborhood of Goldsboro' any time from the 22d tothe 28th of February; this limits your time very materially."If rolling-stock is not secured in the capture of Wilmington, it can besupplied from Washington.  A large force of railroad men have alreadybeen sent to Beaufort, and other mechanics will go to Fort Fisher in aday or two.  On this point I have informed you by telegraph."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD."Previous to giving these instructions I had visited Fort Fisher,accompanied by General Schofield, for the purpose of seeing for myselfthe condition of things, and personally conferring with General Terryand Admiral Porter as to what was best to be done.Anticipating the arrival of General Sherman at Savannah his armyentirely foot-loose, Hood being then before Nashville, Tennessee, theSouthern railroads destroyed, so that it would take several months tore-establish a through line from west to east, and regarding the captureof Lee's army as the most important operation towards closing therebellion--I sent orders to General Sherman on the 6th of December, thatafter establishing a base on the sea-coast, with necessary garrison, toinclude all his artillery and cavalry, to come by water to City Pointwith the balance of his command.On the 18th of December, having received information of the defeat andutter rout of Hood's army by General Thomas, and that, owing to thegreat difficulty of procuring ocean transportation, it would take overtwo months to transport Sherman's army, and doubting whether he mightnot contribute as much towards the desired result by operating fromwhere he was, I wrote to him to that effect, and asked him for his viewsas to what would be best to do.  A few days after this I received acommunication from General Sherman, of date 16th December, acknowledgingthe receipt of my order of the 6th, and informing me of his preparationsto carry it into effect as soon as he could get transportation.  Alsothat he had expected, upon reducing Savannah, instantly to march toColumbia, South Carolina, thence to Raleigh, and thence to report to me;but that this would consume about six weeks' time after the fall ofSavannah, whereas by sea he could probably reach me by the middle ofJanuary.  The confidence he manifested in this letter of being able tomarch up and join me pleased me, and, without waiting for a reply to myletter of the 18th, I directed him, on the 28th of December, to makepreparations to start as he proposed, without delay, to break up therailroads in North and South Carolina, and join the armies operatingagainst Richmond as soon as he could.On the 21st of January I informed General Sherman that I had ordered the23d corps,  Major-General Schofield commanding, east; that it numberedabout twenty-one thousand men; that we had at Fort Fisher, about eightthousand men; at New Bern, about four thousand; that if Wilmington wascaptured, General Schofield would go there; if not, he would be sent toNew Bern; that, in either event, all the surplus force at both pointswould move to the interior towards Goldsboro', in co-operation with hismovement; that from either point railroad communication could be runout; and that all these troops would be subject to his orders as he cameinto communication with them.In obedience to his instructions, General Schofield proceeded to reduceWilmington, North Carolina, in co-operation with the navy under AdmiralPorter, moving his forces up both sides of the Cape Fear River.  FortAnderson, the enemy's main defence on the west bank of the river, wasoccupied on the morning of the 19th, the enemy having evacuated it afterour appearance before it.After fighting on 20th and 21st, our troops entered Wilmington on themorning of the 22d, the enemy having retreated towards Goldsboro' duringthe night.  Preparations were at once made for a movement on Goldsboro'in two columns--one from Wilmington, and the other from New Bern--and torepair the railroad leading there from each place, as well as to supplyGeneral Sherman by Cape Fear River, towards Fayetteville, if it becamenecessary.  The column from New Bern was attacked on the 8th of March,at Wise's Forks, and driven back with the loss of several hundredprisoners.  On the 11th the enemy renewed his attack upon our intrenchedposition, but was repulsed with severe loss, and fell back during thenight.  On the 14th the Neuse River was crossed and Kinston occupied,and on the 21st Goldsboro' was entered. The column from Wilmingtonreached Cox's Bridge, on the Neuse River, ten miles above Goldsboro', onthe 22d.By the 1st of February, General Sherman's whole army was in motion fromSavannah.  He captured Columbia, South Carolina, on the 17th; thencemoved on Goldsboro', North Carolina, via Fayetteville, reaching thelatter place on the 12th of March, opening up communication with GeneralSchofield by way of Cape Fear River.  On the 15th he resumed his marchon Goldsboro'.  He met a force of the enemy at Averysboro', and after asevere fight defeated and compelled it to retreat.  Our loss in thisengagement was about six hundred.  The enemy's loss was much greater.On the 18th the combined forces of the enemy, under Joe Johnston,attacked his advance at Bentonville, capturing three guns and driving itback upon the main body.  General Slocum, who was in the advanceascertaining that the whole of Johnston's army was in the front,arranged his troops on the defensive, intrenched himself and awaitedreinforcements, which were pushed forward.  On the night of the 21st theenemy retreated to Smithfield, leaving his dead and wounded in ourhands.  From there Sherman continued to Goldsboro', which place had beenoccupied by General Schofield on the 21st (crossing the Neuse River tenmiles above there, at Cox's Bridge, where General Terry had gotpossession and thrown a pontoon-bridge on the 22d), thus forming ajunction with the columns from New Bern and Wilmington.Among the important fruits of this campaign was the fall of Charleston,South Carolina. It was evacuated by the enemy on the night of the 17thof February, and occupied by our forces on the 18th.On the morning of the 31st of January, General Thomas was directed tosend a cavalry expedition, under General Stoneman, from East Tennessee,to penetrate South Carolina well down towards Columbia, to destroy therailroads and military resources of the country, and return, if he wasable, to East Tennessee by way of Salisbury, North Carolina, releasingour prisoners there, if possible.  Of the feasibility of this latter,however, General Stoneman was to judge.  Sherman's movements, I had nodoubt, would attract the attention of all the force the enemy couldcollect, and facilitate the execution of this.  General Stoneman was solate in making his start on this expedition (and Sherman having passedout of the State of South Carolina), on the 27th of February I directedGeneral Thomas to change his course, and order him to repeat his raid oflast fall, destroying the railroad towards Lynchburg as far as he could.This would keep him between our garrisons in East Tennessee and theenemy.  I regarded it not impossible that in the event of the enemybeing driven from Richmond, he might fall back to Lynchburg and attempta raid north through East Tennessee.  On the 14th of February thefollowing communication was sent to General Thomas:"CITY POINT, VA., February 14, 1865."General Canby is preparing a movement from Mobile Bay against Mobileand the interior of Alabama. His force will consist of about twentythousand men, besides A. J. Smith's command.  The cavalry you have sentto Canby will be debarked at Vicksburg. It, with the available cavalryalready in that section, will move from there eastward, in co-operation.Hood's army has been terribly reduced by the severe punishment you gaveit in Tennessee, by desertion consequent upon their defeat, and now bythe withdrawal of many of them to oppose Sherman.  (I take it a largeportion of the infantry has been so withdrawn.  It is so asserted in theRichmond papers, and a member of the rebel Congress said a few dayssince in a speech, that one-half of it had been brought to SouthCarolina to oppose Sherman.)  This being true, or even if it is nottrue, Canby's movement will attract all the attention of the enemy, andleave the advance from your standpoint easy.  I think it advisable,therefore, that you prepare as much of a cavalry force as you can spare,and hold it in readiness to go south.  The object would be threefold:first, to attract as much of the enemy's force as possible, to insuresuccess to Canby; second, to destroy the enemy's line of communicationsand military resources; third, to destroy or capture their forcesbrought into the field. Tuscaloosa and Selma would probably be thepoints to direct the expedition against.  This, however, would not be soimportant as the mere fact of penetrating deep into Alabama.  Discretionshould be left to the officer commanding the expedition to go where,according to the information he may receive, he will best secure theobjects named above."Now that your force has been so much depleted, I do not know whatnumber of men you can put into the field.  If not more than fivethousand men, however, all cavalry, I think it will be sufficient.  Itis not desirable that you should start this expedition until the oneleaving Vicksburg has been three or four days out, or even a week.  I donot know when it will start, but will inform you by telegraph as soon asI learn.  If you should hear through other sources before hearing fromme, you can act on the information received."To insure success your cavalry should go with as little wagon-train aspossible, relying upon the country for supplies.  I would also reducethe number of guns to a battery, or the number of batteries, and put theextra teams to the guns taken.  No guns or caissons should be taken withless than eight horses."Please inform me by telegraph, on receipt of this, what force you thinkyou will be able to send under these directions."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL G. H. THOMAS."On the 15th, he was directed to start the expedition as soon after the20th as he could get it off.I deemed it of the utmost importance, before a general movement of thearmies operating against Richmond, that all communications with thecity, north of James River, should be cut off.  The enemy havingwithdrawn the bulk of his force from the Shenandoah Valley and sent itsouth, or replaced troops sent from Richmond, and desiring to reinforceSherman, if practicable, whose cavalry was greatly inferior in numbersto that of the enemy, I determined to make a move from the Shenandoah,which, if successful, would accomplish the first at least, and possiblythe latter of the objects.  I therefore telegraphed General Sheridan asfollows:"CITY POINT, VA., February 20, 1865--1 P.M."GENERAL:--As soon as it is possible to travel, I think you will have nodifficulty about reaching Lynchburg with a cavalry force alone.  Fromthere you could destroy the railroad and canal in every direction, so asto be of no further use to the rebellion.  Sufficient cavalry should beleft behind to look after Mosby's gang.  From Lynchburg, if informationyou might get there would justify it, you will strike south, heading thestreams in Virgina to the westward of Danville, and push on and joinGeneral Sherman.  This additional raid, with one now about starting fromEast Tennessee under Stoneman, numbering four or give thousand cavalry,one from Vicksburg, numbering seven or eight thousand cavalry, one fromEastport, Mississippi, then thousand cavalry, Canby from Mobile Bay,with about thirty-eight thousand mixed troops, these three latterpushing for Tuscaloosa, Selma, and Montgomery, and Sherman with a largearmy eating out the vitals of South Carolina, is all that will be wantedto leave nothing for the rebellion to stand upon.  I would advise you toovercome great obstacles to accomplish this.  Charleston was evacuatedon Tuesday 1st."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN."On the 25th I received a dispatch from General Sheridan, inquiring whereSherman was aiming for, and if I could give him definite information asto the points he might be expected to move on, this side of Charlotte,North Carolina.  In answer, the following telegram was sent him:"CITY POINT, VA., February 25, 1865."GENERAL:--Sherman's movements will depend on the amount of oppositionhe meets with from the enemy.  If strongly opposed, he may possibly haveto fall back to Georgetown, S. C., and fit out for a new start.  Ithink, however, all danger for the necessity of going to that point haspassed.  I believe he has passed Charlotte.  He may take Fayetteville onhis way to Goldsboro'.  If you reach Lynchburg, you will have to beguided in your after movements by the information you obtain.  Beforeyou could possibly reach Sherman, I think you would find him moving fromGoldsboro' towards Raleigh, or engaging the enemy strongly posted at oneor the other of these places, with railroad communications opened fromhis army to Wilmington or New Bern."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN."General Sheridan moved from Winchester on the 27th of February, with twodivisions of cavalry, numbering about five thousand each.  On the 1st ofMarch he secured the bridge, which the enemy attempted to destroy,across the middle fork of the Shenandoah, at Mount Crawford, and enteredStaunton on the 2d, the enemy having retreated to Waynesboro'.  Thencehe pushed on to Waynesboro', where he found the enemy in force in anintrenched position, under General Early.  Without stopping to make areconnoissance, an immediate attack was made, the position was carried,and sixteen hundred prisoners, eleven pieces of artillery, with horsesand caissons complete, two hundred wagons and teams loaded withsubsistence, and seventeen battle-flags, were captured.  The prisoners,under an escort of fifteen hundred men, were sent back to Winchester.Thence he marched on Charlottesville, destroying effectually therailroad and bridges as he went, which place he reached on the 3d.  Herehe remained two days, destroying the railroad towards Richmond andLynchburg, including the large iron bridges over the north and southforks of the Rivanna River and awaited the arrival of his trains.  Thisnecessary delay caused him to abandon the idea of capturing Lynchburg.On the morning of the 6th, dividing his force into two columns, he sentone to Scottsville, whence it marched up the James River Canal to NewMarket, destroying every lock, and in many places the bank of the canal.From here a force was pushed out from this column to Duiguidsville, toobtain possession of the bridge across the James River at that place,but failed.  The enemy burned it on our approach.  The enemy also burnedthe bridge across the river at Hardwicksville.  The other column moveddown the railroad towards Lynchburg, destroying it as far as AmherstCourt House, sixteen miles from Lynchburg; thence across the country,uniting with the column at New Market.  The river being very high, hispontoons would not reach across it; and the enemy having destroyed thebridges by which he had hoped to cross the river and get on the SouthSide Railroad about Farmville, and destroy it to Appomattox Court House,the only thing left for him was to return to Winchester or strike a baseat the White House. Fortunately, he chose the latter.  From New Markethe took up his line of march, following the canal towards Richmond,destroying every lock upon it and cutting the banks whereverpracticable, to a point eight miles east of Goochland, concentrating thewhole force at Columbia on the 10th.  Here he rested one day, and sentthrough by scouts information of his whereabouts and purposes, and arequest for supplies to meet him at White House, which reached me on thenight of the 12th.  An infantry force was immediately sent to getpossession of White House, and supplies were forwarded.  Moving fromColumbia in a direction to threaten Richmond, to near Ashland Station,he crossed the Annas, and after having destroyed all the bridges andmany miles of the railroad, proceeded down the north bank of thePamunkey to White House, which place he reached on the 19th.Previous to this the following communication was sent to General Thomas:"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 7, 1865--9.30 A.M."GENERAL:--I think it will be advisable now for you to repair therailroad in East Tennessee, and throw a good force up to Bull's Gap andfortify there.  Supplies at Knoxville could always be got forward asrequired.  With Bull's Gap fortified, you can occupy as outposts aboutall of East Tennessee, and be prepared, if it should be required of youin the spring, to make a campaign towards Lynchburg, or into NorthCarolina.  I do not think Stoneman should break the road until he getsinto Virginia, unless it should be to cut off rolling-stock that may becaught west of that."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL G. H. THOMAS."Thus it will be seen that in March, 1865, General Canby was moving anadequate force against Mobile and the army defending it under GeneralDick Taylor; Thomas was pushing out two large and well-appointed cavalryexpeditions--one from Middle Tennessee under Brevet Major-General Wilsonagainst the enemy's vital points in Alabama, the other from EastTennessee, under Major-General Stoneman, towards Lynchburg--andassembling the remainder of his available forces, preparatory tocommence offensive operations from East Tennessee; General Sheridan'scavalry was at White House; the armies of the Potomac and James wereconfronting the enemy, under Lee, in his defences of Richmond andPetersburg; General Sherman with his armies, reinforced by that ofGeneral Schofield, was at Goldsboro'; General Pope was makingpreparations for a spring campaign against the enemy under Kirby Smithand Price, west of the Mississippi; and General Hancock wasconcentrating a force in the vicinity of Winchester, Virginia, to guardagainst invasion or to operate offensively, as might prove necessary.After the long march by General Sheridan's cavalry over winter roads, itwas necessary to rest and refit at White House.  At this time thegreatest source of uneasiness to me was the fear that the enemy wouldleave his strong lines about Petersburg and Richmond for the purpose ofuniting with Johnston, and before he was driven from them by battle, orI was prepared to make an effectual pursuit.  On the 24th of March,General Sheridan moved from White House, crossed the James River atJones's Landing, and formed a junction with the Army of the Potomac infront of Petersburg on the 27th.  During this move, General Ord sentforces to cover the crossings of the Chickahominy.On the 24th of March the following instructions for a general movementof the armies operating against Richmond were issued:"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 24, 1865."GENERAL:  On the 29th instant the armies operating against Richmondwill be moved by our left, for the double purpose of turning the enemyout of his present position around Petersburg, and to insure the successof the cavalry under General Sheridan, which will start at the sametime, in its efforts to reach and destroy the South Side and Danvillerailroads.  Two corps of the Army of the Potomac will be moved at firstin two columns, taking the two roads crossing Hatcher's Run, nearestwhere the present line held by us strikes that stream, both movingtowards Dinwiddie Court House."The cavalry under General Sheridan, joined by the division now underGeneral Davies, will move at the same time by the Weldon Road and theJerusalem Plank Road, turning west from the latter before crossing theNottoway, and west with the whole column before reaching Stony Creek.General Sheridan will then move independently, under other instructionswhich will be given him.  All dismounted cavalry belonging to the Armyof the Potomac, and the dismounted cavalry from the Middle MilitaryDivision not required for guarding property belonging to their arm ofservice, will report to Brigadier-General Benham, to be added to thedefences of City Point.  Major-General Parke will be left in command ofall the army left for holding the lines about Petersburg and City Point,subject of course to orders from the commander of the Army of thePotomac.  The 9th army corps will be left intact, to hold the presentline of works so long as the whole line now occupied by us is held.  If,however, the troops to the left of the 9th corps are withdrawn, then theleft of the corps may be thrown back so as to occupy the position heldby the army prior to the capture of the Weldon Road.  All troops to theleft of the 9th corps will be held in readiness to move at the shortestnotice by such route as may be designated when the order is given."General Ord will detach three divisions, two white and one colored, orso much of them as he can, and hold his present lines, and march for thepresent left of the Army of the Potomac.  In the absence of furtherorders, or until further orders are given, the white divisions willfollow the left column of the Army of the Potomac, and the coloreddivision the right column.  During the movement Major-General Weitzelwill be left in command of all the forces remaining behind from the Armyof the James."The movement of troops from the Army of the James will commence on thenight of the 27th instant.  General Ord will leave behind the minimumnumber of cavalry necessary for picket duty, in the absence of the mainarmy.  A cavalry expedition, from General Ord's command, will also bestarted from Suffolk, to leave there on Saturday, the 1st of April,under Colonel Sumner, for the purpose of cutting the railroad aboutHicksford.  This, if accomplished, will have to be a surprise, andtherefore from three to five hundred men will be sufficient.  Theyshould, however, be supported by all the infantry that can be sparedfrom Norfolk and Portsmouth, as far out as to where the cavalry crossesthe Blackwater.  The crossing should probably be at Uniten.  ShouldColonel Sumner succeed in reaching the Weldon Road, he will beinstructed to do all the damage possible to the triangle of roadsbetween Hicksford, Weldon, and Gaston.  The railroad bridge at Weldonbeing fitted up for the passage of carriages, it might be practicable todestroy any accumulation of supplies the enemy may have collected southof the Roanoke. All the troops will move with four days' rations inhaversacks and eight days' in wagons.  To avoid as much hauling aspossible, and to give the Army of the James the same number of days'supplies with the Army of the Potomac, General Ord will direct hiscommissary and quartermaster to have sufficient supplies delivered atthe terminus of the road to fill up in passing.  Sixty rounds ofammunition per man will be taken in wagons, and as much grain as thetransportation on hand will carry, after taking the specified amount ofother supplies.  The densely wooded country in which the army has tooperate making the use of much artillery impracticable, the amount takenwith the army will be reduced to six or eight guns to each division, atthe option of the army commanders."All necessary preparations for carrying these directions into operationmay be commenced at once.  The reserves of the 9th corps should bemassed as much as possible.  While I would not now order anunconditional attack on the enemy's line by them, they should be readyand should make the attack if the enemy weakens his line in their front,without waiting for orders.  In case they carry the line, then the wholeof the 9th corps could follow up so as to join or co-operate with thebalance of the army.  To prepare for this, the 9th corps will haverations issued to them, same as the balance of the army.  GeneralWeitzel will keep vigilant watch upon his front, and if found at allpracticable to break through at any point, he will do so.  A successnorth of the James should be followed up with great promptness.  Anattack will not be feasible unless it is found that the enemy hasdetached largely.  In that case it may be regarded as evident that theenemy are relying upon their local reserves principally for the defenceof Richmond.  Preparations may be made for abandoning all the line northof the James, except inclosed works only to be abandoned, however, aftera break is made in the lines of the enemy."By these instructions a large part of the armies operating againstRichmond is left behind.  The enemy, knowing this, may, as an onlychance, strip their lines to the merest skeleton, in the hope ofadvantage not being taken of it, while they hurl everything against themoving column, and return.  It cannot be impressed too strongly uponcommanders of troops left in the trenches not to allow this to occurwithout taking advantage of it.  The very fact of the enemy coming outto attack, if he does so, might be regarded as almost conclusiveevidence of such a weakening of his lines.  I would have it particularlyenjoined upon corps commanders that, in case of an attack from theenemy, those not attacked are not to wait for orders from the commandingofficer of the army to which they belong, but that they will movepromptly, and notify the commander of their action.  I would also enjointhe same action on the part of division commanders when other parts oftheir corps are engaged.  In like manner, I would urge the importance offollowing up a repulse of the enemy."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERALS MEADE, ORD, AND SHERIDAN."Early on the morning of the 25th the enemy assaulted our lines in frontof the 9th corps (which held from the Appomattox River towards ourleft), and carried Fort Stedman, and a part of the line to the right andleft of it, established themselves and turned the guns of the fortagainst us, but our troops on either flank held their ground until thereserves were brought up, when the enemy was driven back with a heavyloss in killed and wounded, and one thousand nine hundred prisoners.Our loss was sixty-eight killed, three hundred and thirty-seven wounded,and five hundred and six missing.  General Meade at once ordered theother corps to advance and feel the enemy in their respective fronts.Pushing forward, they captured and held the enemy's strongly intrenchedpicket-line in front of the 2d and 6th corps, and eight hundred andthirty-four prisoners.  The enemy made desperate attempts to retake thisline, but without success.  Our loss in front of these was fifty-twokilled, eight hundred and sixty-four wounded, and two hundred and sevenmissing.  The enemy's loss in killed and wounded was far greater.General Sherman having got his troops all quietly in camp aboutGoldsboro', and his preparations for furnishing supplies to themperfected, visited me at City Point on the 27th of March, and statedthat he would be ready to move, as he had previously written me, by the10th of April, fully equipped and rationed for twenty days, if it shouldbecome necessary to bring his command to bear against Lee's army, inco-operation with our forces in front of Richmond and Petersburg.General Sherman proposed in this movement to threaten Raleigh, and then,by turning suddenly to the right, reach the Roanoke at Gaston orthereabouts, whence he could move on to the Richmond and DanvilleRailroad, striking it in the vicinity of Burkesville, or join the armiesoperating against Richmond, as might be deemed best.  This plan he wasdirected to carry into execution, if he received no further directionsin the meantime.  I explained to him the movement I had ordered tocommence on the 29th of March.  That if it should not prove as entirelysuccessful as I hoped, I would cut the cavalry loose to destroy theDanville and South Side railroads, and thus deprive the enemy of furthersupplies, and also to prevent the rapid concentration of Lee's andJohnston's armies.I had spent days of anxiety lest each morning should bring the reportthat the enemy had retreated the night before.  I was firmly convincedthat Sherman's crossing the Roanoke would be the signal for Lee toleave.  With Johnston and him combined, a long, tedious, and expensivecampaign, consuming most of the summer, might become necessary.  Bymoving out I would put the army in better condition for pursuit, andwould at least, by the destruction of the Danville Road, retard theconcentration of the two armies of Lee and Johnston, and cause the enemyto abandon much material that he might otherwise save.  I thereforedetermined not to delay the movement ordered.On the night of the 27th, Major-General Ord, with two divisions of the24th corps, Major-General Gibbon commanding, and one division of the25th corps, Brigadier-General Birney commanding, and MacKenzie'scavalry, took up his line of march in pursuance of the foregoinginstructions, and reached the position assigned him near Hatcher's Runon the morning of the 29th.  On the 28th the following instructions weregiven to General Sheridan:"CITY POINT, VA., March 28, 1865."GENERAL:--The 5th army corps will move by the Vaughn Road at three A.M.to-morrow morning.  The 2d moves at about nine A.M., having but aboutthree miles to march to reach the point designated for it to take on theright of the 5th corps, after the latter reaching Dinwiddie Court House.Move your cavalry at as early an hour as you can, and without beingconfined to any particular road or roads.  You may go out by the nearestroads in rear of the 5th corps, pass by its left, and passing near to orthrough Dinwiddie, reach the right and rear of the enemy as soon as youcan.  It is not the intention to attack the enemy in his intrenchedposition, but to force him out, if possible. Should he come out andattack us, or get himself where he can be attacked, move in with yourentire force in your own way, and with the full reliance that the armywill engage or follow, as circumstances will dictate.  I shall be on thefield, and will probably be able to communicate with you.  Should I notdo so, and you find that the enemy keeps within his main intrenchedline, you may cut loose and push for the Danville Road.  If you find itpracticable, I would like you to cross the South Side Road, betweenPetersburg and Burkesville, and destroy it to some extent.  I would notadvise much detention, however, until you reach the Danville Road, whichI would like you to strike as near to the Appomattox as possible.  Makeyour destruction on that road as complete as possible.  You can thenpass on to the South Side Road, west of Burkesville, and destroy that inlike manner."After having accomplished the destruction of the two railroads, whichare now the only avenues of supply to Lee's army, you may return to thisarmy, selecting your road further south, or you may go on into NorthCarolina and join General Sherman.  Should you select the latter course,get the information to me as early as possible, so that I may sendorders to meet you at Goldsboro'."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN."On the morning of the 29th the movement commenced.  At night the cavalrywas at Dinwiddie Court House, and the left of our infantry line extendedto the Quaker Road, near its intersection with the Boydton Plank Road.The position of the troops from left to right was as follows:  Sheridan,Warren, Humphreys, Ord, Wright, Parke.Everything looked favorable to the defeat of the enemy and the captureof Petersburg and Richmond, if the proper effort was made.  I thereforeaddressed the following communication to General Sheridan, havingpreviously informed him verbally not to cut loose for the raidcontemplated in his orders until he received notice from me to do so:"GRAVELLY CREEK, March 29, 1865."GENERAL:--Our line is now unbroken from the Appomattox to Dinwiddie.We are all ready, however, to give up all, from the Jerusalem Plank Roadto Hatcher's Run, whenever the forces can be used advantageously.  Aftergetting into line south of Hatcher's, we pushed forward to find theenemy's position. General Griffin was attacked near where the QuakerRoad intersects the Boydton Road, but repulsed it easily, capturingabout one hundred men.  Humphreys reached Dabney's Mill, and was pushingon when last heard from."I now feel like ending the matter, if it is possible to do so, beforegoing back.  I do not want you, therefore, to cut loose and go after theenemy's roads at present.  In the morning push around the enemy, if youcan, and get on to his right rear.  The movements of the enemy's cavalrymay, of course, modify your action.  We will act all together as onearmy here, until it is seen what can be done with the enemy.  Thesignal-officer at Cobb's Hill reported, at half-past eleven A.M., that acavalry column had passed that point from Richmond towards Petersburg,taking forty minutes to pass."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN."From the night of the 29th to the morning of the 31st the rain fell insuch torrents as to make it impossible to move a wheeled vehicle, exceptas corduroy roads were laid in front of them. During the 30th, Sheridanadvanced from Dinwiddie Court House towards Five Forks, where he foundthe enemy in full force. General Warren advanced and extended his lineacross the Boydton Plank Road to near the White Oak Road, with a view ofgetting across the latter; but, finding the enemy strong in his frontand extending beyond his left, was directed to hold on where he was, andfortify.  General Humphreys drove the enemy from his front into his mainline on the Hatcher, near Burgess's Mills. Generals Ord, Wright, andParke made examinations in their fronts to determine the feasibility ofan assault on the enemy's lines.  The two latter reported favorably.The enemy confronting us as he did, at every point from Richmond to ourextreme left, I conceived his lines must be weakly held, and could bepenetrated if my estimate of his forces was correct.  I determined,therefore, to extend our line no farther, but to reinforce GeneralSheridan with a corps of infantry, and thus enable him to cut loose andturn the enemy's right flank, and with the other corps assault theenemy's lines.  The result of the offensive effort of the enemy the weekbefore, when he assaulted Fort Stedman, particularly favored this.  Theenemy's intrenched  picket-line captured by us at that time threw thelines occupied by the belligerents so close together at some points thatit was but a moment's run from one to the other. Preparations were atonce made to relieve General Humphreys's corps, to report to GeneralSheridan; but the condition of the roads prevented immediate movement.On the morning of the 31st, General Warren reported favorably to gettingpossession of the White Oak Road, and was directed to do so.  Toaccomplish this, he moved with one division, instead of his whole corps,which was attacked by the enemy in superior force and driven back on the2d division before it had time to form, and it, in turn, forced backupon the 3d division, when the enemy was checked.  A division of the 2dcorps was immediately sent to his support, the enemy driven back withheavy loss, and possession of the White Oak Road gained.  Sheridanadvanced, and with a portion of his cavalry got possession of the FiveForks; but the enemy, after the affair with the 5th corps, reinforcedthe rebel cavalry, defending that point with infantry, and forced himback towards Dinwiddie Court House.  Here General Sheridan displayedgreat generalship.  Instead of retreating with his whole command on themain army, to tell the story of superior forces encountered, he deployedhis cavalry on foot, leaving only mounted men enough to take charge ofthe horses.  This compelled the enemy to deploy over a vast extent ofwooded and broken country, and made his progress slow.  At this juncturehe dispatched to me what had taken place, and that he was dropping backslowly on Dinwiddie Court House.  General Mackenzie's cavalry and onedivision of the 5th corps were immediately ordered to his assistance.Soon after receiving a report from General Meade that Humphreys couldhold our position on the Boydton Road, and that the other two divisionsof the 5th corps could go to Sheridan, they were so ordered at once.Thus the operations of the day necessitated the sending of Warren,because of his accessibility, instead of Humphreys, as was intended, andprecipitated intended movements.  On the morning of the 1st of April,General Sheridan, reinforced by General Warren, drove the enemy back onFive Forks, where, late in the evening, he assaulted and carried hisstrongly fortified position, capturing all his artillery and betweenfive and six thousand prisoners.About the close of this battle, Brevet Major-General Charles Griffinrelieved Major-General Warren in command of the 5th corps.  The reportof this reached me after nightfall.  Some apprehensions filled my mindlest the enemy might desert his lines during the night, and by fallingupon General Sheridan before assistance could reach him, drive him fromhis position and open the way for retreat.  To guard against this,General Miles's division of Humphreys's corps was sent to reinforce him,and a bombardment was commenced and kept up until four o'clock in themorning (April 2), when an assault was ordered on the enemy's lines.General Wright penetrated the lines with his whole corps, sweepingeverything before him, and to his left towards Hatcher's Run, capturingmany guns and several thousand prisoners.  He was closely followed bytwo divisions of General Ord's command, until he met the other divisionof General Ord's that had succeeded in forcing the enemy's lines nearHatcher's Run. Generals Wright and Ord immediately swung to the right,and closed all of the enemy on that side of them in Petersburg, whileGeneral Humphreys pushed forward with two divisions and joined GeneralWright on the left.  General Parke succeeded in carrying the enemy'smain line, capturing guns and prisoners, but was unable to carry hisinner line.  General Sheridan being advised of the condition of affairs,returned General Miles to his proper command.  On reaching the enemy'slines immediately surrounding Petersburg, a portion of General Gibbon'scorps, by a most gallant charge, captured two strong inclosed works--themost salient and commanding south of Petersburg--thus materiallyshortening the line of investment necessary for taking in the city.  Theenemy south of Hatcher's Run retreated westward to Sutherland's Station,where they were overtaken by Miles's division.  A severe engagementensued, and lasted until both his right and left flanks were threatenedby the approach of General Sheridan, who was moving from Ford's Stationtowards Petersburg, and a division sent by General Meade from the frontof Petersburg, when he broke in the utmost confusion, leaving in ourhands his guns and many prisoners.  This force retreated by the mainroad along the Appomattox River.  During the night of the 2d the enemyevacuated Petersburg and Richmond, and retreated towards Danville.  Onthe morning of the 3d pursuit was commenced.  General Sheridan pushedfor the Danville Road, keeping near the Appomattox, followed by GeneralMeade with the 2d and 6th corps, while General Ord moved forBurkesville, along the South Side Road; the 9th corps stretched alongthat road behind him.  On the 4th, General Sheridan struck the DanvilleRoad near Jetersville, where he learned that Lee was at Amelia CourtHouse.  He immediately intrenched himself and awaited the arrival ofGeneral Meade, who reached there the next day. General Ord reachedBurkesville on the evening of the 5th.On the morning of the 5th, I addressed Major-General Sherman thefollowing communication:"WILSON'S STATION, April 5, 1865."GENERAL:  All indications now are that Lee will attempt to reachDanville with the remnant of his force.  Sheridan, who was up with himlast night, reports all that is left, horse, foot, and dragoons, attwenty thousand, much demoralized.  We hope to reduce this numberone-half.  I shall push on to Burkesville, and if a stand is made atDanville, will in a very few days go there.  If you can possibly do so,push on from where you are, and let us see if we cannot finish the jobwith Lee's and Johnston's armies.  Whether it will be better for you tostrike for Greensboro', or nearer to Danville, you will be better ableto judge when you receive this.  Rebel armies now are the only strategicpoints to strike at."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN."On the morning of the 6th, it was found that General Lee was moving westof Jetersville, towards Danville.  General Sheridan moved with hiscavalry (the 5th corps having been returned to General Meade on hisreaching Jetersville) to strike his flank, followed by the 6th corps,while the 2d and 5th corps pressed hard after, forcing him to abandonseveral hundred wagons and several pieces of artillery.  General Ordadvanced from Burkesville towards Farmville, sending two regiments ofinfantry and a squadron of cavalry, under Brevet Brigadier-GeneralTheodore Read, to reach and destroy the bridges.  This advance met thehead of Lee's column near Farmville, which it heroically attacked anddetained until General Read was killed and his small force overpowered.This caused a delay in the enemy's movements, and enabled General Ord toget well up with the remainder of his force, on meeting which, the enemyimmediately intrenched himself.  In the afternoon, General Sheridanstruck the enemy south of Sailors' Creek, captured sixteen pieces ofartillery and about four hundred wagons, and detained him until the 6thcorps got up, when a general attack of infantry and cavalry was made,which resulted in the capture of six or seven thousand prisoners, amongwhom were many general officers.  The movements of the 2d corps andGeneral Ord's command contributed greatly to the day's success.On the morning of the 7th the pursuit was renewed, the cavalry, exceptone division, and the 5th corps moving by Prince Edward's Court House;the 6th corps, General Ord's command, and one division of cavalry, onFarmville; and the 2d corps by the High Bridge Road.  It was soon foundthat the enemy had crossed to the north side of the Appomattox; but soclose was the pursuit, that the 2d corps got possession of the commonbridge at High Bridge before the enemy could destroy it, and immediatelycrossed over.  The 6th corps and a division of cavalry crossed atFarmville to its support.Feeling now that General Lee's chance of escape was utterly hopeless, Iaddressed him the following communication from Farmville:"April 7, 1865."GENERAL--The result of the last week must convince you of thehopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of NorthernVirginia in this struggle.  I feel that it is so, and regard it as myduty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion ofblood, by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the ConfederateStates army known as the Army of Northern Virginia."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."GENERAL R. E. LEE."Early on the morning of the 8th, before leaving, I received at Farmvillethe following:"April 7, 1865."GENERAL:  I have received your note of this date.  Though notentertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of furtherresistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia, I reciprocateyour desire to avoid useless effusion of blood, and therefore, beforeconsidering your proposition, ask the terms you will offer on conditionof its surrender."R. E. LEE, General."LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT."To this I immediately replied:"April 8, 1865."GENERAL:--Your note of last evening, in reply to mine of same date,asking the condition on which I will accept the surrender of the Army ofNorthern Virginia, is just received.  In reply, I would say, that peacebeing my great desire, there is but one condition I would insist upon--namely, That the men and officers surrendered shall be disqualified fortaking up arms again against the Government of the United States untilproperly exchanged.  I will meet you, or will designate officers to meetany officers you may name for the same purpose, at any point agreeableto you, for the purpose of arranging definitely the terms upon which thesurrender of the Army of the Northern Virginia will be received."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."GENERAL R. E. LEE."Early on the morning of the 8th the pursuit was resumed. General Meadefollowed north of the Appomattox, and General Sheridan, with all thecavalry, pushed straight ahead for Appomattox Station, followed byGeneral Ord's command and the 5th corps. During the day General Meade'sadvance had considerable fighting with the enemy's rear-guard, but wasunable to bring on a general engagement.  Late in the evening GeneralSheridan struck the railroad at Appomattox Station, drove the enemy fromthere, and captured twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train,and four trains of cars loaded with supplies for Lee's army.  Duringthis day I accompanied General Meade's column, and about midnightreceived the following communication from General Lee:April 8, 1865."GENERAL:--I received, at a late hour, your note of to-day.  In mine ofyesterday I did not intend to propose the surrender of the Army ofNorthern Virginia, but to ask the terms of your proposition.  To befrank, I do not think the emergency has arisen to call for the surrenderof this army; but as the restoration of peace should be the sole objectof all, I desired to know whether your proposals would lead to that end.I cannot, therefore, meet you with a view to the surrender of the Armyof Northern Virginia; but as far as your proposal may affect theConfederate States forces under my command, and tend to the restorationof peace, I should be pleased to meet you at ten A.M. to-morrow on theold stage-road to Richmond, between the picket-lines of the two armies."R. E. LEE, General."LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT."Early on the morning of the 9th I returned him an answer as follows, andimmediately started to join the column south of the Appomattox:"April 9, 1865."GENERAL:--Your note of yesterday is received.  I have no authority totreat on the subject of peace; the meeting proposed for ten A.M. to-daycould lead to no good.  I will state, however, general, that I amequally anxious for peace with yourself, and the whole North entertainsthe same feeling.  The terms upon which peace can be had are wellunderstood.  By the South laying down their arms they will hasten thatmost desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and hundreds ofmillions of property not yet destroyed.  Seriously hoping that all ourdifficulties may be settled without the loss of another life, Isubscribe myself, etc."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."GENERAL R. E. LEE."On this morning of the 9th, General Ord's command and the 5th corpsreached Appomattox Station just as the enemy was making a desperateeffort to break through our cavalry.  The infantry was at once thrownin.  Soon after a white flag was received, requesting a suspension ofhostilities pending negotiations for a surrender.Before reaching General Sheridan's headquarters, I received thefollowing from General Lee:"April 9, 1865."GENERAL:--I received your note of this morning on the picket-line,whither I had come to meet you, and ascertain definitely what terms wereembraced in your proposal of yesterday with reference to the surrenderof this army.  I now ask an interview, in accordance with the offercontained in your letter of yesterday, for that purpose."R. E. LEE, General."LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT."The interview was held at Appomattox Court-House, the result of which isset forth in the following correspondence:APPOMATTOX COURT-HOUSE, Virginia, April 9, 1865."GENERAL:  In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of NorthernVirginia on the following terms, to wit:  Rolls of all the officers andmen to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an officer to bedesignated by me, the other to be retained by such officer or officersas you may designate.  The officers to give their individual paroles notto take up arms against the Government of the United States untilproperly exchanged; and each company or regimental commander sign a likeparole for the men of their commands.  The arms, artillery, and publicproperty to be parked and stacked, and turned over to the officersappointed by me to receive them.  This will not embrace the side-arms ofthe officers, nor their private horses or baggage.  This done, eachofficer and man will be allowed to return to his home, not to bedisturbed by United States authority so long as they observe theirparoles and the laws in force where they may reside."U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."GENERAL R. E. LEE.""HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865."GENERAL:  I have received your letter of this date containing the termsof surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.  Asthey are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the8th instant, they are accepted.  I will proceed to designate the properofficers to carry the stipulations into effect."R. E. LEE, General."LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT."The command of Major-General Gibbon, the 5th army corps under Griffin,and Mackenzie's cavalry, were designated to remain at AppomattoxCourt-House until the paroling of the surrendered army was completed,and to take charge of the public property. The remainder of the armyimmediately returned to the vicinity of Burkesville.General Lee's great influence throughout the whole South caused hisexample to be followed, and to-day the result is that the armies latelyunder his leadership are at their homes, desiring peace and quiet, andtheir arms are in the hands of our ordnance officers.On the receipt of my letter of the 5th, General Sherman moved directlyagainst Joe Johnston, who retreated rapidly on and through Raleigh,which place General Sherman occupied on the morning of the 13th.  Theday preceding, news of the surrender of General Lee reached him atSmithfield.On the 14th a correspondence was opened between General Sherman andGeneral Johnston, which resulted on the 18th in an agreement for asuspension of hostilities, and a memorandum or basis for peace, subjectto the approval of the President.  This agreement was disapproved by thePresident on the 21st, which disapproval, together with yourinstructions, was communicated to General Sherman by me in person on themorning of the 24th, at Raleigh, North Carolina, in obedience to yourorders.  Notice was at once given by him to General Johnston for thetermination of the truce that had been entered into.  On the 25thanother meeting between them was agreed upon, to take place on the 26th,which terminated in the surrender and disbandment of Johnston's armyupon substantially the same terms as were given to General Lee.The expedition under General Stoneman from East Tennessee got off on the20th of March, moving by way of Boone, North Carolina, and struck therailroad at Wytheville, Chambersburg, and Big Lick.  The force strikingit at Big Lick pushed on to within a few miles of Lynchburg, destroyingthe important bridges, while with the main force he effectuallydestroyed it between New River and Big Lick, and then turned forGreensboro', on the North Carolina Railroad; struck that road anddestroyed the bridges between Danville and Greensboro', and betweenGreensboro' and the Yadkin, together with the depots of supplies alongit, and captured four hundred prisoners.  At Salisbury he attacked anddefeated a force of the enemy under General Gardiner, capturing fourteenpieces of artillery and one thousand three hundred and sixty-fourprisoners, and destroyed large amounts of army stores.  At this place hedestroyed fifteen miles of railroad and the bridges towards Charlotte.Thence he moved to Slatersville.General Canby, who had been directed in January to make preparations fora movement from Mobile Bay against Mobile and the interior of Alabama,commenced his movement on the 20th of March.  The 16th corps,Major-General A. J. Smith commanding, moved from Fort Gaines by water toFish River; the 13th corps, under Major-General Gordon Granger, movedfrom Fort Morgan and joined the 16th corps on Fish River, both movingthence on Spanish Fort and investing it on the 27th; while Major-GeneralSteele's command moved from Pensacola, cut the railroad leading fromTensas to Montgomery, effected a junction with them, and partiallyinvested Fort Blakely.  After a severe bombardment of Spanish Fort, apart of its line was carried on the 8th of April.  During the night theenemy evacuated the fort.  Fort Blakely was carried by assault on the9th, and many prisoners captured; our loss was considerable.  Thesesuccesses practically opened to us the Alabama River, and enabled us toapproach Mobile from the north.  On the night of the 11th the city wasevacuated, and was taken possession of by our forces on the morning ofthe 12th.The expedition under command of Brevet Major-General Wilson, consistingof twelve thousand five hundred mounted men, was delayed by rains untilMarch 22d, when it moved from Chickasaw, Alabama.  On the 1st of April,General Wilson encountered the enemy in force under Forrest nearEbenezer Church, drove him in confusion, captured three hundredprisoners and three guns, and destroyed the central bridge over theCahawba River.  On the 2d he attacked and captured the fortified city ofSelma, defended by Forrest, with seven thousand men and thirty-two guns,destroyed the arsenal, armory, naval foundry, machine-shops, vastquantities of stores, and captured three thousand prisoners.  On the 4thhe captured and destroyed Tuscaloosa.  On the 10th he crossed theAlabama River, and after sending information of his operations toGeneral Canby, marched on Montgomery, which place he occupied on the14th, the enemy having abandoned it.  At this place many stores and fivesteamboats fell into our hands.  Thence a force marched direct onColumbus, and another on West Point, both of which places were assaultedand captured on the 16th.  At the former place we got one thousand fivehundred prisoners and fifty-two field-guns, destroyed two gunboats, thenavy yard, foundries, arsenal, many factories, and much other publicproperty.  At the latter place we got three hundred prisoners, fourguns, and destroyed nineteen locomotives and three hundred cars.  On the20th he took possession of Macon, Georgia, with sixty field-guns, onethousand two hundred militia, and five generals, surrendered by GeneralHowell Cobb.  General Wilson, hearing that Jeff. Davis was trying tomake his escape, sent forces in pursuit and succeeded in capturing himon the morning of May 11th.On the 4th day of May, General Dick Taylor surrendered to General Canbyall the remaining rebel forces east of the Mississippi.A force sufficient to insure an easy triumph over the enemy under KirbySmith, west of the Mississippi, was immediately put in motion for Texas,and Major-General Sheridan designated for its immediate command; but onthe 26th day of May, and before they reached their destination, GeneralKirby Smith surrendered his entire command to Major-General Canby.  Thissurrender did not take place, however, until after the capture of therebel President and Vice-President; and the bad faith was exhibited offirst disbanding most of his army and permitting an indiscriminateplunder of public property.Owing to the report that many of those lately in arms against thegovernment had taken refuge upon the soil of Mexico, carrying with themarms rightfully belonging to the United States, which had beensurrendered to us by agreement among them some of the leaders who hadsurrendered in person and the disturbed condition of affairs on the RioGrande, the orders for troops to proceed to Texas were not changed.There have been severe combats, raids, expeditions, and movements todefeat the designs and purposes of the enemy, most of them reflectinggreat credit on our arms, and which contributed greatly to our finaltriumph, that I have not mentioned.  Many of these will be found clearlyset forth in the reports herewith submitted; some in the telegrams andbrief dispatches announcing them, and others, I regret to say, have notas yet been officially reported.For information touching our Indian difficulties, I would respectfullyrefer to the reports of the commanders of departments in which they haveoccurred.It has been my fortune to see the armies of both the West and the Eastfight battles, and from what I have seen I know there is no differencein their fighting qualities.  All that it was possible for men to do inbattle they have done.  The Western armies commenced their battles inthe Mississippi Valley, and received the final surrender of the remnantof the principal army opposed to them in North Carolina.  The armies ofthe East commenced their battles on the river from which the Army of thePotomac derived its name, and received the final surrender of their oldantagonists at Appomattox Court House, Virginia.  The splendidachievements of each have nationalized our victories removed allsectional jealousies (of which we have unfortunately experienced toomuch), and the cause of crimination and recrimination that might havefollowed had either section failed in its duty.  All have a proudrecord, and all sections can well congratulate themselves and each otherfor having done their full share in restoring the supremacy of law overevery foot of territory belonging to the United States.  Let them hopefor perpetual peace and harmony with that enemy, whose manhood, howevermistaken the cause, drew forth such herculean deeds of valor.I have the honor to be, Very respectfully, your obedient servant, U. S.GRANT, Lieutenant-General.THE END__________FOOTNOTES(*1) Afterwards General Gardner, C.S.A.(*2) General Garland expressed a wish to get a message back toGeneral Twiggs, his division commander, or General Taylor, tothe effect that he was nearly out of ammunition and must havemore sent to him, or otherwise be reinforced.  Deeming thereturn dangerous he did not like to order any one to carry it,so he called for a volunteer.  Lieutenant Grant offered hisservices, which were accepted.--PUBLISHERS.(*3) Mentioned in the reports of Major Lee, Colonel Garland andGeneral Worth.--PUBLISHERS.(*4) NOTE.--It had been a favorite idea with General Scott for agreat many years before the Mexican war to have established inthe United States a soldiers' home, patterned after something ofthe kind abroad, particularly, I believe, in France.  Herecommended this uniformly, or at least frequently, in hisannual reports to the Secretary of War, but never got anyhearing.  Now, as he had conquered the state, he madeassessments upon the different large towns and cities occupiedby our troops, in proportion to their capacity to pay, andappointed officers to receive the money.  In addition to the sumthus realized he had derived, through capture at Cerro Gordo,sales of captured government tobacco, etc., sums which swelledthe fund to a total of about 220,000.  Portions of this fundwere distributed among the rank and file, given to the woundedin hospital, or applied in other ways, leaving a balance of some118,000 remaining unapplied at the close of the war.  After thewar was over and the troops all home, General Scott applied tohave this money, which had never been turned into the Treasuryof the United States, expended in establishing such homes as hehad previously recommended.  This fund was the foundation of theSoldiers' Home at Washington City, and also one at Harrodsburgh,Kentucky.The latter went into disuse many years ago.  In fact it neverhad many soldiers in it, and was, I believe, finally sold.(*5) The Mexican war made three presidential candidates, Scott,Taylor and Pierce--and any number of aspirants for that highoffice.  It made also governors of States, members of thecabinet, foreign ministers and other officers of high rank bothin state and nation.  The rebellion, which contained more war ina single day, at some critical periods, than the whole Mexicanwar in two years, has not been so fruitful of political resultsto those engaged on the Union side.  On the other side, the sideof the South, nearly every man who holds office of any sortwhatever, either in the state or in the nation, was aConfederate soldier, but this is easily accounted for from thefact that the South was a military camp, and there were very fewpeople of a suitable age to be in the army who were not in it.(*6) C. B. Lagow, the others not yet having joined me.(*7) NOTE.--Since writing this chapter I have received from Mrs.W. H. L. Wallace, widow of the gallant general who was killed inthe first day's fight on the field of Shiloh, a letter fromGeneral Lew. Wallace to him dated the morning of the 5th.  Atthe date of this letter it was well known that the Confederateshad troops out along the Mobile & Ohio railroad west of Crump'slanding and Pittsburg landing, and were also collecting nearShiloh.  This letter shows that at that time General Lew.Wallace was making preparations for the emergency that mighthappen for the passing of reinforcements between Shiloh and hisposition, extending from Crump's landing westward, and he sendsit over the road running from Adamsville to the Pittsburglanding and Purdy road.  These two roads intersect nearly a milewest of the crossing of the latter over Owl Creek, where ourright rested.  In this letter General Lew. Wallace advisesGeneral W. H. L. Wallace that he will send "to-morrow" (and hisletter also says "April 5th," which is the same day the letterwas dated and which, therefore, must have been written on the4th) some cavalry to report to him at his headquarters, andsuggesting the propriety of General W. H. L. Wallace's sending acompany back with them for the purpose of having the cavalry atthe two landings familiarize themselves with the road so thatthey could "act promptly in case of emergency as guides to andfrom the different camps."This modifies very materially what I have said, and what hasbeen said by others, of the conduct of General Lew. Wallace atthe battle of Shiloh.  It shows that he naturally, with no moreexperience than he had at the time in the profession of arms,would take the particular road that he did start upon in theabsence of orders to move by a different road.The mistake he made, and which probably caused his apparentdilatoriness, was that of advancing some distance after he foundthat the firing, which would be at first directly to his frontand then off to the left, had fallen back until it had got verymuch in rear of the position of his advance.  This falling backhad taken place before I sent General Wallace orders to move upto Pittsburg landing and, naturally, my order was to follow theroad nearest the river.  But my order was verbal, and to a staffofficer who was to deliver it to General Wallace, so that I amnot competent to say just what order the General actuallyreceived.General Wallace's division was stationed, the First brigade atCrump's landing, the Second out two miles, and the Third two anda half miles out.  Hearing the sounds of battle General Wallaceearly ordered his First and Third brigades to concentrate on theSecond.  If the position of our front had not changed, the roadwhich Wallace took would have been somewhat shorter to our rightthan the River road.U. S. GRANT.MOUNT MACGREGOR, NEW YORK, June 21, 1885.(*8) NOTE:  In an article on the battle of Shiloh which I wrotefor the Century Magazine, I stated that General A. McD. McCook,who commanded a division of Buell's army, expressed someunwillingness to pursue the enemy on Monday, April 7th, becauseof the condition of his troops.  General Badeau, in his history,also makes the same statement, on my authority.  Out of justiceto General McCook and his command, I must say that they left apoint twenty-two miles east of Savannah on the morning of the6th.  From the heavy rains of a few days previous and thepassage of trains and artillery, the roads were necessarily deepin mud, which made marching slow.  The division had not onlymarched through this mud the day before, but it had been in therain all night without rest.  It was engaged in the battle ofthe second day and did as good service as its positionallowed.  In fact an opportunity occurred for it to perform aconspicuous act of gallantry which elicited the highestcommendation from division commanders in the Army of theTennessee.  General Sherman both in his memoirs and report makesmention of this fact.  General McCook himself belongs to a familywhich furnished many volunteers to the army.  I refer to thesecircumstances with minuteness because I did General McCookinjustice in my article in the Century, though not to the extentone would suppose from the public press.  I am not willing to doany one an injustice, and if convinced that I have done one, Iam always willing to make the fullest admission.(*9) NOTE.--For gallantry in the various engagements, from thetime I was left in command down to 26th of October and on myrecommendation, Generals McPherson and C. S. Hamilton werepromoted to be Major-Generals, and Colonels C. C. Marsh, 20thIllinois, M. M. Crocker, 13th Iowa J. A. Mower, 11th Missouri,M. D. Leggett, 78th Ohio, J. D. Stevenson, 7th Missouri, andJohn E. Smith, 45th Illinois, to be Brigadiers.(*10) Colonel Ellet reported having attacked a Confederatebattery on the Red River two days before with one of his boats,the De Soto.  Running aground, he was obliged to abandon hisvessel.  However, he reported that he set fire to her and blewher up.  Twenty of his men fell into the hands of the enemy.With the balance he escaped on the small captured steamer, theNew Era, and succeeded in passing the batteries at Grand Gulfand reaching the vicinity of Vicksburg.(*11) One of Colonel Ellet's vessels which had run the blockadeon February the 2d and been sunk in the Red River.(*12) NOTE.--On this occasion Governor Richard Yates, ofIllinois, happened to be on a visit to the army and accompaniedme to Carthage.  I furnished an ambulance for his use and thatof some of the State officers who accompanied him.(*13) NOTE.--When General Sherman first learned of the move Iproposed to make, he called to see me about it.  I recollectthat I had transferred my headquarters from a boat in the riverto a house a short distance back from the levee.  I was seatedon the piazza engaged in conversation with my staff when Shermancame up.  After a few moments' conversation he said that he wouldlike to see me alone.  We passed into the house together and shutthe door after us.  Sherman then expressed his alarm at the moveI had ordered, saying that I was putting myself in a positionvoluntarily which an enemy would be glad to manoeuvre a year--ora long time--to get me in.  I was going into the enemy's country,with a large river behind me and the enemy holding pointsstrongly fortified above and below.  He said that it was anaxiom in war that when any great body of troops moved against anenemy they should do so from a base of supplies, which they wouldguard as they would the apple of the eye, etc.  He pointed outall the difficulties that might be encountered in the campaignproposed, and stated in turn what would be the true campaign tomake.  This was, in substance, to go back until high groundcould be reached on the east bank of the river; fortify thereand establish a depot of supplies, and move from there, beingalways prepared to fall back upon it in case of disaster.  Isaid this would take us back to Memphis.  Sherman then said thatwas the very place he would go to, and would move by railroadfrom Memphis to Grenada, repairing the road as we advanced.  Tothis I replied, the country is already disheartened over thelack of success on the part of our armies; the last electionwent against the vigorous prosecution of the war, voluntaryenlistments had ceased throughout most of the North andconscription was already resorted to, and if we went back so faras Memphis it would discourage the people so much that bases ofsupplies would be of no use:  neither men to hold them norsupplies to put in them would be furnished.  The problem for uswas to move forward to a decisive victory, or our cause waslost.  No progress was being made in any other field, and we hadto go on.Sherman wrote to my adjutant general, Colonel J. A. Rawlins,embodying his views of the campaign that should be made, andasking him to advise me to at least get the views of my generalsupon the subject.  Colonel Rawlins showed me the letter, but Idid not see any reason for changing my plans.  The letter wasnot answered and the subject was not subsequently mentionedbetween Sherman and myself to the end of the war, that Iremember of.  I did not regard the letter as official, andconsequently did not preserve it.  General Sherman furnished acopy himself to General Badeau, who printed it in his history ofmy campaigns.  I did not regard either the conversation betweenus or the letter to my adjutant-general as protests, but simplyfriendly advice which the relations between us fullyjustified.  Sherman gave the same energy to make the campaign asuccess that he would or could have done if it had been orderedby himself.  I make this statement here to correct an impressionwhich was circulated at the close of the war to Sherman'sprejudice, and for which there was no fair foundation.(*14) Meant Edward's Station.(*15) CHATTANOOGA, November 18, 1863.MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN:Enclosed herewith I send you copy of instructions toMajor-General Thomas.  You having been over the ground inperson, and having heard the whole matter discussed, furtherinstructions will not be necessary for you.  It is particularlydesirable that a force should be got through to the railroadbetween Cleveland and Dalton, and Longstreet thus cut off fromcommunication with the South, but being confronted by a largeforce here, strongly located, it is not easy to tell how this isto be effected until the result of our first effort is known.I will add, however, what is not shown in my instructions toThomas, that a brigade of cavalry has been ordered here which,if it arrives in time, will be thrown across the Tennessee aboveChickamauga, and may be able to make the trip to Cleveland orthereabouts.U. S. GRANTMaj.-Gen'l.CHATTANOOGA, November 18, 1863.MAJOR-GENERAL GEO. H. THOMAS,Chattanooga:All preparations should be made for attacking the enemy'sposition on Missionary Ridge by Saturday at daylight.  Not beingprovided with a map giving names of roads, spurs of themountains, and other places, such definite instructions cannotbe given as might be desirable.  However, the general plan, youunderstand, is for Sherman, with the force brought with himstrengthened by a division from your command, to effect acrossing of the Tennessee River just below the mouth ofChickamauga; his crossing to be protected by artillery from theheights on the north bank of the river (to be located by yourchief of artillery), and to secure the heights on the northernextremity to about the railroad tunnel before the enemy canconcentrate against him.  You will co-operate with Sherman.  Thetroops in Chattanooga Valley should be well concentrated on yourleft flank, leaving only the necessary force to defendfortifications on the right and centre, and a movable column ofone division in readiness to move wherever ordered.  Thisdivision should show itself as threateningly as possible on themost practicable line for making an attack up the valley.  Youreffort then will be to form a junction with Sherman, making youradvance well towards the northern end of Missionary Ridge, andmoving as near simultaneously with him as possible.  Thejunction once formed and the ridge carried, communications willbe at once established between the two armies by roads on thesouth bank of the river.  Further movements will then depend onthose of the enemy.  Lookout Valley, I think, will be easilyheld by Geary's division and what troops you may still havethere belonging to the old Army of the Cumberland.  Howard'scorps can then be held in readiness to act either with you atChattanooga or with Sherman.  It should be marched on Fridaynight to a position on the north side of the river, not lowerdown than the first pontoon-bridge, and there held in readinessfor such orders as may become necessary.  All these troops willbe provided with two days' cooked rations in haversacks, and onehundred rounds of ammunition on the person of each infantrysoldier.  Special care should be taken by all officers to seethat ammunition is not wasted or unnecessarily fired away.  Youwill call on the engineer department for such preparations asyou may deem necessary for carrying your infantry and artilleryover the creek.U. S. GRANT,Major-General.(*16) In this order authority was given for the troops to reformafter taking the first line of rifle-pits preparatory to carryingthe ridge.(*17) CHATTANOOGA, November 24,1863.MAJOR-GENERAL. CEO. H. THOMAS,ChattanoogaGeneral Sherman carried Missionary Ridge as far as the tunnelwith only slight skirmishing.  His right now rests at the tunneland on top of the hill, his left at Chickamauga Creek.  I haveinstructed General Sherman to advance as soon as it is light inthe morning, and your attack, which will be simultaneous, willbe in cooperation.  Your command will either carry therifle-pits and ridge directly in front of them, or move to theleft, as the presence of the enemy may require.  If Hooker'sposition on the mountain [cannot be maintained] with a smallforce, and it is found impracticable to carry the top from wherehe is, it would be advisable for him to move up the valley withall the force he can spare, and ascend by the first practicableroad.U.

C.,April 4, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN,Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi.GENERAL:--It is my design, if the enemy keep quiet and allow meto take the initiative in the spring campaign, to work all partsof the army together, and somewhat towards a common centre.  Foryour information I now write you my programme, as at presentdetermined upon.I have sent orders to Banks, by private messenger, to finish uphis present expedition against Shreveport with all dispatch; toturn over the defence of Red River to General Steele and thenavy and to return your troops to you and his own to NewOrleans; to abandon all of Texas, except the Rio Grande, and tohold that with not to exceed four thousand men; to reduce thenumber of troops on the Mississippi to the lowest numbernecessary to hold it, and to collect from his command not lessthan twenty-five thousand men.  To this I will add five thousandmen from Missouri.  With this force he is to commence operationsagainst Mobile as soon as he can.  It will be impossible for himto commence too early.Gillmore joins Butler with ten thousand men, and the two operateagainst Richmond from the south side of the James River.  Thiswill give Butler thirty-three thousand men to operate with, W.F. Smith commanding the right wing of his forces and Gillmorethe left wing.  I will stay with the Army of the Potomac,increased by Burnside's corps of not less than twenty-fivethousand effective men, and operate directly against Lee's army,wherever it may be found.Sigel collects all his available force in two columns, one,under Ord and Averell, to start from Beverly, Virginia, and theother, under Crook, to start from Charleston on the Kanawha, tomove against the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.Crook will have all cavalry, and will endeavor to get in aboutSaltville, and move east from there to join Ord.  His force willbe all cavalry, while Ord will have from ten to twelve thousandmen of all arms.You I propose to move against Johnston's army, to break it upand to get into the interior of the enemy's country as far asyou can, inflicting all the damage you can against their warresources.I do not propose to lay down for you a plan of campaign, butsimply lay down the work it is desirable to have done and leaveyou free to execute it in your own way.  Submit to me, however,as early as you can, your plan of operations.As stated, Banks is ordered to commence operations as soon as hecan.  Gillmore is ordered to report at Fortress Monroe by the18th inst., or as soon thereafter as practicable.  Sigel isconcentrating now.  None will move from their places ofrendezvous until I direct, except Banks.  I want to be ready tomove by the 25th inst., if possible.  But all I can now directis that you get ready as soon as possible.  I know you will havedifficulties to encounter in getting through the mountains towhere supplies are abundant, but I believe you will accomplishit.From the expedition from the Department of West Virginia I donot calculate on very great results; but it is the only way Ican take troops from there.  With the long line of railroadSigel has to protect, he can spare no troops except to movedirectly to his front.  In this way he must get through toinflict great damage on the enemy, or the enemy must detach fromone of his armies a large force to prevent it.  In other words,if Sigel can't skin himself he can hold a leg while some oneelse skins.I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,U. S. GRANT,Lieutenant-General.(*24) See instructions to Butler, in General Grant's report,Appendix.(*25) IN FIELD, CULPEPER C. H., VA.,April 9, 1864.MAJ.-GENERAL GEO. G. MEADECom'd'g Army of the Potomac.For information and as instruction to govern your preparationsfor the coming campaign, the following is communicatedconfidentially for your own perusal alone.So far as practicable all the armies are to move together, andtowards one common centre.  Banks has been instructed to turnover the guarding of the Red River to General Steele and thenavy, to abandon Texas with the exception of the Rio Grande, andto concentrate all the force he can, not less than 25,000 men, tomove on Mobile.  This he is to do without reference to othermovements.  From the scattered condition of his command,however, he cannot possibly get it together to leave New Orleansbefore the 1st of May, if so soon.  Sherman will move at the sametime you do, or two or three days in advance, Jo. Johnston's armybeing his objective point, and the heart of Georgia his ultimateaim.  If successful he will secure the line from Chattanooga toMobile with the aid of Banks.Sigel cannot spare troops from his army to reinforce either ofthe great armies, but he can aid them by moving directly to hisfront.  This he has been directed to do, and is now makingpreparations for it.  Two columns of his command will make southat the same time with the general move; one from Beverly, fromten to twelve thousand strong, under Major-General Ord; theother from Charleston, Va., principally cavalry, underBrig.-General Crook.  The former of these will endeavor to reachthe Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, about south of Covington,and if found practicable will work eastward to Lynchburg andreturn to its base by way of the Shenandoah Valley, or joinyou.  The other will strike at Saltville, Va., and come eastwardto join Ord.  The cavalry from Ord's command will try tributarieswould furnish us an easy line over which to bring all supplies towithin easy hauling distance of every position the army couldoccupy from the Rapidan to the James River.  But Lee could, ifhe chose, detach or move his whole army north on a line ratherinterior to the one I would have to take in following.  Amovement by his left--our right--would obviate this; but allthat was done would have to be done with the supplies andammunition we started with.  All idea of adopting this latterplan was abandoned when the limited quantity of suppliespossible to take with us was considered.  The country over whichwe would have to pass was so exhausted of all food or forage thatwe would be obliged to carry everything with us.While these preparations were going on the enemy was notentirely idle.  In the West Forrest made a raid in WestTennessee up to the northern border, capturing the garrison offour or five hundred men at Union City, and followed it up by anattack on Paducah, Kentucky, on the banks of the Ohio.  While hewas able to enter the city he failed to capture the forts or anypart of the garrison.  On the first intelligence of Forrest'sraid I telegraphed Sherman to send all his cavalry against him,and not to let him get out of the trap he had put himselfinto.  Sherman had anticipated me by sending troops against himbefore he got my order.Forrest, however, fell back rapidly, and attacked the troops atFort Pillow, a station for the protection of the navigation ofthe Mississippi River.  The garrison to force a passagesouthward, if they are successful in reaching the Virginia andTennessee Railroad, to cut the main lines of the road connectingRichmond with all the South and South-west.Gillmore will join Butler with about 10,000 men from SouthCarolina. Butler can reduce his garrison so as to take 23,000men into the field directly to his front.  The force will becommanded by Maj.-General W. F. Smith.  With Smith and Gillmore,Butler will seize City Point, and operate against Richmond fromthe south side of the river.  His movement will be simultaneouswith yours.Lee's army will be your objective point.  Wherever Lee goes,there you will go also.  The only point upon which I am now indoubt is, whether it will be better to cross the Rapidan aboveor below him.  Each plan presents great advantages over theother with corresponding objections.  By crossing above, Lee iscut off from all chance of ignoring Richmond and going north ona raid.  But if we take this route, all we do must be donewhilst the rations we start with hold out.  We separate fromButler so that he cannot be directed how to co-operate.  By theother route Brandy Station can be used as a base of suppliesuntil another is secured on the York or James rivers.These advantages and objections I will talk over with you morefully than I can write them.Burnside with a force of probably 25,000 men will reinforceyou.  Immediately upon his arrival, which will be shortly afterthe 20th inst., I will give him the defence of the road fromBull Run as far south as we wish to hold it.  This will enableyou to collect all your strength about Brandy Station and to thefront.There will be naval co-operation on the James River, andtransports and ferries will be provided so that should Lee fallback into his intrenchments at Richmond, Butler's force andyours will be a unit, or at least can be made to act as such.What I would direct then, is that you commence at once reducingbaggage to the very lowest possible standard.  Two wagons to aregiment of five hundred men is the greatest number that shouldbe allowed, for all baggage, exclusive of subsistence stores andordnance stores.  One wagon to brigade and one to divisionheadquarters is sufficient and about two to corps headquarters.Should by Lee's right flank be our route, you will want to makearrangements for having supplies of all sorts promptly forwardedto White House on the Pamunkey.  Your estimates for thiscontingency should be made at once.  If not wanted there, thereis every probability they will be wanted on the James River orelsewhere.If Lee's left is turned, large provision will have to be madefor ordnance stores.  I would say not much short of five hundredrounds of infantry ammunition would do.  By the other, half theamount would be sufficient.U. S. GRANT,Lieutenant-General.(*26) General John A. Logan, upon whom devolved the command ofthe Army of the Tennessee during this battle, in his report gaveour total loss in killed, wounded and missing at 3,521; andestimated that of the enemy to be not less than 10,000:  andGeneral G. M. Dodge, graphically describing to General Shermanthe enemy's attack, the full weight of which fell first upon andwas broken by his depleted command, remarks:  "The disparity offorces can be seen from the fact that in the charge made by mytwo brigades under Fuller and Mersy they took 351 prisoners,representing forty-nine different regiments, eight brigades andthree divisions; and brought back eight battle flags from theenemy."(*27)UNION ARMY ON THE RAPIDAN, MAY 5, 1864.[COMPILED.]LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U.

Warren and Wright should hold their corps asclose to the enemy as possible, to take advantage of anydiversion caused by this attack, and to push in if anyopportunity presents itself.  There is but little doubt in mymind that the assault last evening would have proved entirelysuccessful if it had commenced one hour earlier and had beenheartily entered into by Mott's division and the 9th corps.U.

C.I beg leave to recommend the following promotions be made forgallant and distinguished services in the last eight days'battles, to wit:  Brigadier-General H. G. Wright andBrigadier-General John Gibbon to be Major-Generals; Colonel S.S. Carroll, 8th Ohio Volunteers Colonel E. Upton, 121st New YorkVolunteers; Colonel William McCandless, 2d Pennsylvania Reserves,to be Brigadier-Generals. I would also recommend Major-General W.S. Hancock for Brigadier-General in the regular army.  Hisservices and qualifications are eminently deserving of thisrecognition.  In making these recommendations I do not wish theclaims of General G. M. Dodge for promotion forgotten, butrecommend his name to be sent in at the same time.  I would alsoask to have General Wright assigned to the command of the SixthArmy Corps.  I would further ask the confirmation of GeneralHumphreys to the rank of Major-General.General Meade has more than met my most sanguine expectations.He and Sherman are the fittest officers for large commands Ihave come in contact with.  If their services can be rewarded bypromotion to the rank of Major-Generals in the regular army thehonor would be worthily bestowed, and I would feel personallygratified.  I would not like to see one of these promotions atthis time without seeing both.U. S. GRANT,Lieut.-General.(*32) QUARLES' MILLS, VA., May 26, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK,Washington, D. C.The relative position of the two armies is now as follows: Lee'sright rests on a swamp east of the Richmond and Fredericksburgroad and south of the North Anna, his centre on the river at OxFord, and his left at Little River with the crossings of LittleRiver guarded as far up as we have gone. Hancock with his corpsand one division of the 9th corps crossed at Chesterfield Fordand covers the right wing of Lee's army. One division of the 9thcorps is on the north bank of the Anna at Ox Ford, with bridgesabove and below at points nearest to it where both banks areheld by us, so that it could reinforce either wing of our armywith equal facility.  The 5th and 6th corps with one division ofthe 9th corps run from the south bank of the Anna from a shortdistance above Ox Ford to Little River, and parallel with andnear to the enemy.To make a direct attack from either wing would cause a slaughterof our men that even success would not justify.  To turn theenemy by his right, between the two Annas is impossible onaccount of the swamp upon which his right rests.  To turn him bythe left leaves Little River, New Found River and South AnnaRiver, all of them streams presenting considerable obstacles tothe movement of our army, to be crossed.  I have determinedtherefore to turn the enemy's right by crossing at or nearHanover Town.  This crosses all three streams at once, andleaves us still where we can draw supplies.During the last night the teams and artillery not in position,belonging to the right wing of our army, and one division ofthat wing were quietly withdrawn to the north bank of the riverand moved down to the rear of the left.  As soon as it is darkthis division with most of the cavalry will commence a forcedmarch for Hanover Town to seize and hold the crossings.  Thebalance of the right wing will withdraw at the same hour, andfollow as rapidly as possible.  The left wing will also withdrawfrom the south bank of the river to-night and follow in rear ofthe right wing.  Lee's army is really whipped.  The prisoners wenow take show it, and the action of his army shows itunmistakably.  A battle with them outside of intrenchmentscannot be had.  Our men feel that they have gained the MORALEover the enemy, and attack him with confidence.  I may bemistaken, but I feel that our success over Lee's army is alreadyassured.  The promptness and rapidity with which you haveforwarded reinforcements has contributed largely to the feelingof confidence inspired in our men, and to break down that of theenemy.We are destroying all the rails we can on the Central andFredericksburg roads.  I want to leave a gap on the roads northof Richmond so big that to get a single track they will have toimport rail from elsewhere.  Even if a crossing is not effectedat Hanover Town it will probably be necessary for us to move ondown the Pamunkey until a crossing is effected.  I think itadvisable therefore to change our base of supplies from PortRoyal to the White House.  I wish you would direct this changeat once, and also direct Smith to put the railroad bridge therein condition for crossing troops and artillery and leave men tohold it.U. S. GRANT,Lieut.-General.(*33) NEAR COLD HARBOR, June 3, 1864, 7 A.M.MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,Commanding A. P.The moment it becomes certain that an assault cannot succeed,suspend the offensive; but when one does succeed, push itvigorously and if necessary pile in troops at the successfulpoint from wherever they can be taken.  I shall go to where youare in the course of an hour.U. S. GRANT,Lieut.-General.(*34) COLD HARBOR, June 5,1864.MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Chief of Staff of the Army, Washington,D. C.A full survey of all the ground satisfies me that it would beimpracticable to hold a line north-east of Richmond that wouldprotect the Fredericksburg Railroad to enable us to use thatroad for supplying the army.  To do so would give us a longvulnerable line of road to protect, exhausting much of ourstrength to guard it, and would leave open to the enemy all ofhis lines of communication on the south side of the James.  Myidea from the start has been to beat Lee's army if possiblenorth of Richmond; then after destroying his lines ofcommunication on the north side of the James River to transferthe army to the south side and besiege Lee in Richmond, orfollow him south if he should retreat.I now find, after over thirty days of trial, the enemy deems itof the first importance to run no risks with the armies they nowhave.  They act purely on the defensive behind breastworks, orfeebly on the offensive immediately in front of them, and wherein case of repulse they can instantly retire behind them.Without a greater sacrifice of human life than I am willing tomake all cannot be accomplished that I had designed outside ofthe city.  I have therefore resolved upon the following plan:I will continue to hold substantially the ground now occupied bythe Army of the Potomac, taking advantage of any favorablecircumstance that may present itself until the cavalry can besent west to destroy the Virginia Central Railroad from aboutBeaver Dam for some twenty-five or thirty miles west.  When thisis effected I will move the army to the south side of the JamesRiver, either by crossing the Chickahominy and marching near toCity Point, or by going to the mouth of the Chickahominy onnorth side and crossing there.  To provide for this last andmost possible contingency, several ferry-boats of the largestclass ought to be immediately provided.Once on the south side of the James River, I can cut off allsources of supply to the enemy except what is furnished by thecanal.  If Hunter succeeds in reaching Lynchburg, that will belost to him also.  Should Hunter not succeed, I will still makethe effort to destroy the canal by sending cavalry up the southside of the river with a pontoon train to cross wherever theycan.The feeling of the two armies now seems to be that the rebelscan protect themselves only by strong intrenchments, whilst ourarmy is not only confident of protecting itself withoutintrenchments, but that it can beat and drive the enemy whereverand whenever he can be found without this protection.U. S. GRANT,Lieutenant-General.(*35) COLD HARBOR, VA., June 6, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL D. HUNTERCommanding Dept. W. Va.General Sheridan leaves here to-morrow morning, withinstructions to proceed to Charlottesville, Va., and to commencethere the destruction of the Va. Cen. R. R., destroying this wayas much as possible.  The complete destruction of this road andof the canal on James River is of great importance to us.According to the instructions I sent to General Halleck for yourguidance, you were to proceed to Lynchburg and commence there. Itwould be of great value to us to get possession of Lynchburg fora single day.  But that point is of so much importance to theenemy, that in attempting to get it such resistance may be metas to defeat your getting onto the road or canal at all.  I see,in looking over the letter to General Halleck on the subject ofyour instructions, that it rather indicates that your routeshould be from Staunton via Charlottesville.  If you have sounderstood it, you will be doing just what I want.  Thedirection I would now give is, that if this letter reaches youin the valley between Staunton and Lynchburg, you immediatelyturn east by the most practicable road.  From thence moveeastward along the line of the road, destroying it completelyand thoroughly, until you join General Sheridan.  After the worklaid out for General Sheridan and yourself is thoroughly done,proceed to join the Army of the Potomac by the route laid out inGeneral Sheridan's instructions.If any portion of your force, especially your cavalry, is neededback in your Department, you are authorized to send it back.If on receipt of this you should be near to Lynchburg and deemit practicable to detach a cavalry force to destroy the canal.Lose no opportunity to destroy the canal.U.

They no doubtexpected troops from north of the James River to take theirplace before we discovered it.  General Butler took advantage ofthis and moved a force at once upon the railroad and plank roadbetween Richmond and Petersburg, which I hope to retainpossession of.Too much credit cannot be given to the troops and theircommanders for the energy and fortitude displayed during thelast five days.  Day and night has been all the same, no delaysbeing allowed on any account.U. S. GRANT,Lieut.-General.(*38) CITY POINT, VA., July 24, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,Commanding, etc.The engineer officers who made a survey of the front fromBermuda Hundred report against the probability of success froman attack there.  The chances they think will be better onBurnside's front.  If this is attempted it will be necessary toconcentrate all the force possible at the point in the enemy'sline we expect to penetrate.  All officers should be fullyimpressed with the absolute necessity of pushing entirely beyondthe enemy's present line, if they should succeed in penetratingit, and of getting back to their present line promptly if theyshould not succeed in breaking through.To the right and left of the point of assault all the artillerypossible should be brought to play upon the enemy in frontduring the assault.  Their lines would be sufficient for thesupport of the artillery, and all the reserves could be broughton the flanks of their commands nearest to the point of assault,ready to follow in if successful.  The field artillery andinfantry held in the lines during the first assault should be inreadiness to move at a moment's notice either to their front orto follow the main assault, as they should receive orders.  Onething, however, should be impressed on corps commanders.  Ifthey see the enemy giving away on their front or moving from itto reinforce a heavily assaulted portion of their line, theyshould take advantage of such knowledge and act promptly withoutwaiting for orders from army commanders.  General Ord canco-operate with his corps in this movement, and about fivethousand troops from Bermuda Hundred can be sent to reinforceyou or can be used to threaten an assault between the Appomattoxand James rivers, as may be deemed best.This should be done by Tuesday morning, if done at all.  If notattempted, we will then start at the date indicated to destroythe railroad as far as Hicksford at least, and to Weldon ifpossible.        *        *        *        *        *        *        *Whether we send an expedition on the road or assault atPetersburg, Burnside's mine will be blown up....U.

After the repulse of Hood atFranklin, it looks to me that instead of falling back toNashville we should have taken the offensive against the enemywhere he was.  At this distance, however, I may err as to thebest method of dealing with the enemy.  You will now sufferincalculable injury upon your railroads if Hood is not speedilydisposed of.  Put forth therefore every possible exertion toattain this end.  Should you get him to retreating give him nopeace.U. S.

It looks to me evident theenemy are trying to cross the Cumberland River, and arescattered.  Why not attack at once?  By all means avoid thecontingency of a foot race to see which, you or Hood, can beatto the Ohio.  If you think necessary call on the governors ofStates to send a force into Louisville to meet the enemy if heshould cross the river.  You clearly never should cross exceptin rear of the enemy.  Now is one of the finest opportunitiesever presented of destroying one of the three armies of theenemy.  If destroyed he never can replace it.

Letthere be no further delay.  Hood cannot even stand a drawnbattle so far from his supplies of ordnance stores.  If heretreats and you follow, he must lose his material and much ofhis army.  I am in hopes of receiving a dispatch from you to-dayannouncing that you have moved.  Delay no longer for weather orreinforcements.U. S. GRANT,Lieutenant-General.WASHINGTON, D.

After such alteration it was handed to GeneralLee, who put on his glasses, read it, and handed it back toGeneral Grant.  The original was then transcribed by GeneralParker upon official headed paper and a copy furnished GeneralLee.The fac-simile herewith shows the color of the paper of theoriginal document and all interlineations and erasures.There is a popular error to the effect that Generals Grant andLee each signed the articles of surrender.  The document in theform of a letter was signed only by General Grant, in the parlorof McLean's house while General Lee was sitting in the room, andGeneral Lee immediately wrote a letter accepting the terms andhanded it to General Grant.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Personal Memoirs of U.

It is an imperative duty, because it must be performed atonce, for otherwise it will be too late. Every possible means ofpreservation,--sentimental, educational and legislative,--must beemployed.The present warning issues with no uncertain sound, because this greatbattle for preservation and conservation cannot be won by gentle tones,nor by appeals to the aesthetic instincts of those who have no sense ofbeauty, or enjoyment of Nature. It is necessary to sound a loud alarm,to present the facts in very strong language, backed up by irrefutablestatistics and by photographs which tell no lies, to establish the lawand enforce it if needs be with a bludgeon.This book is such an alarm call. Its forceful pages remind me of thesounding of the great bells in the watch-towers of the cities of theMiddle Ages which called the citizens to arms to protect their homes,their liberties and their happiness. It is undeniable that the welfareand happiness of our own and of all future generations of Americans areat stake in this battle for the preservation of Nature against theselfishness, the ignorance, or the cruelty of her destroyers.We no longer destroy great works of art. They are treasured, andregarded as of priceless value; but we have yet to attain the state ofcivilization where the destruction of a glorious work of Nature, whetherit be a cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird, is regardedwith equal abhorrence. The whole earth is a poorer place to live in whena colony of exquisite egrets or birds of paradise is destroyed in orderthat the plumes may decorate the hat of some lady of fashion, andultimately find their way into the rubbish heap. The people of all theNew England States are poorer when the ignorant whites, foreigners, ornegroes of our southern states destroy the robins and other song birdsof the North for a mess of pottage.Travels through Europe, as well as over a large part of the NorthAmerican continent, have convinced me that nowhere is Nature beingdestroyed so rapidly as in the United States. Except within ourconservation areas, an earthly paradise is being turned into an earthlyhades; and it is not savages nor primitive men who are doing this, butmen and women who boast of their civilization. Air and water arepolluted, rivers and streams serve as sewers and dumping grounds,forests are swept away and fishes are driven from the streams. Manybirds are becoming extinct, and certain mammals are on the verge ofextermination. Vulgar advertisements hide the landscape, and in allthat disfigures the wonderful heritage of the beauty of Nature to-day,we Americans are in the lead.Fortunately the tide of destruction is ebbing, and the tide ofconservation is coming in. Americans are practical. Like all othernorthern peoples, they love money and will sacrifice much for it, butthey are also full of idealism, as well as of moral and spiritualenergy. The influence of the splendid body of Americans and Canadianswho have turned their best forces of mind and language into literatureand into political power for the conservation movement, is becomingstronger every day. Yet we are far from the point where the momentum ofconservation is strong enough to arrest and roll back the tide ofdestruction; and this is especially true with regard to our fastvanishing animal life.The facts and figures set forth in this volume will astonish all thoselovers of Nature and friends of the animal world who are living in afalse or imaginary sense of security. The logic of these facts isinexorable. As regards our birds and mammals, the failures of supposedprotection in America--under a system of free shooting--are so glaringthat we are confident this exposure will lead to sweeping reforms. Theauthor of this work is no amateur in the field of wild-life protection.His ideas concerning methods of reform are drawn from long andsuccessful experience. The states which are still behind in thismovement may well give serious heed to his summons, and pass the newlaws that are so urgently demanded to save the vanishing remnant.The New York Zoological Society, which is cooperating with many otherorganizations in this great movement, sends forth this work in thebelief that there is no one who is more ardently devoted to the greatcause or rendering more effective service in it than William T.Hornaday. We believe that this is a great book, destined to exert aworld-wide influence, to be translated into other languages, and toarouse the defenders and lovers of our vanishing animal life before itis too late.HENRY FAIRFIELD OSBORN,10 December, 1912. _President of the New York Zoological Society_       *        *        *        *        *PREFACEThe writing of this book has taught me many things. Beyond question, weare exterminating our finest species of mammals, birds and fishes_according to law!_I am appalled by the mass of evidence proving that throughout the entireUnited States and Canada, in every state and province, the existinglegal system for the preservation of wild life is fatally defective.There is not a single state in our country from which the killable gameis not being rapidly and persistently shot to death, legally orillegally, very much more rapidly than it is breeding, withextermination for the most of it close in sight. This statement is notopen to argument; for millions of men know that it is literally true. Weare living in a fool's paradise.The rage for wild-life slaughter is far more prevalent to-day throughoutthe world than it was in 1872, when the buffalo butchers paved theprairies of Texas and Colorado with festering carcasses. From one end ofour continent to the other, there is a restless, resistless desire to"kill, _kill!_"I have been shocked by the accumulation of evidence showing that allover our country and Canada fully nine-tenths of our protective lawshave practically been dictated by the killers of the game, and that inall save a very few instances the hunters have been exceedingly carefulto provide "open seasons" for slaughter, as long as any game remains tokill!_And yet, the game of North America does not belong wholly andexclusively to the men who kill! The other ninety-seven per cent of thePeople have vested rights in it, far exceeding those of the three percent. Posterity has claims upon it that no honest man can ignore._I am now going to ask both the true sportsman and the people who do notkill wild things to awake, and do their plain duty in protecting andpreserving the game and other wild life which belongs partly to us, butchiefly to those who come after us. Can they be aroused, before it istoo late?The time to discuss tiresome academic theories regarding "bag limits"and different "open seasons" as being sufficient to preserve the game,has gone by! We have reached the point where the alternatives are _longclosed seasons or a gameless continent;_ and we must choose one or theother, speedily. A continent without wild life is like a forest with noleaves on the trees.The great increase in the slaughter of song birds for food, by thenegroes and poor whites of the South, has become an unbearable scourgeto our migratory birds,--the very birds on which farmers north and southdepend for protection from the insect hordes,--the very birds that aremost near and dear to the people of the North. _Song-bird slaughter isgrowing and spreading_, with the decrease of the game birds! It is amatter that requires instant attention and stern repression. At thepresent moment it seems that the only remedy lies in federal protectionfor all migratory birds,--because so many states will not do their duty.We are weary of witnessing the greed, selfishness and cruelty of"civilized" man toward the wild creatures of the earth. We are sick oftales of slaughter and pictures of carnage. It is time for a sweepingReformation; and that is precisely what we now demand.I have been a sportsman myself; but times have changed, and we mustchange also. When game was plentiful, I believed that it was right formen and boys to kill a limited amount of it for sport and for the table.But the old basis has been swept away by an Army of Destruction that nowis almost beyond all control. We must awake, and arouse to the newsituation, face it like men, and adjust our minds to the new conditions.The three million gunners of to-day must no longer expect or demand thesame generous hunting privileges that were right for hunters fifty yearsago, when game was fifty times as plentiful as it is now and there wasonly one killer for every fifty now in the field.The fatalistic idea that bag-limit laws can save the game is to-day _thecurse of all our game birds, mammals and fishes!_ It is a fraud, adelusion and a snare. That miserable fetish has been worshipped much toolong. Our game is being exterminated, everywhere, by blind insistenceupon "open seasons," and solemn reliance upon "legal bag-limits." If amajority of the people of America feel that so long as there is any gamealive there must be an annual two months or four months open season forits slaughter, then assuredly we soon will have a gameless continent.The only thing that will save the game is by stopping the killing of it!In establishing and promulgating this principle, the cause of wild-lifeprotection greatly needs three things: money, labor, and publicity. Withthe first, we can secure the second and third. But can we get it,--and_get it in time to save?_This volume is in every sense a contribution to a Cause; and as such itever will remain. I wish the public to receive it on that basis. So muchimportant material has drifted straight to it from other hands that thisunexpected aid seems to the author like a good omen.The manuscript has received the benefit of a close and critical readingand correcting by my comrade on the firing-line and esteemed friend, Mr.Madison Grant, through which the text was greatly improved. But for thesplendid encouragement and assistance that I have received from him andfrom Professor Henry Fairneld Osborn the work involved would have bornedown rather heavily.The four chapters embracing the "New Laws Needed; A Roll-Call of theStates," were critically inspected, corrected and brought down to dateby Dr. T.S. Palmer, our highest authority on the game laws of the Nationand the States. For this valuable service the author is deeply grateful.Of course the author is alone responsible for all the opinions andconclusions herein recorded, and for all errors that appear outside ofquotations.I trust that the Reader will kindly excuse and forget all thetypographic and clerical errors that may have escaped me in the rushthat had to be made against Time.W.T.H.UNIVERSITY HEIGHTS, NEW YORK,December 1, 1912.       *        *        *        *        *CONTENTSPART I.--EXTERMINATIONChapterI.

EXTERMINATIONCHAPTER ITHE FORMER ABUNDANCE OF WILD LIFE_"By my labors my vineyard flourished. But Ahab came. Alas! for Naboth."_In order that the American people may correctly understand and judge thequestion of the extinction or preservation of our wild life, it isnecessary to recall the near past. It is not necessary, however, to gofar into the details of history; for a few quick glances at a few highpoints will be quite sufficient for the purpose in view.Any man who reads the books which best tell the story of the developmentof the American colonies of 1712 into the American nation of 1912, andtakes due note of the wild-life features of the tale, will say withouthesitation that when the American people received this land from thebountiful hand of Nature, it was endowed with a magnificent andall-pervading supply of valuable wild creatures. The pioneers and theearly settlers were too busy even to take due note of that fact, or tocomment upon it, save in very fragmentary ways.Nevertheless, the wild-life abundance of early American days surviveddown to so late a period that it touched the lives of millions of peoplenow living. Any man 55 years of age who when a boy had a taste for"hunting,"--for at that time there were no "sportsmen" in America,--willremember the flocks and herds of wild creatures that he saw and whichmade upon his mind many indelible impressions."Abundance" is the word with which to describe the original animal lifethat stocked our country, and all North America, only a shorthalf-century ago. Throughout every state, on every shore-line, in allthe millions of fresh water lakes, ponds and rivers, on every mountainrange, in every forest, _and even on every desert_, the wild flocks andherds held sway. It was impossible to go beyond the settled haunts ofcivilized man and escape them.It was a full century after the complete settlement of New England andthe Virginia colonies that the wonderful big-game fauna of the greatplains and Rocky Mountains was really discovered; but the bisonmillions, the antelope millions, the mule deer, the mountain sheep andmountain goat were there, all the time. In the early days, the millionsof pinnated grouse and quail of the central states attracted no seriousattention from the American people-at-large; but they lived andflourished just the same, far down in the seventies, when the greedymarket gunners systematically slaughtered them, and barreled them up for"the market," while the foolish farmers calmly permitted them to do it.We obtain the best of our history of the former abundance of NorthAmerican wild life first from the pages of Audubon and Wilson; next,from the records left by such pioneers as Lewis and Clark, and last fromthe testimony of living men. To all this we can, many of us, addobservations of our own.To me the most striking fact that stands forth in the story of Americanwild life one hundred years ago is the wide extent and thoroughness ofits distribution. Wide as our country is, and marvelous as it is in thediversity of its climates, its soils, its topography, its flora, itsriches and its poverty, Nature gave to each square mile and to each acrea generous quota of wild creatures, according to its ability to maintainliving things. No pioneer ever pushed so far, or into regions sodifficult or so remote, that he did not find awaiting him a host ofbirds and beasts. Sometimes the pioneer was not a good hunter; usuallyhe was a stupid fisherman; but the "game" was there, nevertheless. Thetime was when every farm had its quota.The part that the wild life of America played in the settlement anddevelopment of this continent was so far-reaching in extent, and soenormous in potential value, that it fairly staggers the imagination.From the landing of the Pilgrims down to the present hour the wild gamehas been the mainstay and the resource against starvation of thepathfinder, the settler, the prospector, and at times even therailroad-builder. In view of what the bison millions did for theDakotas, Montana, Wyoming, Kansas and Texas, it is only right and squarethat those states should now do something for the perpetual preservationof the bison species and all other big game that needs help.For years and years, the antelope millions of the Montana and Wyominggrass-lands fed the scout and Indian-fighter, freighter, cowboy andsurveyor, ranchman _and sheep-herder_; but thus far I have yet to hearof one Western state that has ever spent one penny directly for thepreservation of the antelope! And to-day we are in a hand-to-hand fightin Congress, and in Montana, with the Wool-Growers Association, whichmaintains in Washington a keen lobbyist to keep aloft the tariff onwool, and prevent Congress from taking 15 square miles of grass lands onSnow Creek, Montana, for a National Antelope Preserve. All that thewool-growers want is the entire earth, all to themselves. Mr. McClure,the Secretary of the Association says:"The proper place in which to preserve the big game of the West is incity parks, where it can be protected."To the colonist of the East and pioneer of the West, the white-taileddeer was an ever present help in time of trouble. Without thisomnipresent animal, and the supply of good meat that each white flagrepresented, the commissariat difficulties of the settlers who won thecountry as far westward as Indiana would have been many times greaterthan they were. The backwoods Pilgrim's progress was like this:Trail, deer; cabin, deer; clearing; bear, corn, deer; hogs, deer;cattle, wheat, independence.And yet, how many men are there to-day, out of our ninety millions ofAmericans and pseudo-Americans, who remember with any feeling ofgratitude the part played in American history by the white-tailed deer?Very few! How many Americans are there in our land who now preserve thatdeer for sentimental reasons, and because his forbears werenation-builders? As a matter of fact, are there any?On every eastern pioneer's monument, the white-tailed deer shouldfigure; and on those of the Great West, the bison and the antelopeshould be cast in enduring bronze, "_lest we forget!_"The game birds of America played a different part from that of the deer,antelope and bison. In the early days, shotguns were few, and shot wasscarce and dear. The wild turkey and goose were the smallest birds onwhich a rifleman could afford to expend a bullet and a whole charge ofpowder. It was for this reason that the deer, bear, bison, and elkdisappeared from the eastern United States while the game birds yetremained abundant. With the disappearance of the big game came the fatsteer, hog and hominy, the wheat-field, fruit orchard and poultrygalore.The game birds of America, as a class and a mass, have not been sweptaway to ward off starvation or to rescue the perishing. Even back in thesixties and seventies, very, very few men of the North thought ofkilling prairie chickens, ducks and quail, snipe and woodcock, in orderto keep the hunger wolf from the door. The process was too slow anduncertain; and besides, the really-poor man rarely had the gun andammunition. Instead of attempting to live on birds, he hustled for thestaple food products that the soil of his own farm could produce.First, last and nearly all the time, the game birds of the United Statesas a whole, have been sacrificed on the altar of Rank Luxury, to temptappetites that were tired of fried chicken and other farm delicacies.To-day, even the average poor man hunts birds for the joy of the outing,and the pampered epicures of the hotels and restaurants buy game birds,and eat small portions of them, solely to tempt jaded appetites. Ifthere is such a thing as "class" legislation, it is that which permits afew sordid market-shooters to slaughter the birds of the whole people inorder to sell them to a few epicures.The game of a state belongs to the whole people of the state. TheSupreme Court of the United States has so decided. (Geer vs.Connecticut). If it is abundant, it is a valuable asset. The great valueof the game birds of America lies not in their meat pounds as they lieupon the table, but in the temptation they annually put before millionsof field-weary farmers and desk-weary clerks and merchants to get intotheir beloved hunting togs, stalk out into the lap of Nature, and say"Begone, dull Care!"And the man who has had a fine day in the painted woods, on the brightwaters of a duck-haunted bay, or in the golden stubble of September, canfill his day and his soul with six good birds just as well as withsixty. The idea that in order to enjoy a fine day in the open a man mustkill a wheel-barrow load of birds, is a mistaken idea; and ifobstinately adhered to, it becomes vicious! The Outing in the Open isthe thing,--not the blood-stained feathers, nasty viscera and Death inthe game-bag. One quail on a fence is worth more to the world than tenin a bag.The farmers of America have, by their own supineness and lack offoresight, permitted the slaughter of a stock of game birds which, hadit been properly and wisely conserved, would have furnished a goodannual shoot to every farming man and boy of sporting instincts throughthe past, right down to the present, and far beyond. They have allowedmillions of dollars worth of _their_ birds to be coolly snatched awayfrom them by the greedy market-shooters.There is one state in America, and so far as I know _only one_, in whichthere is at this moment an old-time abundance of game-bird life. That isthe state of Louisiana. The reason is not so very far to seek. For thebirds that do not migrate,--quail, wild turkeys and doves,--the cover isyet abundant. For the migratory game birds of the Mississippi Valley,Louisiana is a grand central depot, with terminal facilities that areunsurpassed. Her reedy shores, her vast marshes, her long coast line andabundance of food furnish what should be not only a haven but a heavenfor ducks and geese. After running the gauntlet of guns all the way fromManitoba and Ontario to the Sunk Lands of Arkansas, the shores of theGulf must seem like heaven itself.The great forests of Louisiana shelter deer, turkeys, and fur-bearinganimals galore; and rabbits and squirrels abound.Naturally, this abundance of game has given rise to an extensiveindustry in shooting for the market. The "big interests" outside thestate send their agents into the best game districts, often bringing intheir own force of shooters. They comb out the game in enormousquantities, without leaving to the people of Louisiana any decent andfair quid-pro-quo for having despoiled them of their game and shipped avast annual product outside, to create wealth elsewhere.At present, however, we are but incidentally interested in theshort-sightedness of the people of the Pelican State. As a state ofoldtime abundance in killable game, the killing records that were keptin the year 1909-10 possess for us very great interest. They throw astartling searchlight on the subject of this chapter,--the formerabundance of wild life.From the records that with great pains and labor were gathered by theState Game Commission, and which were furnished me for use here byPresident Frank M. Miller, we set forth this remarkable exhibit ofold-fashioned abundance in game, A.D. 1909.       *        *        *        *        *OFFICIAL RECORD OF GAME KILLED IN LOUISIANA DURING THE SEASON (12MONTHS) OF 1909-10BIRDSWild Ducks, sea and river             3,176,000Coots                                   280,740Geese and Brant                         202,210Snipe, Sandpiper and Plover             606,635Quail (Bob-White)                     1,140,750Doves                                   310,660Wild Turkeys                              2,219                                     ----------  Total number of game birds killed   5,719,214MAMMALSDeer                                      5,470Squirrels and Rabbits                   690,270                                     ----------  Total of game mammals                 695,740Fur-bearing mammals                   1,971,922                                     ----------  Total of mammals                    2,667,662                                     ----------  Grand total of birds and mammals    8,386,876       *        *        *        *        *Of the thousands of slaughtered robins, it would seem that no recordsexist. It is to be understood that the annual slaughter of wild life inLouisiana never before reached such a pitch as now. Without drasticmeasures, what will be the inevitable result? Does any man suppose thateven the wild millions of Louisiana can long withstand such slaughter asthat shown by the official figures given above? It is wildly impossible.But the darkest hour is just before the dawn. At the session of theLouisiana legislature that was held in the spring of 1912, greatimprovements were made in the game laws of that state. The mostimportant feature was the suppression of wholesale market hunting, bypersons who are not residents of the state. A very limited amount ofgame may be sold and served as food in public places, but therestrictions placed upon this traffic are so effective that they willvastly reduce the annual slaughter. In other respects, also, the causeof wild life protection gained much; for which great credit is due toMr. Edward A. McIlhenny.It is the way of Americans to feel that because game is abundant in agiven place at a given time, it always will be abundant, and maytherefore be slaughtered without limit. That was the case last winter inCalifornia during the awful slaughter of band-tailed pigeons, as will benoted elsewhere.It is time for all men to be told in the plainest terms that there neverhas existed, anywhere in historic times, a volume of wild life so greatthat civilized man could not quickly exterminate it by his methods ofdestruction. Lift the veil and look at the stories of the bison, thepassenger pigeon, the wild ducks and shore birds of the Atlantic coast,and the fur-seal.[Illustration: SHALL WE LEAVE ANY ONE OF THEM OPEN?]As reasoning beings, it is our duty to heed the lessons of history, andnot rush blindly on until we perpetrate a continent destitute of wildlife.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER IIEXTINCT SPECIES OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDSFor educated, civilized Man to exterminate a valuable wild species ofliving things is a crime. It is a crime against his own children, andposterity.No man has a right, either moral or legal, to destroy or squander aninheritance of his children that he holds for them in trust. And man,the wasteful and greedy spendthrift that he is, has not created even thehumblest of the species of birds, mammals and fishes that adorn andenrich this earth. "The earth is THE LORD'S, and the fulness thereof!"With all his wisdom, man has not evolved and placed here so much as aground-squirrel, a sparrow or a clam. It is true that he has juggledwith the wild horse and sheep, the goats and the swine, and producedsome hardy breeds that can withstand his abuse without going down beforeit; but as for species, he has not yet created and placed here even somuch as a protozoan.The wild things of this earth are _not_ ours, to do with as we please.They have been given to us _in trust_, and we must account for them tothe generations which will come after us and audit our accounts.But man, the shameless destroyer of Nature's gifts, blithely andpersistently exterminates one species after another. Fully ten per centof the human race consists of people who will lie, steal, throw rubbishin parks, and destroy forests and wild life whenever and wherever theycan do so without being stopped by a policemen and a club. These arehard words, but they are absolutely true. From ten per cent (or more) ofthe human race, the high moral instinct which is honest withoutcompulsion _is absent_. The things that seemingly decent citizens,--menposing as gentlemen,--will do to wild game when they secure greatchances to slaughter, are appalling. I could fill a book of this sizewith cases in point.To-day the women of England, Europe and elsewhere are directly promotingthe extermination of scores of beautiful species of wild birds by thedevilish persistence with which they buy and wear feather ornaments madeof their plumage. They are just as mean and cruel as the truck-driverwho drives a horse with a sore shoulder and beats him on the street. Butthey do it! And appeals to them to do otherwise they laugh to scorn,saying, "I will wear what is fashionable, when I please and where Iplease!" As a famous bird protector of England has just written me, "Thewomen of the smart set are beyond the reach of appeal or protest."To-day, the thing that stares me in the face every waking hour, like agrisly spectre with bloody fang and claw, is _the extermination ofspecies_. To me, that is a horrible thing. It is wholesale murder, noless. It is capital crime, and a black disgrace to the races ofcivilized mankind. I say "civilized mankind," because savages don't doit!There are three kinds of extermination:_The practical extermination of a species_ means the destruction of itsmembers to an extent so thorough and widespread that the speciesdisappears from view, and living specimens of it can not be found byseeking for them. In North America this is to-day the status of thewhooping crane, upland plover, and several other species. If anyindividuals are living, they will be met with only by accident._The absolute extermination_ of a species means that not one individualof it remains alive. Judgment to this effect is based upon the lapse oftime since the last living specimen was observed or killed. When fiveyears have passed without a living "record" of a wild specimen, it istime to place a species in the class of the totally extinct._Extermination in a wild state_ means that the only livingrepresentatives are in captivity or otherwise under protection. This isthe case of the heath hen and David's deer, of China. The American bisonis saved from being wholly extinct as a wild animal by the remnant ofabout 300 head in northern Athabasca, and 49 head in the Yellow-stonePark.It is a serious thing to exterminate a species of any of the vertebrateanimals. There are probably millions of people who do not realize thatcivilized (!) man is the most persistently and wickedly wasteful of allthe predatory animals. The lions, the tigers, the bears, the eagles andhawks, serpents, and the fish-eating fishes, all live by destroyinglife; but they kill only what they think they can consume. If somethingis by chance left over, it goes to satisfy the hunger of the humblercreatures of prey. _In a state of nature, where wild creatures prey uponwild creatures, such a thing as wanton, wholesale and utterly wastefulslaughter is almost unknown!_When the wild mink, weasel and skunk suddenly finds himself in the midstof scores of man's confined and helpless domestic fowls, or his cagedgulls in a zoological park, an unusual criminal passion to murder forthe joy of killing sometimes seizes the wild animal, and great slaughteris the result.From the earliest historic times, it has been the way of savage man,red, black, brown and yellow, to kill as the wild animals do,--only whathe can use, or _thinks_ he can use. The Cree Indian impounded smallherds of bison, and sometimes killed from 100 to 200 at one time; but itwas to make sure of having enough meat and hides, and because heexpected to use the product. I think that even the worst enemies of theplains Indians hardly will accuse them of killing large numbers ofbison, elk or deer merely for the pleasure of seeing them fall, ortaking only their teeth.[Illustration: SIX RECENTLY EXTERMINATED NORTH AMERICAN BIRDSGreat Auk             Labrador DuckEskimo Curlew         Pallas CormorantPassenger Pigeon      Carolina Parrakeet]It has remained for the wolf, the sheep-killing dog and civilized man tomake records of wanton slaughter which puts them in a class together,and quite apart from other predatory animals. When a man can kill bisonfor their tongues alone, bull elk for their "tusks" alone, and shoot awhole colony of hippopotami,--actually damming a river with theirbloated and putrid carcasses, all untouched by the knife,--the men whodo such things must be classed with the cruel wolf and the criminal dog.It is now desirable that we should pause in our career of destructionlong enough to look back upon what we have recently accomplished in thetotal extinction of species, and also note what we have blocked out forthe immediate future. Here let us erect a monument to the dead speciesof our own times.It is to be doubted whether, up to this hour, any man has made a list ofthe species of North American birds that have become extinct during thepast sixty years. The specialists have no time to spare from theircompound differential microscopes, and the bird-killers are too busywith shooting, netting and clubbing to waste any time on such trifles asexterminated species. What does a market-shooter care about birds thatcan not be killed a second time? As for the farmers, they are so busyraising hogs and prices that their best friends, the birds, get scantattention from them,--until a hen-hawk takes a chicken!Down South, the negroes and poor whites may slaughter robins for food bythe ten thousand; but does the northern farmer bother his head about atrifle of that kind? No, indeed. Will he contribute any real money tohelp put a stop to it? Ask him yourself.Let us pause long enough to reckon up some of our expenditures inspecies, and in millions of individuals. Let us set down here, in coldblood, a list of the species of our own North American birds that havebeen totally exterminated in our own times. After that we will havesomething to say about other species that soon will be exterminated; andthe second task is much greater than the first.       *        *        *        *        *ROLL CALL OF THE DEAD SPECIES OF AMERICAN BIRDSTHE GREAT AUK,--_Plautus-impennis_, (Linn.), was a sea-going diving birdabout the size of a domestic goose, related to the guillemots, murresand puffins. For a bird endowed only with flipper-like wings, andtherefore absolutely unable to fly, this species had an astonishinggeographic range. It embraced the shores of northern Europe to NorthCape, southern Greenland, southern Labrador, and the Atlantic coast ofNorth America as far south as Massachusetts. Some say, "as far south asMassachusetts, the Carolinas and Florida," but that is a large order,and I leave the A.O.U. to prove that if it can. In the life history ofthis bird, a great tragedy was enacted in 1800 by sailors, on FunkIsland, north of Newfoundland, where men were landed by a ship, andspent several months slaughtering great auks and trying out their fatfor oil. In this process, the bodies of thousands of auks were burned asfuel, in working up the remains of tens of thousands of others.On Funk Island, a favorite breeding-place, the great auk wasexterminated in 1840, and in Iceland in 1844. Many natives ate this birdwith relish, and being easily captured, either on land or sea, thecommercialism of its day soon obliterated the species. The last livingspecimen was seen in 1852, and the last dead one was picked up inTrinity Bay, Ireland, in 1853. There are about 80 mounted and unmountedskins in existence, four skeletons, and quite a number of eggs. An eggis worth about 1200 and a good mounted skin at least double that sum.THE LABRADOR DUCK,--_Camptorhynchus labradoricus_, (Gmel.).--Thishandsome sea-duck, of a species related to the eider ducks of arcticwaters, became totally extinct about 1875, before the scientific worldeven knew that its existence was threatened. With this species, theexact and final cause of its extinction is to this day unknown. It isnot at all probable, however, that its unfortunate blotting out from ourbird fauna was due to natural causes, and when the truth becomes known,it is very probable that the hand of man will be revealed.The Labrador duck bred in Labrador, and once frequented our Atlanticcoast as far south as Chesapeake Bay; but it is said that it never wasvery numerous, at least during the twenty-five years preceding itsdisappearance. About thirty-five skins and mounted museum specimens areall that remain to prove its former existence, and I think there is noteven one skeleton.THE PALLAS CORMORANT,--_Carbo perspicillatus_, (Pallas).--In 1741, whenthe Russian explorer, Commander Bering, discovered the Bering orCommander Islands, in the far-north Pacific, and landed upon them, healso discovered this striking bird species. Its plumage both above andbelow was a dark metallic green, with blue iridescence on the neck andpurple on the shoulders. A pale ring of naked skin around each eyesuggested the Latin specific name of this bird. The Pallas cormorantbecame totally extinct, through causes not positively known, about 1852.THE PASSENGER PIGEON,--_Ectopistes migratoria_, (Linn.).--We place thisbird in the totally-extinct class, not only because it is extinct in awild state, but only one solitary individual, a twenty-year-old femalein the Cincinnati Zoological Gardens, now remains alive. One livingspecimen and a few skins, skeletons and stuffed specimens are all thatremain to show for the uncountable millions of pigeons that swarmed overthe United States, only yesterday as it were!There is no doubt about where those millions have gone. They went downand out by systematic, wholesale slaughter for the market and the pot,before the shotguns, _clubs_ and _nets_ of the earliest Americanpot-hunters. Wherever they nested they were slaughtered.It is a long and shameful story, but the grisly skeleton of its Michiganchapter can be set forth in a few words. In 1869, from the town ofHartford, Mich., _three car loads_ of dead pigeons were shipped tomarket each day for _forty days_, making a total of 11,880,000 birds. Itis recorded that another Michigan town marketed 15,840,000 in two years.(See Mr. W.B. Mershon's book, "The Passenger Pigeon.")Alexander Wilson, the pioneer American ornithologist, was the man whoseriously endeavored to estimate by computations the total number ofpassenger pigeons in one flock that was seen by him. Here is what he hassaid in his "American Ornithology":"To form a rough estimate of the daily consumption of one of theseimmense flocks, let us first attempt to calculate the numbers of thatabove mentioned, as seen in passing between Frankfort and the Indianaterritory. If we suppose this column to have been one mile in breadth(and I believe it to have been much more) and that it moved at the rateof one mile in a minute, four hours, the time it continued passing,would make its whole length two hundred and forty miles. Again,supposing that each square yard of this moving body comprehended threepigeons; the square yards in the whole space multiplied by three wouldgive 2,230,272,000 pigeons! An almost inconceivable multitude, and yetprobably far below the actual amount."       *        *        *        *        *"Happening to go ashore one charming afternoon, to purchase some milk ata house that stood near the river, and while talking with the peoplewithin doors, I was suddenly struck with astonishment at a loud rushingroar, succeeded by instant darkness, which, on the first moment, I tookfor a tornado about to overwhelm the house and every thing around indestruction. The people observing my surprise, coolly said, 'It is onlythe pigeons!' On running out I beheld a flock, thirty or forty yards inwidth, sweeping along very low, between the house and the mountain orheight that formed the second bank of the river. These continued passingfor more than a quarter of an hour, and at length varied their bearingso as to pass over the mountains, behind which they disappeared beforethe rear came up."In the Atlantic States, though they never appear in such unparalleledmultitudes, they are sometimes very numerous; and great havoc is thenmade amongst them with the gun, the clap-net, and various otherimplements of destruction. As soon as it is ascertained in a town thatthe pigeons are flying numerously in the neighborhood, the gunners rise_en masse_; the clap-nets are spread out on suitable situations,commonly on an open height in an old buckwheat field, four or five livepigeons, _with their eyelids sewed up_,[A] are fastened on a movablestick, a small hut of branches is fitted up for the fowler at thedistance of forty or fifty yards. By the pulling of a string, the stickon which the pigeons rest is alternately elevated and depressed, whichproduces a fluttering of their wings, similar to that of birdsalighting. This being perceived by the passing flocks, they descend withgreat rapidity, and finding corn, buckwheat, etc, strewed about, beginto feed, and are instantly, by the pulling of a cord, covered by thenet. In this manner ten, twenty, and even thirty dozen have been caughtat one sweep. Meantime the air is darkened with large bodies of themmoving in various directions; the woods also swarm with them in searchof acorns, and the thundering of musquetry is perpetual on all sidesfrom morning to night. Wagon loads of them are poured into market, wherethey sell from fifty to twenty-five and even twelve cents per dozen; andpigeons become the order of the day at dinner, breakfast and supper,until the very name becomes sickening."[Footnote A: To-day, we think that the fowlers of the roccolos ofnorthern Italy are very cruel in their methods of catching song-birdswholesale for the market (chapter xi); but our own countrymen ofWilson's day were just as cruel in the method described above.]       *        *        *        *        *The range of the passenger pigeon covered nearly the whole UnitedStates from the Atlantic coast westward to the Rocky Mountains. A fewbold pigeons crossed the Rocky Mountains into Oregon, northernCalifornia and Washington, but only as "stragglers," few and farbetween. The wide range of this bird was worthy of a species thatexisted in millions, and it was persecuted literally all along the line.The greatest slaughter was in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In 1848Massachusetts gravely passed a law protecting the _netters_ of wildpigeons from foreign interference! There was a fine of 10 for damagingnets, or frightening pigeons away from them. This was on the theory thatthe pigeons were so abundant they could not by any possibility everbecome scarce, and that pigeon-slaughter was a legitimate industry.In 1867, the State of New York found that the wild pigeon neededprotection, and enacted a law to that effect. The year 1868 was the lastyear in which great numbers of passenger pigeons nested in that State.Eaton, in "The Birds of New York," said that "millions of birds occupiedthe timber along Bell's Run, near Ceres, Alleghany County, on thePennsylvania line."In 1870, Massachusetts gave pigeons protection except during an "openseason," and in 1878 Pennsylvania elected to protect pigeons on theirnesting grounds.The passenger pigeon millions were destroyed so quickly, and sothoroughly _en masse_, that the American people utterly failed tocomprehend it, and for thirty years obstinately refused to believe thatthe species had been suddenly wiped off the map of North America. Therewas years of talk about the great flocks having "taken refuge in SouthAmerica," or in Mexico, and being still in existence. There weresurmises about their having all "gone out to sea," and perished on thebriny deep.A thousand times, at least, wild pigeons have been "reported" as havingbeen "seen." These rumors have covered nearly every northern state, thewhole of the southwest, and California. For years and years we have beenpatiently writing letters to explain over and over that the band-tailedpigeon of the Pacific coast, and the red-billed pigeon of Arizona andthe southwest are neither of them the passenger pigeon, and never canbe.There was a long period wherein we believed many of the pigeon reportsthat came from the states where the birds once were most numerous; butthat period has absolutely passed. During the past five years large cashrewards, aggregating about 5000, have been offered for the discoveryof one nesting pair of genuine passenger pigeons. Many persons haveclaimed this reward (of Professor C.F. Hodge, of Clark University,Worcester, Mass.), and many claims have been investigated. The resultshave disclosed many _mourning doves_, but not one pigeon. Now weunderstand that the quest is closed, and hope has been abandoned.The passenger pigeon is a dead species. The last wild specimen (so webelieve) that ever will reach the hands of man, was taken near Detroit,Michigan, on Sept. 14, 1908, and mounted by C. Campion. That is the onedefinite, positive record of the past ten years.The fate of this species should be a lasting lesson to the world atlarge. Any wild bird or mammal species can be exterminated by commercialinterests in twenty years time, or less.THE ESKIMO CURLEW,_--Numenius borealis_, (Forst.). This valuable gamebird once ranged all along the Atlantic coast of North America, andwherever found it was prized for the table. It preferred the fields andmeadows to the shore lines, and was the companion of the plovers of theuplands, especially the golden plover. "About 1872," says Mr. Forbush,"there was a great flight of these birds on Cape Cod and Nantucket. Theywere everywhere; and enormous numbers were killed. They could be boughtof boys at six cents apiece. Two men killed 300 worth of these birds atthat time."Apparently, that was the beginning of the end of the "dough bird," whichwas another name for this curlew. In 1908 Mr. G.H. Mackay stated thatthis bird and the golden plover had decreased 90 per cent in fiftyyears, and in the last ten years of that period 90 per cent of theremainder had gone. "Now (1908)," says Mr. Forbush, "ornithologistsbelieve that the Eskimo curlew is practically extinct, as only a fewspecimens have been recorded since the beginning of the twentiethcentury." The very last record is of two specimens collected at Waco,York County, Nebraska, in March, 1911, and recorded by Mr. August Eiche.Of course, it is possible that other individuals may still survive; butso far as our knowledge extends, the species is absolutely dead.       *        *        *        *        *In the West Indies and the Guadeloupe Islands, five species of macawsand parrakeets have passed out without any serious note of theirdisappearance on the part of the people of the United States. It is atleast time to write brief obituary notices of them.We are indebted to the Hon. Walter Rothschild, of Tring, England, foressential facts regarding these species as set forth in his sumptuouswork "Extinct Birds".THE CUBAN TRICOLORED MACAW,--_Ara tricolor_, (Gm.). In 1875, when theauthor visited Cuba and the Isle of Pines, he was informed by ProfessorPoey that he was "about ten years too late" to find this fine speciesalive. It was exterminated for food purposes, about 1864, and only fourspecimens are known to be in existence.[Illustration SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF THE NORTH AMERICANGreat AukPallas CormorantLabrador DuckPassenger PigeonEskimo CurlewCuban Tricolor MacawGosse's MacawGuadeloupe MacawYellow Winged Green ParrotPurple Guadaloupe ParakeetCarolina ParakeetEXTERMINATED BY CIVILIZED MAN 1840-1910]GOSSE'S MACAW,--_Ara gossei_, (Roth.).--This species once inhabited theIsland of Jamaica. It was exterminated about 1800, and so far as knownnot one specimen of it is in existence.GUADELOUPE MACAW,--_Ara guadeloupensis_, (Clark).--All that is known ofthe life history of this large bird is that once it inhabited theGuadeloupe Islands. The date and history of its disappearance are bothunknown, and there is not one specimen of it in existence.YELLOW-WINGED GREEN PARROT,--_Amazona olivacea_, (Gm.).--Of the historyof this Guadeloupe species, also, nothing is known, and there appear tobe no specimens of it in existence.PURPLE GUADELOUPE PARRAKEET,--_Anodorhynchus purpurescens_,(Rothschild).--This is another dead species, that once lived in theGuadeloupe Islands, and passed away silently and unnoticed at the time,leaving no records of its existence, and no specimens.THE CAROLINA PARRAKEET,--_Conuropsis carolinensis_, (Linn.), brings usdown to the present moment. To this charming little green-and-yellowbird, we are in the very act of bidding everlasting farewell. Tenspecimens remain alive in captivity, six of which are in the CincinnatiZoological Garden, three are in the Washington Zoological Park and oneis in the New York Zoological Park.Regarding wild specimens, it is possible that some yet remain, in someobscure and _neglected_ corner of Florida; but it is extremely doubtfulwhether the world ever will find any of them alive. Mrs. Minnie MooreWillson, of Kissimee, Fla. reports the species as totally extinct inFlorida. Unless we would strain at a gnat, we may just as well enterthis species in the dead class; for there is no reason to hope that anymore wild specimens ever will be found.The former range of this species embraced the whole southeastern andcentral United States. From the Gulf it extended to Albany, N.Y.,northern Ohio and Indiana, northern Iowa, Nebraska, central Colorado andeastern Texas, from which it will be seen that once it was widelydistributed. It was shot because it was destructive to fruit and for itsplumage, and many were trapped alive, to be kept in captivity. I knowthat one colony, near the mouth of the Sebastian River, east coast ofFlorida, was exterminated in 1898 by a local hunter, and I regret to saythat it was done in the hope of selling the living birds to a New Yorkbird-dealer. By holding bags over the holes in which the birds werenesting, the entire colony, of about 16 birds, was caught.Everywhere else than in Florida, the Carolina parrakeet has long beenextinct. In 1904 a flock of 13 birds was seen near Lake Okechobee; butin Florida many calamities can overtake a flock of birds in eight years.The birds in captivity are not breeding, and so far as perpetuation bythem is concerned, they are only one remove from mounted museumspecimens. This parrakeet is the only member of its order that rangedinto the United States during our own times, and with its disappearancethe Order Psittaciformes totally disappears from our country.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER IIITHE NEXT CANDIDATES FOR OBLIVIONIn the world of human beings, murder is the most serious of all crimes.To take from a man that which no one ever can restore to him, his life,is murder; and its penalty is the most severe of all penalties.There are circumstances under which the killing of a wild animal may beso wanton, so revolting and so utterly reprehensible that the act mayjustly be classed as murder. The man who kills a walrus from the deck ofa steamer that he knows will not stop; the man who wantonly killed thewhole colony of hippopotami that Mr. Dugmore photographed in life; theman who last winter shot bull elk in Wyoming for their two ugly andshapeless teeth, and the man who wantonly shot down a half-tame deer"for fun" near Carmel, Putnam County, New York, in the summer of1912,--all were guilty of _murdering_ wild animals.The murder of a wild animal species consists in taking from it thatwhich man with all his cunning and all his preserves and breeding cannot give back to it,--its God-given place in the ranks of Living Things.Where is man's boasted intelligence, or his sense of proportion, thatevery man does not see the monstrous moral obliquity involved in thedestruction of a species!If the beautiful Taj Mehal at Agra should be destroyed by vandals, theintelligent portion of humanity would be profoundly shocked, even thoughthe hand of man could at will restore the shrine of sorrowing love.To-day the great Indian rhinoceros, certainly one of the most wonderfulfour-footed animals still surviving, is actually being exterminated; andeven the people of India and England are viewing it with an indifferencethat is appalling. Of course there are among Englishmen a great manysportsmen and several zoologists who really care; but they do notconstitute one-tenth of one per-cent of the men who ought to care!In the museums, we stand in awe and wonder before the fossil skeleton ofthe Megatherium, and the savants struggle to unveil its past, while theequally great and marvelous _Rhinoceros indicus_ is being rushed intooblivion. We marvel at the fossil shell of the gigantic turtle called_Collosochelys atlas_, while the last living representatives of thegigantic land tortoises are being exterminated in the Galapagos Islandsand the Sychelles, for their paltry oil and meat; and only one man (Hon.Walter Rothschild) is doing aught to save any of them in their haunts,where they can breed. The dodo of Mauritius was exterminated by swine,whose bipedal descendants have exterminated many other species sincethat time.A failure to appreciate either the beauty or the value of our livingbirds, quadrupeds and fishes is the hall-mark of arrested mentaldevelopment and ignorance. The victim is _not always to blame_; but inthis practical world the cornerstone of legal jurisprudence is theinexorable principle that "ignorance of the law excuses no man."These pages are addressed to my countrymen, and the world at large, notas a reproach upon the dead Past which is gone beyond recall, but in thefaint hope of somewhere and somehow arousing forces that will reform thePresent and save the Future. The extermination of wild species that nowis proceeding throughout the world, is a dreadful thing. It is not onlyinjurious to the economy of the world, but it is a shame and a disgraceto the civilized portion of the human race.It is of little avail that I should here enter into a detaileddescription of each species that now is being railroaded into oblivion.The bookshelves of intelligent men and women are filled with beautifuland adequate books on birds and quadrupeds, wherein the status of eachspecies may be determined, almost without effort. There is time andspace only in which to notice the most prominent of the doomed species,and perhaps discuss a few examples by way of illustration. Here is a       *        *        *        *        *PARTIAL LIST OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS THREATENED WITH EARLY EXTERMINATIONWHOOPING CRANETRUMPETER SWANAMERICAN FLAMINGOROSEATE SPOONBILLSCARLET IBISLONG-BILLED CURLEWHUDSONIAN GODWITUPLAND PLOVERRED-BREASTED SANDPIPERGOLDEN PLOVERDOWITCHERWILLETPECTORAL SANDPIPERBLACK-CAPPED PETRELAMERICAN EGRETSNOWY EGRETWOOD DUCKBAND-TAILED PIGEONHEATH HENSAGE GROUSEPRAIRIE SHARP-TAILPINNATED GROUSEWHITE-TAILED KITE       *        *        *        *        *THE WHOOPING CRANE.--This splendid bird will almost certainly be thenext North American species to be totally exterminated. It is the onlynew world rival of the numerous large and showy cranes of the old world;for the sandhill crane is not in the same class as the white, black andblue giants of Asia. We will part from our stately _Grus americanus_with profound sorrow, for on this continent we ne'er shall see his likeagain.The well-nigh total disappearance of this species has been brought closehome to us by the fact that there are less than half a dozen individualsalive in captivity, while in a wild state the bird is so rare as to bequite unobtainable. For example, for nearly five years an Englishgentlemen has been offering 1,000 for a pair, and the mostenterprising bird collector in America has been quite unable to fill theorder. So far as our information extends, the last living specimencaptured was taken six or seven years ago. The last wild birds seen andreported were observed by Ernest Thompson Seton, who saw five below FortMcMurray, Saskatchewan, October 16th, 1907, and by John F. Ferry, whosaw one at Big Quill Lake, Saskatchewan, in June, 1909.The range of this species once covered the eastern two-thirds of thecontinent of North America. It extended from the Atlantic coast to theRocky Mountains, and from Great Bear Lake to Florida and Texas. Eastwardof the Mississippi it has for twenty years been totally extinct, and thelast specimens taken alive were found in Kansas and Nebraska.[Illustration: WHOOPING CRANES IN THE ZOOLOGICAL PARKVery Soon this Species will Become Totally Extinct.]THE TRUMPETER SWAN.--Six years ago this species was regarded as sonearly extinct that a doubting ornithological club of Boston refused tobelieve on hearsay evidence that the New York Zoological Park containeda pair of living birds, and a committee was appointed, to investigate inperson, and report. Even at that time, skins were worth all the way from100 to 150 each; and when swan skins sell at either of those figuresit is because there are people who believe that the species either is onthe verge of extinction, or has passed it. The pair referred to abovewas acquired in 1900. Since that time, Dr. Leonard C. Sanford procuredin 1910 two living birds from a bird dealer who obtained them on thecoast of Virginia. We have done our utmost to induce our pair to breed,but without any further results than nest-building.The loss of the trumpeter swan (_Olor americanus_) will not be so great,nor felt so keenly, as the blotting out of the whooping crane. It soclosely resembles the whistling swan that only an ornithologist canrecognize the difference, a yellow spot on the side of the uppermandible, near its base. The whistling swan yet remains in fair numbers,but it is to be feared that soon it will go as the trumpeter has gone.THE AMERICAN FLAMINGO, SCARLET IBIS AND ROSEATE SPOONBILL are three ofthe most beautiful and curious water-haunting birds of the tropics. Onceall three species inhabited portions of the southern United States; butnow all three are gone from our star-spangled bird fauna. The brilliantscarlet plumage of the flamingo and ibis, and the exquisite pinkrose-color and white of the spoonbill naturally attracted the evil eyesof the "milliner's taxidermists" and other bird-butchers. From Floridathese birds quickly vanished. The six great breeding colonies ofFlamingoes on Andros Island, Bahamas, have been reduced to two, and fromProf. E.A. Goeldi, of the State Museum Goeldi, Para, Brazil, have comebitter complaints of the slaughter of scarlet ibises in South America byplume-hunters in European pay.I know not how other naturalists regard the future of the three speciesnamed above, but my opinion is that unless the European feather trade isquickly stopped as to wild plumage, they are absolutely certain to beshot into total oblivion, within a very few years. The plumage of thesebirds has so much commercial value, for fishermen's flies as well as forwomen's hats, that the birds will be killed as long as their featherscan be sold and any birds remain alive.Zoologically, the flamingo is the most odd and interesting bird on theAmerican continent except the emperor penguin. Its beak bafflesdescription, its long legs and webbed feet are a joke, its nestinghabits are amazing, and its food habits the despair of mostzoological-garden keepers. Millions of flamingos inhabit the shores of anumber of small lakes in the interior of equatorial East Africa, butthat species is not brilliant scarlet all over the neck and head, as isthe case with our species.If the American flamingo, scarlet ibis and roseate spoonbill, one or allof them, are to be saved from total extinction, efforts must be made ineach of the countries in which they breed and live. Their preservationis distinctly a burden upon the countries of South America that lieeastward of the Andes, and on Yucatan, Cuba and the Bahamas. The timehas come when the Government of the Bahama Islands should sternly forbidthe killing of any more flamingos, on any pretext whatever; and if thecapture of living specimens for exhibition purposes militates againstthe welfare of the colonies, _they should forbid that also_.THE UPLAND PLOVER, OR "BARTRAMIAN SANDPIPER."--Apparently this is thenext shore-bird species that will follow the Eskimo curlew intooblivion. Four years ago,--a long period for a species that is on theedge of extermination,--Mr. E.H. Forbush[B] wrote of it as follows:"The Bartramian Sandpiper, commonly known as the Upland Plover, a birdwhich formerly bred on grassy hills all over the State and migratedsouthward along our coasts in great flocks, is in imminent danger ofextirpation. A few still breed in Worcester and Berkshire Counties, orNantucket, so there is still a nucleus which, if protected, may save thespecies. Five reports from localities where this bird formerly bred giveit as nearing extinction, and four as extinct. This is one of the mostuseful of all birds in grass land, feeding largely on grasshoppers andcutworms. It is one of the finest of all birds for the table. An effortshould be made at once to save this useful species."[Footnote B: "Special Report on the Decrease of Certain Birds, and itsCauses."--Mass. State Board of Agriculture, 1908.]THE BLACK-CAPPED PETREL, (_Aestrelata hasitata_).--This species isalready recorded in the A.O.U. "Check list" as extinct; but it appearsthat this may not as yet be absolutely true. On January 1, 1912, astrange thing happened. A much battered and exhausted black-cappedpetrel was picked up alive in Central Park, New York, taken to themenagerie, and kept there during the few days that it survived. When itdied it was sent to the American Museum; and this may easily prove to bethe last living record for that species. In reality, this species mightas well be listed with those totally extinct. Formerly it ranged fromthe Antilles to Ohio and Ontario, and the causes of its blotting out arenot yet definitely known.This ocean-going bird once had a wide range overseas in the temperateareas of the North Atlantic. It is recorded from Ulster County, NewYork, New Hampshire, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and Florida. It was aboutof the size of the common tern.THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR, (_Gymnogyps californianus_).--I feel that theexistence of this species hangs on a very slender thread. This is due toits alarmingly small range, the insignificant number of individuals nowliving, the openness of the species to attack, and the danger of itsextinction by poison. Originally this remarkable bird,--the largestNorth American bird of prey,--ranged as far northward as the ColumbiaRiver, and southward for an unknown distance. Now its range is reducedto seven counties in southern California, although it is said to extendfrom Monterey Bay to Lower California, and eastward to Arizona.Regarding the present status and the future of this bird, I have beengreatly disturbed in mind. When a unique and zoologically importantspecies becomes reduced in its geographic range to a small section of asingle state, it seems to me quite time for alarm. For some time I havecounted this bird as one of those threatened with early extermination,and as I think with good reason. In view of the swift calamities thatnow seem able to fall on species like thunderbolts out of clear skies,and wipe them off the earth even before we know that such a fate isimpending, no species of seven-county distribution is safe. Any speciesthat is limited to a few counties of a single state is liable to bewiped out in five years, by poison, or traps, or lack of food.[Illustration: CALIFORNIA CONDORNow Living in the New York Zoological Park.]On order to obtain the best and also the most conservative informationregarding this species, I appealed to the Curator of the Museum ofVertebrate Zoology, of the University of California. Although written inthe mountain wilds, I promptly received the valuable contribution thatappears below. As a clear, precise and conservative survey of animportant species, it is really a model document.       *        *        *        *        *THE STATUS OF THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR IN 1912 _By Joseph Grinnell_"To my knowledge, the California Condor has been definitely observedwithin the past five years in the following California counties: LosAngeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, Kern, andTulare. In parts of Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Kerncounties the species is still fairly common, for a large bird, probablyequal in numbers to the golden eagle in those regions that are suited toit. By suitable country I mean cattle-raising, mountainous territory,of which there are still vast areas, and which are not likely to be putto any other use for a very long time, if ever, on account of the lackof water."While in Kern County last April, I was informed by a reliable man wholives near the Tejon Rancho that he had counted twenty-five condors in asingle day, since January 1 of the present year. These were on the TejonRancho, which is an enormous cattle range covering parts of theTehachapi and San Emigdio Mountains."Our present state law provides complete protection for the condor andits eggs; and the State Fish and Game Commission, in granting permitsfor collectors, always adds the phrase--'except the California condorand its eggs.' I know of two special permits having been issued, butneither of these were used; that is, no 'specimens' have been takensince 1908, as far as I am aware."In my travels about the state, I have found that practically everyoneknows that the condor is protected. Still, there is always the huntingelement who do not hesitate to shoot anything alive and out of theordinary, and a certain percentage of the condors are doubtless pickedoff each year by such criminals. It is possible, also, that themercenary egg-collector continues to take his annual rents, though ifthis is done it is kept very quiet. It is my impression that the presentfatalities from all sources are fully balanced by the natural rate ofincrease."There is one factor that has militated against the condor more than anyother one thing; namely, the restriction in its food source. Its foragerange formerly included most of the great valleys adjacent to itsmountain retreats. But now the valleys are almost entirely devoted toagriculture, and of course far more thickly settled than formerly."The mountainous areas where the condor is making its last stand seem tome likely to remain adapted to the bird's existence for manyyears,--fifty years, if not longer. Of course, this is conditional uponthe maintenance and enforcement of the present laws. There is also theenlightenment of public sentiment in regard to the preservation of wildlife, which I believe can be depended upon. This is a matter of generaleducation, which is, fortunately, and with no doubt whatever,progressing at a quite perceptible rate."Yes; I should say that the condor has a fair chance to survive, inlimited numbers."Another bird which in my opinion is far nearer extinction than thecondor, so far as California is concerned, is the white-tailed kite.This is a perfectly harmless bird, but one which harries over themarshes, where it has been an easy target for the idle duck-hunter.Then, too, its range was limited to the valley bottoms, where humansettlement is increasingly close. I know of only _two_ live pairs withinthe state last year!"Finally, let me remark that the rate of increase of the Californiacondor is not one whit less than that of the band-tailed pigeon! Yet,there is no protection at all for the latter in this state, even in thenesting season; and thousands were shot last spring, in theunprecedented concentration of the species in the southern coastcounties. (See Chambers in _The Condor_ for May, 1912, p. 108.)"       *        *        *        *        *The California Condor is one of the only two species of condor nowliving, and it is the only one found in North America. As a matter ofnational pride, and a duty to posterity, the people of the United Statescan far better afford to lose a million dollars from their nationaltreasury than to allow that bird to become extinct. Its preservation forall coming time is distinctly a white man's burden upon the state ofCalifornia. The laws now in force for the condor's protection are nothalf adequate! I think there is no law by which the accidental poisoningof those birds, by baits put out for coyotes and foxes, can be stopped.A law to prevent the use of poisoned meat baits anywhere in southernCalifornia, should be enacted at the next session of California'slegislature. The fine for molesting a condor should be raised to 500,with a long prison-term as an alternative. A competent, interested gamewarden should be appointed _solely for the protection of the condors_.It is time to count those birds, keep them under observation, and havean annual report upon their condition.THE HEATH HEN.--But for the protection that has been provided for it bythe ornithologists of Massachusetts, and particularly Dr. George W.Field, William Brewster and John E. Thayer, the heath hen or easternpinnated grouse would years ago have become totally extinct. New York,New Jersey and Massachusetts began to protect that species entirely toolate. It was given five-year close seasons, without avail. Then it wasgiven ten-year close seasons, but it was _too late_!To-day, the species exists only in one locality, the island of Martha'sVineyard, and concerning its present status, Mr. Forbush has recentlyfurnished us the following clear statement:  "The heath hens increased for two years after the Massachusetts Fish  and Game Commission established a reservation for them, but in 1911  they had not increased. There are probably about two hundred birds  extant.  "I found a great many marsh hawks on the Island and the Commission  did not kill them, believing them to be beneficial. In watching  them, I concluded that they were catching the young heath hens. A  large number of these hawks have been shot and their stomachs sent  to Washington for examination, as I was too busy at the time to  examine them. So far as I know, no report of the examination has  been made, but Dr. Field himself examined a few of the stomachs and  found the remains of the heath hen in some.  "The warden now says that during the past two years, the heath hen  has not increased, but I can give you no definite evidence of this.  I am quite sure they are being killed by natives of the island and  that at least one collector supplies birds for museums. We are  trying to get evidence of this.  "I believe if the heath hen is to be increased in numbers and brought  back to this country, we shall have to have more than one warden on  the reservation and, eventually, we shall have to establish the bird  on the mainland also."[Illustration: PINNATED GROUSE, OR "PRAIRIE CHICKEN"From the "American Natural History"]THE PINNATED GROUSE, SAGE GROUSE AND PRAIRIE SHARP-TAIL.--In view of thefate of the grouse of the United States, as it has been wrought out thusfar in all the more thickly settled areas, and particularly in view ofthe history of the heath hen, we have no choice but to regard all threeof the species named above as absolutely certain to become totallyextinct, within a short period of years, unless the conditionssurrounding them are immediately and radically changed for the better.Personally, I do not believe that the gunners and game-hogs ofMinnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Californiawill permit any one of those species to be saved.If the present open seasons prevail in the states that I have mentionedabove, no power on earth can save those three species of grouse from thefate of the heath hen. To-day their representatives exist only in smallshreds and patches, and from fully nineteen-twentieths of their originalranges they are forever gone.The sage grouse will be the first species to go. It is the largest, themost conspicuous, the one most easily found, and the biggest mark forthe gunner. Those who have seen this bird in its native sage-brush wellunderstand how fatally it is exposed to slaughter.Many appeals have been made in behalf of the pinnated grouse; but theopen seasons continue. The gunners of the states in which a few remnantsstill exist are determined to have them, all; and the state legislaturesseem disposed to allow the killers to have their way. It may behowever, that like New York with the heath hen, they will arouse andvirtuously lock the stable door--after the horse has been stolen![Illustration: SAGE GROUSEThe First of the Upland Game Birds that will Become Extinct]THE SNOWY EGRET AND AMERICAN EGRET, (_Egretta candidissima and Herodiasegretta_).--These unfortunate birds, cursed for all time by thecommercially valuable "aigrette" plumes that they bear, have had a verynarrow escape from total extinction in the United States, despite allthe efforts made to save them. The "plume-hunters" of the millinerytrade have been, _and still are_, determined to have the last featherand the last drop of egret blood. In an effort to stop the slaughter inat least one locality in Florida, Warden Guy Bradley was killed by aplume-hunter, who of course escaped all punishment through theheaven-born "sympathy" of a local jury.Of the bloody egret slaughter in Florida, not one-tenth of the wholestory ever has been told. Millions of adult birds,--all therewere,--were killed _in the breeding season_, when the plumes were ripefor the market; and millions of young birds starved in their nests. Itwas a common thing for a rookery of several hundred birds to be attackedby the plume-hunters, and in two or three days utterly destroyed. Thesame bloody work is going on to-day in Venezuela and Brazil; and thestories and "affidavits" stating that the millions of egret plumes beingshipped annually from those countries are "shed feathers," "picked upoff the ground," are absolute lies. The men who have sworn to those liesare perjurers, and should be punished for their crimes. (See ChapterXIII).By 1908, the plume-hunters had so far won the fight for the egrets thatFlorida had been swept almost as bare of these birds as the Coloradodesert.Until Mr. E.A. McIlhenny's egret preserve, at Avery Island, Louisiana,became a pronounced success, we had believed that our two egrets soonwould become totally extinct in the United States. But Mr. McIlhenny hascertainly saved those birds to our fauna. In 1892 he started an egretand heron preserve, close beside his house on Avery Island. By 1900 itwas an established success. To-day 20,000 pairs of egrets and herons areliving and breeding in that bird refuge, and the two egret species aresafe in at least one spot in our own country.[Illustration: SNOWY EGRETS IN THE McILHENNY EGRET PRESERVEIt is at This Period That the Parent Birds are Killed for Their Plumes,and the Young Starve in the NestPhoto by E.A. McIlhenny]Three years ago, I think there were not many bird-lovers in the UnitedStates, who believed it possible to prevent the total extinction of bothegrets from our fauna. All the known rookeries accessible toplume-hunters had been totally destroyed. Two years ago, the secretdiscovery of several small, hidden colonies prompted William Dutcher,President of the National Association of Audubon Societies, and Mr. T.Gilbert Pearson, Secretary, to attempt the protection of those colonies.With a fund contributed for the purpose, wardens were hired and dulycommissioned. As previously stated, one of those wardens was shot deadin cold blood by a plume hunter. The task of guarding swamp rookeriesfrom the attacks of money-hungry desperadoes to whom the accursed plumeswere worth their weight in gold, is a very chancy proceeding. There isnow one warden in Florida who says that "before they get my rookery theywill first have to get me."Thus far the protective work of the Audubon Association has beensuccessful. Now there are twenty colonies, which contain all told, about5,000 egrets and about 120,000 herons and ibises which are guarded bythe Audubon wardens. One of the most important is on Bird Island, a mileout in Orange Lake, central Florida, and it is ably defended by Oscar E.Baynard. To-day, the plume hunters who do not dare to raid the guardedrookeries are trying to study out the lines of flight of the birds, toand from their feeding-grounds, and shoot them in transit. Their mottois--"Anything to beat the law, and get the plumes." It is there that thestate of Florida should take part in the war.The success of this campaign is attested by the fact that last year anumber of egrets were seen in eastern Massachusetts--for the first timein many years. And so to-day the question is, can the wardens continueto hold the plume-hunters at bay?THE WOOD-DUCK (_Aix sponsa_), by many bird-lovers regarded as the mostbeautiful of all American birds, is threatened with extinction, in allthe states that it still inhabits with the exception of eight. Long ago(1901) the U.S. Biological Survey sounded a general alarm for thisspecies by the issue of a special bulletin regarding its disappearance,and advising its protection by long close seasons. To their everlastinghonor, eight states responded, by the enactment of long close-seasonlaws.

I am ashamed to tell; but it is necessary that the truthshould be known.Surely we will find that if the other states have not the grace toprotect this bird on account of its exquisite beauty they will notpenalize it by extra long open seasons._A number of them have taken pains to provide extra long_ OPEN _seasonson this species, usually of five or six months!!_ And this for a bird soexquisitely beautiful that shooting it for the table is like dining onbirds of paradise.

Now,is not the record something to blush for?Is there in those fifteen states _nothing_ too beautiful or too good togo into the pot?       *        *        *        *        *THE WOODCOCK _(Philohela minor)_, is a bird regarding which mybird-hunting friends and I do not agree. I say that as a species it issteadily disappearing, and presently will become extinct, unless it isaccorded better protection. They reply: "Well, I can show you wherethere are woodcock yet!"A few months ago a Nova Scotian writer in _Forest and Stream_ came outwith the bold prediction that three more years of the usual annualslaughter of woodcock will bring the species to the verge of extinctionin that Province.It is such occurrences as this that bring the end of a species:"Last fall [1911, at Norwalk, Conn.] we had a good flight of woodcock,and it is a shame the way they were slaughtered. I know of a number ofcases where twenty were killed by one gun in the day, and heard of onecase of fifty. This is all wrong, and means the end of the woodcock, ifcontinued. There is no doubt we need a bag limit on woodcock, as much ason quail or partridge." ("Woodcock" in _Forest and Stream_, Mar. 2,1912.)As far back as 1901, Dr. A.K. Fisher of the Biological Survey predictedthat the woodcock and wood-duck would both become extinct unless betterprotected. As yet, the better protection demanded has not materializedto any great extent.Says Mr. Forbush, State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, in his admirable"Special Report," p. 45:"The woodcock is decreasing all over its range in the East, and needsthe strongest protection. Of thirty-eight Massachusetts reports,thirty-six state that "woodcock are decreasing," "rare" or "extinct,"while one states that they are holding their own, and one that they areincreasing slightly since the law was passed prohibiting their sale."Let not any honest American or Canadian sportsman lullaby himself intothe belief that the woodcock is safe from extermination. As sure as theworld, it is _going_! The fact that a little pocket here or therecontains a few birds does not in the slightest degree disprove the mainfact. If the sportsmen of this country desire to save the seed stock ofwoodcock, they must give it _everywhere_ five or ten-year close seasons,and _do it immediately_!OUR SHORE BIRDS IN GENERAL.--This group of game birds will be the firstto be exterminated in North America as a _group_. Of all our birds,these are the most illy fitted to survive. They are very conspicuous,very unwary, easy to find if alive, and easy to shoot. Never in my lifehave any shore birds except woodcock and snipe appealed to me as realgame. They are too easy to kill, too trivial when killed, and some ofthem are too rank and fishy on the plate. As game for men I place themon a level with barnyard ducks or orchard turkeys. I would as soon becaught stealing a sheep as to be seen trying to shoot fishy yellow legsor little joke sandpipers for the purpose of feeding upon them. And yet,thousands of full-grown men, some of them six feet high, grow indignantand turn red in the face at the mention of a law to give all theshore-birds of New York a five-year close season.But for all that, gentlemen of the gun, there are exactly twoalternatives between which you shall choose:(1) Either give the woodcock of the eastern United States just _tentimes_ the protection that it now has, or (2) bid the species a longfarewell. If you elect to slaughter old _Philohela minor_ on the altarof Selfishness, then it will be in order for the millions of people whodo not kill birds to say whether that proposal shall be consummated ornot.Read if you please Mr. W.A. McAtee's convincing pamphlet (BiologicalSurvey, No. 79), on "Our Vanishing Shore Birds," reproduced in full inChapter XXIII. He says: "Throughout the eastern United States, shorebirds are fast vanishing. Many of them have been so reduced that_extermination seems imminent_. So averse to shore birds are presentconditions [of slaughter] that the wonder is that any escape. All theshore birds of the United States are in great need of betterprotection.... Shore birds have been hunted until only a remnant oftheir once vast numbers are left. Their limited powers of reproduction,coupled with the natural vicissitudes of the breeding period, make theirincrease slow, and peculiarly expose them to danger of extermination. Sogreat is their economic value that their retention in the game list andtheir destruction by sportsmen is a serious loss to agriculture."And yet, here in New York state there are many men who think they"know," who indignantly scoff at the idea that our shore birds need afive-year close season to help save them from annihilation. The writer'sappeal for this at a recent convention of the New York State Fish, Gameand Forest League fell upon deaf ears, and was not even seriouslydiscussed.The shore-birds must be saved; and just at present it seems that theonly persons who will do it are those who are _not_ sportsmen, and whonever kill game! If the sportsmen persist in refusing to act, to them wemust appeal.Besides the woodcock and snipe, the species that are most seriouslythreatened with extinction at an early date are the following:SPECIES IN GREAT DANGERWillet                           _Catoptrophorus semipalmatus_Dowitcher                        _Macrorhamphus griseus_Knot: Red-Breasted Sandpiper     _Tryngites subruficollis_Upland Plover                    _Bartramia longicauda_Golden Plover                    _Charadrius dominicus_Pectoral Sandpiper               _Pisobia maculata_Of these fine species, Mr. Forbush, whose excellent knowledge of theshore birds of the Atlantic coast is well worth the most seriousconsideration, says that the upland plover, or Bartramian sandpiper, "isin imminent danger of extinction. Five reports from localities wherethis bird formerly bred give it as nearing extinction, and four asextinct. This is one of the most useful of all birds in grass land,feeding largely on grasshoppers and cutworms.... There is no differenceof opinion in regard to the diminution of the shore birds; the reportsfrom all quarters are the same. It is noteworthy that practically allobservers agree that, considering all species, these birds have fallenoff about 75 per cent within twenty-five to forty years, and thatseveral species are nearly extirpated."[Illustration: THE GRAY SQUIRREL, A FAMILIAR FRIEND WHEN PROTECTED]In 1897 when the Zoological Society published my report on the"Extermination of Our Birds and Mammals," we put down the decrease inthe volume of bird life in Massachusetts during the previous fifteenyears at twenty-seven per cent. The later and more elaborateinvestigations of Mr. Forbush have satisfactorily vindicated theaccuracy of that estimate.There are other North American birds that easily might be added to thelist of those now on the road to oblivion; but surely the foregoingcitations are sufficient to reveal the present desperate conditions ofour bird life in general. Now the question is: What are the greatAmerican people going to do about it?THE GRAY SQUIRREL.--The gray squirrel is in danger of extermination.Although it is our most beautiful and companionable small wild animal,and really unfit for food, Americans have strangely elected to class itas "game," and shoot it to death, _to eat_! And this in stall-fedAmerica, in the twentieth century! Americans are the only white peoplein the world who eat squirrels. It would be just as reasonable, and nomore barbarous, to kill domestic cats and eat them. Their flesh wouldtaste quite as good as squirrel flesh and some of them would affordquite as good "sport."Every intelligent person knows that in the United States the deadlyshot-gun is rapidly exterminating every bird and every small mammal thatis classed as "game," and which legally may be killed, even during twomonths of the twelve. The market gunners slaughter ducks, grouse, shorebirds and rabbits as if we were all starving.The beautiful gray squirrel has clung to life in a few of our forestsand wood-lots, long after most other wild mammals have disappeared; butthroughout at least ninety-five per cent, of its original area, it isnow extinct. During the past thirty years I have roamed the woods of mystate in several widely separated localities,--the Adirondacks,Catskills, Berkshires, western New York and elsewhere, and in all thattime I have seen only _three_ wild gray squirrels outside of city parks.Except over a very small total area, the gray squirrel is already gonefrom the wild fauna of New York State!Do the well-fed people of America wish to have this beautiful animalentirely exterminated? Do they wish the woods to become wholly lifeless?Or, do they desire to bring back some of the wild creatures, and keepthem for their children to enjoy?There is no wild mammal that responds to protection more quickly thanthe gray squirrel. In two years' time, wild specimens that are set freein city parks learn that they are safe from harm and become almostfearless. They take food from the hands of visitors, and climb intotheir arms. One of the most pleasing sights of the Zoological Park isthe enjoyment of visitors, young and old, in "petting" our wild graysquirrels.We ask the Boy Scouts of America to bring back this animal to each statewhere it belongs, by securing for it from legislatures and governors theperpetual closed seasons that it imperatively needs. It is not much toask. This can be done by writing to members of the legislatures andrequesting a suitable law. Such a request will be both right andreasonable; and three states have already granted it.The gray squirrel is naturally the children's closest wild-animalfriend. Surely every farmer boy would like to have colonies of graysquirrels around him, to keep him company, and furnish him withentertainment. A wood-lot without squirrels and chipmunks is indeed alifeless place. For 20 anyone can restock any bit of woods with themost companionable and most beautiful tree-dweller that nature has givenus.The question now is, which will you choose--a gray squirrel colony toevery farm, or lifeless desolation?We ask every American to lend a hand to save Silver-Tail.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER IVEXTINCT AND NEARLY EXTINCT SPECIES OF MAMMALSWhen we pause and consider the years, the generations and the ages thatNature spends in the production of a high vertebrate species, thepreservation of such species from extermination should seriously concernus. As a matter of fact, in modern man's wild chase after wealth andpleasure, it is only one person out of every ten thousand who pauses toregard such causes, unless cornered by some protectionist fanatic, heldfast and coerced to listen.We are not discussing the animals of the Pleistocene, or the Eocene, orany period of the far-distant Past. We are dealing with species thathave been ruthlessly, needlessly and wickedly destroyed by man duringour own times; species that, had they been given a fair chance, would bealive and well to-day.In reckless waste of blood and treasure, the nineteenth century has muchfor which to answer. Wars and pillage, fires, earthquakes and volcanoesare unhappily unavoidable. Like the poor of holy writ, we have them withus always. But the destruction of animal life is in a totally differentcategory from the accidental calamities of life. It is deliberate,cold-blooded, persistent, and in its final stage, _criminal_! Worst ofall, there is no limit to the devilish persistence of the confirmeddestroyer, this side of the total extinction of species. No polar nightis too cold, no desert inferno is too hot for the man who pursues wildlife for commercial purposes. The rhytina has been exterminated in thefar north, the elephant seals on Kerguelen are being exterminated in thefar south, and midway, in the desert mountains of Lower California afine species of mountain sheep is rapidly being shot into oblivion.       *        *        *        *        *LARGE MAMMALS COMPLETELY EXTERMINATEDTHE ARIZONA ELK, (_Cervus merriami_).--Right at our very door, under ourvery noses and as it were only yesterday, a well-defined species ofAmerican elk has been totally exterminated. Until recently the mountainsof Arizona and New Mexico were inhabited by a light-colored elk ofsmaller size than the Wyoming species, whose antlers possessed on eachside only one brow tine instead of two. The exact history of theblotting out of that species has not yet been written, but it seems thatits final extinction occurred about 1901. Its extermination was only aroutine incident of the devilish general slaughter of American big gamethat by 1900 had wiped out nearly everything killable over a largeportion of the Rocky Mountain region and the Great Plains.The Arizona elk was exterminated before the separate standing of thespecies had been discovered by naturalists, and before even _one_ skinhad been preserved in a museum! In 1902 Mr. E.W. Nelson described thespecies from two male skulls, all the material of which he knew. Sincethat time, a third male skull, bearing an excellent pair of antlers, hasbeen discovered by Mr. Ferdinand Kaegebehn, a member of the New YorkZoological Society, and presented to our National Collection of Headsand Horns. It came from the Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona, in 1884.The species was first exterminated in the central and northern mountainsof Arizona, probably twenty years ago, and made its last stand innorthwestern New Mexico. Precisely when it became extinct there, itslast abiding place, we do not know, but in time the facts may appear.THE QUAGGA, (_Equus quagga_).--Before the days of Livingstone,Gordon-Cumming and Anderson, the grassy plains and half-forested hillsof South Africa were inhabited by great herds of a wild equine speciesthat in its markings was a sort of connecting link between the stripedzebras and the stripeless wild asses. The quagga resembled a wild asswith a few zebra stripes around its neck, and no stripes elsewhere.There is no good reason why a mammal that is not in any one of thefamilies regularly eaten by man should be classed as a game animal.White men, outside of the western border of the continent of Europe, donot eat horses; and by this token there is no reason why a zebra shouldbe shot as a "game" animal, any more than a baboon. A big male baboon isdangerous; a male zebra is not.Nevertheless, white men have elected to shoot zebras as game; and underthis curse the unfortunate quagga fell to rise no more. The species wasshot to a speedy death by sportsmen, and by the British and Dutchfarmers of South Africa. It became extinct about 1875, and to-day thereare only 18 specimens in all the museums of the world.THE BLAUBOK, (_Hippotragus leucophaeus_).--The first of the Africanantelopes to become extinct in modern times was a species of large size,closely related to the roan antelope of to-day, and named by the earlyDutch settlers of Cape Colony the blaubok, which means "blue-buck." Itwas snuffed out of existence in the year 1800, so quickly and sothoroughly that, like the Arizona elk, it very nearly escaped the annalsof natural history. According to the careful investigations of Mr.Graham Renshaw, there are only eight specimens in existence in all themuseums of Europe. In general terms it may be stated that this specieshas been extinct for about a century.DAVID'S DEER, (_Elaphurus davidianus_).--We enter this species withthose that are totally extinct, because this is true of it so far as itswild state is concerned. It is a deer nearly as large as the red deer ofEurope, with 3-tined antlers about equal in total length to those of thered deer. Its most striking differential character is its _long tail_, afeature that among the deer of the world is quite unique.Originally this species inhabited "northern Mongolia" (China), but in awild state it became extinct before its zoological standing became knownto the scientific world. The species was called to the attention ofzoologists by a Roman Catholic missionary, called Father David, and whenfinally described it was named in his honor.At the outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion, in 1900, there were about 200specimens living in the imperial park of China, a short distance southof Pekin; but during the rebellion, all of them were killed and eaten,thus totally exterminating the species from Asia.Fortunately, previous to that calamity (in 1894), the Duke of Bedfordhad by considerable effort and expenditure procured and established inhis matchless park surrounding Woburn Abbey, England, a herd of eighteenspecimens of this rarest of all deer. That nucleus has thriven andincreased, until in 1910 it contained thirty-four head. Owing to thefact that all the living female specimens of this remarkable species areconcentrated in one spot, and perfectly liable to be wiped out in oneyear by riot, war or disease, there is some cause for anxiety. Thewriter has gone so far as to suggest the desirability of starting a newherd of David's deer, at some point far distant from England, as aninsurance measure against the possibility of calamity at Woburn.Excepting two or three specimens in European zoological gardens thathave been favored by the Duke of Bedford, there are no living specimensoutside of Woburn Park.[Illustration: SKELETON OF A RHYTINA, OR ARCTIC SEA-COWIn the United States National Museum]THE RHYTINA, (_Rhytina gigas_).--The most northerly Sirenian that (sofar as we know) ever inhabited the earth, lived on the Commander Islandsin the northern end of Behring Sea, and was exterminated by man, for itsoil and its flesh, about 1768. It was first made known to the world bySteller, in 1741, and must have become extinct near the beginning of thenineteenth century.The rhytina belonged to the same mammalian Order as the manatee ofFlorida and South America, and the dugong of Australia. The largestmanatee that Florida has produced, so far as we know, was thirteen feetlong. The rhytina attained a length of between thirty and thirty-fivefeet, and a weight of 6,000 pounds or over. The flesh of this animal,like that of the manatee and dugong, must have been edible, and surelywas prized by the hungry sailors and natives of its time. It is notstrange that such a species was quickly exterminated by man, in thearctic regions. The wonder is that it ever existed at a latitude sooutrageous for a Sirenian, an animal which by all precedents shouldprefer life in temperate or warm waters.[Illustration: BURCHELL'S ZEBRA, IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUMNow Believed to be Totally Extinct]BURCHELL'S ZEBRA (_Equus burchelli typicus_).--The foundation type ofwhat now is the Burchell group of zebras, consisting of four or fivesub-species of the original species of _burchelli_, is an animalabundantly striped as to its body, neck and head, but with legs that arealmost white and free from stripes. The sub-species have legs that arestriped about half as much as the mountain zebra and the Grevy species.While there are Chapman zebras and Grant zebras in plenty, and ofCrawshay's not a few, all these are forms that have developed northwardof the range of the parent species, the original _Equus burchelli_. Forhalf a century in South Africa the latter had been harried and drivenand shot, and now it is gone, forever. Now, the museum people of theworld are hungrily enumerating their mounted specimens, and live onescannot be procured with money, because there are none! Already it iscommon talk that "the true Burchell zebra is extinct;" and unfortunatelythere is no good reason to doubt it. Even if there are a few now livingin some remote nook of the Transvaal, or Zululand, or Portuguese EastAfrica, the chances are as 100 to 1 that they will not be suffered tobring back the species; and so, to Burchell's zebra, the world is to-daysaying "Farewell!"[Illustration: THYLACINE OR TASMANIAN WOLFNow Being Exterminated by the Sheep Owners of Tasmania]       *        *        *        *        *SPECIES OF LARGE MAMMALS ALMOST EXTINCTTHE THYLACINE or TASMANIAN WOLF, (_Thylacinus cynocephalus_).--Fouryears ago, when Mr. W.H.D. Le Souef, Director of the MelbourneZoological Garden (Australia), stood before the cage of the livingthylacine in the New York Zoological Park, he first expressed surpriseat the sight of the animal, then said:"I advise you to take excellent care of that specimen; for when it isgone, you never will get another. The species soon will be extinct."This opinion has been supported, quite independently, by a lady who isthe highest authority on the present status of that species, Mrs. MaryG. Roberts, of Hobart, Tasmania. For nearly ten years Mrs. Roberts hasbeen procuring all the living specimens of the thylacine that moneycould buy, and attempting to breed them at her private zoo. She statesthat the mountain home of this animal is now occupied by flocks ofsheep, and because of the fact that the "Tasmanian wolves" raid theflocks and kill lambs, the sheep-owners and herders are systematicallypoisoning the thylacines as fast as possible. Inasmuch as the species islimited to Tasmania, Mrs. Roberts and others fear that the sheepmenwill totally exterminate the remnant at an early date. This animal isthe largest and also the most interesting carnivorous marsupial ofAustralia, and its untimely end will be a cause for sincere regret.[Illustration: WEST INDIAN SEALIn the New York Aquarium]THE WEST INDIAN SEAL, (_Monachus tropicalis_).--For at least fiftyyears, all the zoologists who ever had heard of this species believedthat the oil-hunters had completely exterminated it. In 1885, when theNational Museum came into possession of one poorly-mounted skin, fromProfessor Poey, of Havana, it was regarded as a great _prize_.Most unexpectedly, in 1886 American zoologists were startled by thediscovery of a small herd on the Triangle Islands, in the Caribbean Sea,near Yucatan, by Mr. Henry L. Ward, now director of the Milwaukee PublicMuseum, and Professor Ferrari, of the National Museum of Mexico. Theyfound about twenty specimens, and collected only a sufficient number toestablish the true character of the species.Since that time, four living specimens have been captured, and sent tothe New York Aquarium, where they lived for satisfactory periods. Theindoor life and atmosphere did not seem to injure the natural vitalityof the animals. In fact, I think they were far more lively in theAquarium than were the sluggish creatures that Mr. Ward saw on theTriangle reefs, and described in his report of the expedition.It is quite possible that there are yet alive a few specimens of thisodd species; but the Damocletian sword of destruction hangs over themsuspended by a fine hair, and it is to be expected that in the futuresome roving sea adventurer will pounce upon the Remnant, and wipe itout of existence for whatever reason may to him seem good.[Illustration: CALIFORNIA ELEPHANT SEALPhotographed on Guadalupe Island by C.H. Townsend.]THE CALIFORNIA ELEPHANT SEAL, (_Mirounga angustirostris_).--Thisremarkable long-snouted species of seal was reluctantly stricken fromthe fauna of the United States several years ago, and for at leastfifteen years it has been regarded as totally extinct. Last year,however (1911), the _Albatross_ scientific expedition, under the controlof Director C.H. Townsend of the New York Aquarium, visited GuadalupeIsland, 175 miles off the Pacific coast of Lower California and therefound about 150 living elephant seals. They took six living specimens,all of which died after a few months in captivity. Ever since that time,first one person and then another comes to the front with a cheerfulproposition to go to those islands and "clean up" all the remainder ofthose wonderful seals. One hunting party could land on Guadalupe, and inone week totally destroy the last remnant of this almost extinctspecies. To-day the only question is, Who will be mean enough to do it?Fortunately, those seals have no commercial value whatsoever. The littleoil they would yield would not pay the wages of cook's mate. The provenimpossibility of keeping specimens alive in captivity, even for oneyear, and the absence of cash value in the skins, even for museumpurposes, has left nothing of value in the animals to justify anexpedition to kill or to capture them. No zoological garden or parkdesires any of them, at any price. Adult males attain a length ofsixteen feet, and females eleven feet. Formerly this species wasabundant in San Christobal Bay, Lower California.At present, Mexico is in no frame of mind to provide real protection toa small colony of seals of no commercial value, 175 miles from hermainland, on an uninhabited island. It is wildly improbable that thoseseals will be permitted to live. It is a safe prediction that our nextnews of the elephant seals of Guadalupe will tell of the totalextinction of those last 140 survivors of the species.THE CALIFORNIA GRIZZLY BEAR, (_Ursus horribilis californicus_).--No oneprotects grizzly bears, except in the Yellowstone Park and other gamepreserves. For obvious reasons, it is impossible to say whether anyindividuals of this huge species now remain alive, or how long it willbe until the last one falls before a .405 Winchester engine ofextermination. We know that a living specimen can not be procured withmoney, and we believe that "Old Monarch" now in Golden Gate Park, SanFrancisco, is the last specimen of his species that ever will beexhibited alive.I can think of no reason, save general Californian apathy, why theextinction of this huge and remarkable animal was not prevented by law.The sunset grizzly (on a railroad track) is the advertising emblem ofthe Golden State, and surely the state should take sufficient interestin the species to prevent its total extermination.But it will not. California is hell-bent on exterminating a long list ofher wild-life species, and it is very doubtful whether the masses can bereached and aroused in time to stop it. Name some of the species?Certainly; with all the pleasure in life: The band-tailed pigeon, thewhite-tailed kite, the sharp-tailed grouse, the sage grouse, themountain sheep, prong-horned antelope, California mule deer, and ducksand geese too numerous to mention.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER VTHE EXTERMINATION OF SPECIES, STATE BY STATEEarly in 1912 I addressed to about 250 persons throughout the UnitedStates, three questions, as follows:1. What species of birds have become totally extinct in your state?2. What species of birds and mammals are threatened with earlyextinction?3. What species of mammals have been exterminated throughout your state?These queries were addressed to persons whose tastes and observationsrendered them especially qualified to furnish the information desired.The interest shown in the inquiry was highly gratifying. The best of theinformation given is summarized below; but this tabulation also includesmuch information acquired from other sources. The general summary of thesubject will, I am sure, convince all thoughtful persons that thepresent condition of the best wild life of the nation is indeed verygrave.

None of the persons reporting can be regardedas alarmists, but some of the lists of species approaching extinctionare appallingly long. To their observations I add other notes andobservations of interest at this time.ALABAMA:Wood-duck, snowy egret, woodcock. "The worst enemy of wild life is thepot-hunter and game hog. These wholesale slaughterers of game resort toany device and practice, it matters not how murderous, to accomplish thepernicious ends of their nefarious campaign of relentless exterminationof fur and feather. They cannot be controlled by local laws, for theseafter having been tried for several generations have proven consummatefailures, for the reason that local authorities will not enforce theprovisions of game and bird protective statutes. Experience hasdemonstrated the fact that no one desires to inform voluntarily on hisneighbors, and since breaking the game law is not construed to involvemoral turpitude, even to an infinitesimal degree, by many of ourcitizens, the plunderers of nature's storehouse thus go free, it mattersnot how great the damage done to the people as a whole."--(John H.Wallace, Jr., Game Commissioner of Alabama.)ALASKA:Thanks to geographic and climatic conditions, the Alaskan game laws and15,000 with which to enforce them, the status of the wild life ofAlaska is fairly satisfactory. I think that at present no species is indanger of extinction in the near future. When it was pointed out toCongress in 1902, by Madison Grant, T.S. Palmer and others that the wildlife of Alaska was seriously threatened, Congress immediately enactedthe law that was recommended, and now appropriates yearly a fair sum forits enforcement. I regard the Alaskan situation as being, for so vastand difficult a region, reasonably well in hand, even though open toimprovement.There is one fatal defect in our Alaskan game law, in the perpetual andsweeping license to kill, that is bestowed upon "natives" and"prospectors." Under cover of this law, the Indians can slaughter gameto any extent they choose; and they are great killers. For example: In1911 at Sand Point, Kenai Peninsula, Frank E. Kleinchmidt saw 82 cariboutongues in the boat of a native, that had been brought in for sale at 50cents, while the carcasses were left where they fell, to poison the airof Alaska. Thanks to the game law, and five wardens, the number of biggame animals killed last year in Alaska by sportsmen was reasonablysmall,--just as it should have been.--(W.T.H.)ARIZONA:During an overland trip made by Dr. MacDougal and others in 1907 fromTucson to Sonoyta, on the international boundary, 150 miles and backagain, we saw not one antelope or deer.--(W.T.H.)CALIFORNIA:Swan, white heron, bronze ibis. California valley quail are getting veryscarce, and unless adequate protection is afforded them shortly, theywill be found hereafter only in remote districts. Ducks also aredecreasing rapidly.--(H.W. Keller, Los Angeles.)Sage grouse and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse are so nearly extinct thatit may practically be said that they _are_ extinct. Among species likelyto be exterminated in the near future are the wood-duck and band-tailedpigeon.--(W.P. Taylor, Berkeley.)COLORADO:Sage grouse and sharp-tailed grouse; nearly all the shore birds.CONNECTICUT:All the shore birds; quail, purple martin.DELAWARE:Wood duck, upland plover, least tern, Wilson tern, roseate tern, blackskimmer, oystercatcher, and numerous other littoral species. Pileatedwoodpeckers, bald eagles and all the ducks are much more rare thanformerly. Swan are about gone, geese scarce. The list of ducks, geeseand shore-birds, as well as of terns and gulls that are nearingextinction is appalling.--(C.J. Pennock, Wilmington.)Wood-duck, woodcock, turtle dove and bob-white.--(A.R. Spaid,Wilmington.)FLORIDA:Limpkin, ivory-billed woodpecker, wild turkey (?).GEORGIA:Ruffed grouse, wild turkey.IDAHO:Harlequin duck, mountain plover, dusky grouse, Columbian sharp-tailedgrouse, sage grouse. Elk, goats and grizzly bears are becoming veryscarce. Of the smaller animals I have not seen a fisher for years, andmarten are hardly to be found. The same is true of other species.--(Dr.Charles S. Moody, Sand Point.)ILLINOIS:Pinnated grouse, except where rigidly protected. In Vermillion County,by long and persistent protection Harvey J. Sconce has bred back uponhis farm about 400 of these birds.INDIANA:Pileated woodpecker, woodcock, ruffed grouse, pigeon hawk, duckhawk.--(Amos W. Butler, Indianapolis.)In northern and northwestern Indiana, a perpetual close season and rigidprotection have enabled the almost-extinct pinnated grouse to breed upto a total number now estimated by Game Commissioner Miles and hiswardens at 10,000 birds. This is a gratifying illustration of what canbe done in bringing back an almost-vanished species. The good example ofIndiana should be followed by every state that still possesses a remnantof prairie-chickens, or other grouse.IOWA:Pinnated grouse, wood-duck. Notwithstanding an invasion of JasperCounty, Iowa, in the winter of 1911-12 by hundreds of pinnated grouse,such as had not been known in 20 years, this gives no ground to hopethat the future of the species is worth a moment's purchase. The wintermigration came from the Dakotas, and was believed to be due to the extrasevere winter, and the scarcity of food. Commenting on thisunprecedented occurrence, J.L. Sloanaker in the "Wilson Bulletin" No.78, says:"In the opinion of many, the formerly abundant prairie chicken is doomedto early extinction. Many will testify to their abundance in those years[in South Dakota, 1902] when the great land movement was taking place.The influx of hungry settlers, together with an occasional bad season,decimated their ranks. They were eaten by the farmers, both in and outof season. Driven from pillar to post, with no friends and insufficientfood,--what else then can be expected?"Mr. F.C. Pellett, of Atlantic, Iowa, says: "Unless ways can be devisedof rearing these birds in the domestic state, the prairie hen in myopinion is doomed to early extinction."The older inhabitants here say that there is not one song-bird in summerwhere there used to be ten.--(G.H. Nicol, in _Outdoor Life_ March,1912.)KANSAS:To all of those named in my previous list that are not actually extinct,I might add the prairie hen, the lesser prairie hen, as well as theprairie sharp-tailed grouse and the wood-duck. Such water birds as theavocets, godwits, greater yellow-legs, long-billed curlew and Eskimocurlew are becoming very rare. All the water birds that are killed asgame birds have been greatly reduced in numbers during the past 25years. I have not seen a wood-duck in 5 years. _The prairie chicken_ hasentirely disappeared from this locality. A few are still seen in thesand hills of western Kansas, and they are still comparatively abundantalong the extreme southwestern line, and in northern Oklahoma and theTexas panhandle.--(C.H. Smyth, Wichita.)Yellow-legged plover, golden plover; Hudsonian and Eskimo curlew,prairie chicken.--(James Howard, Wichita.)LOUISIANA:Ivory-billed woodpecker, butterball, bufflehead. The wood-duck isgreatly diminishing every year, and if not completely protected, tenyears hence no wood-duck will be found in Louisiana.--(Frank M. Miller,and G.E. Beyer, New Orleans.)Ivory-billed woodpecker, sandhill crane, whooping crane, pinnatedgrouse, American and snowy egret where unprotected.--(E.A. McIlhenny,Avery Island.)MAINE:Wood-duck, upland plover, purple martin, house wren, pileatedwoodpecker, bald eagle, yellow-legs, great blue heron, Canada goose,redhead and canvasback duck.--(John F. Sprague, Dover.)Puffin, Leach's petrel, eider duck, laughing gull, great blue heron,fish-hawk and bald eagle.--(Arthur H. Norton, Portland.)MARYLAND:Curlew, pileated woodpecker, summer duck, snowy heron. No record ofsandhill crane for the last 35 years. Greater yellow-leg is much scarcerthan formerly, also Bartramian sandpiper. The only two birds which showan _increase_ in the past few years are the robin and lesser scaup.General protection of the robin has caused its increase; stopping ofspring shooting in the North has probably caused the increase of thelatter. As a general proposition I think I can say that all birds arebecoming scarcer in this state, as we have laws that do not protect,little enforcement of same, no revenue for bird protection and toolittle public interest. We are working to change all this, but it comesslowly. _The public fails to respond until the birds are 'most gone_,and we have a pretty good lot of game still left. The members of theOrder Gallinae are only holding their own where privately protected. Themembers of the Plover Family and what are known locally as shore birdsare still plentiful on the shores of Chincoteague and Assateague, andalthough they do not breed there as formerly, so far as I know there areno species exterminated.--(Talbott Denmead, Baltimore.)MASSACHUSETTS:Wood-duck, hooded merganser, blue-winged teal, upland plover; curlew(perhaps already gone); red-tailed hawk (I have not seen one inMiddlesex County for several years); great horned owl (almost gone in mycounty, Middlesex); house wren. The eave swallows and purple martins arefast deserting eastern Massachusetts and the barn swallows steadilydiminishing in numbers. The bald eagle should perhaps be included here.I seldom see or hear of it now.--(William Brewster, Cambridge.)Upland plover, woodcock, wood-duck (recent complete protection ishelping these somewhat), heath hen, piping plover, golden plover, a goodmany song and insectivorous birds are apparently decreasing ratherrapidly; for instance, the eave swallow.--(William P. Wharton, Groton.)MICHIGAN:Wood-duck, limicolae, woodcock, sandhill crane. The great whooping craneis not a wild bird, but I think it is now practically extinct. Many ofour warblers and song birds are now exceedingly rare. Ruffed grousegreatly decreased during the past 10 years.--(W.B. Mershon, Saginaw.)MINNESOTA:The sandhill crane has been killed by sportsmen. I have not seen one inthree years. Where there were, a few years ago, thousands of blueherons, egrets, wood ducks, redbirds, and Baltimore orioles, all thosebirds are now almost extinct in this state. They are being killed byAustrians and Italians, who slaughter everything that flies or moves.Robins, too, will be a rarity if more severe penalties are not imposed.I have seized 22 robins, 1 pigeon hawk, 1 crested log-cock, 4woodpeckers and 1 grosbeak in one camp, at the Lertonia mine, all beingprepared for eating. I have also caught them preparing and eating seagulls, terns, blue heron, egret and even the bittern. I have secured 128convictions since the first of last September.--(George E. Wood, GameWarden, Hibbing, Minnesota.)From Robert Page Lincoln, Minneapolis.--Partridge are waning fast, quailgradually becoming extinct, prairie chickens almost extinct.Duck-shooting is rare. The gray squirrel is fast becoming extinct inMinnesota. Mink are going fast, and fur-bearing animals generally arebecoming extinct. The game is passing so very rapidly that it will soonbe a thing of the forgotten past. The quail are suffering most. Thefalling off is amazing, and inconceivable to one who has not looked itup. Duck-shooting is rare, the clubs are idle for want of birds. Whatducks come down fly high, being harassed coming down from the north. Iconsider the southern Minnesota country practically cleaned out.MISSOURI:The birds threatened with extermination are the American woodcock,wood-duck, snowy egret, pinnated grouse, wild turkey, ruffed grouse,golden eagle, bald eagle, pileated woodpecker.MONTANA:Blue grouse.--(Henry Avare, Helena.)Sage grouse, prairie and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse, trumpeter swan,Canada goose, in fact, most of the water-fowl. The sickle-billed curlew,of which there were many a few years ago, is becoming scarce. There areno more golden or black-bellied plover in these parts.--(Harry P.Stanford, Kalispell.)Curlew, Franklin grouse (fool hen) and sage grouse.--W.R. Felton, MilesCity.Sage grouse.--(L.A. Huffman, Miles City.)Ptarmigan, wood-duck, sharp-tailed grouse, sage grouse, fool hen andplover. All game birds are becoming scarce as the country becomessettled and they are confined to uninhabited regions.--(Prof. M.J.Elrod, Missoula.)NEBRASKA:Grouse, prairie chicken and quail.--(H.N. Miller, Lincoln.)Whistling swan.--(Dr. S.G. Towne, Omaha.)NEW HAMPSHIRE:Wood-duck and upland plover.NEW YORK:Quail, woodcock, upland plover, golden plover, black-bellied plover,willet, dowitcher, red-breasted sandpiper, long-billed curlew,wood-duck, purple martin, redheaded woodpecker, mourning dove; graysquirrel, otter.NEW JERSEY:Ruffed grouse, teal, canvasback, red-head duck, widgeon, and all speciesof shore birds, the most noticeable being black-bellied plover,dowitcher, golden plover, killdeer, sickle-bill curlew, upland ploverand English snipe; also the mourning dove.--(James M. Stratton andErnest Napier, Trenton.)Upland plover, apparently killdeer, egret, wood-duck, woodcock, andprobably others.--(B.S. Bowdish, Demarest.)NORTH CAROLINA:Forster's tern, oystercatcher, egret and snowy egret.--(T. GilbertPearson, Sec. Nat. Asso. Audubon Societies.)Ruffed grouse rapidly disappearing; bobwhite becoming scarce.--(E.L.Ewbank, Hendersonville.)Perhaps American and snowy egret. If long-billed curlew is not extinct,it seems due to become so. No definite, reliable record of it later than1885.--(H.H. Brimley, Raleigh.)NORTH DAKOTA:Wood-duck, prairie hen, upland plover, sharp-tailed grouse, canvas-back,pinnated and ruffed grouse, double-crested cormorant, blue heron,long-billed curlew, whooping crane and white pelican.--(W.B. Bell,Agricultural College.)Upland plover, marbled godwit, Baird's sparrow, chestnut-collaredlongspur.--(Alfred Eastgate, Tolna.)OHIO:White heron, pileated woodpecker (if not already extinct). White heronreported a number of times last year; occurrences in Sandusky, Huron,Ashtabula and several other counties during 1911.

Chambers,State Game Warden, Salt Lake City.)VERMONT:If all states afforded as good protection as does Vermont, none; butmigrating birds like woodcock are now threatened.--(John W. Tilcomb,State Game Warden, Lyndonville.)VIRGINIA:Pheasants (ruffed grouse), wild turkey and other game birds are nearlyextinct. A few bears remain, and deer in small numbers in remotesections. In fact, all animals show great reduction in numbers, owing tocutting down forests, and constant gunning.--(L.T. Christian, Richmond.)WEST VIRGINIA:Wood-duck, wild turkey, northern raven, dickcissel.--(Rev. Earle A.Brooks, Weston.)Wild turkeys are very scarce, also ducks. Doves, once numerous, nowalmost _nil_. Eagles, except a few in remote fastnesses. Many nativesong-birds are retreating before the English sparrow.--(William PerryBrown, Glenville.)Wood-duck and wild turkey.--(J.A. Viquesney, Belington.)WISCONSIN:Double-crested cormorant, upland plover, white pelican, long-billedcurlew, lesser snow goose, Hudsonian curlew, sandhill crane, goldenplover, woodcock, dowitcher and long-billed duck; spruce grouse, knot,prairie sharp-tailed grouse, marbled godwit and bald eagle. All these,formerly abundant, must now be called rare in Wisconsin.--(Prof. GeorgeE. Wagner, Madison.)Common tern, knot, American white pelican, Hudsonian godwit, trumpeterswan, long-billed curlew, snowy heron, Hudsonian curlew, Americanavocet, prairie sharp-tailed grouse, dowitcher, passenger pigeon.Long-billed dowitcher and northern hairy woodpecker.--(Henry L. Ward,Milwaukee Public Museum.)Wood-duck, ruddy duck, black mallard, grebe or hell-diver, tern andwoodcock.--(Fred. Gerhardt, Madison.)WYOMING:Sage grouse and sharp-tailed grouse are becoming extinct, both inWyoming and North Dakota. Sheridan and Johnson Counties (Wyoming) havesage grouse protected until 1915. The miners (mostly foreigners) are outafter rabbits at all seasons. To them everything that flies, walks orswims, large enough to be seen, is a "rabbit." They are even worse thanthe average sheep-herder, as he will seldom kill a bird brooding heryoung, but to one of those men, a wren or creeper looks like a turkey.Antelope, mountain sheep and grizzly bears are _going_, fast! The mooseseason opens in 1915, for a 30 days open season, then close season until1920.--(Howard Eaton, Wolf.)Sage grouse, blue grouse, curlew, sandhill crane, porcupine practicallyextinct; wolverine and pine marten nearly all gone.--(S.N. Leek,Jackson's Hole.)CANADAALBERTA:Swainson's buzzard and sandhill crane are now practically extinct. Elkand antelope will soon be as extinct as the buffalo.--(Arthur G.Wooley-Dod, Calgary.)BRITISH COLUMBIA:Wild fowl are in the greatest danger in the southern part of theProvince, especially the wood-duck. Otherwise birds are increasingrather than otherwise, especially the small non-game birds. The seaotter is almost extinct.--(A. Bryan Williams, Provincial Game Warden,Vancouver.)MANITOBA:Whooping crane, wood-duck and golden plover. Other species begin to showa marked increase, due to our stringent protective measures. Forexample, the pinnated grouse and sharp-tailed grouse are more plentifulthan in 15 years. Prong-horned antelope and wolf are threatened withextinction.--(J.P. Turner, Winnipeg.)The game birds indigenous to this Province are fairly plentiful. Thoughthe prairie chicken was very scarce some few years ago, these birds havebecome very plentiful again, owing to the strict enforcement of ourpresent "Game Act." The elk are in danger of becoming extinct if theyare not stringently guarded. Beaver and otter were almost extinct somefew years ago, but are now on the increase, owing to a strictenforcement of the "Game Act."--(Charles Barber, Winnipeg.)NEW BRUNSWICK:Partridge, plover and woodcock. Moose and deer are getting moreplentiful every year.--(W.W. Gerard, St. John.)NOVA SCOTIA:The Canada grouse may possibly become extinct in Nova Scotia, unless theprotection it now enjoys can save it. The American golden plover, whichformerly came in immense flocks, is now very rare. Snowflakes are verymuch less common than formerly, but I think this is because our wintersare now usually much less severe. The caribou is almost extinct on themainland of Nova Scotia, but is still found in North Cape Breton Island.The wolf has become excessively rare, but as it is found in NewBrunswick, it may occur here at any time again. The beaver had beenthreatened with extinction; but since being protected, it hasmultiplied, and is now on a fairly safe footing again.--(Curator ofMuseum, Halifax.)ONTARIO:Quail are getting scarce.--(E. Tinsley, Toronto.)Wood-duck, bob white, woodcock, golden plover, Hudsonian curlew, knotand dowitcher [are threatened with extinction.]--(C.W. Nash, Toronto.)PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND:The species threatened with extinction are the golden plover, Americanwoodcock, pied-billed grebe, red-throated loon, sooty shearwater,gadwall, ruddy duck, black-crowned night heron, Hudsonian godwit,kildeer, northern pileated woodpecker, chimney swift, yellow-belliedflycatcher, red-winged blackbird, pine finch, magnolia warbler,ruby-crowned kinglet.--(E.T. Carbonell, Charlottetown.)In closing the notes of this survey, I repeat my assurance that they arenot offered on a basis of infallibility. It would require years of workto obtain answers from forty-eight states to the three questions that Ihave asked that could be offered as absolutely exact. All these reportsare submitted on the well-recognized court-testimony basis,--"to thebest of our knowledge and belief." Gathered as they have been frompersons whose knowledge is good, these opinions are therefore valuable;and they furnish excellent indices of wild-life conditions as they existin 1912 in the various states and provinces of North America north ofMexico.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER VITHE REGULAR ARMY OF DESTRUCTIONIn order to cure any disease, the surgeon must make of it a correctdiagnosis. It is useless to try to prescribe remedies without a thoroughunderstanding of the trouble.That the best and most interesting wild life of America is disappearingat a rapid rate, we all know only too well. That proposition is entirelybeyond the domain of argument. The fact that a species or a group ofspecies has made a little gain here and there, or is stationary, doesnot sensibly diminish the force of the descending blow. The wild-lifesituation is full of surprises. For example, in 1902 I was astounded bythe extent to which bird life had decreased over the 130 miles betweenMiles City, Montana, and the Missouri River since 1886; for there was noreason to expect anything of the kind. Even the jack rabbits and coyoteshad almost totally disappeared.The duties of the present hour, that fairly thrust themselves into ourfaces and will not be put aside, are these:_First_,--To save valuable species from extermination!_Second_,--To preserve a satisfactory representation of our once richfauna, to hand down to Posterity._Third_,--To protect the farmer and fruit grower from the enormouslosses that the destruction of our insectivorous and rodent-eating birdsis now inflicting upon both the producer and consumer._Fourth_,--To protect our forests, by protecting the birds that keepdown the myriads of insects that are destructive to trees and shrubs._Fifth_,--To preserve to the future sportsmen of America enough game andfish that they may have at least a taste of the legitimate pursuit ofgame in the open that has made life so interesting to the sportsmen ofto-day.For any civilized nation to exterminate valuable and interesting speciesof wild mammals, birds or fishes is more than a disgrace. It is a crime!We have no right, legal, moral or commercial, to exterminate anyvaluable or interesting species; because none of them belong to us, toexterminate or not, as we please.For the people of any civilized nation to permit the slaughter of thewild birds that protect its crops, its fruits and its forests from theinsect hordes, is worse than folly. It is sheer orneryness and idiocy.People who are either so lazy or asinine as to permit the slaughter oftheir best friends deserve to have their crops destroyed and theirforests ravaged. They deserve to pay twenty cents a pound for theircotton when the boll weevil has cut down the normal supply.It is very desirable that we should now take an inventory of the forcesthat have been, and to-day are, active in the destruction of our wildbirds, mammals, and game fishes. During the past ten years a sufficientquantity of facts and figures has become available to enable us tosecure a reasonably full and accurate view of the whole situation. As wepause on our hill-top, and survey the field of carnage, we find that weare reviewing the _Army of Destruction_!It is indeed a motley array. We see true sportsmen beside ordinarygunners, game-hogs and meat hunters; handsome setter dogs are mixed upwith coyotes, cats, foxes and skunks; and well-gowned women and ladies'maids are jostled by half-naked "poor-white" and black-negro "plumehunters."Verily, the destruction of wild life makes strange companions.Let us briefly review the several army corps that together make up thearmy of the destroyers. Space in this volume forbids an extended noticeof each. Unfortunately it is impossible to segregate some of theseclasses, and number each one, for they merge together too closely forthat; but we can at least describe the several classes that form thegreat mass of destroyers.THE GENTLEMEN SPORTSMEN.--These men are the very bone and sinew of wildlife preservation. These are the men who have red blood in their veins,who annually hear the red gods calling, who love the earth, themountains, the woods, the waters and the sky. These are the men to whom"the bag" is a matter of small importance, and to whom "the bag-limit"has only academic interest; because in nine cases out of ten they do notcare to kill all that the law allows. The tenth and exceptional time iswhen the bag limit is "one." A gentleman sportsman is a man who protectsgame, stops shooting when he has "enough"--without reference to thelegal bag-limit, and whenever a species is threatened with extinction,he conscientiously refrains from shooting it.The true sportsmen of the world are the men who once were keen in thestubble or on the trail, but who have been halted by the generalslaughter and the awful decrease of game. Many of them, long before ahair has turned gray, have hung up their guns forever, and turned to thecamera. These are the men who are willing to hand out checks, or toleave their mirth and their employment and go to the firing line attheir state capitols, to lock horns with the bull-headed killers of wildlife who recognize no check or limit save the law.These are the men who have done the most to put upon our statute booksthe laws that thus far have saved some of our American game from totalannihilation, and who (so we firmly believe) will be chieflyinstrumental in tightening the lines of protection around the remnant.These are the men who are making and stocking game preserves, public andprivate, great and small.[Illustration:THE REGULAR ARMY OF DESTRUCTION, WAITING FOR THE FIRST OF OCTOBEREach Year 2,642,274 Well-Armed Men Take the Field Against the Remnantof Wild Birds and Mammals In the United States.Drawn by Dan Beard]If you wish to know some of these men, I will tell you where to find agoodly number of them; and when you find them, you will also find thatthey are men you would enjoy camping with! Look in the membership listsof the Boone and Crockett Club, Camp-Fire Club of America, the Lewis andClark Club of Pittsburgh, the New York State League, the Shikar Club ofLondon, the Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of theBritish Empire, the Massachusetts Fish and Game Protective Association,the Springfield (Mass.) Sportsmen's Association, the Camp-Fire Clubs ofDetroit and Chicago, and the North American Fish and Game ProtectiveAssociation.There are other bodies of sportsmen that I would like to name, werespace available, but to set down here a complete list is quiteimpossible.The best and the most of the game-protective laws now in force in theUnited States and Canada were brought into existence through theinitiative and efforts of the real sportsmen of those two nations. Butfor their activity, exerted on the right side, the settled portion ofNorth America would to-day be an utterly gameless land! Even though thesportsmen have taken their toll of the wilds, they have made the lawsthat have saved a remnant of the game until 1912.For all that, however, every man who still shoots game is a soldier inthe Army of Destruction! There is no blinking that fact. Such men do notstand on the summit with the men who now protect the game _and do notshoot at all!_ The millions of men who do not shoot, and who also _donothing to protect or preserve wild life_, do not count! In this warfarethey are merely ciphers in front of the real figures.THE GUNNERS, WHO KILL TO THE LIMIT.--Out of the enormous mass of men whoannually take up arms against the remnant of wild life, _and are called"sportsmen_," I believe that only one out of every 500 _conscientiously_stops shooting when game becomes scarce, and extinction is impending.All of the others feel that it is right and proper to kill all the gamethat they can kill _up to the legal bag limit_. It is the reasoning ofShylock:"Justice demands it, and _the law_ doth give it!"Especially is this true of the men who pay their _one dollar_ per yearfor a resident hunting license, and feel that in doing so they have donea great Big Thing!This is a very deadly frame of mind. Ethically it is _entirely wrong_;and at least two million men and boys who shoot American game must beshown that it is wrong! This is the spirit of Extermination, clothed inthe robes of Law and Justice.Whenever and wherever game birds are so scarce that a good shot whohunts hard during a day in the fields finds only three or four birds, heshould _stop shooting at once, and devote his mind and energies to theproblem of bringing back the game!_ It is strange that conditions do notmake this duty clear to every conscientious citizen.The Shylock spirit which prompts a man to kill all that "the law allows"is a terrible scourge to the wild life of America, and to the world atlarge. It is the spirit of extermination according to law. Even thekilling of game for the market is not so great a scourge as this; forthis spirit searches out the game in every nook and cranny of the world,and spares not. In effect it says: "If the law is defective, it is rightfor me to take every advantage of it! I do not need to have anyconscience in the matter outside _the letter of the law_."The extent to which this amazing spirit prevails is positively awful.You will find it among pseudo game-protectors to a paralyzing extent! Itis the great gunner's paradox, and it pervades this country from cornerto corner. No: there is no use in trying to "educate" the mass of thehunters of America out of it, as a means of saving the game; forpositively it can not be done! Do not waste time in trying it. If yourely upon it, you will be doing a great wrong to wild life, andpromoting extermination. The only remedy is _sweeping laws, for longclose seasons, for a great many species_. Forget the paltrydollar-a-year license money. The license fees never represent more thana tenth part of the value of the game that is killed under licenses.The savage desire to kill "all that the law allows" often is manifestedin men in whom we naturally expect to find a very different spirit. Byway of illumination, I offer three cases out of the many that I couldstate.Case No. 1. _The Duck Breeder_.--A gentleman of my acquaintance hasspent several years and much money in breeding wild ducks. From myrelations with him, I had acquired the belief that he was a great loverof ducks, and at least wished all species well. One whizzing cold day inwinter he called upon me, and stated that he had been duck-hunting;which surprised me. He added, "I have just spent two days on Great SouthBay, and I made a great killing. _In the two days I got ninety-fourducks!"_I said, "How _could_ you do it,--caring for wild ducks as you do?""Well, I had hunted ducks twice before on Great South Bay and didn'thave very good luck; but this time the cold weather drove the ducks in,and I got square with them!"Case No. 2. _The Ornithologist_.--A short time ago the news waspublished in _Forest and Stream_, that a well-known ornithologist haddistinguished himself in one of the mid-western states by the skill hehad displayed in bagging thirty-four ducks in one day, greatly to theenvy of the natives; and if this shoe fits any American naturalist, heis welcome to put it on and wear it.Case No. 3. _The Sportsman_.--A friend of mine in the South is the ownerof a game preserve in which wild ducks are at times very numerous. Onceupon a time he was visited by a northern sportsmen who takes a deep andabiding interest in the preservation of game. The sportsman was invitedto go out duck-shooting; ducks being then in season there. He said:"Yes, I will go; and I want you to put me in a place where I can kill a_hundred ducks in a day_! I never have done that yet, and I would liketo do it, once!""All right," said my friend, "I can put you in such a place; and if youcan shoot well enough, you can kill a hundred ducks in a day."The effort was made in all earnestness. There was much shooting, but fewwere the ducks that fell before it. In concluding this story my friendremarked in a tone of disgust:"All the game-preserving sportsmen that come to me are just like that!_They want to kill all they can kill_!"There is a blood-test by which to separate the conscientious sportsmenfrom the mere gunners. Here it is:A _sportsman_ stops shooting when game becomes scarce; and he does notobject to long-close-season laws; butA _gunner_ believes in killing "all that the law allows;" and _heobjects to long close seasons_!I warrant that whenever and wherever this test is applied it willseparate the sheep from the goats. It applies in all America, all Asiaand Africa, and in Greenland, with equal force.[Illustration: G.O. SHIELDSA Notable Defender of Wild Life]THE GAME-HOG.--This term was coined by G.O. Shields, in 1897, when hewas editor and owner of _Recreation Magazine_, and it has come intogeneral use. It has been recognized by a judge on the bench as being anappropriate term to apply to all men who selfishly slaughter wild gamebeyond the limits of decency. Although it is a harsh term, and wasmercilessly used by Mr. Shields in his fierce war on the men whoslaughtered game for "sport," it has jarred at least a hundred thousandmen into their first realization of the fact that to-day there is adifference between decency and indecency in the pursuit of game. The useof the term has done _very great good_; but, strange to say, it has madefor Mr. Shields a great many enemies _outside_ the ranks of thegame-hogs themselves! From this one might fairly suppose that there issuch a thing as a sympathetic game-hog!One thing at least is certain. During a period of about six years, whilehis war with the game-hogs was on, from Maine to California, Mr.Shields's name became a genuine terror to excessive killers of game; andit is reasonably certain that his war saved a great number of game birdsfrom the slaughter that otherwise would have overtaken them!The number of armed men and boys who annually take the field in theUnited States in the pursuit of birds and quadrupeds, is enormous.People who do not shoot have no conception of it; and neither do theycomprehend the mechanical perfection and fearful deadliness of theweapons used. This feature of the situation can hardly be realized untilsome aspect of it is actually seen.I have been at some pains to collect the latest figures showing thenumber of hunting licenses issued in 1911, but the total is incomplete.In some states the figures are not obtainable, and in some states thereare no hunters' license laws. The figures of hunting licenses issued in1911 that I have obtained from official sources are set forth below.THE UNITED STATES ARMY OF DESTRUCTION_Hunting Licenses issued in_ 1911Alabama               5,090          Montana              59,291California          138,689          Nebraska             39,402Colorado             41,058          New Hampshire        33,542Connecticut          19,635          New Jersey           61,920Idaho                50,342          New Mexico            7,000Illinois            192,244          New York            150,222Indiana              54,813          Rhode Island          6,541Iowa                 91,000          South Dakota         31,054Kansas               44,069          Utah                 27,800Louisiana            76,000          Vermont              31,762Maine                 2,552          Washington, about    40,000Massachusetts        45,039          Wisconsin           138,457Michigan             22,323          Wyoming               9,721Missouri             66,662                                                       ---------            Total number of regularly licensed gunners 1,486,228The average for the twenty-seven states that issued licenses as shownabove is 55,046 for each state.Now, the twenty-one states issuing no licenses, or not reporting,produced in 1911 fully as many gunners per capita as did the othertwenty-seven states. Computed fairly on existing averages they must haveturned out a total of 1,155,966 gunners, making for all the UnitedStates =2,642,194= armed men and boys warring upon the remnant of gamein 1911. We are not counting the large number of lawless hunters whonever take out licenses. Now, is Mr. Beard's picture a truthfulpresentation, or not?_New York_ with only deer, ruffed grouse, shore-birds, ducks and a veryfew woodcock to shoot annually puts into the field 150,222 armed men. In1909 they killed about _9,000 deer!__New Jersey_, spending 30,000 in 1912 in efforts to restock her coverswith game, and with a population of 2,537,167, sent out in 1911 a totalarmy of 61,920 well-armed gunners. How can any of her game survive?_New Hampshire_, with only 430,572 population, has 33,542 licensedhunters,--equal to _thirty-three regiments of full strength!__Vermont_, with 355,956 people, sends out annually an army of 31,762 menwho hunt according to law; and in 1910 they killed 3,649 deer._Utah_, with only 373,351 population, had 27,800 men in the field afterher very small remnant of game! How can any wild thing of Utah escape?_Montana_, population 376,053, had in 1911 an army of 59,291 well-armedmen, warring chiefly upon the big game, and swiftly exterminating it.How long can any of the big game stand before the army of _two andone-half million well-armed men_, eager and keen to kill, and out to getan equivalent for their annual expenditure in guns, ammunition and otherexpenses?In addition to the hunters themselves, they are assisted by thousands ofexpert guides, thousands of horses, thousands of dogs, hundreds ofautomobiles and hundreds of thousands of tents. Each big-game hunter hasan experienced guide who knows the haunts and habits of the game, thebest feeding grounds, the best trails, and everything else that will aidthe hunter in taking the game at a disadvantage and destroying it. Thebig-game rifles are of the highest power, the longest range, thegreatest accuracy and the best repeating mechanism that modern inventivegenius can produce. It is said that in Wyoming the Maxim silencer is nowbeing used. England has produced a weapon of a new type, called "thescatter rifle," which is intended for use on ducks. The best binocularsare used in searching out the game, and horses carry the hunters andguides as near as possible to the game. For bears, baits are freelyused, and in the pursuit of pumas, dogs are employed to the limit of theavailable supply.The deadliness of the automobile in hunting already is so apparent thatNorth Dakota has wisely and justly forbidden their use by law, (1911).The swift machine enables city gunmen to penetrate game regions theycould not reach with horses, and hunt through from four to sixlocalities per day, instead of one only, as formerly. The use ofautomobiles in hunting should be everywhere prohibited.Every appliance and assistance that money can buy, the modern sportsmansecures to help him against the game. The game is beset during itsbreeding season by various wild enemies,--foxes, cats, wolves, pumas,lynxes, eagles, and many other predatory species. The only help that itreceives is in the form of an annual close season--_which thus far hassaved in America only a few local moose, white-tailed deer and a fewgame birds, from steady and sure extermination_._The bag limits on which vast reliance is placed to preserve the wildgame, are a fraud, a delusion and a snare_! The few local exceptionsonly prove the generality of the rule. In every state, without onesingle exception, the bag limits are far too high, and the laws are ofdeadly liberality. In many states, the bag limit laws on birds are anabsolute dead letter. Fancy the 125 wardens of New York enforcing thebag-limit laws on 150,000 gunners! It is this horrible condition that isenabling the licensed army of destruction to get in its deadly work onthe game, all over the world. In America, the over-liberality of thelaws are to blame for two-thirds of the carnival of slaughter, and thesuccessful evasions of the law are responsible for the other third.[Illustration: TWO GUNNERS OF KANSAS CITYWho Believe in Killing all That the Law Allows. They are not so Much toBlame as the System That Permits Such Slaughter. (Note the Pump Guns)][Illustration: WHY THE SANDHILL CRANE IS BECOMING EXTINCTNineteen of Them Killed as "Game" by Three Gunners. Note the Machine Gun.]The only remedy for the present extermination of game according to lawthat so rapidly and so furiously is proceeding all over the UnitedStates, Canada, Alaska, and Africa, is ten-year close seasons on all thespecies threatened with extinction, and immensely reduced open seasonsand bag limits on all the others.Will the people who still have wild game take heed now, and clamp downthe brakes, hard and fast before it is too late, or will they have theirgame exterminated?Shall we have five-year close seasons, or close seasons of 500 years? Wemust take our choice.Shall we hand down to our children a gameless continent, with all theshame that such a calamity will entail?We have _got_ to answer these questions like men, or they will soon beanswered for us by the extermination of the wild life. For twenty-fiveyears we have been smarting under the disgrace of the extermination ofour bison millions. Let us not repeat the dose through the destructionof other species.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER VIITHE GUERRILLAS OF DESTRUCTIONWe have now to deal with THE GUERRILLAS OF DESTRUCTION.In warfare, a _guerrilla, or bushwhacker_, is an armed man whorecognizes none of the rules of civilized warfare, and very often has nocommander. In France he is called a "franc-tireur," or free-shooter. Theguerrilla goes out to live on the country, to skulk, to war on the weak,and never attack save from ambush, or when the odds clearly are on hisside. His military status is barely one remove from that of the spy.The meat-shooters who harry the game and other wild life in order to useit as a staple food supply; the Italians, negroes and others who shootsong-birds as food; the plume-hunters and the hide-and-tusk hunters allover the world are the guerrillas of the Army of Destruction. Let usconsider some of these grand divisions in detail.Here is an inexorable law of Nature, to which there are no exceptions:_No wild species of bird, mammal, reptile or fish can withstandexploitation for commercial purposes_.The men who pursue wild creatures for the money or other value there isin them, never give up. They work at slaughter when other men areenjoying life, or are asleep. If they are persistent, no species onwhich they fix the Evil Eye escapes extermination at their hands.Does anyone question this statement? If so let him turn backward andlook at the lists of dead and dying species.THE DIVISION OF MEAT-SHOOTERS contains all men who sordidly shoot forthe frying-pan,--to save bacon and beef at the expense of the public, orfor the markets. There are a few wilderness regions so remote and sodifficult of access that the transportation of meat into them is amatter of much difficulty and expense. There are a very few men in NorthAmerica who are justified in "living off the country," _for shortperiods_. The genuine prospectors always have been counted in thisclass; but all miners who are fully located, all lumbermen andrailway-builders certainly are not in the prospector's class. They areabundantly able to maintain continuous lines of communication for thetransit of beef and mutton.Of all the meat-shooters, the market-gunners who prey on wild fowl andground game birds for the big-city markets are the most deadly to wildlife. Enough geese, ducks, brant, quail, ruffed grouse, prairiechickens, heath hens and wild pigeons have been butchered by gunners andnetters for "the market" to have stocked the whole world. No sectioncontaining a good supply of game has escaped. In the United States thegreat slaughtering-grounds have been Cape Cod; Great South Bay, NewYork; Currituck Sound, North Carolina; Marsh Island, Louisiana; thesouthwest corner of Louisiana; the Sunk Lands of Arkansas; the lakeregions of Minnesota; the prairies of the whole middle West; Great SaltLake; the Klamath Lake region (Oregon) and southern California.[Illustration: A MARKET GUNNER AT WORK ON MARSH ISLANDKilling Mallards for the New Orleans Market. The Purchase of This Island byMrs. Russell Sage has now Converted it Into a Bird Sanctuary]The output of this systematic bird slaughter has supplied the greedygame markets of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore,Chicago, New Orleans, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, San Francisco,Portland, and Seattle. The history of this industry, its methods, itscarnage, its profits and its losses would make a volume, but we can notenter upon it here. Beyond reasonable doubt, this awful traffic in deadgame is responsible for at least three-fourths of the slaughter that hasreduced our game birds to a mere remnant of their former abundance.There is no influence so deadly to wild life as that of the marketgunner who works six days a week, from sunrise until sunset, huntingdown and killing every game bird that he can reach with a choke-boregun.During the past five years, several of the once-great killing groundshave been so thoroughly "shot out" that they have ceased to hold theirformer rank. This is the case with the Minnesota Lakes, the Sunk Landsof Arkansas, the Klamath Lakes of Oregon, and I think it is also true ofsouthern California. The Klamath Lakes have been taken over by theGovernment as a bird refuge. Currituck Sound, at the northeastern cornerof North Carolina, has been so bottled up by the Bayne law of New YorkState that Currituck's greatest market has been cut off. Last year onlyone-half the usual number of ducks and geese were killed; and alreadymany "professional" duck and brant shooters have abandoned the businessbecause the commission merchants no longer will buy dead birds.[Illustration: RUFFED GROUSEA Common Victim of Illegal Slaughter]Very many enormous bags of game have been made in a day by marketgunners: but rarely have they published any of their records. Thegreatest kill of which I ever have heard occurred under the auspices ofthe Glenn County Club, in southern California, on February 5, 1906. Twomen, armed with automatic shot-guns, fired five shots apiece, and gotten geese out of one flock. In one hour they killed _two hundred andeighteen geese_, and their bag for the day was _four hundred and fiftygeese!_ The shooter who wrote the story for publication (on February 12,at Willows, Glenn County, California) said: "It being warm weather, thebirds had to be shipped at once in order to keep them from spoiling." Aphotograph was made of the "one hour's slaughter" of two hundred andeighteen geese, and it was published in a western magazine with"C.H.B.'s" story, nearly all of which will be found in Chapter XV.The reasons why market shooting is so deadly destructive to wild lifeare not obscure.The true sportsman hunts during a very few days only each year. Themarket gunners shoot early and late, six days a week, month after month.When game is abundant, the price is low, and a great quantity must bekilled in order to make it pay well. When game is scarce, the marketprices are high, and the shooter makes the utmost exertions to find thelast of the game in order to secure the "big money."When game is protected by law, thousands of people with money desire itfor their tables, just the same, and are willing to pay fabulous pricesfor what they want, when they want it. Many a dealer is quite willing torun the risk of fines, because fines don't really hurt; they are onlyannoying. The dealer wishes to make the big profit, and _retain hiscustomers_; "and besides," he reasons, "if I don't supply him some oneelse will; so what is the difference?"When game is scarce, prices high and the consumer's money ready, thereare a hundred tricks to which shooters and dealers willingly resort toship and receive unlawful game without detection. It takes the verybest kind of game wardens,--genuine detectives, in fact,--to ferret outthese cunning illegal practices, and catch lawbreakers "with the goodson them," so that they can be punished. Mind you, convictions can not besecured at _both_ ends of the line save by the most extraordinary goodfortune, and usually the shooter and shipper escape, even when thedealer is apprehended and fined.[Illustration: A PERFECTLY LAWFUL BAG OF 58 RUFFED GROUSE FOR TWO MENFrom "Rod and Gun in Canada"]Here are some of the methods that have been practiced in the past ingetting illegal game into the New York market:Ruffed grouse and quail have both been shipped in butter firkins, marked"butter"; and latterly, butter has actually been packed solidly on topof the birds.Ruffed grouse and quail very often have been shipped in egg crates,marked "eggs." They have been shipped in trunks and suit cases,--a verycommon method for illegal game birds, all over the United States. InOklahoma when a man refuses to open his trunk for a game warden, thewarden joyously gets out his brace and bitt, and bores an inch hole intothe lower story of the trunk. If dead birds are there, the tell-taleauger quickly reveals them.Three years ago, I was told that certain milk-wagons on Long Island madedaily collections of dead ducks intended for the New York market, andthe drivers kindly shipped them by express from the end of the route.Once upon a time, a New York man gave notice that on a certain date hewould be in a certain town in St. Lawrence County, New York, with apalace horse-car, "to buy horses." Car and man appeared there asadvertised. Very ostentatiously, he bought one horse, and had it takenaboard the car before the gaze of the admiring populace. At night, whenthe A.P. had gone to bed, many men appeared, and into the horseless endof that car, they loaded thousands of ruffed grouse. The game warden whodescribed the incident to me said: "That man pulled out for New Yorkwith one horse and _half a car load of ruffed grouse_!"Whenever a good market exists for the sale of game, as sure as the worldthat market will be supplied. Twenty-six states forbid by law the saleof _their own_ "protected" game, but twenty of them do _not_ expresslyprohibit the sale of game stolen from neighboring states! That is _avery, very weak point in the laws of all those states_. A child can seehow it works. Take Pittsburgh as a case in point.In the winter and spring of 1912 the State Game Commission ofPennsylvania found that quail and ruffed grouse were being sold inPittsburgh, in large quantities. The state laws were well enforced, andit was believed that the birds were not being killed in Pennsylvania.Some other state was being _robbed_!The Game Commission went to work, and in a very short time certaingame-dealers of Pittsburgh were arrested. At first they tried to blufftheir way out of their difficulty, and even went as far as to bringcharges against the game-warden whom the Commission had instructed tobuy some of their illegal game, and pay for it. But the net of the lawtightened upon them so quickly and so tightly that they threw up theirhands and begged for mercy.It was found that those Pittsburgh game-dealers were selling quail andgrouse that had been stolen in thousands, from the state of Kentucky!Between the state game laws, working in lovely harmony with the Laceyfederal law that prohibits the shipment of game illegally killed orsold, the whole bad business was laid bare, and signed confessions werepromptly obtained from the shippers in Kentucky.At that very time, a good bill for the better protection of her game wasbefore the Kentucky legislature; and a certain member was vigorouslyopposing it, as he had successfully done in previous years. He was toldthat the state was being robbed, but refused to believe it. Then asigned confession was laid before him, bearing the name of the man whowas instigating his opposition,--his friend,--who confessed that he hadillegally bought and shipped to Pittsburgh over 5,000 birds. Theobjector literally threw up his hands, and said, "I have been _wrong!_Let the bill go through!" And it went.[Illustration: SNOW BUNTINGA Great "Game Bird"! Of These, 8,058 Were Found in 1902in one New York Cold-Storage Warehouse]Before the passage of the Bayne law, New York City was a "fence" for thesale of grouse illegally killed in Massachusetts, Connecticut,Pennsylvania, New Jersey and I know not how many other states. The Baynelaw stopped all that business, abruptly and forever; and if the ruffedgrouse, quail and ducks of the Eastern States are offered for sale inChicago, Cincinnati, Baltimore and Washington, the people of New Yorkand Massachusetts can at least be assured that they are not to blame.Those two states now maintain no "fences" for the sale of game that hasbeen stolen from other states. They have both set their houses in order,and set two examples for forty other states to follow.The remedy for all this miserable game-stealing, law-breaking businessis simple and easily obtained. Let each state of the United States andeach province and Canada _enact a Bayne law, absolutely prohibiting thesale of all wild native game_, and the thing is done! But nothing shortof that will be really effective. It will not do at all to let statelaws rest with merely forbidding the sale of game "protected by theState;" for that law is full of loop-holes. It does much good service,yes; but what earthly _objection_ can there be in any state to theenactment of a law that is sweepingly effective, and which can not beevaded, save through the criminal connivance of officers of the law?By way of illustration, to show what the sale of wild game means to theremnant of our game, and the wicked slaughter of non-game birds to whichit leads, consider these figures:DEAD BIRDS FOUND IN ONE COLD STORAGE HOUSE IN NEW YORK IN 1902.Snow Buntings   8,058Grouse          7,560Sandpipers      7,607Quail           4,385Plover          5,218Ducks           1,756Snipe           7,003Bobolinks         288Yellow-legs       788Woodcock           96The fines for this lot, if imposed, would have amounted to 1,168,315.Shortly after that seizure American quail became so scarce that ineffect they totally disappeared from the banquet tables of New York. Ican not recall having been served with one since 1903, but the littleEgyptian quail can be legally imported and sold when officially tagged.Few persons away from the firing line realize the far-reaching effectsof the sale of wild game. Here are a few flashes from the searchlight:At Hangkow, China, Mr. C. William Beebe found that during his visit in=1911=, over =46,000= pheasants of various species were shipped fromthat port on one cold-storage steamer to the London market. And thiswhen English pheasants were selling in the Covent Garden market at fromtwo to three shillings each, for _fresh_ birds!In =1910=, =1,200= ptarmigan from Norway, bound for the Chicago market,passed through the port of New York,--not by any means the first or thelast shipment of the kind. The epicures of Chicago are being permittedto comb the game out of Norway.In =1910=, =70,000= _dozen_ Egyptian quail were shipped to Europe fromAlexandria, Egypt. Just why that species has not already beenexterminated, is a zoological mystery; but extermination surely willcome some day, and I think it will be in the near future.The coast of China has been raked and scraped for wild ducks to ship toNew York,--prior to the passage of the Bayne law! I have forgotten thefigures that once were given me, but they were an astonishing number ofthousands for the year.The Division of Negroes and Poor Whites who kill song and other birdsindiscriminately will be found in a separate chapter.THE DIVISION OF "RESIDENT" GAME-BUTCHERS.--This refers to the men wholive in the haunts of big game, where wardens are the most of the timetotally absent, and where bucks, does and fawns of hoofed big game maybe killed in season and out of season, with impunity. It includesguides, ranchmen, sheep-herders, cowboys, miners, lumbermen and floatersgenerally. In times past, certain taxidermists of Montana promoted theslaughter of wild bison in the Yellowstone Park, and it was a pair ofrascally taxidermists who killed, or caused to be killed in Lost Park,in 1897, the very last bison of Colorado.It seems to be natural for the minds of men who live in America in thehaunts of big game to drift into the idea that the wild game around themis all theirs. Very few of them recognize the fact that every other man,woman and child in a given state or province has vested rights in itswild game. It is natural for a frontiersman to feel that because he isin the wilds he has a God-given right to live off the country; butto-day _that idea is totally wrong_! If some way can not be found tocurb that all-pervading propensity among our frontiersmen, then we mayas well bid all our open-field big game a long farewell; for the deadly"residents" surely will exterminate it, outside the game preserves. The"residents" are, in my opinion, about ten times more destructive thanthe sportsmen. A sportsman in quest of large game is in the field onlyfrom ten to thirty days; all his movements are known, and all histrophies are seen and counted. His killing is limited by law, and uponhim the law is actually enforced. Often a resident hunts the wholetwelve months of the year,--for food, for amusement, and for trophies tosell. Rarely does a game warden reach his cabin; because the wardens arefew, the distances great and the frontier cabins are widely scattered.Mr. Carl Pickhardt told me of a guide in Newfoundland who had a shed inthe woods hanging full of bodies of caribou, and who admitted to himthat while the law allowed him five caribou each year, he killed eachyear about twenty-five.Mr. J.M. Phillips knows of a mountain in British Columbia, once wellstocked with goats, on which the goats have been completely exterminatedby one man who lives within easy striking distance of them, and whofinds goat meat to his liking.I have been reliably informed that in 1911, at Haha Lake, near GrandeBay, Saguenay District, P.Q., one family of six persons killedthirty-four woodland caribou and six moose. This meant the waste ofabout 14,000 pounds of good meat, and the death of several femaleanimals.In 1886 I knew a man named Owens who lived on the head of Sunday Creek,Montana, who told me that in 1884-5 he killed thirty-five mule deer forhimself and family. The family ate as much as possible, the dogs ate allthey could, and in the spring the remainder spoiled. Now there is not adeer, an antelope, or a sage grouse within fifty miles of that lifelesswaste.Here is a Montana object lesson on the frame of mind of the "resident"hunter, copied from _Outdoor Life_ Magazine (Denver) for February, 1912.It is from a letter to the Editor, written by C.B. Davis.  November 27, 28, 29, and 30, 1911, will remain a red letter day with  a half thousand men for years to come. These half thousand men  gathered along the border of the Yellowstone National Park, near  Gardiner, Montana, at a point known as Buffalo Flats, to exterminate  elk. The snow had driven the elk down to the foothills, and Buffalo  Flats is on the border of the park and outside the park. The elk  entered this little valley for food. Like hungry wolves, shooters,  not hunters, gathered along the border waiting to catch an elk off  the "reservation" and kill it.  On November 27th about 1500 elk crossed the line, and the slaughter  began. I have not the data of the number killed this day, but it was  hundreds.  On the 28th, twenty-two stepped over and were promptly executed.  Like Custer's band, not one escaped. On the evening of the 28th, 600  were sighted just over the line, and the army of 125 brave men  entrenched themselves for the battle which was expected to open next  morning. Before daylight of the 29th the battle began. The elk were  over the line, feeding on Buffalo Flats. One hundred and twenty-five  men poured bullets into this band of 600 elk till the ground was red  with blood and strewn with carcasses, and in their madness they shot  each other. One man was shot through the ear,--a close call; another  received a bullet through his coat sleeve, and another was shot  through the bowels and can't live.  My informer told me he participated in the slaughter, and while he  would not take fifty dollars for what he saw, and the experience he  went through, yet he would not go through it again for 1,000. When  my informer got back to Gardiner that day there were four sleigh  loads of elk, each load containing from twenty to thirty-five elk,  besides thirty-two mules and horses carrying one to two each. This  was only a part of the slaughter. Hundreds more were carried to  other points; and this was only one day's work.  Hundreds of wounded elk wandered back into the park to die, and  others died outside the park. The station at Livingston, Montana,  for a week looked like a packing house. Carcasses were piled up on  the trucks and depot platform. The baggage cars were loaded with elk  going to points east and west of Livingston.  Maybe this is all right. Maybe the government can't stop the elk  from crossing the line. Maybe the elk were helped over; but it  strikes me there is something wrong somewhere.THE DIVISION OF HIRED LABORERS.--The scourge of lumber-camps in big-gameterritory, the mining camps and the railroad-builders is a long story,and if told in detail it would make several chapters. Their awfuldestructiveness is well known. It is a common thing for "the boss" tohire a hunter to kill big game to supply the hungry outfit, and savebeef and pork.The abuses arising from this source easily could be checked, and finallysuppressed. A ten-line law would do the business,--forbidding any personemployed in any camp of sheep men, cattle men, lumbermen, miners,railway laborers or excavators to own or use a rifle in hunting wildgame; and forbidding any employer of labor to feed those laborers, orpermit them to be fed, on the flesh of wild game mammals or birds."Camp" laborers are not "pioneers;" not by a long shot! They aresoldiers of Commerce, and makers of money.A MOUNTAIN SHEEP CASE IN COLORADO.--The state of Colorado sincerelydesires to protect and perpetuate its slender remnant of mountain sheep,but as usual the Lawless Miscreant is abroad to thwart the efforts ofthe guardians of the game. Every state that strives to protect its biggame has such doings as this to contend with:In the winter of 1911-12, a resident poacher brought into Grant,Colorado, a lot of mountain sheep meat _for sale_; and he actually soldit to residents of that town! The price was _six cents per pound_. A lotof it was purchased by the railway station-agent. I have no doubt thatthe same man who did that job, which was made possible only by theco-operation of the citizens of Grant, will try the samepoaching-and-selling game next winter, unless the State GameCommissioner is able to bring him to book.A WYOMING CASE IN POINT.--As a fair sample of what game wardens, and thegeneral public, are sometimes compelled to endure through the improperdecisions of judges, I will cite this case:In the Shoshone Mountains of northern Wyoming, about fifty miles or sofrom the town of Cody, in the winter of 1911-12 a man was engaged intrapping coyotes. It was currently reported that he had been "driven outof Montana and Idaho." He had scores of traps. He baited his traps withthe flesh of deer, elk calves and grouse, all illegally killed andillegally used for that purpose. A man of my acquaintance saw some ofthis game meat actually used as described.The man was a notorious character, and cruel in the extreme. Finally agame warden caught him red-handed, arrested him, and took him to Codyfor trial. It happened that the judge on the bench had once trapped withhim, and therefore "he set the game-killer free, while the game-wardenwas roasted."That wolf-trapper once took into the mountains a horse, to kill and useas bear-bait. The animal was blind in one eye, and because it would notgraze precisely where the wolfer desired it to remain, he deliberatelydestroyed the sight of its good eye, and left it for days, without theability to find water.Think of the fate of any wild animal that unkind Fate places at themercy of such a man!       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER VIIIUNSEEN FOES OF WILD LIFEQuite unintentionally on his part, Man, the arch destroyer and the mostpredatory and merciless of all animal species except the wolves, hasrendered a great service to all the birds that live or nest upon theground. His relentless pursuit and destruction of the savage-tempered,strong-jawed fur-bearing animals is in part the salvation of the groundbirds of to-day and yesterday. If the teeth and claws had been permittedto multiply unchecked down to the present time, with man's warfare onthe upland game proceeding as it has done, scores upon scores of specieslong ere this would have been exterminated.But the slaughter of the millions of North American foxes, wolves,weasels, skunks, and mink has so overwhelmingly reduced the four-footedenemies of the birds that the balance of wild Nature has been preserved.As a rule, the few predatory wild animals that remain are notslaughtering the birds to a serious extent; and for this we may well bethankful.THE DOMESTIC CAT.--In such thickly settled communities as our northernstates, from the Atlantic coast to the sandhills of Kansas and Nebraska,the domestic cat is probably the greatest four-footed scourge of birdlife. Thousands of persons who never have seen a hunting cat in actionwill doubt this statement, but the proof of its truthfulness is only toopainfully abundant.Unhappily it is the way of the hunting cat to stalk unseen, and to killthe very birds that are most friendly with man, and most helpful to himin his farming and fruit-growing business. The quail is about the onlygame bird that the cat affects seriously, and to it the cat is verydestructive. It is the robin, catbird, thrush, bluebird, dove,woodpecker, chickadee, phoebe, tanager and other birds of the lawn, thegarden and orchard that afford good hunting for sly and savage oldThomas.When I was a boy in my 'teens, I had a lasting series of object lessonson the cat as a predatory animal. Our "Betty" was the most ambitious andsuccessful domestic-cat hunter of wild mammals of which I ever haveheard. To her, rats and mice were mere child's-play, and after a timetheir pursuit offered such tame sport that she sought fresh fields forher prowess. Then she brought in young rabbits, chipmunks andthirteen-lined spermophiles, and once she came in, quite exhausted, halfdragging and half carrying a big, fat pocket gopher. With her it seemedto be a point of honor that she should bring in her game and display it.Little did we realize then that in course of time the wild birds wouldbecome so scarce that their slaughter by house cats would demandlegislative action in the states.In considering the hunting cat, let us call in a credible witness of theeffects of domestic cats on the bob white. The following is aneye-witness report, by Ernest B. Beardsley, in _Outdoor Life_ for April,1912. The locality was Wellington, Sumner County, Kansas.  In the meantime, old Queen was having a high old time up ahead, some  hundred feet by then, running up the bank and back down in the draw.  We had hardly caught up when up goes Mr. Savage's gun and he gives  both barrels. I had seen nothing up to date, but I didn't have long  to wait, for by the time I got up to him and the dog, they were both  in the high grass and had a great, big, common gray maltese  house-cat; and Queen had a half-eaten quail that Mr. Cat was busy  with when disturbed.  Well, we followed the draw across the field and got nine of a covey  of sixteen that had been ahead of Mr. Cat; and about four o'clock  that evening we killed another white-and-gray cat. While driving  home that night, Mr. Savage told me that he had killed fifty or more  in three or four years. They will get in a draw full of  tumble-grass, on a cold day when quail don't like to fly, and stay  right with them; and even after feeding on two or three, they will  lie and watch, and when the covey moves, they move. When eating time  comes around they are at it again, and to a covey of young birds  they are sure death to the whole covey.  Well, Will told me never to overlook a house-cat that I found as far  as a quarter of a mile from a farm or ranch, for if they have not  already turned wild, they are learning how easy it is to hunt and  live on game, and are almost as bad. We found Mr. Black-and-White  Hunter had eaten two quail just before we killed him that evening. I  would rather not write what Mr. Savage said when we found the  remains of a partly-eaten bird.  My advice is, don't let tame cats get away when found out hunting;  for the chances are they have not seen a home in months, and maybe  years,--and say! but they do get big and bad. When you meet one,  give it to him good, and don't let your dog run up to him until he  is out for keeps. I learned afterwards that was how Will knew it was  a cat. Queen had learned to back off and call for help on cats some  years before.In the New York Zoological Park, we have had troubles of our own withmarauding cats. They establish themselves in a day, and quickly learnwhere to seek easy game and good cover. In the daytime they lie close inthe thick brush, exactly as tigers do in India, but if not molested fora period of days, they become bold and attack game in open view. Onebird-killing cat was so shy of man that it was only after two weeks ofhard hunting (mornings and evenings) that it was killed.We have seen cats catch and kill gray squirrels, chipmunks, robins andthrushes, and have found the feathers of slaughtered quail. Once we hadgray rabbits breeding in the park, and their number reached betweeneighty and ninety. For a time they fearlessly hopped about in sight fromour windows, and they were of great interest to visitors and to all ofus. Then the cats began upon them; and in one year there was not arabbit to be seen, save at rare intervals. At the same time thechipmunks of the park were almost exterminated.That was the last straw, and we began a vigorous war upon those wild andpredatory cats. The cats came off second best. We killed every cat thatwas found hunting in the park, and we certainly got some that were bigand bad. We eliminated that pest, and we are keeping it eliminated. Andwith what result?In 1911 a covey of eleven quail came and settled in our grounds, andhave remained there. Twenty times at least during the past eight months(winter and spring) I have seen the flock on the granite ledge not morethan forty feet from the rear window of my office. Last spring when Ileft the Administration Building at six o'clock, after the visitors hadgone, I found two half-grown rabbits calmly roosting on the door-mat.The rabbits are slowly coming back, and the chipmunks are visiblyincreasing in number. The gray squirrels now chase over the walkswithout fear of any living thing, and our ducklings and young guineasand peacocks are safe once more.That cats destroy annually in the United States several _millions_ ofvery valuable birds, seems fairly beyond question. I believe that insettled regions they are worse than weasels, foxes, skunks and mink_combined_; because there are about one hundred times as many of them,and those that hunt are not afraid to hunt in the daytime. Of course Iam not saying that _all_ cats hunt wild game; but in the country Ibelieve that fully one-half of them do.I am personally acquainted with a cat in Indiana, on the farm ofrelatives, which is notorious for its hunting propensities, and itsremarkable ability in capturing game. Even the lady who is joint ownerof the cat feels very badly about its destructiveness, and has said,over and over again, that it ought to be killed; but the cat is such afamily pet that no one in the family has the heart to destroy it, and asyet no stranger has come forward to play the part of executioner. Thelady in question assured me that to her certain knowledge thatparticular cat would watch a nestful of young robins week after weekuntil they had grown up to such a size that they were almost ready tofly; then he would kill them and devour them. Old "Tommy" was too wiseto kill the robins when they were unduly small.In a great book entitled _Useful Birds and Their Protection_, by E.H.Forbush, State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, and published by theMassachusetts State Board of Agriculture in 1905, there appears, on page362, many interesting facts on this subject. For example:  Mr. William Brewster tells of an acquaintance in Maine, who said  that his cat killed about fifty birds a year. Mr. A.C. Dike wrote  [to Mr. Forbush] of a cat owned by a family, and well cared for.  They watched it through one season, and found that it killed  fifty-eight birds, including the young in five nests.  Nearly a hundred correspondents, scattered through all the counties  of the state, report the cat as one of the greatest enemies of  birds. The reports that have come in of the torturing and killing of  birds by cats are absolutely sickening. The number of birds killed  by them in this state is appalling.  Some cat lovers believe that each cat kills on the average not more  than ten birds a year; but I have learned of two instances where  more than that number were killed in a single day, and another where  seven were killed. If we assume, however, that the average cat on  the farm kills but ten birds per year, and that there is one cat to  each farm in Massachusetts, we have, in round numbers, seventy  thousand cats, killing seven hundred thousand birds annually.[Illustration: A HUNTING CAT AND ITS VICTIMThis Cat had fed so bountifully on the Rabbits and Squirrels of theZoological Park, that it ate only the Brain of this Gray Rabbit]In Mr. Forbush's book there is an illustration of the cat which killedfifty-eight birds in one year, and the animal was photographed with adead robin in its mouth. The portrait is reproduced in this chapter.Last year, a strong effort was made in Massachusetts to enact a lawrequiring cats to be licensed. On account of the amount of worknecessary in passing the no-sale-of-game bill, that measure was notpressed, and so it did not become a law; but another year it willundoubtedly be passed, for it is a good bill, and extremely necessary atthis time. _Such a law is needed in every state_!There is a mark by which you may instantly and infallibly know the worstof the wild cats--by their presence _away from home, hunting in theopen_. Kill all such, wherever found. The harmless cats are domestic intheir tastes, and stay close to the family fireside and the kitchen.Being properly fed, they have no temptation to become hunters. There arecats and cats, just as there are men and men: some tolerable, manyutterly intolerable. No sweeping sentiment for _all_ cats should beallowed to stand in the way of the abatement of the hunting-catnuisances._Of all men, the farmer cannot afford the luxury of their existence_! Itis too expensive. With him it is a matter of dollars, and cash out ofpocket for every hunting cat that he tolerates in his neighborhood.There are two places in which to strike the hunting cats: in the open,and in the state legislature.While this chapter was in the hands of the compositors, the hunting catand gray rabbit shown in the accompanying illustration were brought inby a keeper.DOGS AS DESTROYERS OF BIRDS.--I have received many letters fromprotectors of wild life informing me that the destruction ofground-nesting birds, and especially of upland game birds, by roamingdogs, has in some localities become a great curse to bird life.Complaints of this kind have come from New York, Massachusetts,Connecticut, Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Usually the culprits are_hunting dogs_--setters, pointers and hounds.Now, surely it is not necessary to set forth here any argument on thissubject. It is not open to argument, or academic treatment of any kind.The cold fact is:In the breeding season of birds, and while the young birds are incapableof quick and strong flight, all dogs, of every description, should berestrained from free hunting; and all dogs found hunting in the woodsduring the season referred to should be arrested, and their ownersshould be fined twenty dollars for each offense. Incidentally, one-halfthe fine should go to the citizen who arrests the dog. The method ofrestraining hunting dogs should devolve upon dog owners; and the lawneed only prohibit or punish the act.Beyond a doubt, in states that still possess quail and ruffed grouse,free hunting by hunting dogs leads to great destruction of nests andbroods during the breeding season.TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE WIRES.--Mr. Daniel C. Beard has strongly calledmy attention to the slaughter of birds by telegraph wires that has comeunder his personal observation. His country home, at Redding,Connecticut, is near the main line of the New York, New Haven andHartford Railway, along which a line of very large poles carries a greatnumber of wires. The wires are so numerous that they form a barrierthrough which it is difficult for any bird to fly and come out alive andunhurt.Mr. Beard says that among the birds killed or crippled by flying againstthose wires near Redding he has seen the following species: olive-backedthrush, white-throated sparrow and other sparrows, oriole, blue jay,rail, ruffed grouse, and woodcock. It is a common practice for employeesof the railway, and others living along the line, to follow the line andpick up on one excursion enough birds for a pot-pie.Beyond question, the telegraph and telephone wires of the United Statesannually exact a heavy toll in bird life, and claim countless thousandsof victims. They may well be set down as one of the unseen forcesdestructive to birds.Naturally, we ask, what can be done about it?I am told that in Scotland such slaughter is prevented by the attachmentof small tags or discs to the telephone wires, at intervals of a fewrods, sufficiently near that they attract the attention of flying birds,and reveal the line of an obstruction. This system should be adopted inall regions where the conditions are such that birds kill themselvesagainst telegraph wires, and an excellent place to begin would be alongthe line of the N.Y., N.H. & H. Railway.WILD ANIMALS.--Beyond question, it is both desirable and necessary thatany excess of wild animals that prey upon our grouse, quail, pheasants,woodcock, snipe, mallard duck, shore birds and other species that neston the ground, should be killed. Since we must choose between the two,the birds have it! Weasels and foxes and skunks are interesting, andthey do much to promote the hilarity of life in rural districts, butthey do not destroy insects, and are of comparatively little value asdestroyers of the noxious rodents that prey upon farm crops. While a fewpersons may dispute the second half of this proposition, the burden ofproof that my view is wrong will rest upon them; and having spenteighteen years "on the farm," I think I am right. If there is anypositive evidence tending to prove that the small carnivores that weclass as "vermin" are industrious and persistent destroyers of noxiousrodents--pocket gophers, moles, field-mice and rats--or that they do notkill wild birds numerously, now is the time to produce it, because thetide of public sentiment is strongly setting against the weasels, mink,foxes and skunks. (Once upon a time, a shrewd young man in theZoological Park discovered a weasel hiding behind a stone whiledevouring a sparrow that it had just caught and killed. He stalked itsuccessfully, seized it in his bare hand, and, even though bitten, madegood the capture.)The State of Pennsylvania is extensively wooded, with forests and withbrush which affords excellent home quarters and breeding grounds formammalian "vermin." The small predatory mammals are so seriouslydestructive to ruffed grouse and other ground birds that the State GameCommission is greatly concerned. When the hunter's license law isenacted, as it very surely will be at the next session of thelegislature (1913), a portion of the 70,000 that it will produce eachyear will be used by the commission in paying bounties on thedestruction of the surplus of vermin. Through the pursuit of vermin, anyfarmer can easily win enough bounties to more than pay the cost of hisannual hunting license (one dollar), and the farmers' boys will find anew interest in life.In some portions of the Rocky Mountain region, the assaults of the largepredatory mammals and birds on the young of the big-game speciesoccasionally demand special treatment. In the Yellowstone Park the pumasmultiplied to such an extent and killed so many young elk that theirnumber had to be systematically reduced. To that end "Buffalo" Jones wassent out by the Government to find and destroy the intolerable surplusof pumas. In the course of his campaign he killed about forty, much tothe benefit of the elk herds. Around the entrance to the den of a bigold male puma, Mr. Jones found the skulls and other remains of nine elkcalves that "the old Tom" had killed and carried there.Pumas and lynxes attack and kill mountain sheep; and the golden eagle isvery partial to mountain sheep lambs and mountain goat kids. It will notanswer to permit birds of that bold and predatory species to become toonumerous in mountains inhabited by goats and sheep; and the fewer themountain lions the better, for they, like the lynx and eagle, havenothing to live upon save the game.The wolves and coyotes have learned to seek the ranges of cattle,horses and sheep, where they still do immense damage, chiefly inkilling young stock. In spite of the great sums that have been paid outby western states in bounties for the destruction of wolves, in many,many places the gray wolf still persists, and can not be exterminated.To the stockmen of the west the wolf question is a serious matter. Thestockmen of Montana say that a government expert once told them how toget rid of the gray wolves. His instructions were: "Locate the dens, andkill the young in the dens, soon after they are born!" "All very easy to_say_, but a trifle difficult to _do_!" said my informant; and theranchman seem to think they are yet a long way from a solution of thewolf question.During the past year the destruction of noxious predatory animals in thenational forest reserves has seriously occupied the attention of theUnited States Bureau of Forestry. By the foresters of that bureau thefollowing animals were destroyed in fifteen western states:6,487 Coyotes  870 Wild-Cats   72 Lynxes  213 Bears   88 Mountain Lions  172 Gray Wolves   69 Wolf Pups-----7,971In 1910 the total was 9,103.[Illustration: THE EASTERN RED SQUIRRELA Great Destroyer of Birds]THE RED SQUIRREL.--Once in a great while, conditions change in subtleways, wild creatures unexpectedly increase in number, and a communityawakens to the fact that some wild species has become a public nuisance.In a small city park, even gray squirrels may breed and become sofearfully numerous that, in their restless quest for food, they mayravage the nests of the wild birds, kill and devour the young, andbecome a pest. In the Zoological Park, in 1903, we found that the redsquirrels had increased to such a horde that they were driving out allour nesting wild birds, driving out the gray squirrels, and makingthemselves intolerably obnoxious. We shot sixty of them, and brought thetotal down to a reasonable number. Wherever he is or whatever hisnumerical strength, the red squirrel is a bad citizen, and, while we donot by any means favor his extermination, he should resolutely be keptwithin bounds by the rifle.When a crow nested in our woods, near the Beaver Pond, we were greatlypleased; but with the feeding of the first brood, the crows began tocarry off ducklings from the wild-fowl pond. After one crow had beenseen to seize and carry away _five_ young ducks in one forenoon, wedecided that the constitutional limit had been reached, for we did notpropose that all our young mallards should be swept into the awfulvortex of that crow nest. We took those young crows and reared them byhand; but the old one had acquired a bad habit, and she persisted incarrying off young ducks until we had to end her existence with a gun.It was a painful operation, but there was no other way.[Illustration: COOPER'S HAWKA Species to be Destroyed]BIRD-DESTROYING BIRDS.--There are several species of birds that may atonce be put under sentence of death for their destructiveness of usefulbirds, without any extenuating circumstances worth mentioning. Four ofthese are _Cooper's Hawk_, the _Sharp-Shinned Hawk, Pigeon Hawk_ and_Duck Hawk_. Fortunately these species are not so numerous that we needlose any sleep over them. Indeed, I think that today it would be amighty good collector who could find one specimen in seven days'hunting. Like all other species, these, too, are being shot out of ourbird fauna.Several species of bird-eating birds are trembling in the balance, andunder grave suspicion. Some of them are the _Great Horned Owl, ScreechOwl, Butcher Bird_ or _Great Northern Shrike_. The only circumstancethat saves these birds from instant condemnation is the delightfulamount of rats, mice, moles, gophers and noxious insects that theyannually consume. In view of the awful destructiveness of the accursedbubonic-plague-carrying rat, we are impelled to think long beforeplacing in our killing list even the great horned owl, who really doeslevy a heavy tax on our upland game birds. As to the butcher bird, wefeel that we ought to kill him, but in view of his record on wild miceand rats, we hesitate, and finally decline.[Illustration: SHARP-SHINNED HAWKA Species to be Destroyed]SNAKES.--Mr. Thomas M. Upp, a close and long observer of wild thingswishes it distinctly understood that while the common black-snakes andracers are practically harmless to birds, the _Pilot Black-Snake_,--long, thick and truculent,--is a great scourge to nesting birds. Itseems to be deserving of death. Mr. Upp speaks from personal knowledge,and his condemnation of the species referred to is quite sweeping. Atthe same time Mr. Raymond L. Ditmars points out the fact that thisserpent feeds during 6 months of the year on mice, and in doing sorenders good service. In the South it is called the "Mouse Snake."[Illustration: THE CAT THAT KILLED 58 BIRDS IN ONE YEARFrom Mr. Forbush's BookPhoto by A.C. Dyke]       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER IXTHE DESTRUCTION OF WILD LIFE BY DISEASESEvery cause that has the effect of reducing the total of wild-lifepopulation is now a matter of importance to mankind. The violent anduniversal disturbance of the balance of Nature that already has takenplace throughout the temperate and frigid zone offers not only food forthought, but it calls for vigorous action.There are vast sections in the populous centres of western civilizationwhere the destruction of species, even to the point of extermination, isfairly inevitable. It is the way of Christian man to destroy all wildlife that comes within the sphere of influence of his iron heel. Withthe exception of the big game, this destruction is largely atemperamental result, peculiar to the highest civilization. In Indiawhere the same fields have been plowed for wheat and dahl and raggi forat least 2,000 years, the Indian antelope, or "black buck," the sarascrane and the adjutant stalk through the crops, and the nilgai andgazelle inhabit the eroded ravines in an agricultural land that averages1,200 people to the square mile!We have seen that even in farming country, where mud villages are asthick as farm houses in Nebraska, wild animals and even hoofed game canlive and hold their own through hundreds of years of close associationwith man. The explanation is that the Hindus regard wild animals ascreatures entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, andthey are not anxious to shoot every wild animal that shows its head. Inthe United States, nearly every game-inhabited community is animated bya feeling that every wild animal must necessarily be killed as soon asseen; and this sentiment often leads to disgraceful things. Forinstance, in some parts of New England a deer straying into a town is atonce beset by the hue and cry, and it is chased and assaulted until itis dead, by violent and disgraceful means. New York State, however,seems to have outgrown that spirit. During the past ten years, at leasta dozen deer in distress have been rescued from the Hudson River, or ininland towns, or in barnyards in the suburbs of Yonkers and New York,and carefully cared for until "the zoo people" could be communicatedwith. Last winter about 13 exhausted grebes and one loon were picked up,cared for and finally shipped with tender care to the Zoological Park.One distressed dovekie was picked up, but failed to survive.The sentiment for the conservation of wild life has changed the mentalattitude of very many people. The old Chinese-Malay spirit which cries"Kill! Kill!" and at once runs amuck among suddenly discovered wildanimals, is slowly being replaced by a more humane and intelligentsentiment. This is one of the hopeful and encouraging signs of thetimes.The destruction of wild animals by natural causes is an interestingsubject, even though painful. We need to know how much destruction iswrought by influences wholly beyond the control of man, and a few casesmust be cited.RINDERPEST IN AFRICA.--Probably the greatest slaughter ever wrought uponwild animals by diseases during historic times, was by rinderpest, acattle plague which afflicted Africa in the last decade of the previouscentury. Originally, the disease reached Africa by way of Egypt, andcame as an importation from Europe. From Egypt it steadily traveledsouthward, reaching Somaliland in 1889. In 1896 it reached the ZambesiRiver and entered Rhodesia. From thence it went on southward almost tothe Cape. Not only did it sweep away ninety percent of the native cattlebut it also destroyed more than seventy-five per cent of the buffalos,antelopes and other hoofed game of Rhodesia. It was feared that manyspecies would be completely exterminated, but happily that fear was notrealized. The buffalo and antelope herds were fifteen years in breedingup again to a reasonable number, but thanks to the respite from hunterswhich they enjoyed for several years, finally they did recover.Throughout British East Africa the supply of big game in 1905 was verygreat, but since that time it has been very greatly diminished byshooting.CARIBOU DISEASE.--From time to time reports have come from the Provinceof Quebec, and I think from Maine and New Brunswick also, of manycaribou having died of disease. The nature of that disease has remaineda mystery, because it seems that no pathologist ever has had anopportunity to investigate it. Fortunately, however, the alleged diseasenever has been sufficiently wide-spread or continuous to makeappreciable inroads on the total number of caribou, and apparently thetrouble has been local.SCAB IN MOUNTAIN SHEEP.--"Scab" is a contagious and persistent skindisease that affects sheep, and is destructive when not controlled.Fifteen years ago it prevailed in some portions of the west. In Coloradoit has several times been reported that many bighorn mountain sheep werekilled by "scab," which was contracted on wild mountain pastures thathad been gone over by domestic sheep carrying that disease. From thereports current at that time, we inferred that about 200 mountain sheephad been affected. It was feared that the disease would spread throughthe wild flocks and become general, but this did not occur. It seemsthat the remnant flocks had become so isolated from one another that theisolation of the affected flocks saved the others.LUMPY-JAW IN ANTELOPE AND SHEEP.--It is a lamentable fact that some, atleast, of the United States herds of prong-horned antelope are afflictedwith a very deadly chronic infective disease known as actinomycosis, orlumpy-jaw. It has been brought into the Zoological Park five times, byspecimens shipped from Colorado, Texas, Wyoming and Montana. I think ourfirst cases came to us in 1902.In its early stage this disease is so subtle and slow that it is monthsin developing; and this feature renders it all the more deadly, throughthe spread of infection long before the ailment can be discovered.One of our antelope arrivals, apparently in perfect health whenreceived, was on general principles kept isolated in rigid quarantinefor two months. At the expiration of that period, no disease of any kindhaving become manifest, the animal was placed on exhibition, with twoothers that had been in the Park for more than a year, in perfecthealth.In one more week the late arrival developed a swelling on its jaw,drooled at the corner of the mouth, and became feverish,--sure symptomsof the dread disease. At once it was removed and isolated, but in about10 days it died. The other two antelopes were promptly attacked, andeventually died.The course of the disease is very intense, and thus far it has provenincurable in our wild animals. We have lost about 10 antelopes from it,and one deer, usually, in each case, within ten days or two weeks fromthe discovery of the first outward sign,--the well known swelling on thejaw. One case that was detected immediately upon arrival was verypersistently treated by Dr. Blair, and the animal actually survived forfour months, but finally it succumbed. From first to last not a singlecase was cured.In 1912, the future of the prong-horned antelope in real captivity seemshopeless. We have decided not to bring any more specimens to ourinstitution, partly because all available candidates seem reasonablycertain to be affected with lumpy-jaw, and partly because we areunwilling to run further risks of having other hoofed animals inoculatedby them. Today we are anxiously wondering whether the jaw disease of theprong-horn is destined to exterminate the species. Such a catastrophe ismuch to be feared. This is probably one of the reasons why the antelopeis steadily disappearing, despite protection.In 1906 we discovered the existence of actinomycosis among the blackmountain sheep of northern British Columbia. Two specimens out of sixwere badly affected, the bones of the jaws being greatly enlarged, andperforated by deep pits. The black sheep of the Stickine and Iskootregions are so seldom seen by white men, save when a sportsman kills hisallotment of three specimens, we really do not know anything about theextent to which actinomycosis prevails in those herds, or how deadly areits effects. One thing seems quite certain, from the appearance of thediseased skulls found by the writer in the taxidermic laboratory ofFrederick Sauter, in New York. The enormous swelling of the diseased jawbones clearly indicates a disease that in some cases affects its victimthroughout many months. Such a condition as we found in those sheepcould not have been reached in a few days after the disease becameapparent. Now, in our antelopes, the collapse and death of the victimusually occurred in about 10 days from the time that the first swellingwas observed: which means a very virulent disease, and rapid progress atthe climax. The jaw of one of our antelopes, which was figured in Dr.Blair's paper in the Eleventh Annual Report of the New York ZoologicalSociety (1906) shows only a very slight lesion, in comparison with thoseof the mountain sheep.The conclusion is that among the sheep, this disease does not carry offits victims in any short period like 10 days. The animal must survivefor some months after it becomes apparent. At least two parties ofAmerican sportsmen have shot rams afflicted with this disease, but Ihave no reports of any sheep having been found dead from this cause.This disease is well known among domestic cattle, but so far as we areaware it never before has been found among wild animals. The black sheepherds wherein it was found in British Columbia are absolutely isolatedfrom domestic cattle and all their influences, and therefore it seemsquite certain that the disease developed among the sheepspontaneously,--a remarkable episode, to say the least. Whether it willexterminate the black mountain sheep species, and in time spread to thewhite sheep of the northwest, is of course a matter of conjecture; butthere is nothing in the world to prevent a calamity of that kind. Thewhite sheep of Yukon Territory range southward until in the SheslayMountains they touch the sphere of influence of the black sheep, wherethe disease could easily be transmitted. It would be a good thing ifthere existed between the two species a sheepless zone about 200 mileswide.I greatly fear that actinomycosis is destined to play an important partin the final extinction that seems to be the impending fate of thebeautiful and valuable prong-horned antelope. In view of our hardexperiences, extending through ten years (1902-1912), I think this fearis justified. All persons who live in country still inhabited byantelope are urged to watch for this disease. If any antelopes are founddead, see if the lower jaw is badly swollen and discharging pus. If itis, bury the body quickly, burn the ground over, and advise the writerregarding the case.THE RABBIT PLAGUE.--One of the strangest freaks of Nature of which weknow as effecting the wholesale destruction of wild animals by diseaseis the rabbit plague. In the northern wilderness, and particularlycentral Canada, where rabbits exist in great numbers and supply thewants of a large carnivorous population, this plague is well known, andamong trappers and woodsmen is a common topic of conversation. The besttreatment of the subject is to be found in Ernest T. Seton's "LifeHistories of Northern Animals", Vol. I, p. 640 et seq. From this Iquote:"Invariably the year of greatest numbers [of rabbits] is followed by ayear of plague, which sweeps them away, leaving few or no rabbits in theland. The denser the rabbit population, the more drastically is itravaged by the plague. They are wiped out in a single spring byepidemic diseases usually characterized by swellings of the throat,sores under the armpits and groins, and by diarrhea.""The year 1885 was for the country around Carberry 'a rabbit year,' thegreatest ever known in that country. The number of rabbits wasincredible. W.R. Hine killed 75 in two hours, and estimated that hecould have killed 500 in a day. The farmers were stricken with fear thatthe rabbit pest of Australia was to be repeated in Manitoba. But theyears 1886-7 changed all that. The rabbits died until their bodiesdotted the country in thousands. The plague seemed to kill all themembers of the vast host of 1885."The strangest item of Mr. Seton's story is yet to be told. In 1890 Mr.Seton stocked his park at Cos Cob, Conn., with hares and rabbits fromseveral widely separated localities. In 1903, the plague came and sweptthem all away. Mr. Seton sent specimens to the Zoological Park forexamination by the Park veterinary surgeon, Dr. W. Reid Blair. They werefound to be infested by great numbers of a dangerous bloodsuckingparasite known as _Strongylus strigosus_, which produces death by anemiaand emaciation. There were hundreds of those parasites in each animal. Iassisted in the examination, and was shown by Dr. Blair, under themicroscope, that _Strongylus_ puts forth eggs literally by hundreds ofthousands!The life history of that parasite is not well known, but it may easilydevelop that the cycle of its maximum destructiveness is seven years,and therefore it may be accountable for the seven-year plague among thehares and rabbits of the northern United States and Canada.Possibly _Strongylus strigosus_ is all that stands between Canada and apest of rabbits like that of Australia. Just why this parasite isinoperative in Australia, or why it has not been introduced there tolessen the rabbit evil, we do not know. Mr. Seton declares that therabbits of his park were "subject to all the ills of the flesh, exceptpossibly writer's paralysis and housemaid's knee."PARASITIC INFECTION OF WILD DUCKS.--The diseases of wild game,especially waterfowl, grouse and quail, have caused heavy losses inAmerica as well as in European countries, and scientists have beencarefully investigating the cause and the general nature of themaladies, as well as probable methods of prevention and cure. Mr. Geo.Atkinson, a well-known practical naturalist of Portage la Prairie,Manitoba, writes as follows to a local paper on this subject, which Ifind quoted in the _National Sportsman_:  The question which has developed these important proportions during  the past year is that of the extent of the parasitic infection of  our wild ducks and other game, and the possibilities of the extended  transmission of these parasites to domestic stock, or even humanity,  by eating.  The parasites in question are contained in small elliptical cases  found underlying the surface muscles of the breast, and in advanced  cases extending deeper into the flesh and the muscular tissues of  the legs and wings. They are not noticeable in the ordinary process  of plucking the bird for the table, and are not found internally, so  that the only method of discovering their presence is by slitting  the skin of the breast and paring it back a few inches when the  worm-like sacs will be seen buried in the flesh.  These parasites have come to my notice periodically during the  process of skinning birds for mounting during the past number of  years, but it was only when they appeared in unusual numbers last  fall that I made inquiries of the biological bureaus of Washington  and Ottawa for information of their life history and the  possibilities of their transmission to other hosts.  Replies from these sources surprised me with the information that  very little was known of the life history of any of the  Sarcosporidia, of which group this was a species. Nothing was known  of the method of infection or the transference from host to host or  species to species, and both departments asked for specimens for  examination.  Authorities are a unit in opinion that the question is one of great  importance to game conservation, and although opinions of the  dangers from eating differ somewhat, a record is given of a hog fed  upon affected flesh developing parasites in the muscles in six  weeks' time, while a case of a man's death from dropsy was found to  be the result of development of these parasites in the valves of the  heart.  The ability of these low forms of life to withstand extremes of heat  makes it necessary for more than ordinary cooking to be assured of  killing them, and since their presence is unnoted in the ordinary  course of dressing the birds for the table, there is little doubt  that very considerable numbers of these parasites are consumed at  our tables every season, with results at present unknown to us.  The species I have found most particularly infected have been  mallards, shovellers, teal, gadwall and pintails, and the birds,  outwardly in the best condition, have frequently been found loaded  with sacs of these parasites and only the turning back of the breast  skin can disclose their presence.The greatest slaughter of wild ducks by disease occurred on Great SaltLake, Utah. Until the "duck disease" (intestinal coccidiosis) broke outthere, in the summer of 1910, the annual market slaughter of ducks atthe mouth of Bear River had been enormous. When at Salt Lake City in1888 I made an effort to arouse the sportsmen whom I met to thenecessity of a reform, but my exhortations fell on deaf ears. Naturally,the sweeping away of the remaining ducks by disease would suggest aheaven-sent judgment upon the slaughterers were it not for the fact thatthe last state of the unfortunate ducks is if anything worse than thefirst.On Oct. 17, 1911, the annual report of the chief of the BiologicalSurvey contained the following information on this subject:  _Epidemic Among Wild Ducks on Great Salt Lake_.--Following a long  dry season, which favored the rearing of a large number of wild  ducks, but materially reduced the area of the feeding ponds,  resulting in great overcrowding, a severe epidemic broke out about  August 1, 1910, among the wild ducks about Great Salt Lake, Utah.  Dead ducks could be counted by thousands along the shores and the  disease raged unabated until late fall. Shooting clubs found it  necessary to declare a closed season. Some of the dead ducks were  forwarded to the Biological Survey and were turned over for  examination to the Bureau of Animal Industry, by the experts of  which the disease was diagnosed as intestinal coccidiosis.  Various plans of relieving the situation were tried. The irrigation  ditches were closed, thus providing the sloughs and ponds with fresh  water, and lime was sprinkled on the mud flats and duck trails.  Great improvement followed this treatment, and experiments proved  that ducks provided with abundant fresh water and clean food began  to recover immediately. These methods promised success, but later it  was proposed that the marshes be drained and exposed to the sun's  rays--a course which cannot be recommended. That coccidia are not  always killed by exposure to the sun is shown by their survival on  the sites of old chicken yards. An added disadvantage of the plan is  that draining and drying the marshes would have a bad effect on the  natural duck food, and upon the birds themselves.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XDESTRUCTION OF WILD LIFE BY THE ELEMENTSIt is a fixed condition of Nature that whenever and wherever a wildspecies exists in a state of nature, free from the trammels andlimitations that contact with man always imposes, the species is fittedto survive all ordinary climatic influences. Freedom of action, and theexercise of several options in the line of individual maintenance understress, is essential to the welfare of every wild species.A prong-horned antelope herd that is free can drift before a blizzard,can keep from freezing by the exercise, and eventually come to shelter.Let that same herd drift against a barbed-wire fence five miles long,and its whole scheme of self-preservation is upset. The herd perishesthen and there.Cut out the undergrowth of a given section, drain the swamps and mowdown all the weeds and tall grass, and the next particularly hard winterstarves and freezes the quail.Naturally the cutting of forests, clearing of brush and drainage ofmarshes is more or less calamitous to all the species of birds thatinhabit such places and find there winter food and shelter. Red-wingedblackbirds and real estate booms can not inhabit the same swampscontemporaneously. Before the relentless march of civilization, the wildIndian, the bison and many of the wild birds must inevitably disappear.We cannot change conditions that are as inexorable as death itself. Thewild life must either adjust itself to the conditions that civilized manimposes upon it, or perish. I say "civilized man," for the reason thatthe primitive races of man are not deadly exterminators of species, aswe are. I know of not one species of wild life that has beenexterminated by savage man without the aid of his civilized peers.As civilization marches ever onward, over the prairies, into the badlands and the forests, over the mountains and even into the farthestcorner of Death Valley, the desert of deserts, the struggle of the wildbirds, mammals and fishes is daily and hourly intensified. Man must helpthem to maintain themselves, or accept a lifeless continent. The besthelp consists in letting the wild creatures throughly alone, so thatthey can help themselves; but quail often need to be fed in criticalperiods. The best food is wheat screenings placed under little tents ofstraw, bringing food and shelter together.In the well settled portions of the United States, such species asquail, ruffed grouse, wild turkey, pinnated grouse and sage grouse hangto life by slender threads. A winter of exceptionally deep snows, muchsleet, and a late spring always causes grave anxiety among the stategame wardens. In Pennsylvania a very earnest movement is in progress toeducate and persuade farmers to feed the quail in winter, and much goodis being done in that direction.Mr. Erasmus Wilson, of the _Pittsburgh Gazette-Times_ is the apostle ofthat movement._Quail should be fed every winter, in every northern state_. The methodsto be pursued will be mentioned elsewhere.By way of illustration, here is a sample game report, from Las Animas,Colorado, Feb. 22, 1912:"After the most severe winter weather experienced for twenty years weare able to compute approximately our loss of feathered life. It isseventy-five per cent of the quail throughout the irrigated district,and about twenty per cent of meadow-larks. In the rough cedar-coveredsections south of the Arkansas River, the loss among the quail was muchlighter. The ground sparrows suffered severely, while the Englishsparrow seems to have come through in good shape. Many cotton-tailrabbits starved to death, while the deep, light snow of January madethem easy prey for hawks and coyotes." (F.T. Webber).It would be possible to record many instances similar to the above, butwhy multiply them? And now behold the cruel corollary:At least twenty-five times during the past two years I have heard andread arguments by sportsmen against my proposal for a 5-year closeseason for quail, taking the ground that "The sportsmen are not whollyto blame for the scarcity of quail. It is the cold winters that killthem off!"So then, _because the fierce winters murder the bob white, wholesale,they should not have a chance to recover themselves_! Could human beingspossibly assume a more absurd attitude?Yes, it is coldly and incontestably true, that even after such winterslaughter as Mr. Webber has reported above, the very next season willfind the quail hunter joyously taking the field, his face beaming withhealth and good living, to hunt down and shoot to death as many aspossible of the pitiful 25 per cent remnant that managed to survive thepitiless winter. How many quail hunters, think you, ever stayed theirhands because of "a hard winter on the quail?" I warrant not one out ofevery hundred! How many states in this Union ever put on a close seasonbecause of a hard winter? I'll warrant that not one ever did; and Ithink there is only one state whose game commissioners have the power toact in that way without recourse to the legislature. This situation isintolerable.Thanks to the splendid codified game laws enacted in New York state in1912, our Conservation Commission can declare a close season in anylocality, for any length of time, when the state of the game demands anemergency measure. This act is as follows; and it is a model law, whichevery other state should speedily enact:       *        *        *        *        *  THE NEW YORK CLOSE-SEASON LAW.  _152. Petition for additional protection; notice of hearings; power  to grant additional protection; notice of prohibition or regulation;  penalties_.  _1. Petition for additional protection_. Any citizen of the state  may file with the commission a petition in writing requesting it to  give any species of fish, other than migratory food fish of the sea,  or game protected by law, additional or other protection than that  afforded by the provisions of this article. Such petition shall  state the grounds upon which such protection is considered  necessary, and shall be signed by the petitioner with his address.  _2. Notice of hearings_. The commission shall hold a public hearing  in the locality or county to be affected upon the allegations of  such petition within twenty days from the filing thereof. At least  ten days prior to such hearing notice thereof, stating the time and  place at which such hearing shall be held, shall be advertised in a  newspaper published in the county to be affected by such additional  or other protection. Such notice shall state the name and the  address of the petitioner, together with a brief statement of the  grounds upon which such application is made, and a copy thereof  shall be mailed to the petitioner at the address given in such  petition at least ten days before such hearing.  _3. Power to grant additional protection_. If upon such hearing the  commission shall determine that such species of fish or game, by  reason of disease, danger of extermination, or from any other cause  or reason, requires such additional or other protection, in any  locality or throughout the state, the commission shall have power to  prohibit or regulate, during the open season therefor, the taking of  such species of fish or game. Such prohibition or regulation may be  made general throughout the state or confined to a particular part  or district thereof.  _4. Notice of prohibition or regulation_. Any order made by the  commission under the provisions of this section shall be signed by  it, and entered in its minute book. At least thirty days before such  prohibition or regulation shall take effect, copies of the same  shall be filed in the office of the clerk issuing hunting and  trapping licenses for the district to which the prohibition or  regulation applies. It shall be the duty of said clerks to issue a  copy of said prohibition or regulation to each person to whom a  hunting or trapping license is issued by them; to mail a copy of  such prohibition or regulation to each holder of a hunting and  trapping license theretofore issued by them and at that time in  effect, and to post a copy thereof in a conspicuous place in their  office. At least thirty days before such prohibition or regulation  shall take effect the commission shall cause a notice thereof to be  advertised in a newspaper published in the county wherein such  prohibition or regulation shall take effect.  _5. Penalties_. Any person violating the provisions of such  prohibition, rule or regulation shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and  shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not to exceed one  hundred dollars, or shall be imprisoned for not more than thirty  days, or both, for each offense, in addition to the penalties  hereinafter provided for taking fish, birds or quadrupeds in the  close season.       *        *        *        *        *I want all sensible, honest sportsmen to stop citing the killing of gamebirds by severe winters _as a reason_ why long close seasons are notnecessary, and why automatic guns "don't matter." And I want sportsmento consider their duty, and not go out hunting any game species that hasbeen slaughtered by a hard winter, until it has had at least five yearsin which to recover. Any other course is cruel, selfish, andshortsighted; and a word to the humane should be sufficient.The worst exhibitions ever made of the wolfish instinct to slay thatsprings eternal in some human (!) breasts are those brought aboutthrough the distress or errors of wild animals. By way of illustration,consider the slaughter of half-starved elk that took place in the edgeof Idaho in the winter of 1909 and 1910, when about seven hundred elkthat were driven out of the Yellowstone Park at its northwestern cornerby the deep snow, fled into Idaho in the hope of finding food. Theinhabitants met the starving herds with repeating rifles, and as theunfortunate animals struggled westward through the snow and storm, theywere slaughtered without mercy. Bulls and cows, old and young, all ofthe seven hundred, went down; and Stoney Indians could not have actedany worse than did those "settlers."On another occasion, it is recorded that the prong-horned antelope herdof the Mammoth Hot Springs wandered across the line into Gardiner, andquickly met a savage attack of gunners with rifles. A number of thoserare and valuable animals were killed, and others fled back into thePark with broken legs dangling in the air.In the interest of public decency, and for the protection of thereputation of American citizenship, one of two things should be done.The northern boundary of the Park should be extended northward beyondGardiner, or else the deathtrap should be moved elsewhere. The case ofthe town of Gardiner is referred to the legislature of Montana fortreatment.Beyond question, the highest sentiments of humanity are those that arestirred by the misfortunes of killable game. During the past thirtyyears, I have noticed some interesting manifestations of the increasedsympathy for wild creatures that steadily is growing in a large sectionof the public mind. Thirty years ago, the appearance of a deer or moosein the streets of any eastern village nearly always was in itself asignal for a grand chase of the unfortunate creature, and its speedyslaughter. Today, in the eastern states, the general feeling is quitedifferent. The appearance of a deer in the Hudson River itself, or amoose in a Maine village is a signal, not for a wild chase and cruelslaughter, but for a general effort to save the animal from being hurt,or killed. I know this through ocular proof, at least half a dozen lostand bewildered deer having been carefully driven into yards, or barns,and humanely kept and cared for until they could be shipped to us.Several have been caught while swimming in the Hudson, bewildered andpanic-stricken. The latest capture occurred in New York City itself.A puma that escaped (about 1902) from the Zoological Park, instead ofbeing shot was captured by sensible people in the hamlet of Bronxdale,alive and unhurt, and safely returned to us.In some portions of the east, though not all, the day of the hue and cryover "a wild animal in town" seems to be about over. On Long Island somehumane persons found an injured turkey vulture, and took it in and caredfor it,--only to be persecuted by ill-advised game wardens, because theyhad a forbidden wild bird "in their possession!" There are times when itis the highest (moral) duty of a game warden to follow the advice ofPrivate Mulvaney to the "orficer boy," and "Shut yer oye to therigulations, sorr!"Such occurrences as these are becoming more and more common. _The desireof "the great silent majority" is to SAVE the wild creatures_; and itis in response to that sentiment that thousands of people are today inthe field against the Army of Destruction.It is the duty of every sportsman to assist in promoting the passage ofa law like our New York law which empowers the State Game Commission tothrow extra protection around any species that has been slaughtered toomuch by snow or by firearms, by closing the open season as long as maybe necessary. Can there be in all America even one thinking, reasoningbeing who can not see the justice and also the imperative necessity ofthis measure? It seems impossible.Give the game the benefit of every doubt! If it becomes too thick, yourgun can quickly thin it out; but if it is once exterminated, it will beimpossible to bring it back. Be wise; and take thought for the morrow.Remember the heath hen.SLAUGHTER OF BLUEBIRDS.--In the late winter and early spring of 1896 thewave of bluebirds was caught on its northward migration by a period ofunseasonably cold and fearfully tempestuous weather, involving muchicy-cold rain and sleet. Now, there is no other climatic condition thatis so hard for a wild bird or mammal to withstand as rain at thefreezing point, and a mantle of ice or frozen snow over all supplies offood.The bluebirds perished by thousands. The loss occurred practically allalong their east-and-west line of migration, from Arkansas to theAtlantic Coast. In places the species seemed almost exterminated; and itwas several years ere it recovered to a point even faintly approximatingits original population. I am quite certain that the species never hasrecovered more than 50 per cent of the number that existed previous tothe calamity.DUCK CHOLERA IN THE BRONX RIVER.--In 1911, some unknown but new andparticularly deadly element, probably introduced in sewage, contaminatedthe waters of Bronx River where it flows through New York City, withresults very fatal in the Zoological Park. The large flock of mallardducks, Canada geese, and snow geese on Lake Agassiz was completely wipedout. In all about 125 waterfowl died in rapid succession, from causescommonly classed under the popular name of "duck cholera." The diseasewas carried to other bodies of water in the Park that were fed fromother sources, but made no headway elsewhere than on lakes fed by thepolluted Bronx River.Fortunately the work of the Bronx River Parkway Commission soon willterminate the present very unsanitary condition of that stream.WILD DUCKS IN DISTRESS.--In the winter of 1911-12, many flocks of wildducks decided to winter in the North. Many persons believe that this waslargely due to the prevention of late winter and spring shooting; whichseems reasonable. Unfortunately the winter referred to provedexceptionally severe and formed vast sheets of thick ice over thefeeding-grounds where the ducks had expected to obtain their food. OnCayuga, Seneca and other lakes in central New York, and on the island ofMartha's Vineyard, the flocks of ducks suffered very severely, and manyperished of hunger and cold. _But for the laws prohibiting late wintershooting undoubtedly all of them would have been shot and eaten,regardless of their distress_.Game wardens and humane citizens made numerous efforts to feed thestarving flocks, and many ducks were saved in that way. An illustratedarticle on the distressed ducks of Keuka Lake, by C. William Beebe andVerdi Burtch, appeared in the _Zoological Society Bulletin_ for May,1912. Fortunately there is every reason to believe that such occurrenceswill be rare.WILD SWANS SWEPT OVER NIAGARA FALLS.--During the past ten years, severalwinter tragedies to birds have occurred on a large scale at NiagaraFalls. Whole flocks of whistling swans of from 20 up to 70 individualsalighting in the Niagara River above the rapids have permittedthemselves to float down into the rapids, and be swept over the Falls,en masse. On each occasion, the great majority of the birds weredrowned, or killed on the rocks. Of the very few that survived, few ifany were able to rise and fly out of the gorge below the Falls tosafety. It is my impression that about 200 swans recently have perishedin this strange way.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XISLAUGHTER OF SONG-BIRDS BY ITALIANSIn these days of wild-life slaughter, we hear much of death anddestruction. Before our eyes there continually arise photographs ofhanging masses of waterfowl, grouse, pheasants, deer and fish, usuallysupported in true heraldic fashion by the men who slew them and theimplements of slaughter. The world has become somewhat hardened to thesethings, because the victims are classed as game; and in the destructionof game, one game-bag more or less "Will not count in the news of thebattle."The slaughter of song, insectivorous and all other birds by Italians andother aliens from southern Europe has become a scourge to the bird lifeof this country. The devilish work of the negroes and poor whites of theSouth will be considered in the next chapter. In Italy, linnets andsparrows are "game"; and so is everything else that wears feathers!Italy is a continuous slaughtering-ground for the migratory birds ofEurope, and as such it is an international nuisance and a pest. The waypasserine birds are killed and eaten in that country is a disgrace tothe government of Italy, and a standing reproach to the throne. Evenkings and parliaments have no right in moral or international law topermit year after year the wholesale slaughter of birds of passage ofspecies that no civilized man has a right to kill.There are some tales of slaughter from which every properly-balancedChristian mind is bound to recoil with horror. One such tale hasrecently been given to us in the pages of the _Avicultural Magazine_, ofLondon, for January, 1912, by Mr. Hubert D. Astley, F.Z.S., whose wordno man will dispute. In condensing it, let us call it       *        *        *        *        *THE ITALIAN SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTSThis story does not concern game birds of any kind. Quite the contrary.That it should be published in America, a land now rapidly filling upwith Italians, is a painful necessity in order that the people ofAmerica may be enabled accurately to measure the fatherland traditionsand the fixed mental attitude of Italians generally toward our songbirds. I shall now hold a mirror up to Italian nature. If the image iseither hideous or grotesque, the fault will not be mine. I speciallycommend the picture to the notice of American game wardens and judges onthe bench.The American reader must be reminded that the Italian peninsula reachesout a long arm of land into the Mediterranean Sea for several hundredmiles toward the sunny Barbary coast of North Africa. This greatsouthward highway has been chosen by the birds of central Europe astheir favorite migration route. Especially is this true of the smallsong-birds with weak wings and a minimum of power for long-sustainedflight. Naturally, they follow the peninsula down to the Italian Land'sEnd before they launch forth to dare the passage of the Mediterranean.[Illustration: AN ITALIAN ROCCOLO, ON LAKE COMOA Death-Trap for Song-Birds. From the Avicultural Magazine]Italy is the narrow end of a great continental funnel, into the widenorthern end of which Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland annuallypour their volume of migratory bird life. And what is the result? Foranswer let us take the testimony of two reliable witnesses, and file itfor use on the day when Tony Macchewin, gun in hand and pockets bulgingwith cartridges, goes afield in our country and opens fire on our birds.The linnet is one of the sweet singers of Europe. It is a small,delicately formed, weak-winged little bird, about the size of ourphoebe-bird. It weighs only a trifle more than a girl's love-letter.Where it breeds and rears its young, in Germany for example, a truesportsman would no more think of shooting a linnet than he would ofkilling and eating his daughter's dearest canary.To the migrating bird, the approach to northern Italy, either going orreturning, is not through a land of plenty. The sheltering forests havemostly been swept away, and safe shelters for small birds are very rare.In the open, there are owls and hawks; and the only refuge from eitheris the thick-leafed grove, into which linnets and pipits can dive at theapproach of danger and quickly hide.A linnet from the North after days of dangerous travel finally reachedLake Como, southward bound. The country was much too open for safety,and its first impulse was to look about for safe shelter. The low bushesthat sparsely covered the steep hillsides were too thin for refuge intimes of sudden danger.Ah! Upon a hilltop is a little grove of trees, green and inviting. Inthe grove a bird is calling, calling, insistently. The trees are verysmall; but they seem to stand thickly together, and their foliage shouldafford a haven from both hawk and gunner. To it joyously flits the tiredlinnet. As it perches aloft upon a convenient whip-like wand, it noticesfor the first time a queer, square brick tower of small dimensions,rising in the center of a court-yard surrounded by trees. The tower islike an old and dingy turret that has been shorn from a castle, and seton the hilltop without apparent reason. It is two stories in height,with one window, dingy and uninviting. A door opens into its base.Several birds that seem very near, but are invisible, frequently calland chirp, as if seeking answering calls and companionship. Surely thegrove must be a safe place for birds, or they would not be here.Hark! A whirring, whistling sound fills the air, like the air tone of aflying hawk's wings. A hawk! A hawk!Down plunges the scared linnet, blindly, frantically, into the spacesheltered by the grove!Horrors! What is this?Threads! Invisible, interlacing threads; tangled and full of pockets,treacherously spanning the open space. It is a fowler's net! The linnetis entangled. It flutters frantically but helplessly, and hangs there,caught. Its alarm cry is frantically answered by the two strange,invisible bird voices that come from the top of the tower!The grove and the tower are A ROCCOLO! A huge, permanent, merciless,deadly _trap_, for the wholesale capture of songbirds! The tower is thehiding place of the fowler, and the calling birds are decoy birds whoseeyes have been totally blinded by red-hot wires in order that they willcall more frantically than birds with eyes would do. The whistling wingsthat seemed a hawk were a sham, made by a racquet thrown through the airby the fowler, through a slot in his tower. He keeps by him many suchracquets.The door of the tower opens, and out comes the fowler. He is lowbrowed,swarthy, ill kept, and wears rings in his ears. A soiled hand seizes thestruggling linnet, and drags it violently from the threads thatentangled it. A sharp-pointed twig is thrust straight through the headof the helpless victim _at the eyes_, and after one wild, flutteringagony--it is dead.The fowler sighs contentedly, re-enters his dirty and foul-smellingtower, tosses the feathered atom upon the pile of dead birds that liesupon the dirty floor in a dirty corner,--and is ready for the next one.Ask him, as did Mr. Astley, and he will tell you frankly that there areabout 150 dead birds in the pile,--starlings, sparrows, linnets,greenfinches, chaffinches, goldfinches, hawfinches, redstarts,blackcaps, robins, song thrushes, blackbirds, blue and coal tits,fieldfares and redwings. He will tell you also, that there are _sevenother roccolos within sight and twelve within easy walking distance_. Hewill tell you, as he did Mr. Astley, that during that week he had takenabout 500 birds, and that that number was a fair average for each of the12 other roccolos.This means the destruction of about 5,000 songbirds per week _in thatneighborhood alone!_ Another keeper of a roccolo told Mr. Astley thatduring the previous autumn he took about 10,000 birds at his small andcomparatively insignificant roccolo.And above that awful roccolo of slaughtered innocents rose _a woodencross_, in memory of Christ, the Merciful, the Compassionate!Around the interior of the entwined sapling tops that formed the fatalbower of death there hung a semicircle of tiny cages containing livedecoys,--chaffinches, hawfinches, titmice and several other species."The older and staider ones call repeatedly," says Mr. Astley, "and thechaffinches break into song. It is the only song to be heard in Italy atthe time of the autum migration."And the King of Italy, the Queen of Italy, the Parliament of Italy andHis Holiness the Pope permit these things, year in and year out. It isnow said, however, that through the efforts of a recently organizedbird-lovers' society in Italy, the blinding of decoy birds for roccolosis to be stopped.In Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, the protection of these birdsduring their breeding season must be very effective, for otherwise thesupply for the Italian slaughter of the Innocents would long ago havefallen to nothing.The Germans love birds, and all wild life. I wonder how they like theItalian roccolo. I wonder how France regards it; and whether the nationsof Europe north of Italy will endure this situation forever.To the American and English reader, comment on the practices recordedabove is quite unnecessary, except the observation that they betoken acallousness of feeling and a depth of cruelty and destructiveness towhich, so far as known, no savages ever yet have sunk. As an exhibit ofthe groveling pusillanimity of the human soul, the roccolo of northernItaly reveals minus qualities which can not be expressed either in wordsor in figures.And what is the final exhibit of the gallant knight of the roccolo, thefeudal lord of the modern castle and its retainers?The answer is given by Dr. Louis B. Bishop, in an article on "Birds inthe Markets of Southern Europe."In Venice, which was visited in October and November, during the fallmigration, he found on sale in the markets, as food, thousands ofsongbirds."Birds were there in profusion, from ducks to kites, in the earlymorning, hung in great bunches above the stalls, but by 9 A.M. most ofthem had been sold. Ducks and shorebirds occurred in some numbers, butthe vast majority were small sparrows, larks and thrushes. These werethere during my visit by the thousands, if not ten thousands. To themarket they were brought in large sacks, strung in fours on twigs whichhad been passed through the eyes and then tied. Most of these smallbirds had been trapped, and on skinning them I often could find noinjury except at their eyes.[C] One of these sacks which I examined onNovember 3, contained hundreds of birds, largely siskins, skylarks andbramblings. As a rule the small birds that were not sold in the earlymorning were skinned or picked, and their tiny bodies packed in regularorder, breasts up, in shadow tin boxes, and exposed for sale."[Footnote C: It is probable that these birds were killed by piercing thehead through the eyes.]"During these visits to the Venetian markets, I identified 60 species,and procured specimens of most. As nearly as I can remember, small birdscost from two to five cents apiece. For example I paid 2.15 on Nov. 8,for1 Woodcock,                    1 Skylark,1 Jay,                         1 Greenfinch,2 Starlings,                   1 Bullfinch,2 Spotted Crakes,              1 Redpoll.1 Song Thrush,                 3 Linnets,1 Gold-Crest,                  2 Goldfinches,1 Long-Tailed Titmouse,        6 Siskins,1 Great Titmouse,              3 Reed Buntings,1 Pipit,                       3 Bramblings,1 Redstart,              --and 5 Chaffinches."On November 10, I paid 3.25 for2 Coots,                       1 European Curlew,1 Water Rail,                  2 Kingfishers,1 Spotted Crake,               2 Greenfinches,1 Sparrow Hawk,                2 Wrens,2 Woodcock,                    2 Great Titmouse,1 Common Redshank,             2 Blue Titmouse,1 Dusky Redshank,              1 Redbreast, and                   2 Dunlins."Of course there were various species of upland game birds, shore-birdsand waterfowl,--everything, in fact, that could be found and killed. Inaddition to the passerine birds listed above. Dr. Bishop noted thefollowing, all in Venice alone:Skylark ("in great numbers"),Crested Lark,                   Crossbill,Calandra,                       House Sparrow,Tree Sparrow,                   Stonechat,Hawfinch,                       Coal,Yellow-Hammer,                  Goldcrest,Blackbird,                      Rock Pipit,Fieldfare,                      White Wagtail,Song Thrush,                    Redwing."In Florence," says Dr. Bishop, "I visited the central market onNovember 26, 28, 29, 30, December 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, and foundbirds even more plentiful than in Venice." Besides a variety of gamebirds, he found quantities of the species mentioned above, seen inVenice, and also the following:Green Sandpiper,                Brown Creeper,Dotterel,                       Nuthatch,Magpie,                         Black-Cap Warbler,Corn Bunting,                   Black-Headed Warbler,Migratory Quail,                Fantail Warbler,Green Woodpecker,               Missel Thrush,Spotted Woodpecker,             Ring Ouzel,Wood Lark,                      Rock Sparrow, and                Gray Wagtail."Here, too [at Florence] we saw often, bunches and baskets of smallbirds, chiefly redbreasts, hawked through the streets.... Every Sundaythat we went into the country we met numbers of Italians out shooting,and their bags seemed to consist wholly of small birds."At Genoa, San Remo, Monte Carlo and Nice, between December 13 and 29, Idid not visit the central markets, if such exist, but saw frequentlybunches of small birds hanging outside stores.... A gentleman who spentthe fall on an automobile trip through the west of FRANCE _from Brittanyto the Pyrenees, tells me he noticed these bunches of small birds onsale in every town he visited_."That killing song-birds for food," continues Dr. Bishop, "is notconfined to the poor Italians I learned on October 27, when one of themost prominent and wealthy Italian _ornithologists_--a delightfulman--told me he had shot 180 skylarks and pipits the day before, andthat his family liked them far better than other game. Our prejudiceagainst selling game does not exist in Europe, and this sameornithologist told me he often shot 200 ducks in a day at hisshooting-box, sending to the market what he could not use himself. OnNovember 1, 1910, he shot 82 ducks, and on November 8, 103, chieflywidgeon and teal."An "ornithologist" indeed! A "sportsman" also, is he not? He belongswith his brother "ornithologists" of the roccolos, who net their "game"with the aid of _blind_ birds! Brave men, gallant "sportsmen," are thesemen of Italy,--and western France also if the tale is true!If the people of Europe can stand the wholesale, systematic slaughter oftheir song and insectivorous birds, _we can_! If they are toomean-spirited to rise up, make a row about it, and stop it, then letthem pay the price; but, by the Eternal, Antonio shall not come to thiscountry with the song-bird tastes of the roccolo and indulge them here!The above facts have been cited, not at all for the benefit of Europe,but for our own good. The American People are now confronted by theItalian and Austrian and Hungarian laborer and saloon-keeper andmechanic, and all Americans should have an exact measure of thesentiments of southern Europe toward our wild life generally, especiallythe birds that we do not shoot at all, _and therefore are easy to kill_.When a warden or a citizen arrests an alien for killing any of ournon-game birds, show the judge these records of how they do things inItaly, and ask for the extreme penalty.I have taken pains to publish the above facts from eye-witnesses inorder that every game commissioner, game warden and state legislator whoreads these pages may know exactly what he is "up against" in the alienpopulation of our country from southern Europe. For unnumberedgenerations, the people of Italy have been taught to believe that it is_perfectly right_ to shoot and devour every song-bird that flies. TheVenetian is no respecter of species; and when an Italian "ornithologist"(!) can go out and murder 180 linnets and pipits in one day for the pot,it is time for Americans to think hard.We sincerely hope that it will not require blows and kicks and fines toremove from Antonio's head the idea that America is not Italy, and thatthe slaughter of song birds "don't go" in this country. I stronglyrecommend to every state the enactment of a law that will do thesethings:1.--Prohibit the owning, carrying or use of firearms by aliens, and2.--Prohibit the use of firearms in hunting by any naturalized alienfrom southern Europe until after a 10-years' residence in America.From reports that have come to me at first hand regarding Italians inthe East, Hungarians in Pennsylvania and Austrians in Minnesota, itseems absolutely certain that all members of the lower classes ofsouthern Europe are a dangerous menace to our wild life.On account of the now-accursed land-of-liberty idea, every foreignerwho sails past the statue on Bedloe's Island and lands on ourliberty-ridden shore, is firmly convinced that _now, at last_, he can doas he pleases! And as one of his first ways in which to show hisnewly-acquired personal liberty and independence in the Land of EasyMarks, he buys a gun and goes out to shoot "free game!"If we, as a people, are so indolent and so somnolent that Antonio getsaway with all our wild birds, then do we deserve to be robbed.Italians are pouring into America in a steady stream. They are strong,prolific, persistent and of tireless energy. New York City now contains340,000 of them. They work while the native Americans sleep. Whereverthey settle, their tendency is to root out the native American and takehis place and his income. Toward wild life the Italian laborer is ahuman mongoose. Give him power to act, and he will quickly exterminateevery wild thing that wears feathers or hair. To our songbirds he isliterally a "pestilence that walketh at noonday".As we have shown, the Italian is a born pot-hunter, and he has grown upin the fixed belief that killing song-birds for food is right! To himall is game that goes into the bag. The moment he sets foot in the open,he provides himself with a shot-gun, and he looks about for things tokill. It is "a free country;" therefore, he may kill anything he canfind, cook it and eat it. If anybody attempts to check him,--sapristi!beware his gun! He cheerfully invades your fields, and even your lawn;and he shoots robins, bluebirds, thrushes, catbirds, grosbeaks,tanagers, orioles, woodpeckers, quail, snipe, ducks, crows, and herons.Down in Virginia, near Charlottesville, an Italian who was working on anew railroad once killed a turkey buzzard; and he selfishly cooked itand ate it, all alone. A pot-hunting compatriot of his heard of it, andreproached him for having-dined on game in camera. In the quarrel thatensued, one of the "sportsmen" stabbed the other to death.When the New York Zoological Society began work on its Park in 1899, thenorthern half of the Borough of the Bronx was a regular dailyhunting-ground for the slaughter of song-birds, and all other birds thatcould be found. Every Sunday it was "bangetty!" "bang!" from Pelham Bayto Van Cortlandt. The police force paid not the slightest attention tothese open, flagrant, shameless violations of the city ordinances andthe state bird laws. In those days I never but once heard of a policeman_on his own initiative_ arresting a birdshooter, even on Sunday; butwhenever meddlesome special wardens from the Zoological Park havepointedly called upon the local police force for help, it has alwaysbeen given with cheerful alacrity. In the fall of 1912 an appeal to thePolice Commissioner resulted in a general order to stop all hunting andshooting in the Borough of the Bronx, and a reform is now on.The war on the bird-killers in New York City began in 1900. It seemedthat if the Zoological Society did not take up the matter, the slaughterwould continue indefinitely. The white man's burden was taken up; andthe story of the war is rather illuminating. Mr. G.O. Shields,President of the League of American Sportsmen, quickly became interestedin the matter, and entered actively into the campaign. For monthsunnumbered, he spent every Sunday patroling the woods and thickets ofnorthern New York and Westchester county, usually accompanied by John J.Rose and Rudolph Bell of the Zoological Park force, for whomappointments as deputy game wardens had been secured from the State.The adventures of that redoubtable trio of man-hunters would make aninteresting chapter. They were shot at by poachers, but more frequentlythey shot at the other fellows. Just why it was that no one was killed,no one seems to know. Many Italians and several Americans were arrestedwhile hunting, haled to court, prosecuted and fined. Finally, a reign ofterror set in; and that was the beginning of the end. It became knownthat those three men could not be stopped by threats, and that theyalways got their man--unless he got into a human rabbit-warren of theItalian boarding-house species. That was the only escape that waspossible.The largest haul of dead birds was 43 robins, orioles, thrushes andwoodpeckers, captured along with the five Italians who committed theindiscretion of sitting down in the woods to divide their dead birds. Wesaved all the birds in alcohol, and showed them in court. The judgefined two of the Italians 50 each, and the other three were sent to thepenitentiary for two months each.Even yet, however, at long intervals an occasional son of sunny Italytries his luck at Sunday bird shooting; but if anyone yells at him to"Halt!" he throws away his gun and stampedes through the brush like afrightened deer. The birds of upper New York are now fairly secure; butit has taken ten years of fighting to bring it about.Throughout New York State, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut,Massachusetts, and even Minnesota, wherever there are large settlementsof Italians and Hungarians, the reports are the same. They swarm throughthe country every Sunday, and shoot every wild thing they see. Whereverthere are large construction works,--railroads, canals oraqueducts,--look for bird slaughter, and you are sure to find it. Theexception to this rule, so far as I know, is along the line of the newCatskill aqueduct, coming to New York City. The contractors have electednot to permit bird slaughter, and the rule has been made that any manwho goes out hunting will instantly be discharged. That is the best rulethat ever was made for the protection of birds and game againstgang-working aliens.Let every state and province in America look out sharply for thebird-killing foreigner; for sooner or later, he will surely attack yourwild life. The Italians are spreading, spreading, spreading. If you arewithout them to-day, to-morrow they will be around you. Meet them at thethreshold with drastic laws, throughly enforced; for no half waymeasures will answer.Pennsylvania has had the worst experience of alien slaughterers of anystate, thus far. _Six_ of her game wardens have been _killed_, and eightor ten have been wounded, by shooting! Finally her legislature arose inwrath, and passed a law prohibiting the ownership or possession of gunsof any kind by aliens. The law gives the right of domiciliary search,and it surely is enforced. Of course the foreign population "kicked"against the law, but the People's steam roller went over them just thesame. In New York, we require from an alien a license costing 20, andit has saved a million (perhaps) of our birds; but the Pennsylvania lawis the best. It may be taken as a model for every state and province inAmerica. Its text is as follows:  Section I. Be it enacted, &c., That from and after the passage of  this act, it shall be unlawful for any unnaturalized foreign-born  resident to hunt for or capture or kill, in this Commonwealth, any  wild bird or animal, either game or otherwise, of any description,  excepting in defense of person or property; and to that end it shall  be unlawful for any unnaturalized foreign-born resident, within this  Commonwealth, to either own or be possessed of a shotgun or rifle of  any make. Each and every person violating any provision of this  section shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a  penalty of twenty-five dollars for each offense, or undergo  imprisonment in the common jail of the county for the period of one  day for each dollar of penalty imposed. Provided, That in addition  to the before-named penalty, all guns of the before-mentioned kinds  found in possession or under control of an unnaturalized  foreign-born resident shall, upon conviction of such person, or upon  his signing a declaration of guilt as prescribed by this act, be  declared forfeited to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and shall be  sold by the Board of Game Commissioners as hereinafter directed.  Section 2. For the purpose of this act, any unnaturalized  foreign-born person who shall reside or live within the boundaries  of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for ten consecutive days shall  be considered a resident and shall be liable to the penalties  imposed for violation of the provisions of this act.  Section 3. That the possession of a shotgun or rifle at any place  outside of a building, within this Commonwealth, by an unnaturalized  foreign-born resident, shall be conclusive proof of a violation of  the provisions of section one of this act, and shall render any  person convicted thereof liable to the penalty as fixed by said  section.  Section 4. That the presence of a shotgun or rifle in a room or  house, or building or tent, or camp of any description, within this  Commonwealth, occupied by or controlled by an unnaturalized  foreign-born resident shall be prima facie evidence that such gun is  owned or controlled by the person occupying or controlling the  property in which such gun is found, and shall render such person  liable to the penalty imposed by section one of this act.Other sections provide for the full enforcement of this law.It is now high time, and an imperative public necessity, that everystate should act in this matter, before its bird life is suddenlyattacked, and serious inroads made upon it. Do it NOW! The enemy isheaded your way. Don't wait for him to strike the first blow!_Duty of the Italian Press and Clergy_.--Now what is the best remedy forthe troubles that will arise for Italians in America because of wrongprinciples established in Italy? It is not in the law, the police, thecourt and the punishment. It is in _educating the Italian into aknowledge of the duties of the good citizen_! The Italian press andclergy can do this; and _no one else can do it so easily, so quickly andso well_!Those two powerful forces should enter seriously upon this task. Inevery other respect, the naturalized Italian tries to become a goodcitizen, and adjust himself to the laws and the customs of his newcountry. Why should he not do this in regard to bird life? It is not toomuch to ask, nor is it too much to _exact_. Does the Italian workman, orstore-keeper who makes his living by honest toil _enjoy_ breaking ourbird laws, _enjoy_ irritating and injuring those with whom he has cometo live? Does he _enjoy_ being watched, and searched, and chased, andarrested,--all for a few small birds that he _does not need_ for food?He earns good wages; he has plenty of good food; and he must be_educated_ into protecting our birds instead of destroying them. TheItalian newspapers and clergy have a serious duty to perform in thismatter, and we hope they will diligently discharge it.[Illustration: DEAD SONG-BIRDSThese jars contain the dead bodies of 43 valuable insectivorous birdsthat were taken from two Italians in October, 1905, in the suburbs ofNew York City, by game wardens of the New York Zoological Society.]       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XIIDESTRUCTION OF SONG BIRDS BY SOUTHERN NEGROES AND POOR WHITESBefore going farther, there is one point that I wish to make quiteclear.Whenever the people of a particular race make a specialty of someparticular type of wrong-doing, anyone who pointedly rebukes the faultymembers of that race is immediately accused of "race prejudice." Onaccount of the facts I am now setting forth about the doings of Italianand negro bird-killers, I expect to be accused along that line. If I am,I shall strenuously deny the charge. The facts speak for themselves.Zoologically, however, I am strongly prejudiced against the people ofany race, creed, club, state or nation who make a specialty of anyparticularly offensive type of bird or wild animal slaughter; and I donot care who knows it.The time was, and I remember it very well, when even the poorest gunnerscorned to kill birds that were not considered "game." In days langsyne, many a zoological collector has been jeered because the specimenshe had killed for preservation were not "game."But times have changed. In the wearing of furs, we have bumped downsteps both high and steep. In 1880 American women wore sealskin, marten,otter, beaver and mink. To-day nothing that wears hair is too humble tobe skinned and worn. To-day "they are wearing" skins of muskrats, foxes,rabbits, skunks, domestic cats, squirrels, and even rats. And see howthe taste for game,--of some sections of our population,--also has gonedown.In the North, the Italians are fighting for the privilege of eatingeverything that wears feathers; but we allow no birds to be shot forfood save game birds and cranes. In the South, the negroes and poorwhites are killing song-birds, woodpeckers and doves for food; and inseveral states some of it is done under the authority of the laws. Lookat these awful lists:       *        *        *        *        *IN THESE STATES, ROBINS ARE LEGALLY SHOT AND EATEN:Louisiana    North Carolina   Tennessee  TexasMississippi  South Carolina   Maryland   FloridaIN THESE STATES, BLACKBIRDS ARE LEGALLY SHOT AND EATEN:Louisiana    Pennsylvania        TennesseeDistrict of Columbia    South CarolinaCRANES ARE SHOT AND EATEN IN THESE STATES:Colorado    North Dakota    Nevada    Oklahoma    NebraskaIn Mississippi, the _cedar bird_ is legally shot and eaten! In NorthCarolina, the meadow lark is shot and eaten.IN THE FOLLOWING STATES, DOVES ARE CONSIDERED "GAME," AND ARE SHOT IN AN"OPEN SEASON:"Alabama            Georgia    Minnesota        OhioArkansas           Idaho      Mississippi      OregonCalifornia         Illinois   Missouri         PennsylvaniaConnecticut        Kentucky   Nebraska         South CarolinaDelaware           Louisiana  New Mexico       TennesseeDist. of Columbia  Maryland   North Carolina   Texas               Utah                       Virginia       *        *        *        *        *The killing of doves represents a great and widespread decline in theethics of sportsmanship. In the twenty-six States named, a great manymen who _call_ themselves sportsmen indulge in the cheap and ignoblepastime of potting weak and confiding doves. It is on a par with the"sport" of hunting English sparrows in a city street. Of course this is,to a certain extent, a matter of taste; but there is at least one clubof sportsmen into which no dove-killer can enter, provided his standardof ethics is known in advance.With the killing of robins, larks, blackbirds and cedar birds for food,the case is quite different. No white man calling himself a sportsmanever indulges in such low pastimes as the killing of such birds forfood. That burden of disgrace rests upon the negroes and poor whites ofthe South; but at the same time, it is a shame that respectable whitemen sitting in state legislatures should deliberately enact laws_permitting_ such disgraceful practices, or permit such disgraceful andungentlemanly laws to remain in force!Here is a case by way of illustration, copied very recently from theAtlanta _Journal_:  Editor _Journal_:--I located a robin roost up the Trinity River, six  miles from Dallas, and prevailed on six Dallas sportsmen to go with  me on a torch-light bird hunt. This style of hunting was, of course,  new to the Texans, but they finally consented to go, and I had the  pleasure of showing them how it was done.  Equipped with torch lights and shot guns, we proceeded. After  reaching the hunting grounds the sport began in reality, and  continued for two hours and ten minutes, with a total slaughter of  10,157 birds, an average of 1,451 birds killed by each man.  But the Texans give me credit for killing at least 2,000 of the  entire number. I was called 'the king of bird hunters' by the  sportsmen of Dallas, Texas, and have been invited to  command-in-chief the next party of hunters which go from Dallas to  the Indian Territory in search of large game.--F.L. CROW, Dallas,  Texas, former Atlantan.Dallas, Texas, papers and Oklahoma papers, please copy!As a further illustration of the spirit manifested in the South towardrobins, I quote the following story from Dr. P.P. Claxton, of theUniversity of Tennessee, as related in Audubon Educational Leaflet No.46, by Mr. T. Gilbert Pearson:--"The roost to which I refer," says Professor Claxton, "was situated inwhat is locally known as a 'cedar glade,' near Porestville, Bedford Co.,Tennessee. This is a great cedar country, and robins used to come inimmense numbers during the winter months, to feed on the berries.[Illustration: THE ROBIN OF THE NORTHOur best-beloved Song Bird, now being legally shot as "game" in theSouth. In the North there is now only one robin for every ten formerlythere.]"The spot which the roost occupied was not unlike numerous others thatmight have been selected. The trees grew to a height of from five tothirty feet, and for a mile square were literally loaded at night withrobins. Hunting them while they roosted was a favorite sport. A manwould climb a cedar tree with a torch, while his companions with polesand clubs would disturb the sleeping birds on the adjacent trees.Blinded by the light, the suddenly awakened birds flew to thetorch-bearer; who, _as he seized each bird would quickly pull off itshead_, and drop it into a sack suspended from his shoulders.[Illustration: THE MOCKING-BIRD OF THE SOUTHThis sweet singer of the South is NOT being shot in the Northfor food! No northern lawmaker ever will permit such barbarity.]"The capture of three of four hundred birds was an ordinary night'swork. Men and boys would come in wagons from all the adjoining countiesand camp near the roost for the purpose of killing robins. Many times,100 or more hunters with torches and clubs would be at work in a singlenight. _For three years_ this tremendous slaughter continued inwinter,--and then the survivors deserted the roost."[Illustration: NORTHERN ROBINS READY FOR SOUTHERN SLAUGHTER195 Birds at Avery Island, La. in January 1912, Photographed Daring theAnnual Slaughter, by E.A. McIlhenny]No: these people were not Apache Indians, led by a Geronimo who knew nomercy, no compassion. We imagine that they were mostly poor white trash,of Tennessee. One small hamlet sent to market annually enough deadrobins to return 500 at _five cents per dozen_; which means _120,000birds_!Last winter Mr. Edward A. McIlhenny of Avery Island, La. (south of NewIberia) informed me that every winter, during the two weeks that theholly berries are ripe thousands of robins come to his vicinity to feedupon them. "Then every negro man and boy who can raise a gun is afterthem. About 10,000 robins are slaughtered each day while they remain.Their dead bodies are sold in New Iberia at 10 cents each." Theaccompanying illustrations taken by Mr. McIlhenny shows 195 robins onone tree, and explains how such great slaughter is possible.An officer of the Louisiana Audubon Society states that a conservativeestimate of the number of robins annually killed in Louisiana for foodpurposes when they are usually plentiful, is a _quarter of a million_!The food of the robin is as follows:Insects, 40 per cent; wild fruit, 43 per cent; cultivated fruit, 8 percent, miscellaneous vegetable food, 5 per cent.SPECIAL WORK OF THE SOUTHERN NEGROES.--In 1912 a female colored servantwho recently had arrived from country life in Virginia chanced to remarkto me at our country home in the middle of August: "I wish I could findsome birds' nests!""What for?" I asked, rather puzzled."Why, to get the aigs and _eat 'em!_" she responded with a bright smileand flashing teeth."Do you eat the eggs of _wild_ birds?""Yes indeed! It's _fine_ to get a pattridge nest! From them we nearlyalways git a whole dozen of aigs at once,--back where I live, inVirginia.""Do the colored people of Virginia make a _practice_ of hunting for theeggs of wild birds, and eating them?""Yes, indeed we do. In the spring and summer, when the birds are around,we used to get out every Sunday, and hunt all day. Some days we'd comeback with a whole bucket full of aigs; and then we'd set up half thenight, cookin' and eatin' 'em. They was _awful_ good!"Her face fairly beamed at the memory of it.A few days later, this story of the doings of Virginia negroes was fullycorroborated by a colored man who came from another section of thatstate. Three months later, after special inquiries made at my request, agentleman of Richmond obtained further corroboration, from negroes. Hewas himself much surprised by the state of fact that was revealed tohim.In the North, the economic value of our song birds and other destroyersof insects and weed seeds is understood by a majority of the people, andas far as possible those birds are protected from all human enemies. Butin the South, a new division of the Army of Destruction has risen intodeadly prominence.In _Recreation_ Magazine for May, 1909, Mr. Charles Askins published amost startling and illuminating article, entitled "The South's Problemin Game Protection." It brought together in concrete form and witheye-witness reliability the impressions that for months previous hadbeen gaining ground in the North. In order to give the testimony of aman who has seen what he describes, I shall now give numerous quotationsfrom Mr. Askins' article, which certainly bears the stamp oftruthfulness, without any "race prejudice" whatever. It is a calm,judicial, unemotional analysis of a very bad situation: and Iparticularly commend it alike to the farmers of the North and all thetrue sportsmen of the South.In his opening paragraphs Mr. Askins describes game and huntingconditions in the South as they were down to twenty years ago, when thenegroes were too poor to own guns, and shooting was not for them.       *        *        *        *        *SPECIAL WORK OF THE SOUTHERN NEGROES.  It is all different now, says Mr. Askins, and the old days will only  come back with the water that has gone down the stream. The master  is with his fathers or he is whiling away his last days on the  courthouse steps of the town. Perhaps a chimney or two remain of  what was once the "big house" on the hill; possibly it is still  standing, but as forlorn and lifeless as a dead tree. The muscadine  grapes still grow in the swale and the persimmons in the pasture  field, but neither 'possum nor 'coon is left to eat them. The last  deer vanished years ago, the rabbits died in their baby coats and  the quail were killed in June. Old "Uncle Ike" has gone across the  "Great River" with his master, and his grandson glances at you  askance, nods sullenly, whistles to his half breed bird dog,  shoulders his three dollar gun and leaves you. He is typical of the  change and has caused it, this grandson of dear old Uncle Ike.  In the same way the white man is telling the black to abide upon the  plantation raising cotton and corn, and further than this nothing  will be required of him. He can cheat a white man or a black, steal  in a petty way anything that comes handy, live in marriage or out of  it to please himself, kill another negro if he likes, and lastly  shoot every wild thing that can be eaten, if only he raises the  cotton and the corn. But the white sportsmen of the South have never  willingly granted the shooting privilege in its entirety, and hence  this story. They have told him to trap the rabbits, pot the robins,  slaughter the doves, kill the song birds, but to spare the white  sportsman's game, the aristocratic little bobwhite quail.  In the beginning not so much damage to southern game interests could  be accomplished by our colored man and brother, however decided his  inclinations. He had no money, no ammunition and no gun. His weapons  were an ax, a club, a trap, and a hound dog; possibly he might own  an old war musket bored out for shot. Such an outfit was not adapted  to quail shooting and especially to wing shooting, with which  knowledge Dixie's sportsmen were content. Let the negro ramble about  with his hound dog and his war musket; he couldn't possibly kill the  quail. And so Uncle Ike's grandson loafed and pottered about in the  fields with his ax and his hound dogs, not doing so much harm to the  quail but acquiring knowledge of the habits of the birds and skill  as a still-hunting pot-hunter that would serve him well later on.  The negro belongs to a primitive race of people and all such races  have keener eyes than white men whose fathers have pored over lines  of black and white. He learned to see the rabbit in its form, the  squirrels in the leafy trees, and the quails huddled in the grass.  The least shade of gray in the shadow of the creek bank he  distinguished at once as a rabbit, a glinting flash from a tree top  he knew instantly as being caused by the slight movement of a hidden  squirrel, and the quiver of a single stem of sedge grass told him of  a bevy of birds hiding in the depths. The pot-hunting negro has all  the skill of the Indian, has more industry in his loafing, and kills  without pity and without restraint. This grandson of Uncle Ike was  growing sulky, too, with the knowledge that the white man was  bribing him with half a loaf to raise cotton and corn when he might  as well exact it all. And this he shortly did, as we shall see.  The time came when cotton went up to sixteen cents a pound and  single breech-loading guns went down to five dollars apiece. The  negro had money now, and the merchants--these men who had said let  the nigger alone so long as he raises cotton and corn--sold him the  guns, a gun for every black idler, man and boy, in all the South.  Then shortly a wail went up from the sportsmen, "The niggers are  killing our quail." They not only were killing them, but most of the  birds were already dead. On the grounds of the Southern Field Club  where sixty bevies were raised by the dogs in one day, within two  years but three bevies could be found in a day by the hardest kind  of hunting; and this story was repeated all over the South. Now the  negro began to raise bird dogs in place of hounds, and he carried  his new gun to church if services happened to be held on a week day.  Finally the negro had grown up and had compassed his ambition: he  could shoot partridges flying just the same as a white man, was a  white man except for a trifling difference in color; and he could  kill more birds, too, three times as many. It was merely a change  from the old order to the new in which a dark-skinned "sportsman"  had taken the place in plantation life of the dear old "Colonel" of  loved memory. The negro had exacted his price for raising cotton and  corn.[Illustration: THE SOUTHERN-NEGRO METHOD OF COMBING OUT THE WILD LIFE"Our colored sportsman is gregarious at all times, but especially so inthe matter of recreation. He may slouch about alone, and pot a bevy ortwo of quail when in actual need of something to eat, or when he has asale for the birds, but when it comes to shooting for fun he wants to bewith the 'gang'."--Charles Askins.Reproduced from Recreation Magazine. By permission of the Outdoor World.]  Our colored sportsman is gregarious at all times, but especially so  in the matter of recreation. He may slouch about alone and pot a  bevy or two of quail when in actual need of something to eat, or  when he has a sale for the birds, but when it comes to shooting for  fun he wants to be with the "gang." I have seen the darkies at  Christmas time collect fifty in a drove with every man his dog, and  spread out over the fields. Such a glorious time as he has then! A  single cottontail will draw a half-dozen shots and perhaps a couple  of young bucks will pour loads into a bunny after he is dead out of  pure deviltry and high spirits. I once witnessed the accidental  killing of a young negro on this kind of a foray. His companions  loaded him into a wagon, stuck a cigar in his mouth, and tried to  pour whiskey down him every time they took a drink themselves as  they rode back to town. This army of black hunters and their dogs  cross field after field, combing the country with fine teeth that  leave neither wild animal nor bird life behind.  There comes a time toward the spring of the year after the quail  season is over when the average rural darky is "between hay and  grass." The merchants on whom he has depended for supplies make it a  practice to refuse credit between January first and crop time. The  black has spent his cotton money, his sweet potato pile has  vanished, the sorghum barrel is empty, he has eaten the last of his  winter's pork, and all that remains is a bit of meal and the meat  his gun can secure. He is hunting in grim earnest now, using all the  cunning and skill acquired by years of practice. He eats  woodpeckers, jaybirds, hawks and skunks, drawing the line only at  crows and buzzards. At this season of the year I have carried  chicken hawks up to the cabins for the sake of watching the delight  of the piccaninnies who with glowing eyes would declare, "Them's  mos' as good as chicken." What happens to the robins, doves, larks,  red birds, mocking birds and all songsters in this hungry season  needs hardly to be stated.  It is also a time between hay and grass for the rabbits and the  quail. The corn fields are bare and the weed seeds are exhausted. A  spring cold spell pinches, they lose their vitality, become thin and  quite lack their ordinary wariness. Then the figure-four trap  springs up in the hedgerow and the sedge while the work of  decimation goes more rapidly along. The rabbits can no longer escape  the half-starved dogs, the thinning cover fails to hide the quail  and the song birds betray themselves by singing of the coming  spring.  With the growing scarcity of the game now comes the season of sedge  and field burning. This is done ostensibly to prepare the land for  spring plowing, but really to destroy the last refuge of the quail  and rabbits so that they can be bagged with certainty. All the  negroes of a neighborhood collect for one of these burnings, all  their dogs, and of course all the boys from six years old up. They  surround the field and set it on fire in many places, leaving small  openings for the game to dash out among the motley assembly. I have  seen quail fly out of the burning grass with flaming particles still  attached to them. They alight on the burnt ground too bewildered to  fly again and the boys and dogs pick them up. Crazed rabbits try the  gauntlet amidst the barking curs, shouting negroes and popping guns,  but death is sure and quick. The few quail that may escape have no  refuge from the hawks and nothing to eat, so every battue of this  kind marks the absolute end of the birds in one vicinity; and the  next day the darkies repeat the performance elsewhere.  At this season of the year, the first of May, the blacks are putting  in some of their one hundred working days while the single  breech-loader rusts in the chimney corner. Surely the few birds that  have escaped the foray of the "gang," lived through the hungry days,  and survived their burned homes can now call "Bob White" and mate in  peace. But school is out and the summer sun is putting new life into  the bare feet of the half-grown boys, and the halfbreed bird dogs  are busier than they were even in winter. The young rabbits are  killed before they get out of the nest, and the quail eggs must be  hidden rarely well that escape both the eyes of the boys and the  noses of the dogs. After all it is not surprising that but three  bevies remained of the sixty. Doubtless they would not, except that  nature is very kind to her own in the sunny South.  Not every white man in the South is a sportsman or even a shooter;  many are purely business men who have said let the "nigger" do as he  likes so long as he raises cotton and buys our goods. But Dixie has  her full share of true men of the out-of-doors and they have sworn  in downright Southern fashion that this thing has got to end.  Nevertheless their problem is deep and puzzling. In Alabama they  made an effort and a beginning. They asked for a law requiring every  man to obtain written permission before entering the lands of  another to hunt and shoot; they asked for a resident license law  taxing every gun not less than five dollars a year; for a shortened  season, a bag limit, and a complete system of State wardens.  Unfortunately, a lot of white farmers were in the same range as the  blacks, and being hit, too, they raised a great outcry. The result  was that the Alabama sportsmen got everything they asked for except  the foundation of the structure they were trying to build, the high  resident license or gun tax which alone could have shut out three  dollar guns and saved the remnant of the game. Under the new law the  sale of game was forbidden, neither could it be shipped out of the  State alive or dead; the ever popular non-resident license was  provided for; the season was shortened and the bag limited; the  office of State game warden was created with deputies to be paid  from fines; hunting upon the lands of another without written  permission became a misdemeanor; and then the whole thing was  nullified by reducing the resident license to nothing where a man  shot upon his own land, one dollar in his own county, and two  dollars outside of it. In its practical workings the new law amounts  to this: A few northern gunners have paid the non-resident license  fee, and enough resident licenses have been taken out by the city  sportsmen to make up the handsome salary of the State warden. The  negro still hunts upon his own land _or upon the land of the man who  wants corn and cotton raised_, with perfect indifference to the  whole thing. Who was to enforce the law against him? Not the one  disgusted deputy with three big counties to patrol who depended for  his salary upon the fines collected from the negroes. It would take  one man to every three miles square to protect the game in the  South.  The one effective way of dealing with the situation in Alabama was  to have legislated three dollar guns out of existence with a five  dollar tax, adding to this nearly a like amount on dogs. Hardly a  sportsman in the South will disagree with this conclusion. But  sportsmen never had a majority vote either in the South or in the  North, and the South's grave problem is yet unsolved.  I do not favor depriving the black man of his natural human right to  hunt and shoot. If he is the owner of land, or if he leases or rents  it, or if he does not, he should have exactly the same privilege of  hunting that the white man has. That is not the question now,  however, but how to restrict him to legal shooting, to make him  amenable to the law that governs the white man, to deprive him of  the absolute license he now enjoys to kill throughout the year  without mercy, without discrimination, without restraint. If only  for selfish reasons, we of the North should reach to southern  sportsmen a helping hand, for by and by the last of our migratory  song birds will go down into Dixie and never return.       *        *        *        *        *Mr. Askins has fairly stated a profoundly disturbing case. The remedymust contain at least three ingredients. The sportsmen of the South muststop the unjustifiable slaughter of their non-migratory game birds. As amatter of comity between states, the gentlemen of the South must passlaws to stop the killing of northern song-birds and all crop-protectingbirds, for food. Finally, all men, North and South, East and West, mustunite in the work that is necessary to secure the immediate enactment byCongress of a law for the federal protection of all migratory birds.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XIIIEXTERMINATION OF BIRDS FOR WOMEN'S HATS[D][Footnote D: In the preparation of this chapter and its illustrations, Ihave had much valuable assistance from Mr. C. William Beebe, whorecently has probed the London feather trade almost to the bottom.]It is high time for the whole civilized world to know that many of themost beautiful and remarkable birds of the world are now being_exterminated_ to furnish millinery ornaments for women's wear. The massof new information that we have recently secured on this traffic fromthe headquarters of the feather trade is appalling. Previously, I hadnot dreamed that conditions are half as bad as they are.It is entirely fitting that on this subject New York should send amessage to London. New York is almost a Spotless Town in plume-freemillinery, and London and Paris are the worst places in the world. Wehave cleaned house. With but extremely slight exceptions, the blood ofthe slaughtered innocents is no longer upon our skirts, and on thesubject of plumage millinery we have a right to be just as Pharisaicalas we choose.Here in New York (and also in New Jersey) no man may sell, own for saleor offer for sale the plumage of any wild American bird other than agame bird. More than that, the plumage of no foreign bird belonging toany bird family represented in the fauna of North America can be soldhere! There are only a few kinds of improper "millinery" feathers thatit is possible to sell here under the law. Thanks to the long andarduous campaign of the National Association of Audubon Societies,founded and for ten years directed by gallant William Dutcher, you nowsee on the streets of New York very, very little wild-bird plumage savethat from game birds.It is true that a few servant girls are now wearing the cast-offaigrettes of their mistresses; but they are only as one in a thousand.At Atlantic City there is said to be a fine display of servant-girl andladies-maid aigrettes. In New York and New Jersey, in Pennsylvania foreverything save the sale of heron and egret plumes (a privilege obtainedby a bunko game), in Massachusetts, and in many other of our States, thewild-birds'-plumage millinery business is dead. Two years ago, when theNew York legislature refused to repeal the Dutcher law, the MillineryAssociation asserted, and brought a cloud of witnesses to Albany toprove, that the enforcement of the law would throw thousands ofoperatives out of employment.[Illustration: BEAUTIFUL AND CURIOUS BIRDS NOW BEING DESTROYEDFOR THE FEATHER TRADE--(I)Belted KingfisherVictoria Crowned PigeonSuperb CallisteGreater Bird of ParadiseCommon TernCock of the Rock]The law is in effect; and the aigrette business is dead in this state.Have any operatives starved, or been thrown out of employment? We haveheard of none. They are now at work making very pretty hat ornaments ofsilk and ribbons, and gauze and lace; and "_They_ are wearing them."[Illustration: 1600 HUMMINGBIRD SKINS AT 2 CENTS EACH!Part of Lot Purchased by the Zoological Society at the Regular QuarterlyLondon Millinery Feather Sale, August, 1912.]But even while these words are being written, there is one large fly inthe ointment. The store-window of E. &. S. Meyers, 688 Broadway, NewYork, contains about _six hundred plumes and skins of birds of paradisefor sale for millinery purposes_. No wonder the great bird of paradiseis now almost extinct! Their sale here is possible because the Dutcherlaw protects from the feather dealers only the birds that belong toavian families represented in the United States. With fiendish cunningand enterprise, the shameless feather dealers are ferreting out thebirds whose skins and plumes may legally be imported into this countryand sold; but we will meet that with a law that will protect allforeign birds, so far as we are concerned. Now it is time for theuniversal enactment of a law which will prohibit the sale and use asornaments of the plumage, feathers or skins of _any_ wild bird that isnot a legitimate game bird.London is now the head of the giant octopus of the "feather trade" thathas reached out its deadly tentacles into the most remote wildernessesof the earth, and steadily is drawing in the "skins" and "plumes" and"quills" of the most beautiful and most interesting _unprotected_ birdsof the world. The extent of this cold-blooded industry, supported byvain and hard-hearted women, will presently be shown in detail. Paris isthe great manufacturing center of feather trimming and ornaments, andthe French people obstinately refuse to protect the birds fromextermination, because their slaughter affords employment to a certainnumbers of French factory operatives.All over the world where they have real estate possessions, the men ofEngland know how to protect game from extermination. The English aregood at protecting game--when they decide to set about it.Why should London be the Mecca of the feather-killers of the world?It is easily explained:(1) London has the greatest feather market in the world; (2) the featherindustry "wants the money"; and (3) the London feather industry iswilling to spend money in fighting to retain its strangle-hold on theunprotected birds of the world.Let us run through a small portion of the mass of fresh evidence beforeus. It will be easier for the friends of birds to read these detailshere than to procure them at first hand, as we have done.The first thing that strikes one is the fact that the feather-huntersare scattered _all over the world where bird life is plentiful_ andthere are no laws to hinder their work. I commend to every friend ofbirds this list of the species whose plumage is to-day being bought andsold in large quantities every year in London. To the birds of the worldthis list is of deadly import, for it spells extermination.The reader will notice that it is the way of the millinery octopus toreach out to the uttermost ends of the earth, and take everything thatit can use. From the trackless jungles of New Guinea, round the worldboth ways to the snow-capped peaks of the Andes, no unprotected bird issafe. The humming-birds of Brazil, the egrets of the world at large, therare birds of paradise, the toucan, the eagle, the condor and the emu,all are being _exterminated_ to swell the annual profits of themillinery trade. The case is _far_ more serious than the world at largeknows, or even suspects.

As one item, let us take the salesin London in February, May and October, 1911, because they bring thesubject well down to date. My agent's explanatory note is as follows:"These three sales represent six months. Very nearly double thisquantity is sold by these four firms in a year. We must also take intoconsideration that all the feathers are not brought to the Londonmarket, and that _very large shipments are also made direct to theraw-feather dealers and manufacturers of Paris and Berlin, and thatAmsterdam also gets large quantities from the West Indies_. For yourpurpose, I report upon three sales, at different periods of the year1911, and as those sales do not vary much, you will be able to judge theconsumption of birds in a year."The "aigrettes" of the feather trade come from egrets, and, being verylight, it requires the death of several birds to yield one ounce. Inmany catalogues, the word "albatross" stands for the jabiru, anearly-exterminated species of giant stork, inhabiting South America."Rhea" often stands for vulture plumage.If the feather dealers had deliberately attempted to form an educationallist of the most beautiful and the most interesting birds of the world,they could hardly have done better than they have done in the abovelist. If it were in my power to show the reader a colored plate of eachspecies now being exterminated by the feather trade, he would bestartled by the exhibit. That the very choicest birds of the whole avianworld should be thus blotted out at the behest of vain and heartlesswomen is a shame, a disgrace and world-wide loss.       *        *        *        *        *LONDON FEATHER SALE OF FEBRUARY, 1911_Sold by Hale & Sons            Sold by Dalton & Young_Aigrettes         3,069 ounces    Aigrettes         1,606 ouncesHerons              960 "         Herons              250 "Birds of Paradise 1,920 skins     Paradise          4,330 bodies_Sold by Figgis & Co.

The defenders of the feather trade areat great pains to assure the world that in the monthly, bi-monthly andquarterly sales, feathers often appear in the market twice in the sameyear; and this statement is made for them in order to be absolutelyfair. Recent examinations of the plume catalogues for an entire year,marked with the price _paid_ for each item, reveals very few which areblank, indicating no sale! The subtractions of the duplicated itemswould alter the result only very slightly.The full extent of England's annual consumption of the plumage of wildbirds slaughtered especially for the trade never has been determined. Idoubt whether it is possible to ascertain it. The information that wehave is so fragmentary that in all probability it reflects only a smallportion of the whole truth, but for all that, it is sufficient to provethe case of the Defenders of the Birds _vs_. the London Chamber ofCommerce.IMPORTS OF FEATHERS AND DOWN (ORNAMENTAL) FOR THE YEAR 1910                            _Pounds_           _Value_Venezuela                     8,398           191,058Brazil                          787              5,999Japan                         2,284              3,830China                         6,329             16,308Tripoli                         345                900Egypt                        21,047             89,486Java, Sumatra, and Borneo    15,703            186,504Cape of Good Hope           709,406[E]       9,747,146British India                18,359             22,137Hong-Kong                       310              3,090British West Indies              30                 97Other British Colonies       10,438             21,938[Footnote E: Chiefly Ostrich feathers.]The above does not take into account the feathers from game birdsreceived in England from France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium andthe Netherlands.As a final side-light on the quantity of egret and heron plumes offeredand sold in London during the twelve months ending in April, 1912, weoffer the following exhibit:"OSPREY" FEATHERS (EGRET AND HERON PLUMES) SOLD IN LONDON DURING THEYEAR ENDING APRIL. 1912                                    _Offered_          _Sold_Venezuelan, long and medium       11,617 ounces     7,072 ouncesVenezuelan, mixed Heron            4,043   "        2,539   "Brazilian                          3,335   "        1,810   "Chinese                              641   "          576   "                                  19,636 ounces    11,997 ouncesBirds of Paradise, plumes (2 plumes = 1 bird)                                  29,385           24,579[Illustration: BEAUTIFUL AND CURIOUS BIRDS NOW BEING DESTROYEDFOR THE FEATHER TRADE--(III)Griffon VultureHerring GullJabiruCondorEmeuIndian Adjutant]Under the head of "Hummingbirds Not Wanted," Mr. Downham is at greatpains to convey[F] the distinct impression that to-day hummingbirds arescorned by the feather trade, and the demand for them is dead. _Ibelieved him_--until my agent turned in the following statement:Hummingbirds sold by Lewis & Peat, London, February, 1911   24,800Hummingbirds sold by Lewis & Peat, London, May, 1911         6,250Hummingbirds sold by Hale & Sons, London, October, 1911     10,040                                                            ------                                                      Total 41,090It is useless for anyone to assert that these birds were merely"offered," and not actually sold, as Mr. Downham so laboriously explainsis the regular course with hummingbird skins; for that will deceive nointelligent person.

The reason isthat there are no longer enough birds of that group to hold a place inthe London market! Few indeed are the Americans who know that from 1900to 1908 the lake region of southern Oregon was the scene of theslaughter of uncountable thousands of those birds, which continued untilthe grebes were almost exterminated.When the wonderful lyre-bird of Australia had been almost exterminatedfor its tail feathers, its open slaughter was stopped by law, and aheavy fine was imposed on exportation, amounting, I have been told, to250 for each offense. My latest news of the lyre-bird was of thesurreptitious exportation of 200 skins to the London feather market.In India, the smuggling outward of the skins of protected birds isconstantly going on. Occasionally an exporter is caught and fined; butthat does not stop the traffic.Bird-lovers must now bid farewell forever to all the birds of paradise.Nothing but the legal closing of the world's markets against theirplumes and skins can save any of them. They never were numerous; nordoes any species range over a wide area. They are strictly insular, andthe island homes of some of them are very small. Take the great bird ofparadise (_Paradisea apoda_) as an illustration. On Oct. 2, 1912, atIndianapolis, Indiana, a city near the center of the United States, inthree show-windows within 100 feet of the headquarters of the FourthNational Conservation Congress, I counted 11 stuffed heads and 11complete sets of plumes of this bird, displayed for sale. The pricesranged from 30 to 47.50 each! And while I looked, a large ladyapproached, pointed her finger at the remains of a greater bird ofparadise, and with grim determination, said to her shopping companion:"There! I want one o' them, an' I'm agoin' to _have_ it, too!"Says Mr. James Buckland in "Pros and Cons of the Plumage Bill":"Mr. Goodfellow has returned within the last few weeks from a secondexpedition to new Guinea.... One can now walk, he states, miles andmiles through the former haunts of these birds [of paradise] withoutseeing or hearing even the commonest species. When I reflect on thissacrilege, I am lost in wonder at the apathy of the British public."Mr. Carl Hagenbeck wrote me only three months ago that "the condors ofthe Andes are all being exterminated for their feathers, and these birdsare now very difficult to obtain."The egret and heron plumes, known under the trade name of "osprey, etc.,feathers," form by far the most important item in each feather sale.There are _fifteen_ grades! They are sold by the ounce, and the pricesrange all the way from twenty-eight cents per ounce for "mixed heron" to_two hundred and twenty-five shillings_ (45.60) per ounce for the bestBrazilian "short selected," on February 7, 1912! Is it any wonder thatin Philadelphia the prices of finished aigrettes, ready to be worn, runsfrom 20 to 125!The plumes that run up into the big figures are the "short selected"coming from the following localities, and quoted at the prices set downhere in shillings and pence. Count the shilling at twenty-four cents,United States money.PRICES OF "SHORT SELECTED" EGRET AND HERON PLUMES, IN LONDON ON FEBRUARY7, 1912(Lewis & Peat's List)East Indies per ounce, 117/6 to 207/6 = 49.80 max.Rangoon      "    "    150/0  " 192/6 =  46.20  "China        "    "    130/0  " 245/0 =  58.80  "Brazil       "    "    200/0  " 225/0 =  54.00  "Venezuela    "    "    165/0  " 222/6 =  53.40  "The total offering of these "short selected" plumes in December 1911,was 689 ounces, and in February, 1912, it was 230 ounces.Now with these enormous prices prevailing, is it any wonder that theegrets and herons are being relentlessly pursued to the uttermost endsof the earth? I think that any man who really knows the habits of egretsand herons, and the total impossibility of any quantity of their shedfeathers being picked up in a marketable state, must know in his heartthat if the London and continental feather markets keep open a few yearslonger, _every species_ that furnishes "short selected" plumes will beutterly exterminated from off the face of the earth.Let the English people make no mistake about this, nor be fooled by anyfairy tales of the feather trade about Venezuelan "garceros," and vastquantities of valuable plumes picked off the bushes and out of the mud.Those carefully concocted egret-farm stories make lovely reading, butthe reader who examines the evidence will soon decide the extent oftheir truthfulness. I think that they contain not even ten per cent oftruth; and I shall not rest until the stories of Leon Laglaize andMayeul Grisol have been put to the test in the regions where theyoriginated.A _few_ plumes may be picked out of the jungle, yes; but as for any_commercial quantity_, it is at present beyond belief. Besides, we havedirect, eye-witness testimony to the contrary.It must not be inferred that the friends of birds in England have beenidle or silent in the presence of the London feather trade. On thecontrary, the Royal Society for the Protection of Wild Birds and Mr.James Buckland have so strongly attacked the feather industry that theLondon Chamber of Commerce has felt called upon to come to its rescue.Mr. Buckland, on his own individual account, has done yeoman service tothe cause, and his devotion to the birds, and his tireless energy, areboth almost beyond the reach of praise in words. At the last momentbefore going to press I learn that the birds'-plumage bill has achievedthe triumph of a "first reading" in Parliament, which looks as ifsuccess is at last in sight. The powerful pamphlet that he has written,published and circulated at his own expense, entitled "Pros and Cons ofthe Plumage Bill," is a splendid effort. What a pity it is that moreindividuals are not similarly inspired to make independent effort in theprotection cause! But, strange to say, few indeed are the men who haveeither the nerve or the ability to "go it alone."On the introduction in Parliament of the bill to save the birds from thefeather trade, it was opposed (through the efforts of the Chamber ofCommerce), on the ground that if any bill against the sale of plumesshould pass, and plumes could not be sold, the London business inwild-bird skins and feathers "would immediately be transferred to thecontinent!"In the face of that devastating and altogether horrible prospect, andbecause the London feather dealers "need the money," the bill was atfirst defeated--to the great joy of the Chamber of Commerce and Mr.Downham; but the cause of birds will win in the end, because it isRight.The feather dealers have been shrewdly active in the defense of theirtrade, and the methods they have employed for influencing public opinionhave quite outshone those put forth by their brethren in America. I havebefore me a copy of a booklet bearing the name of Mr. C.F. Downham asthe author, and the London Chamber of Commerce has loaned its good nameas publisher. Altogether it is a very shrewd piece of work, even thoughits arguments in justification of bird slaughter for the feather marketare too absurd and weak for serious consideration.The chief burden of the defender of bird slaughter for millinerypurposes is on account of the destruction of egrets and herons, butparticularly the former. To offset as far as possible the absolutelytrue charge that egrets bear their best plumes in their breeding season,when the helpless young are in the nest and the parent birds must bekilled to obtain the plumes, the feather trade has obtained from threeFrenchmen--Leon Laglaize, Mayeul Grisol, and F. Geay--a beautiful andplausible story to the effect that in Venezuela the enormous output ofegret plumes has been obtained _by picking up, off the bushes and out ofthe water and mud, the shed feathers of those birds!_ According to thestory, Venezuela is full of _egret farms_, called "garceros,"--where thebirds breed and moult under strict supervision, and kindly drop theirfeathers in such places that it is possible _to find them_, and to _pickthem up_, in a high state of preservation! And we are asked to believethat it is these very Venezuelan picked-up feathers that command inLondon the high price of _44 per ounce_.[Illustration: THE FIGHT IN ENGLAND AGAINST THE USE OF WILD BIRD'SPLUMAGE IN THE MILLINERY TRADESandwich-men Employed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,that Patroled London Streets in July, 1911.]Mr. Laglaize is especially exploited by Mr. Downham, as a Frenchtraveler of high standing, and well known in the zoological museums ofFrance; but, sad to say, when Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn cabled to theMuseum of Natural History in Paris, inquiring about Mr. Laglaize, thecable flashed back the one sad word; "_Inconnu!_" (Unknown!)I think it entirely possible that enough shed feathers have been pickedup in the reeking swamps of Venezuela, on the upper tributaries of theOrinoco, to afford _an excuse_ for the beautiful story of Mr. Laglaize.Any shrewd individual with money, and the influence that money secures,could put up just such a "plant" as I firmly believe _has_ been put upby some one in Venezuela. I will guarantee that I could accomplish sucha job in Venezuela or Brazil, in four months' time, at an expense notexceeding one thousand dollars.That the great supply of immaculately perfect egret plumes that annuallycome out of Venezuela could by any possibility be picked up in theswamps where they were shed and dropped by the egrets, is entirelypreposterous and incredible. The whole proportion is denounced byseveral men of standing and experience, none of whom are "_inconnu_."As a sweeping refutation of the fantastic statements regarding"garceros," published by Mr. Downham as coming from Messrs. Laglaize,Grisol and Geay, I offer the written testimony of an American gentlemanwho at this moment owns and maintains within a few yards of hisresidence a large preserve of snowy egrets and herons, the formerrepresenting the species which furnishes egret plumes exactly similar tothose shipped from Venezuela and Brazil. If the testimony of Mr.McIlhenny is not sufficient to stamp the statements of the threeFrenchmen quoted by Mr. Downham as absolute and thoroughly misleadingfalsehoods, then there is no such thing in this world as evidence. Isuggest a perusal of the statements of the three Frenchmen who arequoted with such confidence by Mr. Downham and published by the Hon.Chamber of Commerce at London, and then a careful reading of thefollowing letter:  Avery Island, La., June 17, 1912.  DEAR MR. HORNADAY:--  I have before me your letter of June 8th, asking for information as  to whether or no egrets shed their plumes at their nesting places in  sufficient quantities to enable them to be gathered commercially. I  most emphatically wish to state that it is impossible to gather at  the nesting places of these birds any quantity of their plumes. I  have nesting within 50 yards of where I am now sitting dictating  this letter not less than 20,000 pairs of the various species of  herons and egrets, and there are fully 2,500 pairs of snowy herons  nesting within my preserve.  During the nesting season, which covers the months of April, May and  June, I am through this heronry in a small canoe almost every day,  and often twice a day. I have had these herons under my close  inspection for the past 17 years, and I have not in any one season  picked up or seen more than half a dozen discarded plumes. Such  plumes as I have picked up, I have kept on my desk, and given to the  people who were interested. I remember that last year I picked up  four plumes of the snowy heron that were in one bunch. I think these  must have been plucked out by the birds fighting.  This year I have found only one plume so far. I enclose it herewith.  You will notice that it is one of the shorter plumes, and is badly  worn at the end, as have been all the plumes which I have picked up  in my heronry.  I am positive that it is not possible for natural shed plumes to be  gathered commercially. I have a number of times talked with plume  hunters from Venezuela and other South American countries, and I  have never heard of any egret feathers being gathered by their being  picked up after the birds have shed them.  I have heard of a number of heronries in South America that are  protected by the land owners for the purpose of gathering a yearly  crop of egret plumes, but this crop is gathered always by shooting a  certain percentage of the birds. This shooting is done by experts  with 22-calibre rifles, and does not materially disturb the nesting  colony. I have known of two men who have been engaged in killing the  birds on large estates in South America, who were paid regular  salaries for their services as egret hunters.  Very truly yours,  E.A. McIlhenny.I am more than willing to set the above against the fairy tale of Mr.Laglaize.Here is the testimony of A.H. Meyer, an ex-plume-hunter, who for nineyears worked in Venezuela. His sworn testimony was laid before theLegislature of the State of New York, in 1911, when the New YorkMilliners' Association was frantically endeavoring to secure the repealof the splendid Dutcher law. This witness was produced by the NationalAssociation of Audubon Societies."My attention has been called to the fact that certain commercialinterests in this city are circulating stories in the newspapers andelsewhere to the effect that the aigrettes used in the millinery tradecome chiefly from Venezuela, where they are gathered from the ground inthe large _garceros_, or breeding-colonies, of white herons."I wish to state that I have personally engaged in the work ofcollecting the plumes of these birds in Venezuela. This was my businessfor the years 1896 to 1905, inclusive. I am thoroughly conversant withthe methods employed in gathering egret and snowy heron plumes inVenezuela, and I wish to give the following statement regarding thepractices employed in procuring these feathers:"The birds gather in large colonies to rear their young. They have theplumes only during the mating and nesting season. After the period whenthey are employed in caring for their young, it is found that the plumesare virtually of no commercial value, because of the worn and frayedcondition to which they have been reduced. It is the custom in Venezuelato shoot the birds while the young are in the nests. A few feathers ofthe large white heron (American egret), known as the _Garza blanca_, canbe picked up of a morning about their breeding places, but these are ofsmall value and are known as "dead feathers." They are worth locally notover three dollars an ounce; while the feathers taken from the bird,known as "live feathers," are worth fifteen dollars an ounce."My work led me into every part of Venezuela and Colombia where thesebirds are to be found, and I have never yet found or heard of any_garceros_ that were guarded for the purpose of simply gathering thefeathers from the ground. No such condition exists in Venezuela. Thestory is absolutely without foundation, in my opinion, and has simplybeen put forward for commercial purposes."The natives of the country, who do virtually all of the hunting forfeathers, are not provident in their nature, and their practices are ofa most cruel and brutal nature. I have seen them frequently pull theplumes from wounded birds, leaving the crippled birds to die ofstarvation, unable to respond to the cries of their young in the nestsabove, which were calling for food. _I have known these people to tieand prop up wounded egrets on the marsh where they would attract theattention of other birds flying by. These decoys they keep in thisposition until they die of their wounds, or from the attacks of insects.I have seen the terrible red ants of that country actually eating outthe eyes of these wounded, helpless birds that were tied up by theplume-hunters._ I could write you many pages of the horrors practiced ingathering aigrette feathers in Venezuela by the natives for themillinery trade of Paris and New York."To illustrate the comparatively small number of dead feathers whichare collected, I will mention that in one year I and my associatesshipped to New York eighty pounds of the plumes of the large heron andtwelve pounds of the little recurved plumes of the snowy heron. In thiswhole lot there were not over five pounds of plumes that had beengathered from the ground--and these were of little value. Theplume-birds have been nearly exterminated in the United States andMexico, and the same condition of affairs will soon exist in tropicalAmerica. This extermination will come about because of the fact that theyoung are left to starve in the nest when the old birds are killed, anyother statement made by interested parties to the contrarynotwithstanding."I am so incensed at the ridiculously absurd and misleading stories thatare being published on this question that I want to give you thisletter, and, before delivering it to you, shall take oath to itstruthfulness."Here is the testimony of Mr. Caspar Whitney, of New York, formerlyeditor of _Outing_ Magazine and _Outdoor America_:"During extended travel throughout South America, from 1903 to 1907,inclusive, I journeyed, on three separate occasions, by canoe(1904-1907), on the Lower Orinoco and Apure rivers and theirtributaries. This is the region, so far as Venezuela is concerned, inwhich is the greatest slaughter of white herons for their plumage, ormore specifically for the marital plumes, which are carried only in themating and breeding season, and are known in the millinery trade as'aigrettes.'"There is literally no room for question. The snowy herons are killedexactly as I describe. It is the custom of all those who hunt for themillinery trade, and is recognized by the natives as the usual method."Here is the testimony of Mr. Julian A. Dimock, of Peekamose, N.Y., thefamous outdoor photographer, and illustrator of "Florida Enchantments":"I know a goodly number of the plume-hunters of Florida. I have campedwith them, and talked to them. I have heard their tales, and even fullaccounts of the 'shooting-up' of an egret rookery. Never has a man inFlorida suggested to me that plumes could be obtained without killingthe birds. I have known the wardens, and have visited rookeries afterthey had been 'shot-up,' and the evidence all pointed to the everlastinguse of the gun. _It is certainly not true that the plumes can beobtained without killing the birds bearing them_."Nineteen years ago, I visited the Cuthbert Rookery with one of the menwho discovered the birds nesting in that lake. He and his partner hadsold the plumes gathered there for more than a thousand dollars. Heshowed me how they hid in the bushes and shot the birds. He even gave mea chance to watch him kill two or three birds."I know personally the man chiefly responsible for the slaughter of thebirds at Alligator Bay. _He laughed at the idea of getting plumeswithout killing the birds!_ I well know the man who shot the birds upRogers River, and even saw some of the empty shells left on the groundby him.[Illustration: YOUNG EGRETS, UNABLE TO FLY, STARVINGThe Parent Birds had Been Killed by Plume Hunters][Illustration: SNOWY EGRET, DEAD ON HER NESTWounded in the Feeding-Grounds, and Came Home to Die. Photographed in aFlorida Rookery Protected by the National Association of AudubonSocieties]I have camped with Seminoles, whites, blacks, outlaws, and those withinthe pale, connected with plume-hunting, and all tell the same story:_The birds are shot to get the plumes._ The evidence of my own eyes, andthe action of the birds themselves, convinces me that there is not ashadow of doubt concerning this point."This sworn testimony from Mr. T.J. Ashe, of Key West, Florida, is verydirect and to the point:"I have seen many moulted and dropped feathers from wild plumed birds. Ihave never seen a moulted or dropped feather that was fit for anything.It is the exception when a plumed bird drops feathers of any value whilein flight. Whatever feathers are so dropped are those that are frayed,worn out, and forced out by the process of moulting. The moulting seasonis not during the hatching season, but is after the hatching season. Theshedding, or moulting, takes place once a year; and during this moultingseason the feathers, after having the hard usage of the year from wind,rain and other causes, when dropped are of absolutely no commercialvalue."Mr. Arthur T. Wayne, of Mount Pleasant, S.C., relates in sworn testimonyhis experience in attempting to secure egret plumes without killing thebirds:"It is utterly impossible to get fifty egret plumes from any colony ofbreeding birds without shooting the birds. Last spring, I went twice aweek to a breeding colony of American and snowy egrets, from early inApril until June 8. Despite the fact that I covered miles of territoryin a boat, I picked up but two American egret plumes (which I now have);but not a single snowy egret plume did I see, nor did my companion, whoaccompanied me on every trip."I saw an American egret plume on the water, and left it, purposely, tosee whether it would sink or not. Upon visiting the place a few daysafterwards, the plume was not in evidence, undoubtedly having sunk. Theplumes are chiefly shed in the air while the birds are going to orcoming from their breeding grounds. If that millinery plume law isrepealed, the fate of the American and snowy egrets is sealed, for thefew birds that remain will be shot to the very last one."Any man who ever has been in an egret rookery (and I have) knows thatthe above testimony is _true_! The French story of the beautiful andsmoothly-running egret farms in Venezuela is preposterous, save for amere shadow of truth. I do not say that _no_ egret plumes could bepicked up, but I do assert that the total quantity obtainable in oneyear in that way would be utterly trivial.No; the "ospreys" of the British feather market come from slaughteredegrets and herons, _killed in the breeding season_. Let the Britishpublic and the British Parliament make no mistake about that. If theywish the trade to continue, let it be based on the impregnable groundthat the merchants want the money, and not on a fantastic dream that istoo silly to deceive even a child that knows birds.The use or disuse of wild birds' plumage as millinery ornaments isanother of those wild-life subjects regarding which there is no room forargument. To assert that the feather-dealers want the business for themoney it brings them is not argument! We have seen many a steam rollergo over Truth, and Right, and Justice, by main strength and red-hotpower; but Truth and Right refuse to stay flat down. There is on thisearth not one wild-animal species--mammal, bird or reptile--that canlong withstand exploitation for commercial purposes. Even the whales ofthe deep sea, the walrus of the arctic regions, the condors of the Andesand alligators of the Everglade morasses are no exception to theuniversal rule.In Mr. Downham's book there is much fallacious reasoning, and manyconclusions that are not borne out by the facts. For example, he saysthat no species of bird of paradise has been diminished in number byslaughter for the feather trade; that Florida still contains a supply ofegrets; that the decrease in bird life should be charged to the spreadof cities, towns and farms, and not to the trade; that the trade was "inno way responsible" for the slaughter of three hundred thousand gullsand albatrosses on Laysan Island!I have space to notice one other important erroneous conclusion that Mr.Downham publishes in his book, on page 105. He says:"The destruction of birds in foreign countries is something that notrade can direct or control."This is an amazing declaration; and absolutely contrary to experience.Let me prove what I say by a fresh and incontestable illustration:Prior to April, 1911, when Governor Dix signed the Bayne law against thesale of wild native game in the State of New York, Currituck County,N.C., was a vast slaughter-pen for wild fowl. No power or persuasion hadavailed to induce the people of North Carolina to check, or regulate, orin any manner mitigate that slaughter of geese, ducks and swans. It wasestimated that two hundred thousand wild fowl were annually slaughteredthere.We who advocated the Bayne law said: "Close the New York markets againstCurrituck birds, and you will stop a great deal of the slaughter."We cleaned our Augean stable. The greatest game market in America wasabsolutely closed.Last winter (1911) the annual killing of wild fowl was fully fifty percent less than during previous years. In one small town, twentyprofessional duck shooters went entirely out of business--because they_couldn't sell their ducks_! The dealers refused to buy them. The resultwas exactly what we predicted it would be; and this year, it is reportedover and over that ducks are more plentiful in New England than theyhave been in twenty years previously! The result is wonderful, becauseso quick.Beyond all question, the feather merchants of London, Paris and Berlinabsolutely control the bird-killers of Venezuela, China, New Guinea.Mexico and South America. Let the word go forth that "the trade" is nolonger permitted to buy and sell egret and heron plumes, skins of birdsof paradise and condor feathers, and presto! the killing industry fallsdead the next moment.[Illustration: MISCELLANEOUS BIRD SKINS, 8 CENTS EACHPurchased by the New York Zoological Society from the Quarterly Sale inLondon, August, 1912]Yes, indeed, members of the British Parliament: it is easily within_your power_ to wipe out at a single stroke fully one-half of the birdslaughter for fancy feathers. It can be done just as we wiped outone-half the annual duck slaughter in wickedly-wasteful North Carolina!The feather trade absolutely _does_ control the killing situation! Now,will the people of England clean house by controlling the feather trade?If a hundred species of the most beautiful birds of the world must beexterminated for the feather trade, let the odium rest elsewhere than onthe people of England.The bird-lovers of America may rest assured that the bird-lovers ofEngland--a mighty host--are neither careless nor indifferent regardingthe wild-birds' plumage business. On the contrary, several bills havebeen brought before Parliament intended to regulate or prohibit thetraffic, and a measure of vast importance to the birds of the world isnow before the House of Commons. It is backed by Mr. Percy Alden, M.P.,by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, by the SelbourneSociety, and by Mr. James Buckland--a host in himself. For years pastthat splendidly-equipped and well-managed Royal Society has wagedceaseless warfare for the birds. Its activity has been tremendous, andits membership list contains many of the finest names in England. Theaddress of the Honorary Secretary, Frank E. Lemon, Esq., is 23 QueenAnne's Gate, London, S.W.Naturally, these influences are opposed by the Textile Trade Section ofthe London Chamber of Commerce, and their only argument consists of theplea that if London doesn't get the money out of the feather trade, theContinent will get it! A reasonable, logical, magnificent and convincingexcuse for wholesale bird slaughter, truly!Mr. Buckland has been informed from the Continent that the people ofFrance, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium are waiting and watching tosee what England is going to do with the question, "To slaughter, or notto slaughter?" For England has no monopoly of the birds' plumage trade,not by any means. Says Mr. Buckland ("Pros and Cons of the PlumageBill," page 17):"As regards the vast majority of fancy feathers used in millinery, theContinent receives its own supplies. The feathers of the hundreds ofthousands of albatrosses which are killed in the North Pacific all go toParis. Of the untold thousands of 'magpies,' owls, and other specieswhich come from Peru, not one skin or feather crosses the Channel. Thewhite herons of the Upper Senegal and the Niger are being rapidlyexterminated at the instigation of the feather merchants, but not one ofthe plumes reaches London. Paris receives direct a large supply ofaigrettes from South America and elsewhere.... The millions ofswallows and other migratory birds which are killed annually as theypass through Italy, France and Spain on their way north, supply themillinery trade of Europe with an incredible quantity of wings and otherplumage, but none of it is distributed from London.... London, as adistributing center, has no monopoly of the trade in raw feathers."Mr. Buckland's green-covered pamphlet is a powerful document, and bothhis facts and his conclusions seem to be unassailable. The author'saddress is Royal Colonial Institute, Northumberland Ave., London, W.C.The duty of the civilized nations of Europe is perfectly plain. Thesavage and bloody business in feathers torn from wild birds should bestopped, completely and forever. If the commons will not arise andreform the odious business out of existence, then the kings and queensand presidents should do their plain duty. In the suppression of a worldcrime like this it is clearly a case of _noblesse oblige_!       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XIV.THE BIRD TRAGEDY ON LAYSAN ISLANDThis chapter is a curtain-dropper to the preceding chapter. As aclearly-cut, concrete case, the reader will find it unique andunsurpassed. It should be of lively interest to every American becausethe tragedy occurred on American territory.In the far-away North Pacific Ocean, about seven hundred miles fromHonolulu west-b'-north, lies the small island of Laysan. It is level,sandy, poorly planted by nature, and barren of all things likely toenlist the attention of predatory man. To the harassed birds ofmid-ocean, it seemed like a secure haven, and for ages past it has beeninhabited only by them. There several species of sea birds, large andsmall, have found homes and breeding places. Until 1909, the inhabitantsconsisted of the Laysan albatross, black-footed albatross, sooty tern,gray-backed tern, noddy tern, Hawaiian tern, white tern, Bonin petrel,two shearwaters, the red-tailed tropic bird, two boobies and theman-of-war bird.Laysan Island is two miles long by one and one-half miles broad, and attimes it has been literally covered with birds. Its bird life was firstbrought prominently to notice in 1891, by Henry Palmer, the agent ofHon. Walter Rothschild, and in 1902 and 1903 Walter K. Fisher and W.A.Bryan made further observations.Ever since 1891 the bird life on Laysan has been regarded as one of thewonders of the bird world. One of the photographs taken prior to 1909shows a vast plain, apparently a square mile in area, covered andcrowded with Laysan albatrosses. They stand there on the level sand,serene, bulky and immaculate. Thousands of birds appear in one view--avery remarkable sight.Naturally man, the ever-greedy, began to cast about for ways by which toconvert some product of that feathered host into money. At first guanoand eggs were collected. A tramway was laid down and small box-cars wereintroduced, in which the collected material was piled and pushed down tothe packing place.For several years this went on, and the birds themselves were notmolested. At last, however, a tentacle of the feather-trade octopusreached out to Laysan. In an evil moment in the spring of 1909, apredatory individual of Honolulu and elsewhere, named Max Schlemmer,decided that the wings of those albatross, gulls and terns should betorn off and sent to Japan, whence they would undoubtedly be shipped toParis, the special market for the wings of sea-birds slaughtered in theNorth Pacific.[Illustration: LAYSAN ALBATROSSES, BEFORE THE GREAT SLAUGHTERBy the Courtesy of Hon. Walter Rothschild.][Illustration: LAYSAN ALBATROSS ROOKERY, AFTER THE GREAT SLAUGHTERThe Same Ground as Shown in the Preceding Picture, Photographed in 1911by Prof. Homer R. Dill]Schlemmer the Slaughterer bought a cheap vessel, hired twenty-threephlegmatic and cold-blooded Japanese laborers, and organized a raid onLaysan. With the utmost secrecy he sailed from Honolulu, landed hisbird-killers upon the sea-bird wonderland, and turned them loose uponthe birds.For several months they slaughtered diligently and without mercy.Apparently it was the ambition of Schlemmer to kill every bird on theisland.By the time the bird-butchers had accumulated between three and fourcar-loads of wings, and the carnage was half finished, William A. Bryan,Professor of Zoology in the College of Honolulu, heard of it andpromptly wired the United States Government.Without the loss of a moment the Secretary of the Navy despatched therevenue cutter _Thetis_ to the shambles of Laysan. When Captain Jacobsarrived he found that in round numbers about _three hundred thousand_birds had been destroyed, and all that remained of them were severalacres of bones and dead bodies, and about three carloads of wings,feathers and skins. It was evident that Schlemmer's intention was tokill all the birds on the island, and only the timely arrival of the_Thetis_ frustrated that bloody plan.The twenty-three Japanese poachers were arrested and taken to Honolulufor trial, and the _Thetis_ also brought away all the stolen wings andplumage with the exception of one shedful of wings that had to be leftbehind on account of lack of carrying space. That old shed, with oneend torn out, and supposed to contain nearly fifty thousand pairs ofwings, was photographed by Prof. Dill in 1911, as shown herewith.[Illustration: ACRES OF GULL AND ALBATROSS BONESPhotographed on Laysan Island by H.R. Dill, 1911]Three hundred thousand albatrosses, gulls, terns and other birds werebutchered to make a Schlemmer holiday! Had the arrival of the _Thetis_been delayed, it is reasonably certain that every bird on Laysan wouldhave been killed to satisfy the wolfish rapacity of one money-grubbingwhite man.In 1911, the Iowa State University despatched to Laysan a scientificexpedition in charge of Prof. Homer R. Dill. The party landed on theisland on April 24 and remained until June 5, and the report ofProfessor Dill (U.S. Department of Agriculture) is consumedlyinteresting to the friends of birds. Here is what he has said regardingthe evidences of bird-slaughter:"Our first impression of Laysan was that the poachers had stripped theplace of bird life. An area of over 300 acres on each side of thebuildings was apparently abandoned. Only the shearwaters moaning intheir burrows, the little wingless rail skulking from one grass tussockto another, and the saucy finch remained. It is an excellent example ofwhat Prof. Nutting calls the survival of the inconspicuous."Here on every side are bones bleaching in the sun, showing where thepoachers had piled the bodies of the birds as they stripped them ofwings and feathers. In the old open guano shed were seen the remains ofhundreds and possibly thousands of wings which were placed there butnever cured for shipping, as the marauders were interrupted in theirwork.[Illustration: SHED PILLED WITH WINGS OF SLAUGHTERED BIRDS ON LAYSANISLAND]"An old cistern back of one of the buildings tells a story of crueltythat surpasses anything else done by these heartless, sanguinarypirates, not excepting the practice of cutting wings from living birdsand leaving them to die of hemorrhage. In this dry cistern the livingbirds were kept by hundreds to slowly starve to death. In this way thefatty tissue lying next to the skin was used up, and the skin was leftquite free from grease, so that it required little or no cleaning duringpreparation."Many other revolting sights, such as the remains of young birds thathad been left to starve, and birds with broken legs and deformed beakswere to be seen. Killing clubs, nets and other implements used by thesemarauders were lying all about. Hundreds of boxes to be used in shippingthe bird skins were packed in an old building. It was very evident theyintended to carry on their slaughter as long as the birds lasted."Not only did they kill and skin the larger species but they caught andcaged the finch, honey eater, and miller bird. Cages and material formaking them were found."--(Report of an Expedition to Laysan Island in1911. By Homer R. Dill, page 12.)The report of Professor Bryan contains the following pertinentparagraphs:"This wholesale killing has had an appalling effect on the colony.... Itis conservative to say that fully one-half the number of birds of bothspecies of albatross that were so abundant everywhere in 1903 have beenkilled. The colonies that remain are in a sadly decimated condition....Over a large part of the island, in some sections a hundred acres in aplace, that ten years ago were thickly inhabited by albatrosses not asingle bird remains, while heaps of the slain lie as mute testimony ofthe awful slaughter of these beautiful, harmless, and without doubtbeneficial inhabitants of the high seas."While the main activity of the plume-hunters was directed against thealbatrosses, they were by no means averse to killing anything in thebird line that came in their way.... Fortunately, serious as were thedepredations of the poachers, their operations were interrupted beforeany of the species had been completely exterminated."But the work of the Evil Genius of Laysan did not stop with theslaughter of three hundred thousand birds. Mr. Schlemmer introducedrabbits and guinea-pigs; and these rapidly multiplying rodents now arethreatening to consume every plant on the island. If the plantsdisappear, many of the insects will go with them; and this will mean thedisappearance of the small insectivorous birds.In February, 1909, President Roosevelt issued an executive ordercreating the Hawaiian Islands Reservation for Birds. In this areincluded Laysan and twelve other islands and reefs, some of which areinhabited by birds that are well worth preserving. By this act, we mayfeel that for the future the birds of Laysan and neighboring islets aresecure from further attacks by the bloody-handed agents of the vainwomen who still insist upon wearing the wings and feathers of wildbirds.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XVUNFAIR FIREARMS, AND SHOOTING ETHICSFor considerably more than a century, the States of the American Unionhave enacted game-protective laws based on the principle that the wildgame belongs to the People, and the people's senators, representativesand legislators generally may therefore enact laws for its protection,prescribing the manner in which it may and may not be taken andpossessed. The soundness of this principle has been fully confirmed bythe Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Geer vs.Connecticut, on March 2, 1896.The tendency of predatory man to kill and capture wild game of all kindsby wholesale methods is as old as the human race. The days of the club,the stone axe, the bow and arrow and the flint-lock gun werecontemporaneous with the days of great abundance of game. Now that theadvent of breech-loaders, repeaters, automatics and fixed ammunition hasrendered game scarce in all localities save a very few, the thoughtfulman is driven to consider measures for the checking of destruction andthe suppression of wholesale slaughter.First of all, the deadly floating batteries and sail-boats wereprohibited. To-day a punt gun is justly regarded as a relic ofbarbarism, and any man who uses one places himself beyond the pale ofdecent sportsmanship, or even of modern pot-hunting. Strange to say,although the unwritten code of ethics of English sportsmen is verystrict, the English to this day permit wild-fowl hunting with guns ofhuge calibre, some of which are more like shot-cannons than shot-guns.And they say, "Well, there are still wild duck on our coast!"Beyond question, it is now high time for the English people to take upthe shot-gun question, and consider what to-day is fair and unfair inthe killing of waterfowl. The supply of British ducks and geese can notforever withstand the market gunners and their shot-cannons. Has not theBritish wild-fowl supply greatly decreased during the past fifteenyears? I strongly suspect that a careful investigation would reveal thefact that it has diminished. The Society for the Preservation of theFauna of the Empire should look into the matter, and obtain a series ofreports on the condition of the waterfowl to-day as compared with whatit was twenty years ago.In the United States we have eliminated the swivel guns, the punt gunsand the very-big-bore guns. Among the real sportsmen the tendency issteadily toward shot-guns of small calibre, especially under 12-gauge.But, outside the ranks of sportsmen, we are now face to face with twoautomatic and five "pump" shotguns of deadly efficiency. Of these, morethan one hundred thousand are being made and sold annually by the fivecompanies that produce them. Recently the annual output has beencarefully estimated from known facts to be about as follows:Winchester Arms Co., New Haven, Conn.  (1 Automatic and 1 Pump-gun)                           50,000 guns.Remington Arms Co., Ilion, N.Y.

Willthe hunters ever catch up?The anglers have steadily diminished the weight of the rod and the sizeof the line; and they have prohibited the use of gang hooks and nets. Inthis respect the initiative of the Tuna Club of Santa Catalina is worthyof the highest admiration. Even though the leaping tuna, the jewfish andthe sword-fish are big and powerful, the club has elected to raise thestandard of sportsmanship by making captures more difficult than everbefore. A higher degree of skill, and nerve and judgment, is required inthe angler who would make good on a big fish; and, incidentally, thefish has about double "the show" that it had fifteen years ago.That is Sportsmanship!But how is it with the men who handle the shot-gun?By them, the Tuna Club's high-class principle has been exactly reversed!In the making of fishing-rods, commercialism plays small part; but inabout forty cases out of every fifty the making of guns is solely amatter of dollars and profits.Excepting the condemnation of automatic and pump guns, I think that fewclubs of sportsmen have laid down laws designed to make shooting moredifficult, and to give the game more of a show to escape. Thousands ofgentlemen sportsmen have their own separate unwritten codes of honor,but so far as I know, few of them have been written out and adopted asbinding rules of action. I know that among expert wing shots it is anunwritten law that quail and grouse must not be shot on the ground, norducks on the water. But, among the three million gunners who annuallyshoot in the United States how many, think you, are there who in actualpractice observe any sentimental principles when in the presence ofkillable game? I should say about one man and boy out of every fivehundred.Up to this time, the great mass of men who handle guns have left it tothe gunmakers to make their codes of ethics, and hand them out with theloaded cartridges, all ready for use.For fifty years the makers of shot-guns and rifles have taxed theiringenuity and resources to make killing easier, especially for "amateur"sportsmen,--_and take still greater advantages of the game_! Look atthis scale of progression:FIFTY YEARS' INCREASE IN THE DEADLINESS OF FIREARMS.KIND OF GUN.

The Remington,Winchester, Marlin, Stevens and Union Companies are engaged in a madrace to see who can turn out the deadliest guns, and the most of them.On the market to-day there are five pump-guns, that fire six shots each,in about _six seconds_, without removal from the shoulder, by the quicksliding of a sleeve under the barrel, that ejects the empty shell andinserts a loaded one. There are two automatics that fire five shots eachin _five seconds or less_, by five pulls on the trigger! _Theautoloading gun is reloaded and cocked again wholly by its own recoil_.Now, if these are not machine guns, what are they?In view of the great scarcity of feathered game, and the number ofdeadly machine guns already on the market, the production of the lastand deadliest automatic gun (by the Winchester Arms Company), _alreadyin great demand_, is a crime against wild life, no less.Every human action is a matter of taste and individual honor.It is natural for the duck-butchers of Currituck to love the automaticshot-guns as they do, because they kill the most ducks per flock. Withtwo of them in his boat, holding _ten shots_, one expert duck-killercan,--and sometimes _actually does_, so it is said,--get every duck outof a flock, up to seven or eight.It is natural for an awkward and blundering wing-shot to love thedeadliest gun, in order that he may make as good a bag as an expert shotcan make with a double-barreled gun. It is natural for the hunter whodoes not care a rap about the extermination of species to love the gunthat will enable him to kill up to the bag limit, every time he takesthe field. It is natural for men who don't think, or who think incircles, to say "so long as I observe the lawful bag limit, whatdifference does it make what kind of a gun I use?"It is natural for the Remington, and Winchester, and Marlin gun-makersto say, as they do, "Enforce the laws! Shorten the open seasons! Reducethe bag limit, and then it won't matter what guns are used! But,--DON'Ttouch autoloading guns! Don't hamper Inventive Genius!"Is it not high time for American sportsmen to cease taking their moralprinciples and their codes of ethics from the gun-makers?Here is a question that I would like to put before every hunter of gamein America:In view of the alarming scarcity of game, in view of the impendingextermination of species by legal hunting, can any high-minded_sportsman_, can any _good citizen_ either sell a machine shot-gun oruse one in hunting?A gentleman is incapable of taking an unfair advantage of any wildcreature; therefore a gentleman cannot use punt guns for ducks, dynamitefor game fish, or automatic or pump guns in bird-shooting. The machineguns and "silencers" are grossly unfair, and like gang-hooks, nets anddynamite for trout and bass, their use in hunting must everywhere beprohibited by law. Times have changed, and the lines for protection mustbe more tightly drawn.[Illustration: THE CHAMPION GAME SLAUGHTER CASEOne Hour's Slaughter (218 Geese) With Two Automatic Shot-Guns]The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (Judge Orlady) has decided that thePennsylvania law against the use of automatic guns in hunting isentirely constitutional, because every state has a right to say how itsgame may and may not be killed.It is up to the American People to say _now_ whether their wild lifeshall be slaughtered by machinery, or not.If they are willing that it should be, then let us be consistent andsay--away with all "conservation!" The game conservators can endure agameless and birdless continent quite as well as the average citizencan.HOW THEY WORK.--There are a few apologists for the automatic and pumpguns who cheerfully say, "So long as the bag limit is observed whatdifference does it make how the birds are killed?"It is strange that a conscientious man should ask such a question, whenthe answer is apparent.We reply, "The difference is that an automatic or pump gun will killfully twice as many waterfowl as a double-barrel, _if not more_; and _itis highly undesirable that every gunner should get the bag limit ofbirds, or any number near it_! The birds can not stand it. Moreover,_the best states for ducks and geese have no bag limits on those birds_!"To-day, on Currituck Sound, for example, the market hunters are killingall the waterfowl they can sell. On Marsh Island, Louisiana, one man haskilled 369 ducks in one day, and another market gunner killed 430 in oneday.The automatic and the "pump" shot-guns are the favorite weapons of thegame-hog who makes a specialty of geese and ducks. It is no uncommonthing for a gunner who shoots a machine gun to get, with one gun, ashigh as _eight_ birds out of one flock. A man who has himself done thishas told me so._The Champion Game-Slaughter Case_.--Here is a story from Californiathat is no fairy tale. It was published, most innocently, in a westernmagazine, with the illustration that appears herewith, and in whichplease notice the automatic shot-gun:"February 5th, I and a friend were at one of the Glenn County Club'scamps.... Neither of us having ever had the pleasure of shooting overlive decoys, we were anxious, and could hardly wait for the sport tocommence. On arriving at the scene we noticed holes which had been dugin the ground, just large enough for a man to crawl into. These holeswere used for hiding places, and were deep enough so the sportsmen wouldbe entirely out of sight of the game. The birds are so wild that to movea finger will frighten them...."The decoys are wild geese which had been crippled and tamed for thispurpose. They are placed inside of silk net fences which are located oneach side of the holes dug for hiding places. These nets are the colorof the ground and it is impossible for the wild geese flying overhead todetect the difference."After we had investigated everything the expert caller and owner of theoutfit exclaimed: 'Into your holes!'"We noticed in the distance a flock of geese coming. Our caller in a fewseconds had their attention, and they headed towards our decoys. Soonthey were directly over us, but out of easy range of our guns. We wereanxious to shoot, but in obedience to our boss had to keep still, andsoon noticed that the birds were soaring around and in a short time werewithin fifteen or twenty feet of us. At that moment we heard thecommand, 'Punch 'em!' and the bombardment that followed was beyondimagining. _We had fired five shots apiece and found we had bagged tengeese from this one flock_."At the end of one hour's shooting we had 218 birds to our credit andwere out of ammunition."On finding that no more shells were in our pits we took our dead geeseto the camp and returned with a new supply of ammunition. We remained inthe pits during the entire day. When the sun had gone behind themountains we summed up our kill and _it amounted to 450 geese_!"The picture shown with this article gives a view of _the first hour'sshoot_. A photograph would have been taken of the remainder of theshoot, but it being warm weather the birds had to be shipped at once inorder to keep them from spoiling.[Illustration: SLAUGHTERED ACCORDING TO LAWA Result of a Faulty System. Such Pictures as this are Very Common inSportsmen's Magazines Note the Automatic Gun]"Supper was then eaten, after which we were driven back to Willows; bothagreeing that it was one of the greatest days of sport we ever had, andwishing that we might, through the courtesy of the Glenn County GooseClub, have another such day. C.H.B."Another picture was published in a Canadian magazine, illustrating astory from which I quote:"I fixed the decoys, hid my boat and took my position in the blind. Myman started his work with a will and hustled the ducks out of everycove, inlet or piece of marsh for two miles around. I had barely time toslip the cartridges into my guns--_one a double and the other a fiveshot automatic_--when I saw a brace of birds coming toward me. Theysailed in over my decoys. I rose to the occasion, and the leaderup-ended and tumbled in among the decoys. The other bird, unable to stopquick enough, came directly over me. He closed his wings and struck theground in the rear of the blind."More and more followed. Sometimes they came singly, and then in twosand threes. I kept busy and attended to each bird as quickly aspossible. Whenever there was a lull in the flight I went out in the boatand picked up the dead, leaving the wounded to take chances with anygunner lucky enough to catch them in open and smooth water. A bird handyin the air is worth two wounded ones in the water. _Twice I took sixdead birds out of the water for seven shots, and both guns empty_."The ball thus opened, the birds commenced to move in all directions.Until the morning's flight was over I was kept busy pumping lead, _firstwith the 10, then with the automatic_, reloading, picking up the dead,etc."And the reader will observe that the harmless, innocent, inoffensiveautomatic shot gun, that "don't matter if you enforce the bag limit,"figures prominently in both stories and both photographs._A Story of Two Pump Guns and Geese_:--It comes from Aberdeen, S.D.(Sand Lake), in the spring of 1911. Mr. J.J. Humphrey tells it, in_Outdoor Life_ magazine for July, 1911."Smith and I were about a hundred yards from them [the flock of Canadageese], when Murphy scared them. They rose in a dense mass and camedirectly between Smith and me. We were about gunshot distance apart, andthey were not over thirty feet in the air when we opened up on them withour pump guns and No. 5 shot. When the smoke cleared away and we hadrounded up the cripples we found we had twenty-one geese. I have heardof bigger killings out in this country, but never positively knew ofthem."So then: _those two gunners averaged 10-1/2 wild geese per pump gun outof one flock_! And yet there are wise and reflective sportsmen who say,"What difference does the kind of gun make so long as you live up to thelaw?"I think that the pump and automatic guns make about 75 _per-cent ofdifference, against the game_; that is all!The number of shot-guns now in use in the United States is almost beyondbelief. About six years ago a gentleman interested in the manufacture ofsuch weapons informed me, and his statement has never been disputed,that _every year_ about 500,000 new shot-guns were sold in the UnitedStates. The number of shot cartridges annually produced by our fourgreat cartridge companies has been reliably estimated as follows:Winchester Arms Co              300,000,000Union Metallic Cartridge Co     250,000,000Peters Cartridge Co             150,000,000Western Cartridge Co             75,000,000                                -----------                                775,000,000We must stop all the holes in the barrel, or eventually lose all thewater. No group of bird-slaughterers is entitled to immunity. We willnot "limit the bag, and enforce the laws," while we permit the makersand users of autoloading and pump guns to kill at will, as they demand.       *        *        *        *        *[Illustration: Copy of letter:National Association of Audubon SocietiesFounded 1901.

It was written to G.O. Shields, March 21, 1906.  DEAR SIR:  Regarding the use of the automatic shot-gun, would say that I am a  member of two southern ducking clubs where these guns are used very  extensively. I have seen a flock of ducks come into a blind where  one, two, or even three of these guns were in use, and have seen as  many as eleven shots poured into a single flock.  We have considerable poaching on one of these clubs, the territory  being so extensive that it is impossible to prevent it. We own  60,000 acres, and these poachers, I am told, nearly all use the  automatic guns. They frequently kill six or eight ducks out of one  flock--first taking a raking shot on the water, and then getting in  the balance of the magazine before the flock is out of range. In  fact, some of them carry two guns, and are able to discharge a part  of the second magazine into the same flock.  As I told you the other evening, I am not so much against the gun  when in the hands of gentlemen and real sportsmen, but, on account  of its terrible possibilities for market hunters, I believe that the  only safe way is to abolish it entirely, and that the better class  should be willing to give up this weapon as being the only means of  putting a stop to this willful game slaughter.  Very truly yours,  ARTHUR ROBINSON.       *        *        *        *        *HOW GENTLEMEN SPORTSMEN REGARD AUTOMATIC AND PUMP GUNSEach one of the following organizations, chiefly clubs of gentlemensportsmen, have adopted strong resolutions condemning the use ofautomatic guns in hunting, and either requesting or recommending theenactment of laws against their use:New York Zoological Society ...

The weapondischarges all three barrels simultaneously. In the _London Field_, ofDec. 9, 1911, it is described by a writer who also thoughtfully concealshis identity under a nom-de-plume. After a trial of 48 shots, the writerdeclares that "the 3-barreled is a really practicable weapon," and thatwith it one could bag wild-fowl that were quite out of reach of anyshot-gun. Just why a Gatling gun or a Maxim should not be employed forthe same purpose, the writer fails to state. The use of either would bequite as sportsmanlike, and as fair to the game. There are greatpossibilities in ducking mortars, also._The "Sunday Gun."_--A new weapon of peculiar form and great deadlinessto song birds, has recently come into use. Because of the manner of itsuse, it is known as the "Sunday gun." It is specially adapted toconcealment on the person. A man could go through a reception with oneof these deadly weapons absolutely concealed under his dress coat! It isa weapon with two barrels, rifle and shot; and it enables the user tokill anything from a humming-bird up to a deer. What the shot-barrel cannot kill, the rifle will. It is not a gun that any sportsman would own,save as a curiosity, or for target use.The State Ornithologist of Massachusetts, Mr. E.H. Forbush, informs methat already the "Sunday gun" has become a scourge to the bird life ofthat state. Thousands of them are used by men and boys who live incities and towns, and are able to get into the country only on Sundays.They conceal them under their coats, on Sunday mornings, go out into thecountry, and spend the day in shooting small birds and mammals. The deadbirds are concealed in various pockets, the Sunday gun goes under thecoat, and at nightfall the guerrilla rides back to the city with aninnocent smile on his face, as if he had spent a day in harmlessenjoyment of the beauties of nature.The "Sunday gun" is on sale everywhere, and it is said to be in use bothby American and Italian killers of song-birds. It weighs only twopounds, eight ounces, and its cost is so trifling that any guerrilla whowishes one can easily find the money for its purchase. There are in theUnited States at least a million men and boys quite mean enough to usethis weapon on song-birds, swallows, woodpeckers, nuthatches, rabbitsand squirrels, and like other criminals, hide both weapon and loot intheir clothing. So long as this gun is in circulation, no small bird issafe, at any season, near any city or town.Now, what are the People going to do about it?My recommendation is that each state enact a law in the following terms:Be it enacted, etc.--That from and after the passage of this act itshall be unlawful for any person to use in hunting, or to carryconcealed on the person, any shotgun, or rifle, or combination ofshotgun and rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than twenty-eightinches in length, or with a skeleton stock fixed on a hinge.The carrying of any rifle or shotgun concealed on the person shallconstitute a felony.The penalties for hunting with any gun specially adapted to concealmentshould be not less than 50 fine or two months imprisonment at hardlabor, and the carrying of such weapons concealed should be 100 or fourmonths at hard labor.Incidentally, we wonder what will be the next devilish device for thedestruction of wild life that American inventive genius will produce.[Illustration: THE "SUNDAY GUN!"A Deadly Combination of Concealable Rifle-and-Shot-Gun.][Illustration: THE WILDERNESS OF NORTH AMERICA (SHADED) AND THE ARCTICPRAIRIES, WELL STOCKED WITH BIG GAME]       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XVITHE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF NORTH AMERICAN BIG GAMEThe subject of this chapter opens up a vast field of facts andconclusions, quite broad enough to fill a whole volume. In the space atour disposal here it is possible to offer only a summary of the subject,without attempting to prove our statements by the production of detailedevidence.To say that all over the world, the large land mammals are beingdestroyed more rapidly than they are breeding, would not be literallytrue, for the reason that there are yet many areas that are almostuntouched by the destroying hand of civilized man. It is true, however,that all the unspoiled areas rapidly are growing fewer and smaller. Itis also true that in all the regions of the earth that are easilypenetrable by civilized man, the wild life is being killed faster thanit breeds, and of necessity it is disappearing. This is why the Britishare now so urgently bestirring themselves to create game preserves inall the countries that they own.It is one of the inexorable laws of Nature, to which I know of not oneexception, that large hoofed animals which live on open plains, on openmountains, or in regions that are thinly forested, always are easilyfound and easily exterminated. All such animals have a weak hold onlife. This is because it is so difficult for them to hide, and so veryeasy for man to creep up within the killing range of modern, high-power,long-range rifles. Is it not pitiful to think of animals like thecaribou, moose, white sheep and bear trying to survive on the nakedridges and bald mountains of Yukon Territory and Alaska! With a modernrifle, the greatest duffer on earth can creep up within killing distanceof any of the big game of the North.The gray wolf is practically the only large animal that is able to hidesuccessfully and survive in the treeless regions of the North; but hisroom is always preferable to his company, because he, too, is adestroyer of big game.I am tempted to try to map out roughly what are to-day the unopened andundestroyed wild haunts of big game in North America. In doing this,however, I warn the reader not to be deceived into thinking that becausegame still exists in those regions, those areas therefore constitute apermanent preserve and safe breeding-ground for large mammals. That isvery, very far from being the case. The further "opening up" of thewilderness areas, as I shall call them for convenience, can and surelywill quickly wipe out their big game; for throughout nine-tenths ofthose areas it holds to life by very slender threads.To-day the unopened and undestroyed wilderness areas of North America,wherein large mammals still live in a normal wild state, are in generalas follows:THE ARCTIC BARREN GROUNDS, or Arctic Prairies, north of the limit oftrees, embracing the Barren Grounds of northern Canada, the great arcticarchipelago, Ellesmere, Melville and Grant Lands and Greenland. Thisregion is the home of the musk-ox and three species of arctic caribou.THE ALASKA-YUKON REGION, inhabited by the moose, white mountain sheep,mountain goat, four species of caribou, and half a dozen species ofAlaska brown, grizzly and black bears.NORTHERN ONTARIO, QUEBEC, LABRADOR AND NEWFOUNDLAND, inhabited by moose,woodland caribou, white-tailed deer and black bear.BRITISH COLUMBIA, inhabited by a magnificent big-game fauna embracingthe moose, elk, caribou of two species, white sheep, black sheep,big-horn sheep, mule deer, white-tailed deer, mountain goat, grizzly,black and inland white bears.THE SIERRA MADRE OF MEXICO, containing jaguar, puma, _grizzly_ and blackbears, mule deer, white-tailed deer, antelope, mountain sheep andpeccaries.I have necessarily omitted all those regions of the United States andCanada that still contain a remnant of big game, but have been literally"shot to pieces" by gunners.In the United States and southern Canada there are about fifteenlocalities which contain a supply of big game sufficient that aconscientious sportsman might therein hunt and kill one head per yearwith a clear conscience. _All others should be closed for five years_!Here is the list of availables; and regarding it there will be about asmany opinions as there are big-game sportsmen:       *        *        *        *        *HUNTING GROUNDS IN AND NEAR THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTHERN CANADAWHEREIN IT IS RIGHT TO HUNT BIG GAMETHE MAINE WOODS: Well stocked with white-tailed deer.NEW BRUNSWICK: Well stocked with moose; a few caribou, deer and blackbear.WHITE MOUNTAINS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND VERMONT: For deer.THE ADIRONDACKS, NEW YORK: Well stocked with white-tailed deer, only.PENNSYLVANIA MOUNTAINS: Contain many deer and black bears, and soon willcontain more.NORTHERN MINNESOTA: Deer and moose.NORTHERN MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN: White-tailed deer.NORTHWESTERN WYOMING: Thousands of elk in fall and winter; a few deer,grizzly and black bears, but no sheep that it would be right to kill.WESTERN AND SOUTHWESTERN MONTANA: Elk in season, mule and white-taildeer; no sheep that it would be right to kill.NORTHWESTERN MONTANA: Mule and white-tailed deer, only. No sheep, bear,moose, elk or antelope _to kill_!WYOMING, EAST OF YELLOWSTONE PARK: A few elk, by migration from thePark; a few deer, and bear of two species.NORTHERN WOODS OF ONTARIO AND QUEBEC: Moose; deer.SOUTHERN BRITISH COLUMBIA: Goat, a few sheep and deer; grizzly bear.Moose, caribou and elk should not be killed.NORTHERN BRITISH COLUMBIA: Six fine species of big game.NORTHWESTERN ALBERTA: Grizzly bear, big-horn and mountain goat.Under existing conditions I regard the above-named hunting grounds as_nearly all_ in which it is right or fair for big-game hunting now to bepermitted, even on a strict basis. Nearly all others should immediatelybe closed, for large game, for ten years.Of course such a proceeding, if carried into effect, would provoke loudprotests from sportsmen, gunners, game-hogs, pot-hunters and others; butI only wish to high heaven that we had the power to carry such a programas that into effect! _Then we would see some game in ten years_; and ourgrand-children would thank us for some real big-game protection at acritical period.Except in the few localities above-mentioned, I regard the big-gamesituation in the United States and southern Canada as particularlydesperate. Unless there is an immediate and complete revolution in thiscountry from an era of slaughter to an era of preservation, as sure asthe sun rises on the morrow, outside of the hard and fast gamepreserves, and places like Maine and the Adirondacks, this generation ofAmericans and near-Americans will live to see our country _swept cleanof big game_!Two years ago, I did not believe this; but I do now. It is impossible toexaggerate the wide extent or the seriousness of this situation. In acountry where any and every individual can rise and bluster,"I'm-just-as-good-as-_you_-are," and bellow for his "rights" as a"tax-payer," there is no stopping the millions who kill whenever thereis an open season. And to many Americans, no right is dearer than theright to kill the game which by even the commonest law of equitybelongs, not to the shooter exclusively, but partly to two thousandother persons who don't shoot at all!Unless we come to an "About, face!" in quick time, all our big gameoutside the preserves is doomed to sure and quick extermination. This isnot an individual opinion, merely: it is a _fact_; and a hundredthousand men know it to be such.Last winter (1911-12), because the deer of Montana were driven by coldand hunger out of the mountains and far down into the ranchmen'svalleys, eleven thousand of them were ruthlessly slaughtered. StateGame Warden Avare says that often heads of families took out as manylicenses as there were persons in the family, and the whole quota waskilled. Such people deserve to go deerless into the future; but we cannot allow them to rob innocent people.       *        *        *        *        *OUR SPECIES OF BIG GAMETHE PRONG-HORNED ANTELOPE, unique and wonderful, will be one of _thefirst species of North American big game to become totally extinct_. Wemay see this come to pass within twenty years. They can not be bred inprotection, _save in very large fenced ranges_. They are delicate,capricious, and easily upset. They die literally "at the drop of a hat."They are quite subject to actinomycosis (lumpy-jaw), which in wildanimals is incurable.Already all the states that possess wild antelope, except Nevada, havepassed laws giving that species long close seasons; which is highlycreditable to the states that have done their duty. Nevada must get inline at the next session of her legislature!In 1908, Dr. T.S. Palmer published in his annual report of "Progress inGame Protection" the following in regard to the prong-horned antelope:"Antelope are still found in diminished numbers in fourteen westernstates. A considerable number were killed during the year in Montana,where the species seems to have suffered more than elsewhere since theseason was opened in 1907."A striking illustration of the decrease of the antelope is afforded byColorado. In 1898 the State Warden estimated that there were 25,000 inthe state, whereas in 1908 the Game Commissioner places the number atonly 2,000. The total number of antelope now in the United Statesprobably does not exceed 17,000, distributed approximately as follows:Colorado    2,000         Yellowstone Park    2,000Idaho         200         Other States        2,000Montana     4,000                             -----New Mexico  1,300         Saskatchewan        2,000Oregon      1,500                             -----Wyoming     4,000                            19,000To-day (1912), Dr. Palmer says the total number of antelope is less thanit was in 1908, and in spite of protection the number is steadilydiminishing. This is indeed serious news. The existing bands, alreadysmall, are steadily growing smaller. The antelope are killed lawlessly,and the crimes of such slaughter are, in nearly every instance,successfully concealed.Previously, we have based strong hopes for the preservation of theantelope species on the herd in the Yellowstone Park, but those animalsare vanishing fearfully fast. In 1906, Dr. Palmer reported that "Aboutfifteen hundred antelope came down to the feeding grounds near thehaystacks in the vicinity of Gardiner." In 1908 the Yellowstone Parkwas credited with two thousand head. _To-day, the number alive, byactual count, is only five hundred head_; and this after twenty-fiveyears of protection! Where have the others gone? This shows, alas! thatperpetual close seasons can not _always_ bring back the vanishedthousands of game![Illustration: PRONG-HORNED ANTELOPE]Here is a reliable report (June 29, 1912) regarding the prong-hornedantelope in Lower California, from E.W. Nelson: "Antelope formerlyranged over nearly the entire length of Lower California, but are nowgone from a large part of their ancient range, and their steadilydecreasing numbers indicate their early extinction throughout thepeninsula."In captivity the antelope is exasperatingly delicate and short-lived. Ithas about as much stamina as a pet monkey. As an exhibition animal inzoological gardens and parks it is a failure; for it always looks faded,spiritless and dead, like a stuffed animal ready to be thrown into thediscard. Zoologists can not save the prong-horn species save at longrange, in preserves so huge that the sensitive little beast will noteven suspect that it is confined.Two serious attempts have been made to transplant and acclimatize theantelope--in the Wichita National Bison Range, in Oklahoma, and in theMontana Bison Range, at Ravalli. In 1911 the Boone and Crockett Clubprovided a fund which defrayed the expenses of shipping from theYellowstone Park a small nucleus herd to each of those ranges. Eightwere sent to the Wichita Range, of which five arrived alive. Of theseven sent to the Montana Range, four arrived alive and were duly setfree. While it seems a pity to take specimens from the Yellowstone Parkherd, the disagreeable fact is that there is no other source on which todraw for breeding stock.The Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, in Canada, still permit thehunting and killing of antelope; which is wholly and entirely wrong.THE BIG-HORN SHEEP.--Of North American big game, the big-horn of theRockies will be, after the antelope, the next species to become extinctoutside of protected areas. In the United States that event is fastapproaching. It is far nearer than even the big-game sportsmen realize.There are to-day only two localities in the four states that still_think_ they have killable sheep, in which it is worth while to gosheep-hunting. One is in Montana, and the other is in Wyoming. In theUnited States a really big, creditable ram may now be regarded as animpossibility. There are now perhaps half a dozen guides who can findkillable sheep in our country, but the game is nearly always young rams,under five years of age.That Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and Washington still continue to permitsheep slaughter is outrageous. Their answer is that "The sportsmen won'tstand for stopping it altogether." I will add:--and the great mass ofpeople are too criminally indifferent to take a hand in the matter, and_do their duty_ regardless of the men of blood.The seed stock of big-horn sheep now alive in the United Statesaggregates a pitifully small number. After twenty-five years of unbrokenprotection in Colorado, Dillon Wallace estimates, after an investigationon the ground, that the state possesses perhaps thirty-five hundredhead. He credits Montana and Wyoming with five hundred each--which Ithink is far too liberal a number. I do not believe that either of thosestates contains more than one hundred unprotected sheep, at the veryutmost limit. If there are more, where are they?In the Yellowstone Park there are 210 head, safe and sound, and slowlyincreasing. I can not understand why they have not increased morerapidly than they have. In Glacier Park, now under permanent protection,three guides on Lake McDonald, in 1910, estimated the number of sheep atseven hundred. Idaho has in her rugged Bitter Root and ClearwaterMountains and elsewhere, a remnant of possibly two hundred sheep, andWashington has only what chemists call "a trace." It has recently beendiscovered that California still contains a few sheep, and insouthwestern Nevada there are a few more.In Utah, the big-horn species is probably quite extinct. In Arizona,there are a few very small bands, very widely scattered. They are in theSanta Catalina Mountains, the Grand Canyon country, the Gila Range, andthe Quitovaquita Mountains, near Sonoyta. But who can protect fromslaughter those Arizona sheep? Absolutely no one! They are too few andtoo widely scattered for the game wardens to keep in touch with them.The "prospectors" have them entirely at their mercy, and the world wellknows what prospectors' "mercy" to edible big game looks like on theground. It leads straight to the frying-pan, the coyotes and thevultures.The Lower California peninsula contains about five hundred mountainsheep, without the slightest protection save low, desert mountains, heatand thirst. But that is no real protection whatever. Those sheep are toofine to be butchered the way they have been, and now are beingbutchered. In 1908 I strongly called the attention of the MexicanGovernment to the situation; and the Departmento de Fomento secured theissue of an executive order forbidding the hunting of any big game inLower California without the written authority of the government. I amsure, however, that owing to the political and military upheaval itnever stopped the slaughter of sheep. In such easy mountains as those ofLower California, it is a simple matter to exterminate quickly all themountain sheep that they possess. The time for President Madero and hiscabinet to inaugurate serious protective measures has fully arrived.Both British Columbia and Alberta have even yet fine herds of big-horn,and we can count three large game preserves in which they are protected.They are Goat Mountain Park (East Kootenay district, between the Elk andBull Rivers); the Rocky Mountains Park, near Banff, and Waterton LakesPark, in the southwestern corner of Alberta.In view of the number of men who desire to hunt them, the bag limit onbig-horn rams in British Columbia and Alberta still is too liberal, byhalf. One ram per year for one man is _quite enough_; quite as much soas one moose is the limit everywhere. To-day "a big, old ram" isregarded by sportsmen as a much more desirable and creditable trophythan a moose; because moose-killing is easy, and the bagging of an oldmountain ram in real mountains requires five times as much effort andskill.The splendid high and rugged mountains of British Columbia and Albertaform an ideal home for the big-horn (and mountain goat), and it would bean international calamity for that region to be denuded of its splendidbig game. With resolute intent and judicial treatment that region canremain a rich and valuable hunting ground for five hundred years tocome. Under falsely "liberal" laws, it can be shot into a state ofcomplete desolation within ten years, or even less.OTHER MOUNTAIN SHEEP.--In northern British Columbia, north of IskootLake, there lies a tremendous region, extending to the Arctic Ocean, andcomprehending the whole area between the Rocky Mountain continentaldivide and the waters of the Pacific. Over the southern end of thisgreat wilderness ranges the black mountain sheep, and throughout theremainder, with many sheepless intervals, is scattered the whitemountain sheep.Owing to the immensity of this wilderness, the well-nigh total lack ofrailroads and also of navigable waters, excepting the Yukon, it will notbe thoroughly "opened up" for a quarter of a century. The few resoluteand pneumonia-proof sportsmen who can wade into the country, pullingboats through icy-cold mountain streams, are not going to devastatethose millions of mountains of their big game. The few head of gamewhich sportsmen can and will take out of the great northwesternwilderness during the next twenty-five years will hardly be missed fromthe grand total, even though a few easily-accessible localities are shotout. It is the deadly resident trappers, hunters and prospectors whomust be feared! And again,--_who_ can control them? Can any wildernessgovernment on earth make it possible? Therefore, _in time, even thegreat wilderness will be denuded of big game_. This is absolutely fixedand certain; for within much less than another century, every square rodof it will have been gone over by prospectors, lumbermen, trappers andskin-hunters, and raked again and again with fine-toothed combs. Arailway line to Dawson, the Copper River and Cook Inlet is to-day merelythe next thing to expect, after Canada's present railway program hasbeen wrought out.Yes, indeed! In time the wilderness will be opened up, and the big gamewill _all_ be shot out, save from the protected areas.THE MOUNTAIN GOAT.--Even yet, this species is not wholly extinct in theUnited States. It survives in Glacier Park, Montana, and the numberestimated in that region by three guide friends is too astoundinglylarge to mention.This animal is much more easily killed than the big-horn. Its white coatrenders it fatally conspicuous at long range during the best huntingseason; it is almost devoid of fear, and it takes altogether too manychances on man. Thanks to the rage for sheep horns, the averagesportsman's view-point regarding wild life ranks a goat head about sixcontours below "old ram" heads, in desirability. Furthermore, mostguides regard the flesh of the goat as almost unfit for use as food, andfar inferior to that of the big-horn. These reasons, taken together,render the goats much less persecuted by the sportsmen, ranchmen andprospectors who enter the home of the two species. It was because ofthis indifference toward goats that in 1905 Mr. John M. Phillips and hisparty saw 243 goats in thirty days in Goat Mountain Park, and onlyfourteen sheep.Unless the preferences of western sportsmen and gunners change veryconsiderably, the coast mountains of the great northwestern wildernesswill remain stocked with wild mountain goats until long after the lastbig-horn has been shot to death. Fortunately, the skin of the mountaingoat has no commercial value. I think it was in 1887 that I purchased,in Denver, 150 nicely tanned skins of our wild white goat _at fiftycents each_! They were wanted for the first exhibit ever made toillustrate the extermination of American large mammals, and they wereshown at the Louisville Exposition. It must have cost the price of thoseskins to tan them; and I was pleased to know that some one lost money onthe venture.[Illustration MAP OF THE FORMER AND EXISTING RANGES OF THE AMERICAN ELKFrom "Life History of Northern Animals," Copyright 1909 by E.T. Seton]At present the mountain goat extends from north-western Montana to thehead of Cook Inlet, but it is not found in the interior or in the Yukonvalley. Whenever man decides that the species has lived long enough, hecan quickly and easily exterminate it. It is one of the most picturesqueand interesting wild animals on this continent, and there is not theslightest excuse for shooting it, save as a specimen of natural history.Like the antelope, it is so unique as a natural curiosity that itdeserves to be taken out of the ranks of animals that are regularlypursued as game.THE ELK.--The story of the progressive extermination of the Americanelk, or wapiti, covers practically the same territory as the tragedy ofthe American bison--one-third of the mainland of North America. Theformer range of the elk covered absolutely the garden ground of ourcontinent, omitting the arid region. Its boundary extended from centralMassachusetts to northern Georgia, southern Illinois, northern Texas andcentral New Mexico, central Arizona, the whole Rocky Mountain region upto the Peace River, and Manitoba. It skipped the arid country west ofthe Rockies, but it embraced practically the whole Pacific slope fromcentral California to the north end of Vancouver Island. Mr. Setonroughly calculated the former range of _canadensis_ at two and a halfmillion square miles, and adds: "We are safe, therefore, in believingthat in those days there may have been ten million head."The range of the elk covered a magnificent domain. The map prepared byMr. Ernest T. Seton, after twenty years of research, is the last word onthe subject. It appears on page 43, Vol. I, of his great work, "LifeHistories of Northern Animals," and I have the permission of author andpublisher to reproduce it here, as an object lesson in wild-animalextermination. Mr. Seton recognizes (for convenience, only?) four formsof American elk, two of which, _C. nannodes_ and _occidentalis_, stillexist on the Pacific Coast. The fourth, _Cervus merriami_, wasundoubtedly a valid species. It lived in Arizona and New Mexico, butbecame totally extinct near the beginning of the present century.In 1909 Mr. Seton published in the work referred to above a remarkablyclose estimate of the number of elk then alive in North America.Recently, a rough count--the first ever made--of the elk in and aroundthe Yellowstone Park, revealed the real number of that largestcontingent. By taking those results, and Mr. Seton's figures for elkoutside the United States, we obtain the following very closeapproximation of the wild elk alive in North America in 1912:LOCALITY                         NUMBER             AUTHORITYYellowstone Park and vicinity    47,000     U.S. Biological Survey.Idaho (permanently),                600Washington                        1,200 Game Warden Chris.

Seton.                                 ------Total, for all America.          54,850In 1905, a herd of twenty of the so-called dwarf elk of the San JoaquinValley, California, were taken to the Sequoia National Park, and placedin a fenced range that had been established for it on the Kaweah River.The extermination of the wapiti began with the settlement of theAmerican colonies. Naturally, the largest animals were the ones mosteagerly sought by the meat-hungry pioneers, and the elk and bison werethe first game species to disappear. The colonists believed in thesurvival of the fittest, and we are glad that they did. The one thingthat a hungry pioneer cannot withstand is--temptation--in a form thatembraces five hundred pounds of succulent flesh. And let it not besupposed that in the eastern states there were only a few elk. ThePennsylvania salt licks were crowded with them, and the early writersdescribe them as existing in "immense bands" and "great numbers."Of course it is impossible for wild animals of great size to exist incountries that are covered with farms, villages and people. Under suchconditions the wild and the tame cannot harmonize. It is a fact,however, that elk could exist and thrive in every national forest andnational park in our country, and also on uncountable hundreds ofthousands of rough, wild, timbered hills and mountains such as exist inprobably twenty-five different states. There is no reason, except man'sshort-sighted greed and foolishness, why there are not to-day onehundred thousand elk living in the Allegheny Mountains, furnishing eachyear fifty thousand three-year-old males as free food for the people.The trouble is,--the greedy habitants _could not_ be induced to killonly the three-year-old-males, in the fall, and let the cows, calves andbreeding bulls alone! By sensible management the Rocky Mountains, theSierra Nevadas and the Coast Range would support enough wild elk to feeda million people. But we Americans seem utterly incapable of maintaininganywhere from decade to decade a large and really valuable supply ofwild game. Outside the Yellowstone Park and northwestern Wyoming, theAmerican elk exists only in small bands--mere remnants and samples ofthe millions we could and should have._If_ they could be protected, and the surplus presently killed accordingto some rational, working system, then _every national forest in theUnited States should be stocked with elk_! In view of the awful cost ofbeef (to-day 10-1/2 cents per pound in Chicago _on the hoof_!), it ishigh time that we should consider the raising of game on the publicdomain on such lines that it would form a valuable food supply withoutdiminishing the value of the forests.Just now (1912) the American people are sorely puzzled by a remarkableelk problem that each winter is presented for solution in the JacksonHole country, Wyoming. Driven southward by the deep snows of winter, theelk thousands that in summer graze and grow fat in the Yellowstone Parkmarch down into Jackson Hole, to find in those valleys less snow andmore food. Now, it happens that the best and most of the former wintergrazing grounds of the elk are covered by fenced ranches! As a result,the elk that strive to winter there, about fifteen thousand head, areeach winter threatened with starvation; and during three or four wintersof recent date, an aggregate of several thousand calves, weak yearlingsand weakened cows perished of hunger. The winters of 1908, 1909 and 1910were progressively more and more severe; and 1911 saw about 2500 deaths,(S.N. Leek).In 1909-10, the State of Wyoming spent 7,000 for hay, and fed it to thestarving elk. In 1911, Wyoming spent 5,000 more, and appealed toCongress for help. Thanks to the efforts of Senator Lodge and others,Congress instantly responded with a splendid emergency appropriation of20,000, partly for the purpose of feeding the elk, and also to meet thecost of transporting elsewhere as many of the elk as it might seem bestto move. The starving of the elk ceased with 1911._Outdoor Life_ magazine (Denver, Colo.) for August, 1912, contains anexcellent article by Dr. W.B. Shore, entitled, "Trapping and ShippingElk." I wish I could reprint it entire, for the solid information thatit contains. It gives a clear and comprehensive account of last spring'soperations by the Government and by the state of Montana in capturingand shipping elk from the Yellowstone Park herd, for the double purposeof diminishing the elk surplus in the Park and stocking vacant rangeselsewhere.The operations were conducted on the same basis as the shipping ofcattle--the corral, the chute, the open car, and the car-load in bulk.Dr. Shore states that the undertaking was really no more difficult thanthe shipping of range cattle; but the presence of a considerableproportion of young and tender calves, such as are never handled withbeef cattle, led to 8.8 per cent of deaths in transit. The deaths andthe percentage are nothing at which to be surprised, when it isremembered, that the animals had just come through a hard winter, andtheir natural vitality was at the lowest point of the year.The following is a condensed summary of the results of the work:                            Number of   Hours on   Killed or    Died After         Destination           Elk       Road      Died in Car  Unloading1 Car.

Leek, of Jackson Hole, clearly reveal the fact that the herdsnow consist chiefly of cows, calves, yearlings and young bulls withsmall antlers. In one photograph showing about twenty-five hundred elk,there are not visible even half a dozen pairs of antlers that belong toadult bulls. There should be a hundred! This condition means that thebest bulls, with the finest heads, are constantly being selected andkilled by sportsmen and others who want their heads; and the young,immature bulls are left to do the breeding that alone will sustain thespecies.[Illustration: HUNGRY ELK IN JACKSON HOLE, WYOMINGPart of a Herd of About 2,500 Head, being fed on hay, in the Winter of1910-11 Note the Absence of Adult Bulls. Copyright, 1911, by S.N.Leek]It is a well-known principle in stock-breeding that sires should befully adult, of maximum strength, and in the prime of life. Nostockbreeder in his senses ever thinks of breeding from a youthful,immature sire. The result would be weak offspring not up to thestandard.This inexorable law of inheritance and transmission is just as much alaw for the elk, moose and deer of North America as it is for domesticcattle and horses. If the present conditions in the Wyoming elk herdscontinue to prevail for several generations, as sure as time goes on weshall see a marked deterioration in the size and antlers of the elk.If the foundation principles of stock-breeding are correct, then it isimpossible to maintain any large-mammal species at its zenith of size,strength and virility by continuous breeding of the young and immaturemales. By some sportsmen it is believed that through long-continuedkilling of the finest and largest males, the red deer of Europe havebeen growing smaller; but on that point I am not prepared to offerevidence.In regard to the in-breeding of the elk herds in large open parks andpreserves throughout North America, there are positively _no ill effectsto fear_. Wild animals that are _closely_ confined generation aftergeneration are bound to deteriorate physically; but with healthy wildanimals living in large open ranges, feeding and breeding naturally, thein-breeding that occurs produces no deterioration.In the twin certainties of over-population, and deterioration fromexcessive killing of the good sires, we have to face two new problems ofvery decided importance. Nothing short of very radical measures willprovide a remedy. For the immediate future, I can offer a solution.While it seems almost impossible deliberately to kill females, I thinkthat the present is a very exceptional case, and one that compels us toapply the painful remedy that I now propose._Premises_:1.--There are at present _too many_ breeding cows in the Yellowstoneherds.2.--There are far too few good breeding bulls._Conclusion_:--For five years, entirely prohibit the killing of adultmale elk, and kill only females, and young males. This would graduallydiminish the number of calves born each year, by about 2,500, and by theend of five years it would reduce the number, _and the annual birth_, offemales to a figure sufficiently limited that the herds could bemaintained on existing ranges._Corollary_.--At the end of five years, stop killing females, and killonly _young_ males. This plan would permit a large number of bull elk tomature; and then the largest and strongest animals would do thebreeding,--just as Nature always intends shall be done.       *        *        *        *        *SOUTH AMERICAOf all the big-game regions of the earth, South America is the poorest.Of hoofed game she possesses only a dozen species that are worth theattention of sportsmen; and like all other animal life in that land oflittle game, they are desperately hard to find. In South America youmust work your heart out in order to get either game or specimens thatwill be worth showing.At present, we need not worry about the marsh deer, the pampas deer, theguemal, or the venado, nor the tapir, jaguar, ocelot and bears. Allthese species are abundantly able to take care of themselves; and tofind and kill any one of them is a man's task. In Patagonia the nativesdo wastefully slaughter the guanacos; and there are times also whengreat numbers of guanacos come down in winter to certain mountain lakes,presumably in search of food, and perish by hundreds through starvation.(H. Hesketh Prichard.)       *        *        *        *        *MEXICOAbout ten years more will see the extinction of the mountain sheep ofLower California,--in the wake of the recently exterminated Mexicansheep of the Santa Maria Lakes region. In 1908, I solemnly warned thegovernment of President Diaz, and at that time the Mexican governmentexpressed much concern.It is a great pity that just now political conditions are completelyestopping wild-life protection in Mexico; but it is true. If the code ofproposed laws that I drew up (by request) in 1908 and submitted toMinister Molina were adopted, it would have a good effect on the faunaof Mexico.In Mexico there is little hoofed game to kill,--deer of the white-tailgroups, seven or eight species; the desert mule deer; the brocket; theprong-horned antelope, the mountain sheep and the peccary. The deer willnot so easily be exterminated, but the antelope and sheep will beutterly destroyed. They will be the first to go; and I think they cannot by any possibility last longer than ten years. Is it not too badthat Mexico should permit her finest species of hoofed and horned gameto be obliterated before she awakens to the desirability ofconservation! The Mexicans could protect their small stock of big gameif they would; but in Lower California they are leasing huge tracts ofland to cattle companies, and they permit the lessees to kill all thewild game they please on their leased lands, even with the aid of dogs.This is a vicious and fatal system, and contrary to all the laws ofnations.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XVIIPRESENT AND FUTURE OF NORTH AMERICAN BIG GAME(Concluded)THE WHITE-TAILED DEER.--Five hundred years hence, when the greed andrapacity of "civilized" man has completed the loot and ruin of thecontinent of North America, the white-tailed deer will be the lastspecies of our big game to be exterminated. Its mental traits, its size,its color and its habits all combine to render it the most persistent ofour large animals, and the best fitted to survive. It neither bawls norbugles to attract its enemies, it can not be called to a sportsman, likethe moose, and it sticks to its timber with rare and commendablecloseness. When it sees a strange living thing walking erect, it doesnot stop to stare and catch soft-nosed bullets, but dashes away in questof solitude.The worst shooting that I ever did or saw done at game was at runningwhite-tailed deer, in the Montana river bottoms.For the reasons given, the white-tail exists and persists in a hundredUnited States localities from which all other big game save the blackbear have been exterminated. For example, in our Adirondacks the moosewere exterminated years and years ago, but the beloved wilderness calledthe "North Woods" still is populated by about 20,000 deer, and about8,000 are killed annually. The deer of Maine are sufficiently numerousthat in 1909 a total of 15,879 were killed. With some assistance fromthe thin sprinkling of moose and caribou, the deer of Maine annuallydraw into that state, for permanent dedication, a huge sum of money,variously estimated at from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000. In spite of heavyslaughter, and vigorous attempts at extermination by over-shooting, thedeer of northern Michigan obstinately refuse to be wiped out.There is, however, a large group of states in which this species hasbeen exterminated. The states comprising it are Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,Iowa, and adjacent portions of seven other states.As if to shame the people of Iowa, a curious deer episode is recorded.In 1885, W.B. Cuppy, of Avoca, Iowa, purchased five deer, and placedthem in a paddock on his 600-acre farm. By 1900 they had increased to 32head; and then one night some one kindly opened the gate of theirenclosure, and gave them the freedom of the city. Mr. Cuppy made noeffort to capture them, possibly because they decided to annex his farmas their habitat. When a neighbor led them with a bait of corn to theirowner's door, he declined to impound them, on the ground that it wasunnecessary.By 1912, those deer had increased to 400, and the portion of this storythat no one will believe is this: they spread all through the suburbsand hinterland farms of Avoca, and _the people not only failed toassassinate all of them and eat them, but they actually killed only afew, protected the rest, and made pets of many!_ Queer people, those menand boys of Avoca. Nearly everywhere else in the world that I know, thathistory would have been ended differently. Here in the East, 90 per centof our people are like the Avocans, but the other 10 per cent think onlyof slaying and eating, sans mercy, sans decency, sans law. Now the Stateof Iowa has taken hold, to capture some of those deer, and set them freein other portions of the state.Elsewhere I shall note the quick and thorough success with which thewhite-tailed deer has been brought back in Vermont, Massachusetts,Connecticut, and southern New York.No state having waste lands covered with brush or timber need be withoutthe ubiquitous white-tailed deer. Give them a semblance of a fair show,and they will live and breed with surprising fecundity and persistence.If you start a park herd with ten does, soon you will have more deerthan you will know how to dispose of, unless you market them under aBayne law, duly tagged by the state. In close confinement this speciesfares rather poorly. In large preserves it does well, but during therutting season the bucks are to be dreaded; and those that developaggressive traits should be shot and marketed. This is the only way inwhich the deer parks of England are kept safe for unarmed people.Dr. T.S. Palmer has taken much pains to ascertain the number of deerkilled in the eastern United States. His records, as published in May,1910, are as follows:STATE              1908       1909        1910Maine            15,000     15,879      15,000New Hampshire       (a)         (a)        (a)Vermont           2,700       4,736      3,649New York          6,000       9,000      9,000New Jersey                      (a)        120Pennsylvania        500         500        800Michigan          9,076       6,641     13,347Wisconsin        11,000       6,000      6,000Minnesota         6,000       6,000      3,147West Virginia       107          51         49Maryland             16          13          6Virginia            207         210        224North Carolina      (a)         (a)         (a)South Carolina    1,000         (a)         (a)Georgia             (a)         367        369Florida           2,209       2,021      1,526Alabama             152         148        132Mississippi         411         458        500Louisiana         5,500       5,470      5,000Massachusetts                            1,281                 ------      ------     ------ Total           59,878      57,494     60,150(a) No statistics available.At this date deer hunting is not permitted at any time in Indiana,Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas,--where there are no wild deer; norin Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Tennessee or Kentucky. The longclose seasons in Massachusetts, Connecticut and southern New York havecaused a great migration of deer into those once-depopulatedregions,--in fact, right down to tide-water.THE MULE DEER.--This will be the first member of the Deer Family tobecome extinct in North America outside of the protected portions of itshaunts. Its fatal preference for open ground and its habit of pausing tostare at the hunter have been, and to the end will be, its undoing.Possibly there are now two of these deer in the United States andBritish Columbia for every 98 that existed forty years ago, but no more.It is a deer of the bad lands and foothills, and its curiosity is fatal.The number of sportsmen who have hunted and killed this fine animal inits own wild and picturesque bad-lands is indeed quite small. It hasbeen four-fifths exterminated by the resident hunter and ranchman, andto-day is found in the Rocky Mountain region most sparingly. Ten yearsago it seemed right to hunt the so-called Rocky Mountain "black-tail" innorthwestern Montana, because so many deer were there it did not seem tospell extermination. Now, conditions have changed. Since last winter'sgreat slaughter in northwestern Montana, of 11,000 hungry deer, thespecies has been so reduced that it is no longer right to kill mule deeranywhere in our country, and a universal close season for five years isthe duty of every state which contains that species.THE REAL BLACK-TAILED DEER, of the Pacific coast, (_Odocoileuscolumbianus_) is, to most sportsmen of the Rocky Mountains and the Eastactually less known than the okapi! Not one out of every hundred of themcan recognize a mounted head of it at sight. It is a small,delicately-formed, delicately-antlered understudy of the big mule deer,and now painfully limited in its distribution. It is _the_ deer ofCalifornia and western Oregon, and it has been so ruthlessly slaughteredthat today it is going fast. As conditions stand to-day, and without aradical change on the part of the people of the Pacific coast, this veryinteresting species is bound to disappear. It will not be persistent,like the white-tailed deer, but in the heavy forests, it will last muchlonger than the mule deer.My information regarding this deer is like the stock of specimens of itin museum collections,--meager and unsatisfactory. We need to know indetail how that species is faring to-day, and what its prospects are forthe immediate future. In 1900, I saw great piles of skins from it in thefur houses of Seattle, and the sight gave me much concern.THE CARIBOU, GENERALLY.--I think it is not very difficult to forecastthe future of the Genus _Rangifer_ in North America, from the logic ofthe conditions of to-day. Thanks to the splendid mass of informationthat has been accumulated regarding this group, we are able to drawcertain conclusions. I think that the caribou of the Canadian BarrenGrounds and northeastern Alaska will survive in great numbers for atleast another century; that the caribou herds of Newfoundland will lastnearly as long, and that in fifty years or less all the caribou of thegreat northwestern wilderness will be swept away.The reasons for these conclusions are by no means obscure, orfarfetched.In the first place, the barren-ground caribou are to-day enormouslynumerous,--undoubtedly running up into millions. It can not be possiblethat they are being killed faster than they are breeding; and so theymust be increasing. Their food supply is unlimited. They are protectedby two redoubtable champions,--Jack Frost and the Mosquito. Theircountry never will contain a great human population. The natives are sofew in number, and so lazy, that even though they should become suppliedwith modern firearms, it is unlikely that they ever will make a seriousimpression on the caribou millions. The only thing to fear for thebarren-ground caribou throngs is disease,--a factor that is beyond humanprediction.It is reasonably certain that the Barren Grounds never will be netted byrailways,--unless gold is discovered over a wide area. The fierce coldand hunger, and the billions of mosquitoes of the Barren Grounds willprotect the caribou from the wholesale slaughter that "civilized" manjoyously would inflict--if he had the chance.The caribou thousands of Newfoundland are fairly accessible to sportsmenand pot-hunters, but at the same time the colonial government canprotect them from extermination if it will. Already much has been doneto check the reckless and wicked slaughter that once prevailed. A baglimit of three bull caribou per annum has been fixed, which is enforcedas to non-residents and sportsmen, but in a way that is much too"American" it is often ignored by residents in touch with the game. Forinstance, the guide of a New York gentleman whom I know admitted to myfriend that each year he killed "about 25" caribou for himself and hisfamily of four other persons. He explained thus: "When the inspectorcomes around, I show him two caribou hanging in my woodshed, but back inthe woods I have a little shack where I keep the others until I wantthem."The real sportsmen of the world never will make the slightestperceptible impression on the caribou of Newfoundland. For one thing,the hunting is much too tame to be interesting. If the caribou of thatIsland ever are exterminated, it will be strictly by the people ofNewfoundland, themselves. If the government will tighten its grip on theherds, they need never be exterminated.The caribou of New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario are few and widelyscattered. Unless carefully conserved, they are not likely to last long;for their country is annually penetrated in every direction by armedmen, white and red. There is no means by which it can be proven, butfrom the number of armed men in those regions I feel sure that thetypical woodland caribou species is being shot faster than it isbreeding. The sportsmen and naturalists of Canada and New Brunswickwould render good service by making a close and careful investigation ofthat question.The caribou of the northwestern wilderness are in a situation peculiarlytheir own. They inhabit a region of naked mountains and _thin_ forests,wherein they are conspicuous, easily stalked and easily killed. Nowheredo they exist in large herds of thousands, or even of many hundreds.They live in small bands of from ten to twenty head, and even those arefar apart. The region in which they live is certain to be thoroughlyopened up by railways, and exploited. Fifty years from now we will findevery portion of the now-wild Northwest fairly accessible by rail. Thebuilding of the railways will be to the caribou--and to other biggame--the day of doom. In that wild, rough region, no power onearth,--save that which might be able to deprive _all_ the inhabitantsand all visitors of firearms,--can possibly save the game outside of afew preserves that are diligently patroled.The big game of the northwest region, in which I include the interior ofAlaska, _will go_! It is only a question of time. Already the buildingof the city of Fairbanks, and the exploitation of the mining districtssurrounding it, have led to such harassment and slaughter of themigrating caribou that the great herd which formerly traversed theTanana country once a year has completely changed its migration route,and now keeps much farther north. The "crossing" of the Yukon near EagleCity has been abandoned. A hundred years hence, the northwesternwilderness will be dotted with towns and criss-crossed with railways;but the big game of it will be gone, except in the preserves that areyet to be made. This will particularly involve the caribou, moose, andmountain sheep of all species, which will be the first to go. Themountain goat and the forest bears will hold out longer than their moreexposed neighbors of the treeless mountains.THE MOOSE.--In the United States the moose is found in fivestates,--Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. There are 550 inthe Yellowstone Park. In Maine and Minnesota only may moose be huntedand killed. In the season of 1909, 184 moose were killed in Maine,--alarge number, considering the small moose population of that state. Innorthern Minnesota, we now possess a great national moose preserve of909,743 acres; and in 1908 Mr. Fullerton, after a personal inspection inwhich he saw 189 moose in nine days, estimated the total moosepopulation of the present day at 10,000 head. This is a moose preserveworth while.Outside of protected areas, the moose is the animal that is most easilyexterminated. Its trail is easily followed, and its habits arethoroughly known, down to three decimal places. As a hunter's reward itis Great. Strange to say, New Brunswick has found that the moose is ananimal that it is possible, and even easy, to protect. The death of amoose is an event that is not easily concealed! Wherever it isthoroughly understood that the moose law will be enforced, the would-bepoacher pauses to consider the net results to him of a jail sentence.In New Brunswick we have seen two strange things happen, during our owntimes. We have seen the moose migrate into, and permanently occupy, anextensive area that previously was destitute of that species. At thesame time, we have seen a reasonable number of bull moose killed bysportsmen without disturbing in the least the general equanimity of thegeneral moose population! And at this moment, the moose population ofNew Brunswick is almost incredible. Every moose hunter who goes theresees from 20 to 40 moose, and two of my friends last year saw, "in roundnumbers, about 100!" Up to date the size of adult antlers seem to bemaintaining a high standard.In summer, the photographing of moose in the rivers, lakes and ponds ofMaine and New Brunswick amounts to an industry. I am uneasy about theconstant picking off of the largest and best breeding bulls of theMirimachi country, lest it finally reduce the size and antlers of themoose of that region; but only the future can tell us just how thatprospect stands to-day.In Alaska, our ever thoughtful and forehanded Biological Survey of theDepartment of Agriculture has by legal proclamation at one strokeconverted the whole of the Kenai Peninsula into a magnificent moosepreserve. This will save _Alces gigas_, the giant moose of Alaska, fromextermination; and New Brunswick and the Minnesota preserve will save_Alces americanus_. But in the northwest, we can positively depend uponit that eventually, wherever the moose may legally be hunted and killedby any Tom, Dick or Harry who can afford a twenty-dollar rifle and alicense, the moose surely will disappear.The moose laws of Alaska are strict--toward sportsmen, only! The miners,"prospectors" and Indians may kill as many as they please, "for foodpurposes." This opens the door to a great amount of unfair slaughter.Any coffee-cooler can put a pan and pick into his hunting outfit, go outafter moose, and call himself a "prospector."I grant that the _real_ prospector, who is looking for ores and mineralswith an intelligent eye, and knows what he is doing, should have specialprivileges on game, to keep him from starving. The settled miner,however, is in a different class. No miner should ask the privilege ofliving on wild game, any more than should the farmer, the steamboat man,the railway laborer, or the soldier in an army post. The Indian shouldhave no game advantages whatever over a white man. He does not own thegame of a region, any more than he owns its minerals or its water-power.He should obey the general game laws, just the same as white men. InAfrica, as far as possible, the white population wisely prohibits thenatives from owning or using firearms, and a good idea it is, too. I amglad there is one continent on which the "I'm-just-as-good-as-you-are"nightmare does not curse the whole land.THE MUSK-OX.--Now that the north pole has been safely discovered, andthe south pole has become the storm-center of polar exploration, theharried musk-ox herds of the farthest north are having a rest. I thinkthat most American sportsmen have learned that as a sporting propositionthere is about as much fun and glory in harrying a musk-ox herd withdogs, and picking off the members of it at "parade rest," as there is inshooting range cattle in a round-up. The habits of the animal positivelyeliminate the real essence of sport,--difficulty and danger. When amusk-ox band is chased by dogs, or by wolves, the full-grown members ofit, bulls and cows alike, instantly form a close circle around thecalves, facing outward shoulder to shoulder, and stand at bay. Withoutthe aid of a gunner and a rifle, such a formation is invincible! Mr.Paul Rainey's moving pictures tell a wonderful story of animalintelligence, bravery and devotion to the parental instinct.For some reason, the musk-ox herds do not seem to have perceptiblyincreased since man first encountered them. The number alive to-dayappears to be no greater than it was fifty years ago; and this leads tothe conclusion that the present delicate balance could easily bedisturbed the wrong way. Fortunately, it seems reasonably certain thatthe Indians of the Canadian Barren Grounds, the Eskimo of the far north,and the stray explorers all live outside the haunts of the species, andcome in touch only with the edge of the musk-ox population as a whole.This leads us to hope and believe that, through the difficultiesinvolved in reaching them, the main bodies of musk-ox of both speciesare safe from extermination.At the same time, the time has come for Canada, the United States andDenmark to join in formulating a stiff law for the prevention ofwholesale slaughter of musk-ox for sport. It should be renderedimpossible for another sportsman to kill twenty-three head in one day,as once occurred. Give the sportsman a bag of three bulls, and no more.To this, no true sportsman will object, and the objections of game-hogsonly serve to confirm the justice of the thing they oppose.THE GRIZZLY BEAR.--To many persons it may seem strange that anyoneshould feel disposed to accord protection to such fierce predatoryanimals as grizzly bears, lions and tigers. But the spirit of fair playsprings eternal in some human breasts. The sportsmen of the world do notstick at using long-range, high-power repeating rifles on big game, butthey draw the line this side of traps, poisons and extermination. Thesportsmen of India once thought,--for about a year and a day,--that itwas permissible to kill troublesome and expensive tigers by poison. Mr.G.P. Sanderson tried it, and when his strychnine operations promptlydeveloped three bloated and disgusting tiger carcasses, even his nativefollowers revolted at the principle. That was the alpha and omega ofSanderson's poisoning activities.I am quite sure that if the extermination of the tiger from the whole ofIndia were possible, and the to-be or not-to-be were put to a vote ofthe sportsmen of India, the answer would be a thundering _"No!"_ SaysMajor J. Stevenson-Hamilton in his "Animal Life in Africa:" "It isimpossible to contemplate the use against the lion of any other weaponthan the rifle."The real sportsmen and naturalists of America are decidedly opposed tothe extermination of the grizzly bear. They feel that the wilds of NorthAmerica are wide enough for the accommodation of many grizzlies, withoutcrowding the proletariat. A Rocky Mountain without a grizzly upon it, orat least a bear of some kind, is only half a mountain,--commonplace andtame. Put one two-year-old grizzly cub upon it, and presto! every cubicyard of its local atmosphere reeks with romantic uncertainty andfearsome thrills.A few persons have done considerable talking and writing about thedamage to stock inflicted by bears, but I think there is littlejustification for such charges. Certainly, there is not one-tenth enoughreal damage done by bears to justify their extermination. At the presenttime, we hear that the farmers (!) of Kadiak Island, Alaska, are beingseriously harassed and damaged by the big Kadiak bear,--an animal sorare and shy that it is very difficult for a sportsman to kill one! Ithink the charges against the bears,--if the Kadiak Islanders everreally have made any,--need to be proven, by the production of realevidence.In the United States, outside of our game preserves, I know of not onelocality in which grizzly bears are sufficiently numerous to justify asportsman in going out to hunt them. The California grizzly, oncerepresented by "Monarch" in Golden Gate Park, is almost, if not wholly,extinct. In Montana, outside of Glacier Park it is useless to apply forwild grizzlies. In the Bitter Root Mountains and Clearwater Mountains ofIdaho, there are grizzlies, but they hide so effectually under thesnow-bent willows on the "slides" that it is almost impossible to get ashot. Northwestern Wyoming still contains a few grizzlies, but there areso many square miles of mountains around each animal it is now almostuseless to go hunting for them. British Columbia, western Alberta andthe coast mountains at least as far as Skaguay, and Yukon Territorygenerally, all contain grizzlies, and the sportsman who goes out forsheep, caribou and moose is reasonably certain to see half a dozen bearsand kill at least one or two. In those countries, the grizzly specieswill hold forth long after all killable grizzlies have vanished from theUnited States.I think that it is now time for California, Montana, Washington, Oregon,Idaho and Wyoming to give grizzly bears protection of some sort.Possibly the situation in those states calls for a five-year closeseason. Even British Columbia should now place a bag limit on thisspecies. This has seemed clear to me ever since two of my friends killed(in the spring of 1912) _six_ grizzlies in one week! But Provincial GameWarden A. Bryan Williams says that at present it would be impossible toimpose a bag limit of one per year on the grizzlies of British Columbia;and Mr. Williams is a sincere game-protector.THE BROWN BEARS OF ALASKA.--These magnificent monsters present aperplexing problem, which I am inclined to believe can be satisfactorilysolved by the Biological Survey only in short periods, say of three orfour years each. Naturally, the skin hunters of Alaska ardently desirethe skins of those bears, for the money they represent. That side of thebear problem does not in the least appeal to the ninety odd millions ofpeople who live this side of Alaska. The skins of the Alaskan brownbears have little value save as curiosities, nailed upon the wall, wherethey can not be stepped upon and injured. The _hunting_ of those bears,however, is a business for men; and it is partly for that reason theyshould be preserved. A bear-hunt on the Alaska Peninsula, Admiralty orMontagu Islands, is an event of a lifetime, and with a bag limit of_one_ brown bear, the species would be quite safe from extermination.[Illustration: THE WICHITA NATIONAL BISON HERDPresented by the New York Zoological Society]In Alaska there is some dissatisfaction over the protection accorded thebig brown bears; but those rules are right _as far as they go_! Agovernor of Alaska once said to me: "The preservation of the game ofAlaska should be left to the _people_ of Alaska. It is their game; andthey will preserve it all right!"The answer? _Not by a long shot_!Only three things were wrong with the ex-governor's view:1.--The game of Alaska does _not_ belong to the people who live inAlaska--with the intent to get out to-morrow! It belongs to the93,000,000 people of the Nation.2.--The preservation of the Alaskan fauna on the public domain shouldnot be left unreservedly to the people of Alaska, because3.--As sure as shooting, they will _not_ preserve it!Congress is right in appropriating 15,000 for game protection inAlaska. It is very necessary that the regulations for conserving thewild life should be fixed by the Secretary of Agriculture, with theadvice of the Biological Survey.THE BLACK BEAR is an interesting citizen. He harms nobody nor anything;he affords good sport; he objects to being exterminated, and wherever inNorth America he is threatened with extermination, he should at once begiven protection! A black bear _in the wilds_ is harmless. In captivity,posed as a household "pet," he is decidedly dangerous, and had best begiven the middle of the road. In big forests he is a grand stayer, andwill not be exterminated from the fauna of the United States untilWashington is wrecked by anarchists.THE AMERICAN BISON.--I regard the American bison species as nowreasonably secure against extermination. This is due to the fact that itbreeds persistently and successfully in captivity, and to the greatefforts that have been put forth by the United States Government, theCanadian Government, the American Bison Society, the New York ZoologicalSociety, and several private individuals.The species reached its lowest ebb in 1889, when there were only 256head in captivity and 835 running wild. The increase has been asfollows:1888--W.T. Hornaday's census                     1,3001902--S.P. Langley's census                      1,3941905--Frank Baker's census                       1,6971908--W.T. Hornaday's census                     2,0471910--W.P.

Twogovernments and two thousand individuals have shared this task,--solelyfor sentimental reasons. In these facts we find reason to hope andbelieve that other efforts now being made to save other species fromannihilation will be equally successful.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XVIIITHE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF AFRICAN GAMEThanks to the diligence with which sportsmen and field naturalists haverecorded their observations in the haunts of big game, it is not at alldifficult to forecast the immediate future of the big game of the world.We may safely assume that all lands well suited to agriculture, miningand grazing will become populated by rifle-bearing men, with the usualresult to the wild mammals and birds. At the same time, the game of theopen mountains everywhere is thinly distributed and easily exterminated.On the other hand, the unconquerable forest jungles of certain portionsof the tropics will hold their own, and shelter their four-footedinhabitants for centuries to come.On the open mountains of the world and on the grazing lands most biggame is now being killed much faster than it breeds. This is due to theattacks of five times too many hunters, open seasons that are too long,and bag limits that are far too liberal. As an example, consider AfricaViewed in any way it may be taken, the bag limit in British East Africais appallingly high. Notice this astounding array of wild creatures that_each hunter_ may kill under a license costing _only 250!_ 2 Buffalo 2 Rhinoceros 2 Hippopotamus 1 Eland 2 Grevy Zebra20 Common Zebra 2 Fringe-eared Oryx 4 Beisa Antelope 4 Waterbuck 1 Sable Antelope 1 Roan Antelope 1 Greater Kudu 4 Lesser Kudu10 Topi20 Coke Hartebeest 2 Neumann Hartebeest 4 Jackson Hartebeest 6 Hunter's Antelope 4 Thomas Kob 2 Bongo 4 Pallah 2 Sitatunga 3 Gnu12 Grant Gazelle 4 Waller's Gazelle10 Harvey's Duiker10 Isaac's Duiker10 Blue Duiker10 Kirk's Dik-dik10 Guenther's Dik-dik10 Hinde's Dik-dik10 Cavendish Dik-dik10 Abyssinian Oribi10 Haggard's Oribi10 Kenya Oribi10 Suni10 Klipspringer10 Ward's Reedbuck10 Chanler's Reedbuck10 Thompson Gazelle10 Peters Gazelle10 Soemmerring Gazelle10 Bushbuck10 Haywood BushbuckThe grand total is a possible 300 large hoofed and horned animalsrepresenting _44 species_! Add to this all the lions, leopards,cheetahs, cape hunting dogs and hyaenas that the hunter can kill, andit will be enough to stock a zoological garden!Quite a number of these species, like the sable antelope, kudu, Hunter'santelope, bongo and sitatunga are already rare, and therefore they areall the more eagerly sought.Into the fine grass-lands of British East Africa, suitable for crops andstock grazing, settlers are steadily going. Each one is armed, and atonce becomes a killer of big game. And all the time the visitingsportsmen are increasing in number, going farther from the UgandaRailway, and persistently seeking out the rarest and finest of the game.The buffalo has recovered from the slaughter by rinderpest only in timeto meet the onset of oversea sportsmen.Mr. Arthur Jordan has seen much of the big game of British East Africa,and its killing. Him I asked to tell me how long, in his opinion, thebig game of that territory will last outside of the game preserves, asit is now being killed. He said, "Oh, it will last a long time. I thinkit will last fifteen years!"_Fifteen years!_ And this for the richest big-game fauna of any one spotin the whole world, which Nature has been _several million years indeveloping and placing there_!At present the marvelous herds of big game of British East Africa andUganda constitute the grandest zoological spectacle that the world everhas seen in historic times. For such an area, the number of species isincredible, and until they are seen, the thronging masses of individualsare beyond conception. It is easy to say "a herd of 3,000 zebras;" butno mere words can give an adequate impression of the actual army ofstripes and bars, and hoofs thundering in review over a grassy plain.But the settlers say, "The zebras must go! They break through our bestwire fences, ruin our crops, despoil us of the fruits of long andtoilsome efforts, and much expenditure. We simply can not live in acountry inhabited by herds of wild zebras." And really, their contentionis well founded. When it is necessary to choose between wild animals andpeaceful agriculture for millions of men, the animals must give way.In those portions of the great East African plateau region that aresuited to modern agriculture, stretching from Buluwayo to northernUganda, the wild herds are doomed to be crowded out by the farmer andthe fruit-grower. This is the inevitable result of civilization andprogress in wild lands. Marauding battalions of zebras, bellicoserhinoceroses and murderous buffaloes do not fit in with ranches andcrops, and children going to school. Except in the great game preserves,the swamps and the dense jungles it is certain that the big game of thewhole of eastern Africa is foredoomed to disappear,--the largest andmost valuable species first.Five hundred years from now, when North America is worn out, and wastedto a skeleton of what it now is, the great plateau region of East Africabetween Cape Town and Lake Rudolph will be a mighty empire, teemingwith white population. Giraffes and rhinoceroses now are trampling overthe sites of the cities and universities of the future. Then the herdsof grand game that now make Africa a sportsman's wonderland will existonly in closed territory, in books, and in memory.[Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE LIONIncidentally, it is also an Index of the Disappearance of African BigGame Generally. From an Article in the Review of Reviews, for August,1912, by Cyrus C. Adams, and Based Largely upon the Exhaustive Studiesof Dr. C.M. Engel, of Copenhagen.]From what has befallen in South Africa, we can easily and correctlyforecast the future of the big game of British East Africa and Uganda.Less than fifty years ago, Cape Colony, Natal, Zululand, and everycountry up to the Zambesi was teeming with herds of big wild animals,just as the northern provinces now are. As late as 1890, when Rhodesiawas taken over by the Chartered Company, and the capital city ofSalisbury was staked out, an American boy in the Pioneer Corps, nowHonorable William Harvey Brown, of Salisbury, wrote thus of the GwibiFlats, near Salisbury:"That evening I beheld on those flats a sight which probably will neveragain be seen there to the end of the world. The variety deployingbefore me was almost incredible! There, within the range of my visionwere groups of roan, sable and tsessebi antelopes, Burchell zebras, [nowtotally extinct!] elands, reedbucks, steinbucks and ostriches. It waslike Africa in the days of Livingstone. As I sat on my horse, viewingwith amazement this wonderful panorama of wild life, I was startled by aherd that came galloping around a small hill just behind me."--("_On theSouth African Frontier_," p. 114.)That was in 1890. And how is it to-day?Salisbury is a modern city, endorsed by two lines of railway. The GwibiFlats are farms. There is some big game yet, in Rhodesia south of theZambesi, but to find it you must go at least a week's journey from thecapital, to the remote corners that have not yet been converted intofarms or mining settlements. North of the Zambesi, Rhodesia yet containsplenty of big game. The Victoria Falls station is a popular startingpoint for hunting expeditions headed northeast and northwest. In thenorthwest the game is yet quite in a state of nature. Unfortunately theBarotse natives of that region can procure from the Portuguese tradersall the firearms and ammunition that they can pay for, and by treatythey retain their hunting rights. The final result willbe--extermination of the game.Elsewhere throughout Rhodesia the natives are not permitted to have gunsand gunpowder,--a very wise regulation. In Alaska our Indians areprivileged to kill game all the year round, and they have modernfirearms with which to do it.And how is it with the game of that day?The true Burchell's zebra is now regarded as _extinct_! In Cape Colonyand Natal, that once teemed with big game in the old-fashioned Africanway, they are _counting the individual wild animals that remain_! Also,they are making game preserves, literally everywhere.Now that the best remaining game districts of Africa are rapidly comingunder British control, it is a satisfaction to observe that thegoverning bodies and executive officers are alive to the necessity ofpreserving the big game from actual extinction. Excepting German EastAfrica, from Uganda to Cape Colony the game preserves form an almostcontinuous chain. It is quite impossible to enumerate all of them; butthe two in British East Africa are of enormous size, and are wellstocked with game. South Africa contains a great many smaller preservesand a few specimen herds of big game, but that is about all. Except in afew localities the hunting of big game in that region is done forever.The Western Districts Game and Trout Protective Association of SouthAfrica recently, (1911), has made careful counts and estimates of thenumber of individual game animals remaining in Cape Colony, with thefollowing result:       *        *        *        *        *BIG GAME IN THE CAPE PROVINCEFrom information kindly placed at the disposal of the Association by theGovernment, it was found that the following varieties of big game arestill found in the Province. The numbers, however, are only approximate:_Blesbok_: About 400 in Steynsburg, and 35 in Queen's Town divisions._Bontebok_: About 30 in Bredasdorp and 45 in Swellendam divisions._Buffalo_: About 340 in Uitenhage, 120 in Alexandria, and 75 in Bathurstdivisions._Elephants_: About 130 in Alexandria, 160 in Uitenhage, 40 in Bathurst,and 20 in Knysna divisions._Gemsbok_: About 2,450 in Namaqualand, 4,500 in Vryburg, 4,000 inGordonia, and 670 in the Kenhardt, Mafeking and Barkly West divisions._Koodoo_: About 10,000, found chiefly in the divisions of Albany, BarklyWest, Fort Beaufort, Hay, Herbert, Jansenville, Kuruman, Ladismith,Mafeking, Mossel Bay, Oudtshoorn, Riversdale, Steytlerville, Uitenhage,Victoria East and Vryburg._Oribi_: About 120, in the divisions of Albany and Alexandria._Rietbok_: About 170, in the Komgha division._Zebra_: About 560, most of which are to be found in the divisions ofCradock, George and Oudtshoorn. A few are to be found in the divisionsof Uniondale and Uitenhage._Springbok_: Being migratory, it is difficult to estimate their number.In some years they are compelled by drought to invade the Province inlarge numbers. They are then seen as far south as Calvinia andFraserburg. Large numbers are, however, fenced in on private estates invarious parts of the Province._Klipspringers_: About 11,200, in the following divisions, viz.:Namaqualand, 6,559; Kuruman, 2,100; Steytlerville, 1,530; Oudtshoorn,275; Hay, 250; Ladismith, 220; Graaff-Reinet, 119; Kenhardt, 66; andCradock, 56._Hartebeest_: About 9,700, principally in the divisions of Vryburg,Gordonia, Kuruman, Mafeking, Kimberley, Hay and Beaufort West._Wildebeest_: About 3,450 in Vryburg, 80 each in Gordonia and Kuruman,65 in Mafeking, 20 in Queen's Town, and a few in the Bredasdorpdivisions._Eland_: About 12 in the Graaff-Reinet division, privately bred.       *        *        *        *        *The above showing of the pitifully small numbers of the specimens thatconstitute the remnant of the big-game of the Cape suggest just onething:--a universal close season throughout Cape Colony, and no huntingwhatever for ten years. And yet, what do we see?The Report from which the above census was taken contains half a columnof solid matter, in small type, giving a list of the _open seasons_ allover Cape Colony, during which killing may be done! So it seems that thespirit of slaughter is the same in Africa that it is inAmerica,--_kill_, as long as there is _anything_ alive to kill!This list is of startling interest, because it shows how closely thesmall remnants of big game are now marked down in South Africa.In view of the success with which Englishmen protect their game whenonce they have made up their minds to do so, it is fair to expect thatthe herds now under protection, as listed above, will save theirrespective species from extinction. It is alarming, however, to note thewide territory covered by the deadly "open seasons," and to wonder whenthe bars really will be put up.To-day, Mashonaland is a very-much-settled colony. The Cape to Cairorailway and trains de luxe long ago attained the Palls of the Zambesi,and now the Curator of the Salisbury Museum will have to searchdiligently in far off Nyassaland, and beyond the Zambesi River, to findenough specimens to fill his cases with representatives of the vanishedRhodesian fauna. Once (1892) the white rhinoceros was found in northernRhodesia; but never again. In Salisbury, elands and zebras are nearly asgreat a curiosity as they are in St. Louis.But for the discovery of white rhinoceroses in the Lado district, on thewestern bank of the Nile below Gondokoro, we would now be saying that_Rhinoceros simus_ is within about ten specimens of total extinction.From South Africa, as far up as Salisbury, in central Rhodesia, at least99 per cent of the big game has disappeared before the white man'srifle. Let him who doubts this scan the census of wild animals stillliving in Cape Colony.From all the other regions of Africa that are easily accessible togunners, the animal life is vigorously being shot out, and no man in hissenses will now say that the big game is breeding faster than it isbeing killed. The reverse is painfully true. Mr. Carl Akeley, in hisquest for a really large male elephant for the American Museum found andlooked over _a thousand_ males without finding one that was really fineand typical. All the photographs of elephant herds that were taken byKermit Roosevelt and Akeley show a striking absence of adult males andof females with long tusks. There are only young males, and youngfemales with small, short tusks. The answer is--the white ivory huntershave killed nearly all the elephants bearing good ivory.The slaughter of big game is going on furiously in British East Africabecause the Uganda Railway opens up the entire territory to hunters.Anyone, man or woman, who can raise 5,000 in cash can go there and makea huge "bag" of big game. With a license costing only 250 he can killenough big game to sink a ship.The bag limit in British East Africa is ruinously extravagant. If thegovernment desires the extermination of the game, such a bag limitsurely will promote that end. It is awful to think that for a petty sumany man may buy the right to kill 300 _head_ of hoofed and hornedanimals, of 44 species, not counting the carnivorous animals that alsomay be killed. That bag limit should _immediately_ be reduced _75 percent_!As matters stand to-day in British East Africa, the big game of thecountry, outside the three preserves, is absolutely certain todisappear, in about one-fourth of the time that it took South Africa toaccomplish the same result. The reasons are obvious:--superioraccessibility, more deadly rifles, expert professional guides, and awidespread craze for killing big game. With care and economy, BritishEast Africa should furnish good hunting for two centuries, but asthings are going on to-day, twenty years will see a tremendous changefor the worse, and a disappearance of game that will literally astonishthe natives.German East Africa and Uganda will not exterminate their quotas of biggame quite so soon. The absence of railways is a great factor ingame-existence. The Congo Free State contains game and sportingpossibilities--on the unexplored uplands _between the rivers_,--that areas yet totally unknown to sportsmen at large. We are accustomed tothinking of the whole basin of the Congo as a vast, gloomy andimpenetrable forest.There is to-day in Africa a vast reserve supply of grand game. Itinhabits regions that are either unknown, or most difficult topenetrate. As a species in point, consider the okapi. Only the boldestand most persistent explorers ever have set foot in its tangled andmiasmatic haunts. It may be twenty years before a living specimen can bebrought out. The gorilla and the chimpanzee are so well protected by thedensity of their jungles that they never can be exterminated--until thenatives are permitted to have all the firearms that they desire! Whenthat day arrives, it is "good-night" to all the wild life that is largeenough to eat or to wear.The quagga and the blaubok became _extinct_ before the world learnedthat their existence was threatened! The giant eland, the sableantelope, the greater kudu, the bontebok, blessbok, the mountain andBurchell zebras, all the giraffes save that of Nigeria, the bigwaterbucks, the nyala, the sitatunga, the bongo, and the gerenuk--allwill go in the same way, everywhere outside the game preserves. Thebuffalo, zebra and rhinoceros are especially marked for destruction, asannoyances to colonists. You who read of the killing of these speciesto-day will read of their total disappearance to-morrow. So long as thehunting of them is permitted, their ultimate disappearance is fixed andcertain. It is not the way of rifle-shooting English colonists to permitherds of big game to run about merely to be looked at.Naturally, the open plains of Africa, and the thin forests of theplateau regions, will be the first to lose their big game. In the gloomyfastnesses of the great equatorial forests, and other really denseforests wherever found, the elephants, the Derby eland, the bongo, theokapi, the buffaloes (of three species), the bush-pigs, the bushbucksand the forest-loving antelopes generally will live, for possibly onehundred years,--_or until the natives secure plenty of modern firearmsand ammunition_. Whenever and wherever savages become supplied withrifles, then it is time to measure each big-game animal for its coffin.The elephants of the great equatorial forest westward of the lake regionwill survive long after the last eastern elephant has bitten the dust.The pygmy elephant of the lower Congo region (_Elephas pumilio_) will bethe last African elephant species to disappear--because it inhabitsdense miasmatic jungles, its tusks are of the smallest size, and it hasthe least commercial value.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XIXTHE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF THE GAME OF ASIAAfter a successful survival of man's influence through two thousandyears, at last the big game of India has made a good start on the roadto vanishment. Up to 1870 it had held its own with a tenacity that wasastonishing. In 1877, I found the Ganges--Jumna dooab, the AnimallaiHills, the Wynaad Forest and Ceylon literally teeming with herds ofgame. The Animallais in particular were a hunter's paradise. In each dayof hunting, large game of some kind was a certainty. The Nilgiri Hillshad been quite well shot out, but in view of the very small area andopen, golf-links character of the whole top of that wonderful skyplateau, that was no cause for wonderment.In those days no native shikaree owned and operated a gun,--or at themost very, very few of them did. If a rogue elephant, a man-eating tigeror a nasty leopard became a public nuisance, it was a case for a sahibto come and doctor it with a .577 double-barreled express rifle, worth150 or more; and the sahibs had shooting galore.I think that no such great wild-life sights as those of the plateauregions of Africa ever were seen in southern Asia. Conditions there aredifferent, and usually the game is widely scattered. The sambar deer andmuntjac of the dense forests, the axis of the bamboo glades, the thamengdeer of the Burmese jungles, the sladang, or gaur, of the awful Malaytangle, and the big cats and canines will last long and well. Theibexes, markhors, tahr and all the wild sheep eventually will be shotout by sportsmen who are "sheep crazy." The sheep and goats of Asia willdisappear soon after the plains animals of Africa, because no big gamethat lives in the open can much longer endure the modern, inexpensivelong-range rifles of deadly accuracy and limitless repetition of fire.Eventually, I fear that by some unlucky turn of Fortune's wheel all thenative hunters of Asia will obtain rifles; and when they do, we soonwill see the end of the big game.Even to-day we find that the primitive conditions of 1877 have beengreatly changed. In the first place, about every native shikaree(hunter) owns a rifle, at a cost of about 25; and many other nativespossess guns, and assume to hunt with them. The logical conclusion ofthis is more hunting and less game. The development of the country hasreduced the cover for game. New roads and railways have made the gamedistricts easily accessible, and real sportsmen are now three or fourtimes as numerous as they were in 1877.At Toonacadavoo, in the Animallai Hills where thirty-five years agothere modestly nestled on the ridge beside the river only Forest RangerTheobold's bungalow, built of mud and covered with grass thatch andbamboo rats, there is now a regular hill station lighted by electricity,a modern sanatorium high up on the bluff, a _club_, golf links, andother modern improvements. In my day there were exactly four guns on theAnimallais. Now there are probably one hundred; and it is easy to guesshow much big game remains on the Delectable Mountains in comparison withthe golden days of 1877. I should say that there is now only one gameanimal for every twenty-five that were there in my day.I am told that it is like that all over India. Beyond question, thegun-sellers and gun-users have been busy there, as everywhere else. Thegame of India is on the toboggan slide, and the old days of abundancehave gone forever.The first fact that strikes us in the face is the impending fate of thegreat Indian rhinoceros, an animal as wonderful as the Titanothere orthe Megatherium. It is like a gift handed down to us straight out of thePleistocene age, a million years back. The British paleontologiststo-day marvel at _Elephas ganesa_, and by great labor dig his bones outof the Sewalik rocks, but what one of them all has yet made a move tosave _Rhinoceros indicus_ from the quick extermination that soon will behis portion unless he is accorded perpetual and real protection from theassaults of man?Let the mammalogists of the world face this fact. The available cover ofthe Indian rhinoceros is _alarmingly_ decreasing, throughout Assam andBengal where the behemoth of the jungle has a right to live. It isbelieved that the few remaining rhinos are being shot much faster thenthey are breeding; and what will be the effect of this upon an animalthat requires fourteen years to reach full maturity? To-day, the mostwonderful hoofed mammal of all Asia is booked for extermination, andunless very radical measures for its preservation are at once carriedinto effect, it is probable that twenty years more will see the lastIndian rhino go down to rise no more. One remedy would be a good, amplerhinoceros preserve; and another, the most absolute and permanentprotection for the species, all along the line. Half-way measures willnot suffice. It is time to ring in a general alarm.During the past eighteen years, only three specimens of that specieshave come out of India for the zoological gardens and parks of theworld, and I think there are only five in captivity, all told.We are told that in India now the natives are permitted to have aboutall the firearms they can pay for. Naturally, in a country containingover 300,000,000 people this is a deadly thing. Of course there areshooting regulations, many of them; but their enforcement is soimperfect that it is said that the natives are attacking the big game onall sides, with deadly effect. I fear it is utterly impossible for theIndian government to put enough wardens into the field to watch thedoings of the grand army of native poachers.Fortunately, the Indian native,--unlike the western frontiersman,--doesnot contend that _he owns_ the big game, or that "all men are born freeand equal." At the same time, he means to have his full share of it, toeat, and to sell in various forms for cash. Even in India, thesale-of-game dragon has reared its head, and is to-day in need of beingscotched with an iron hand.When I received direct from a friend in the native state of Kashmir along printed circular setting forth the hunting laws and game-protectivemeasures of that very interesting principality, it gave me a shock. Itwas disquieting to be thus assured that the big game of Kashmir hasdisappeared to such an extent that strong protective measures arenecessary. It was as if the Chief Eskimo of Etah had issued a strongproclamation for the saving of the musk-ox.In Kashmir, the destruction of game has become so serious that a GamePreservation Department has been created, with the official staff thatsuch an organization requires. The game laws are printed annually, andany variations from them may be made only by the authority of theMaharajah himself. Up to date, _eight_ game preserves have been created,having a total area of about thee hundred square miles. In addition tothese, there are twelve small preserves, each having an area of fromtwenty-five to fifty square miles. By their locations, these seem toprovide for all the species of big game that are found in Kashmir,--theibex, two forms of markhor, the tahr. Himalayan bighorn sheep, burrheland goral.In our country we have several states that are very large, verydiversified in surface, and still inhabited by large game. Has any oneof those states created a series of game preserves even half waycomparable with those of Kashmir? I think not. Montana has made abeginning with two preserves,--Snow Creek and the Pryor Mountains,--butbeside the splendid series of Kashmir they are not worthy of seriousmention.And then following closely in the wake of that document came a lengthyarticle in the "Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London," byE.C. Stebbing, in which a correspondent of the Indian _Field_ clearlysets forth the fact that the big game of the Himalayas now is menaced bya peril new to our consideration, but of a most deadly character. Hearhim:"In this inventory (of game destroyers in India), the Gurkha soldierdoes not find a place, for he belongs to a class which he amply fills byhimself with his small but very important personality. He deservesseparate notice. From the banks of the Sarda on the frontier of Nepal,to the banks of the Indus, the battalions of these gallant little menare scattered in cantonments all along the outer spurs of the Himalayanrange. In seven or eight of these locations there are at least 14,000 ofthese disciplined warriors, who, in the absence of opportunities forspilling human blood legitimately, are given a free hand forslaughtering wild animals, along five-hundred miles of the best huntinggrounds of Upper India."Now, since those facts must be true as reported, do they not inthemselves constitute a severe arraignment of the Indian government? Whyshould that state of game slaughter endure, when a single executiveorder to the C.O. of each post would effectually stop it?In the making of game preserves, or "sanctuaries" as they are called outthere, the Government of India has shown rare and commendable diligence.The total number is too great for enumeration here. The native state ofMysore has seven, and the Nilgiri Hills have sanctuaries aggregatingabout 100,000 acres in area. In the Wynaad Forest, my oldhunting-grounds at Mudumallay have been closed to bison shooting,because of the alarming decrease of bison (gaur) through shooting anddisease. The Kundah Forest Reserve has been made a partial gamepreserve, but the door might as well have been left wide open as sowidely ajar.In eastern Bengal and Assam, several game preserves have been created.On the whole, by the diligence and thoroughness with which sanctuaries,as they are termed, have been created quite generally throughout India,it is quite evident that the government and the sportsmen of India havebecome thoroughly alarmed by the great decrease of the game, and thedanger of the extermination of species. In the past India has been thefinest and best-stocked hunting-ground of all Asia, quite beyondcompare, and the destruction of her once-splendid fauna of big gamewould be a zoological calamity._Tibet_.--As yet, Tibet offers free hunting, without legal let orhindrance, to every sportsman who can climb up to her lofty, wind-sweptand whizzing-cold plateau. The man who hunts the _Ovis poli_, superbcreature though it be, pays in full for his trophies. The ibex of thesouth help out the compensatory damages, but even with that, the list ofspecies available in southern Tibet is painfully small. The Mitchelltakin can be reached from China, via Chungking, after a long, hardjourney, over Consul Mason Mitchell's trail; but the takin is about theonly large hoofed game available._The Altai Mountains_, of western China, contain the magnificentSiberian argali, the grandfather of all sheep species, whose horns mustbe seen to be believed. Through a quest for that species the Russianmilitary authorities played upon Mr. George L. Harrison and his comradea very grim and unsportsmanlike joke. At the frontier military post, onthe Russo-Chinese border, the two Americans were courteously halted,hospitably entertained, and _prevented_ from going into theargali-infested mountains that loomed up before them only a few milesaway! The Russian officers said:"Sheep? Why, if you really want sheep, we will send out some of ourbrave soldiers to shoot some for you; but there is no need for _you_ totake the trouble to go after them!"After Mr. Harrison and his comrade had spent 5,000, and traveled halfway around the world for those sheep, that is in brief the story of howthe cup of Tantalus was given them by the Russians, actually _at theirgoal_! As spoil-sports, those Russian officers were the champions of theworld.Seven hundred miles southeastward of the Altai Mountains of westernChina, guarded by the dangerous hostility of savage native tribes, thereexists and awaits the scientific explorer, according to report, anundiscovered wild horse. The Bicolored Wild Horse is black and white,and joy awaits the zoologist or sportsman who sees it first. Evidentlyit will not soon be exterminated by modern rifles._The Impenetrable Forests_.--Although the mountains of central Asia willin time be cleared of their big game,--when by hook and by crook thenatives secure plenty of modern firearms,--there are places in the FarEast that we know will contain big game forever and a day. Take theMalay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra as examples.Mr. C. William Beebe, who recently has visited the Far East, hasdescribed how the state of Selangor, between Malacca and Penang, hastaken on many airs of improvement since 1878, and sections of SarawakTerritory are being cut down and burned for the growing of rubber.Despite this I am trying to think that those developments menace thetotal volume of the wild life of those regions but little. I wonder ifthose tangled, illimitable, ever-renewing jungles yet know that theirfaces have been scratched. White men never will exterminate the big gameof the really dense jungles of the eastern tropics; but with enoughaxes, snares, guns and cartridges _the natives_ may be able toaccomplish it!In Malayana there are some jungles so dense, so tangled with lianas andso thorny with Livistonias and rattan that nothing larger than a cat canmake way through them. There are thousands of square miles so boggy, soswampy, so dark, gloomy and mosquito-ridden that all men fear them andavoid them, and in them rubber culture must be impossible. In thosesilent places the gaur, the rhino, the Malay sambar, the clouded leopardand the orang-utan surely are measurably safe from the game-bags andmarket gunners of the shooting world. It is good to think that there isan equatorial belt of jungle clear around the world, in Central andSouth America as well as in the old World, in which there will be littleextermination in our day, except of birds for the feather market. Butthe open plains, open mountains, and open forests of Asia andAustralasia are in different case. Eventually they will be "shot out."China, all save Yunnan and western Mongolia, is now horribly barren ofwild life. Can it ever be brought back? We think it can not. Themillions of population are too many; and except in the great foresttracts, the spread of modern firearms will make an end of the game.Already the pheasants are being swept out of China for the Londonmarket, and extinction is staring several species in the face. On thewhole, the pheasants of the Old World are being hit hard by therubber-planting craze. Mr. Beebe declares that owing to the inrush ofaggressive capital, the haunts of many species of pheasants are beingdenuded of all their natural cover, and some mountain species that arelimited to small areas are practically certain to be exterminated at anearly date.DESTRUCTION OF ANIMALS FOR FUR.--In the far North, only the interior ofKamchatka seems to be safe from the iron heel of the skin-hunter. Aglance at the list of furs sold in London last year reveals one or twothings that are disquieting. The total catch of furs for the year 1911is enormous,--considering the great scarcity of wild life on twocontinents. Incidentally it must be remembered that every trappercarries a gun, and in studying the fur list one needs no help in tryingto imagine the havoc wrought with firearms on the edible wild life ofthe regions that contributed all that fur. I have been told by trappersthat as a class, trappers are great killers of game.In order that the reader may know by means of definite figures theextent to which the world is being raked and combed for fur-bearinganimals, we append below a statement copied from the _Fur News Magazine_for November, 1912, of the sales of the largest London fur house duringthe past two years.With varying emotions we call attention to the wombat of Australia,3,841; grebe, 51,261, and house cat, 92,407. Very nearly all the totalsof Lampson & Co. for each species are much lower for the sales of 1912than for those of 1911. Is this fact significant of a steady decline?       *        *        *        *        *FURS SOLD BY C.M.

WILLIAM BEEBECurator of Birds, New York Zoological Park[Footnote G: The observations which furnished this valuable chapter weremade by Mr. Beebe in 1911 while conducting an expedition in southernAsia, Borneo and Java for the purpose of studying in life and nature allthe members of the Pheasant Family inhabiting that region. The resultsof these studies and collections will shortly appear in a very completemonograph of the Phasianidae.--W.T.H.]In chapter XIII, treating of the "Extermination of Birds for Women'sHats," Dr. Hornaday has dealt fully with the feather and plumage trafficafter it enters the brokers' hands, and has proved conclusively that theplumes of egrets are gathered from the freshly killed birds. We maytrace the course of the plumes and feathers backward through thetightly-packed bales and boxes in the holds of the vessels to the portsof the savage lands whence they were shipped; then to the skilful, darkhands of Mexican peon, Venezuelan Indian, African negro or AsiaticChinaman or Malay, who stripped the skin from the flesh; and finally tothe jungle or mountain side or terai where the bird gave up its life toblowpipe, cross-bow, blunderbuss or carefully set snare.In various trips to Mexico, Venezuela and other countries in the tropicsof the New World I have seen many such scenes, but not until I hadcompleted a seventeen months' expedition in search of pheasants, throughsome twenty wild countries of Asia and the East Indies, did I realizethe havoc which is being wrought week by week everywhere on the globe.While we were absent even these few months from the great centers ofcivilization, tremendous advances had been made in air-ships and thethousand and one other modern phases of human development, but evolutionin the world of Nature as we observed it was only destructive--aworld-wide katabolism--a retrogression often discernible from month tomonth. We could scarcely repeat the trip and make the same observationsupon pheasants, so rapidly is this group of birds approachingextinction.The causes of this destruction of wild life are many and diverse, andresemble one another only in that they all emanate from mankind. To thecasual traveller the shooting and trapping of birds for millinerypurposes at first seems to hold an insignificant place among the causes.But this is only because in many of the larger ports, the protectivelaws are more or less operative and the occupation of the plume hunteris carried on in secret ways. But it is as far-reaching and insidiousas any; and when we add to the actual number of birds slain, thecompound interest of eggs grown cold, of young birds perishing slowlyfrom hunger, of the thousands upon thousands of birds which fall woundedor dead among the thick tropical jungle foliage and are lost, the totalis one of ghastly proportions.Not to weaken my argument with too many general statements, let me takeat once some concrete cases. First, that of the Himalayan pheasants andgame-birds. In a recent interesting article by E.P. Stebbing[H] thepast, present and hoped-for future of game birds and animals in India isreviewed. Unfortunately, however, most of the finest creatures in Asialive beyond the border of the British sphere of influence, and thoughwithin sight, are absolutely beyond reach of civilized law. The heart ofthe Himalayas,--the haunts of some of the most beautiful birds in theworld, the tragopans, the blood and impeyan pheasants--lies within thelimits of Nepal, a little country which time and time again has badedefiance to British attacks, and still maintains its independence. Fromits northern border Mt. Everest looks down from its most exalted of allearthly summits and sees valley after valley depleted of first one birdand then another. I have seen and lived with Nepalese shepherds who havenothing to do month after month but watch their flocks. In the loftysolitudes time hangs heavy on their hands, and with true orientalpatience they weave loop after loop of yak-hair snares, and then setthem, not in dozens or scores, but in hundreds and thousands up and downthe valleys.[Footnote H: "Game Sanctuaries and Game Protection in India,"Proc. Zool. Soc., London, 1912. pp. 23-35.]In one locality seven great valleys had been completely cleared ofpheasants, only a single pair of tragopans remaining; and from one ofthese little brown men I took two hundred nooses which had been preparedfor these lone survivors. In these cases, the birds were either cookedand eaten at once, or sold to some passing shepherd or lama for a fewannas. But in other parts of this unknown land systematic collecting ofskins goes on, for bale after bale of impeyan and red argus (tragopan)pheasant skins goes down to the Calcutta wharves, where its infamouscontents, though known, are safe from seizure under the Nepal Raja'sseal! Thus it is that the London feather sales still list these amongthe most splendid of all living birds. And shame upon shame, when weread of 80 impeyan skins "dull," or "slightly defective," we know thatthese are female birds. Then, if ever, we realize that the time of thebird and the beast is passing, the acme of evolution for these wonderfulbeings is reached, and at most we can preserve only a small fragment ofthem.To the millinery hunter, what the egret is to America, and the bird ofparadise to New Guinea, the impeyan pheasant is to India--the mostcoveted of all plumages. There is a great tendency to blame the nativehunter for the decrease of this and other pheasants, and from what Ihave personally seen in many parts of the Himalayas there is no questionthat the Garwhalese and Nepalese hill-men have wrought havoc among thebirds. But these men are by no means the sole cause. As long ago as 1879we read that "The great demand for the brilliant skins of the moonalthat has existed for many years has led to their almost totalextermination in some parts of the hills, as the native shikaris shootand snare for the pot as well as for skins, and kill as many females asmales. On the other hand, though for nearly thirty years my friend Mr.Wilson has yearly sent home from 1,000 to 1,500 skins of this speciesand the tragopan, there are still in the woods whence they were obtainedas many as, if not more than, when he first entered them, simply becausehe has rigidly preserved females and nests, and (as amongst Englishpheasants) one cock suffices for several hens."[Illustration: PHEASANT SNARESMade of Yak Hair, Taken from a Shepherd in Nepal by Mr. Beebe]Ignoring the uncertainty of the last statement, it is rather absurd tothink of a single man "preserving" females and nests in the Himalayasfrom 1850 to 1880, when the British Government, despite most efficientlaws and worthy efforts is unable to protect the birds of these wildregions to-day. The statement that after thirty to forty-five thousandcock impeyans were shot or snared, as many or more than the originalquota remained, could only emanate from the mind of a professionalfeather-hunter, and Hume should not be blamed for more than the mererepetition of such figures. Let it be said to the credit of Wilson, theslaughterer of something near forty-five thousand impeyans, that he wasa careful observer of the birds' habits, and has given us an excellentaccount, somewhat coloured by natives, but on the whole, the best wehave had in the past. But it is not pleasant to read of his waitinguntil "twenty or thirty have got up and alighted in the surroundingtrees, and have then walked up to the different trees and fired at thoseI wished to procure without alarming the rest, only those very close tothe one fired at being disturbed at each report."Hume's opinion that in 1879 there were scores of places where one mightsecure from ten to eighteen birds in a day, is certainly not trueto-day. Indeed, as early as 1858 we read that "This splendid bird, onceso abundant on the Western Himalayas is now far from being so, inconsequence of the numbers killed by sportsmen on account of its beauty.Whole tracts of mountain forest once frequented by the moonal are nowalmost without a single specimen." The same author goes on naively totell the reader that "Among the most pleasant reminiscences of bygonedays is a period of eleven days, spent by the author and a friend on theChoor Mountain near Simia, when among other trophies were numberedsixty-eight moonal pheasants, etc."[Illustration: SILVER PHEASANT SKINS SEIZED AT RANGOON, BRITISH BURMAAbout 600 Skins out of Several Thousand Confiscated in the Custom House,on their way to the London Feather Market. Photographed by Mr. Beebe]For some unaccountable reason there is, or was for many years, a veryprevalent idea that the enormous number of skins which have poured intothe London market were from birds bred in the vicinity of Calcutta. Whenwe remember the intense heat of that low-lying city, and learn from therecords of the Calcutta Zoological Garden that impeyans and tragopansare even shorter-lived than in Europe, the absurdity of the idea isapparent. In spite of numberless inquiries throughout India, I failed tolearn of a single captive young bird ever hatched and reared even in thehigh, cool, hill-stations. The commercial value of an impeyan skin hasvaried from five dollars to twenty dollars, according to the numberreceived annually. In 1876 an estimate placed the monthly average ofimpeyans received in London at from two to eight hundred.In such a case as Nepal, direct protective laws are of no avail. Allhumane arguments are useless, but if the markets at the other end _canbe closed_, the slaughter will cease instantly and automatically.[Illustration: DEADFALL TRAPS IN BURMAA Long Series set Across a Valley, by the Kachins of the Burma-ChineseBorder. A Wholesale Method of Wild-life Slaughter, Photographed by C.William Beebe, 1910]As a contrast to the millinery hunter of fifty years ago it isrefreshing to find that at last sincere efforts are being made inBritish possessions to stop this traffic. I happened to be at Rangoonwhen six large bales of pheasant skins were seized by the Customofficials. A Chinaman had brought them from Yunnan via Bhamo, and waspreparing to ship them as ducks' feathers. Two of the bales were openedfor my inspection. The first contained about five hundred Lady Amherstpheasant skins, falling to pieces and lacking heads and legs. The secondheld over four hundred silver pheasants, in almost perfect condition.The chief collector had put the absolutely prohibitive fine of 200pounds on them, and was waiting for the expiration of the legal numberof days before burning the entire lot. They must have represented yearsof work in decimating the pheasant fauna of western China.Far up in the wilderness of northern Burma, and over the Yunnan border,we often came upon some of the most ingenious examples of nativetrapping, a system which we found repeated in the Malay States, Borneo,China and other parts of the Far East. A low bamboo fence is builtdirectly across a steep valley or series of valleys, about half way fromthe summit to the lower end, and about every fifteen feet a narrowopening is left, over which a heavy log is suspended. Any creatureattempting to make its way through, treads upon several small sticks andby so doing springs the trap and the dead-fall claims a victim. When acountry is systematically strung with traps such as these, sooner orlater all but a pitiful remnant of the smaller mammals, birds andreptiles are certain to be wiped out. Morning after morning I havevisited such a runway and found dead along its path, what must have beenall the walking, running or crawling creatures which the night beforehad sought the water at the bottom; pheasants, cobras, mouse-deer,rodents, civets, and members of many other groups. In some countriesnooses instead of dead-falls guard the openings, but the result isequally deadly.I have described this method of trapping because of its futureimportance in the destruction of wild life in the Far East. The Chinamanin all his many millions is undergoing a remarkably swift and radicalevolution both of character and dress. In many ways, if only from theviewpoint of the patient, thrifty store-keeper he is a most powerfulfactor in the East, and is becoming more so. In many cases he imitatesthe white nations by cutting off his queue and altering his dress. Insome mysterious correlated way his diet seems simultaneously affected,and while for untold generations rice and fish has satisfied all hisgastronomic desires, a new craving, that for meat, has come to him. Theresult is apparent in many parts of the East. The Chinaman is willingand able to pay for meat, and the native finds a new market for thecreatures about him. Again and again when I wished a few specimens ofsome certain pheasant I had but to hail passing canoes and bid a fewannas or "cash" or "ringits" higher than the prospective Chinesepurchaser would give, and the pheasants were mine.In the catalogues of the brokers' sales of feathers we read of manythousands of the wonderful ocellated wing feathers of the arguspheasant, but no less horrible is the sight of a canoe crammed with thebedraggled bodies of these magnificent birds on their way to someChinese hamlet where they will be sold for a pittance, the flesh eatento the last tendon and the feathers given to the children and puppies toplay with. The newly-aroused appetite of the Mongolian will soon be animportant factor in the extermination of animals and birds, few speciesbeing exempt, for the Chinaman lives up to his reputation and is notsqueamish as to the nature of his meat.Before we leave the subject of Chinamen let us consider another recentfactor in the destruction of wild life which is at present widelyoperative in China itself. This is the cold storage warehouse, of whichsix or eight enormous ones have gone up in different parts of the East.To speak in detail only of the one at Hankow, six hundred miles up theYangtze, we found it to be the largest structure in the city. Surroundedby a high wall, with each entrance and exit guarded by armed Sikhs, itseemed like the feudal castle of some medieval baron. Why such secrecyis necessary I could not learn, as there are no laws against itsbusiness. But so carefully guarded is its premises that until a shorttime ago even the British consul-general of Hankow had not been allowedto enter. He, however, at last refused to sign the papers for any moreoutgoing shipments until he should be allowed to see what was going onwithin the warehouse. I hoped to be able to look over some of the frozenpheasants for interesting scientific material, but of course was notallowed to do so.Although here in the heart of China, outside changes are not felt sostrongly and the newly-acquired meat diet of the border and emigrantChinese is hardly apparent, these warehouses have opened up a new sourceof revenue, which has met with instant response. Thousands and tens ofthousands of wild shot or trapped pheasants and other birds are nowbrought to these establishments by the natives from far and near. Thebirds are frozen, and twice a year shipped on specially refrigerated P.and O. steamships to England and the continent of Europe where they seemto find a ready sale. Pigs and chickens also figure in the shipments.Now the pheasants have for centuries existed in enormous numbers in theendless ricefields of China, without doing any damage to the crops. Infact they could not be present in such numbers without being animportant factor in keeping down insect and other enemies of the grain.When their numbers are decimated as they are being at present, theremust eventually result a serious upsetting of the balance of nature. Letus hope that in some way this may be avoided, and that the presentfamine deaths of thirty thousand or more in some provinces will not beincreased many fold.When I started on this search for pheasants I was repeatedly told by oldexplorers in the east that my task would be very different from theirsof thirty years ago; that I would find steamers, railroads andautomobiles where formerly were only canoes and jungle. I indeed foundthis as reported, but while my task was different it was made no easier.Formerly, to be sure, one had from the start to paddle slowly or pushalong the trails made by natives or game animals. But then the wild lifewas encountered at once, while I found it always far from the end of thesteamer's route or the railroad's terminal, and still to be reached onlyby the most primitive modes of travel.I cite this to give point to my next great cause of destruction; theburning and clearing of vast stretches of country for the planting ofrubber trees. The East seems rubber mad, and whether the enormous outputwhich will result from the millions of trees set out month after monthwill be profitable, I cannot say. I can think only of the vanishing ofthe _entire fauna_ and _flora_ of many districts which I have seen as adirect result of this commercial activity. One leaves Port Swettenham onthe west coast of Selangor, and for the hour's run to Kuala Lumpur seeshardly anything but vast radiating lines of spindling rubber trees, allunderbrush cleared, all native growths vanished. From Kuala Lumpur toKuala Kubu at the very foot of the mountain backbone of the MalayPeninsula, the same holds true. And where some area appears not undercultivation, the climbing fern and a coarse, useless "lalang" grasscovers every inch of ground. One can hardly imagine a more completeblotting out of the native fauna and flora of any one limited region.And ever-extending roads for the increasing motor cars are widening thecleared zone, mile after mile to the north and south.In this region, as we pushed on over the mountains into the wildernessof Pahang, we saw little of the actual destruction of the primevalnative growth, but elsewhere it became a common sight. Once, for manydays we studied the wonderful life of a jungle which stretched up to ourvery camp. Troops of rollicking wa-was or gibbons frequented the forest;squirrels, tupaias, birds and insects in myriads were everywhere duringthe day. Great fruit-bats, flying lemurs, owls and other nocturnalcreatures made the evenings and nights full of interest.And then, one day without warning came the sound of an ax, and anotherand another. From that moment the songs, cries, chirps and roars of thejungle were seldom heard from our camp. Every day saw new phalanxes ofsplendid primeval trees fallen, or half suspended in their rigging oflianas. The leaves withered, the flower petals fell and we heard no morethe crackling of bamboos in the wind. Then the pitiful survivors of thedestruction were brought to us; now a baby flying lemur, flung from itshole by the falling of some tree; young tupaias, nestling birds; a fewout of the thousands of creatures from insects to mammals which wereslain so that a Chinaman or Malay might eke a few dollars, four or fiveyears hence, from a grove of rubber trees. I do not say it is wrong. Manhas won out, and might is right, as since the dawn of creation; but tothe onlooker, to the lover of nature and the animal world it is aterrible, a hopeless thing.One cannot at present leave the tourist line of travel in the Eastwithout at once encountering evidence of the wholesale direct slaughterof wild life, or its no less certain extermination by the elimination ofthe haunts and the food plants of the various beasts and birds.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XXITHE SAVAGE VIEW-POINT OF THE GUNNERThe mental attitude of the men who shoot constitutes a deadly factor inthe destruction of wild life and the extermination of species. Fullyninety-five per cent of the sportsmen, gunners and other men and boyswho kill game, all over the world and in all nations, regard game birdsand mammals only as things to be killed _and eaten_, and not ascreatures worth preserving for their beauty or their interest tomankind. This is precisely the viewpoint of the cave-man and the savage,and it has come down from the Man-with-a-Club to the Man-with-a-Gunabsolutely unchanged save for one thing: the latter sometimes isprompted to save to-day in order to slaughter to-morrow.The above statement of an existing fact may seem harsh; and some personsmay be startled by it; but it is based on an acquaintance with thousandsof men who shoot all kinds of game, all over the world. My criticssurely will admit that my opportunities to meet the sportsmen andgunners of the world are, and for thirty-five years have been, ratherfavorable. As a matter of fact, I think the efforts of the hunters of mypersonal acquaintance have covered about seven-tenths of the huntinggrounds of the world. If the estimate that I have formed of the averagehunter's viewpoint is wrong, or even partially so, I will be glad tohave it proven in order that I may reform my judgment and apologize.In working with large bodies of bird-shooting sportsmen I havesteadily--and also painfully--been impressed by their intentness on.killing, and by the fact that _they seek to preserve game only to killit!_ Who ever saw a bird-shooter rise in a convention and advocate thepreservation of any species of game bird on account of its beauty or itsesthetic interest _alive?_ I never did; and I have sat in manyconventions of sportsmen. All the talk is of open seasons, bag limitsand killing rights. The man who has the hardihood to stand up andpropose a five-year close season has "a hard row to hoe." Men rise andsay: "It's all nonsense! There's plenty of quail shooting on Long Islandyet."Throughout the length and breadth of America, the ruling passion is tokill as long as anything killable remains. The man who will openlyadvocate the stopping of quail-shooting because the quails are of suchgreat value to the farmers, or because they are so _beautiful_ andcompanionable to man, receives no sympathy from ninety per cent of thebird-killing sportsmen. The remaining ten per cent think seriously aboutthe matter, and favor long close seasons. It is my impression that ofthe men who shoot, it is only among the big-game hunters that we findmuch genuine admiration for game animals, or any feeling remotelyresembling regard for it.The moment that a majority of American gunners concede the fact thatgame birds are worth preserving for their beauty, and their value asliving neighbors to man, from that moment there is hope for the savingof the Remnant. That will indeed be the beginning of a new era, of amillennium in fact, in the preservation of wild life. It will then beeasy to enact laws for ten-year close seasons on whole groups ofspecies. Think what it would mean for such a close season to be enactedfor all the grouse of the United States, all the shore-birds of theUnited States, or the wild turkey wherever found!To-day, the great--indeed, the _only_--opponents of long close seasonson game birds are the gunners. Whenever and wherever you introduce abill to provide such a season, you will find that this is true. The gunclubs and the Downtrodden Hunters' and Anglers' Protective Associationswill be quick to go after their representatives, and oppose the bill.And state senators and assemblymen will think very hard and with strongcourage before they deliberately resolve to do their duty regardless ofthe opposition of "a large body of sportsmen,"--men who have votes, andwho know how to take revenge on lawmakers who deprive them of their"right" to kill. The greatest speech ever made in the Mexican Congresswas uttered by the member who solemnly said: "I rise to sacrificeambition to honor!"Unfortunately, the men who shoot have become possessed of the idea thatthey have certain inherent, God-given "rights" to kill game! Now, as amatter of fact, a sportsman with a one-hundred-dollar Fox gun in hishands, a two-hundred-dollar dog at his heels and five one-hundred-dollarbills in his pocket has no more "right" to kill a covey of quail on LongIsland than my milkman has to elect that it shall be let alone for thepleasure of his children! The time has come when the people who don'tshoot must do one of two things:1. They must demonstrate the fact that they have rights in the wildcreatures, and demand their recognition, or2. See the killable game all swept off the continent by the Army ofDestruction.Really, it is to me very strange that gunners never care to save gamebirds on account of their beauty. One living bob white on a fence isbetter than a score in a bloody game-bag. A live squirrel in a tree ispoetry in motion; but on the table a squirrel is a rodent that tastes asa rat smells. Beside the ocean a flock of sandpipers is needed tocomplete the beautiful picture; but on the table a sandpiper is beneathcontempt. A live deer trotting over a green meadow, waving a triangularwhite flag, is a sight to thrill any human ganglion; but a deer lyingdead,--unless it has an exceptionally fine head,--is only so muchbutcher's meat.One of the finest sights I ever saw in Montana was a big flock of sagegrouse slowly stalking over a grassy flat thinly sprinkled withsage-brush. It was far more inspiring than any pile of dead birds that Iever saw. I remember scores of beautiful game birds that I have seen andnot killed; but of all the game birds that I have eaten or tried to eatin New York, I remember with sincere pleasure only _one_. Some of theancient cold-storage candidates I remember "for cause," as the lawyerssay.[Illustration: ONE MORNING'S CATCH OF TROUT, NEAR SPOKANEAnother Line of Extermination According to law. Three Times too ManyFish for one rod. In those Cold Mountain Streams, Fish Grow Slowly, anda Stream is Quickly "Fished out"]Sportsmen and gunners, for God's sake elevate your viewpoint of thegame of the world. Get out of the groove in which man has run ever sincethe days of Adam! There is something in a game bird over and above itspound of flesh. You don't "need" the meat any longer; for you don't knowwhat hunger is, save by reading of it. Try the field-glass and thecamera, instead of the everlasting gun. Any fool can take a five-dollargun and kill a bird; but it takes a genius to photograph one wild birdand get "a good one." As hunters, the camera men have the best of it.One good live-bird photograph is more of a trophy and a triumph than abushel of dead birds. The birds and mammals now are literally dying for_your_ help in the making of long close seasons, and in the realstoppage of slaughter. Can you not hear the call of the wild remnant?It is time for the people who don't shoot to call a halt on those whodo; "and if this be treason, then let my enemies make the most of it!"Since the above was written, I have read in the _Outdoor World_ forApril, 1912, the views of a veteran sportsman and writer, Mr. EmersonHough, on the wild-life situation as it seems to him to-day. It is astrong utterance, even though it reaches a pessimistic and gloomyconclusion which I do not share. Altogether, however, its breadth ofview, its general accuracy, and its incisiveness, entitle it to a fullhearing. The following is only an extract from a lengthy articleentitled, "God's Acre:"       *        *        *        *        *  EMERSON HOUGH'S VIEW OF THE SITUATION  The truth is none the less the truth because it is unpleasant to  face. There is no well posted sportsman in America, no manufacturer  of sporting goods in America, no man well versed in American outdoor  matters, who does not know that we are at the evening of the day of  open sport in America. Our old ways have failed, all of them have  failed. The declining fortunes of the best sportsman's journals of  America would prove that, if proof were asked. Our sportsmanship has  failed. Our game laws have failed, and we know they have failed. Our  game is almost gone, and we know it is almost gone. America has  changed and we know that it has changed, although we have not  changed with it. The old America is done and it is gone, and we know  that to be the truth. The old order passeth, and we know that the  new order must come soon if it is to work any salvation for our wild  game and our life in the open in pursuit of it.  There are many reasons for this fact, these facts. Perhaps the  greatest lies in the steady advance of civilization into the  wilderness, the usurpation for agricultural or industrial use of  many of the ancient breeding and feeding places of the wild game.  All over the West and now all over Canada, the plow advances, that  one engine which cannot be gainsaid, which never turns a backward  furrow.  Another great agency is the rapid perfection of transportation all  over the world. Take the late influx of East African literature. If  there really were not access to that country we would not have this  literature, would not have so many pictures from that country. And  if even Africa will soon be overrun, if even Africa soon will be  shot out, what hope is there for the game of the wholly accessible  North American continent?  It is all too easy now for the slaughterer to get to his work, all  too easy for him to transport the fruits of the slaughter. At the  hands of the ignorant, the unscrupulous and the unsparing, our game  has steadily disappeared until it is almost gone. We have handled it  in a wholly greedy, unscrupulous and selfish fashion. This has been  our policy as a nation. If there is to be success for any plan to  remedy this, it must come from a few large-minded men, able to think  and plan, and able to do more than that--to follow their plans with  deeds.  I have seen the whole story of modern American sportsmanship, so  called. It has been class legislation and organized  selfishness--that is what it has been, and nothing else. I do not  blame country legislators, game dealers, farmers, for calling the  sportsmen of America selfish and thoughtless. I do not blame them  for saying that the so-called protective measures advanced by  sportsmen have been selfish measures, and looking to destruction  rather than to protection. At least that has been their actual  result. I have no more reverence for a sportsman than for anyone  else, and no reverence for him at all because he is or calls himself  a sportsman. He has got to be a man. He has got to be a citizen.  I have seen millions of acres of breeding and feeding grounds pass  under the drain and under the plow in my own time, so that the  passing whisper of the wild fowl's wing has been forgotten there now  for many years. I have seen a half dozen species of fine game birds  become extinct in my own time and lost forever to the American  people.  And you and I have seen one protective society after another,  languidly organized, paying in a languid dollar or so per capita  each year, and so swiftly passing, also to be forgotten. We have  seen one code and the other of conflicting and wholly selfish game  laws passed, and seen them mocked at and forgotten, seen them all  fail, as we all know.  We have seen even the nation's power--under that Ark of the Covenant  known as the Interstate Commerce Act--fail to stop wholly the  lessening of our wild game, so rapidly disappearing for so many  reasons.  We have seen both selfish and unselfish sportsmen's journals attempt  to solve this problem and fail to do so. Some of them were great and  broad-minded journals. Their record has not been one of disgrace,  although it has been one of defeat; for some of them really desired  success more than they desired dividends. These, all of them, bore  their share of a great experiment, an experiment in a new land,  under a new theory of government, a theory which says a man should  be able to restrain himself, and to govern himself. Only by  following their theory through to the end of that experiment could  they know that it was to fail in one of its most vitally interesting  and vitally important phases.  But now, as we know, all of these agencies, selfish or unselfish,  have failed to effect the salvation of American wild game. Not by  any scheme, device, or theory, not by any panacea can the old days  of America be brought back to us.       *        *        *        *        *Mr. Hough's views are entitled to respectful consideration; but on onevital point I do not follow him.I believe most sincerely--in fact, _I know_,--that it is _possible_ tomake a few new laws which, in addition to the many, many good protectivelaws we already have, will bring back the game, just as fast and as faras man's settlements, towns, railroads, mines and schemes in generalever can permit it to come back.If the American People as a whole elect that our wild life shall besaved, and to a reasonable extent brought back, then by the Eternal itwill be saved and brought back! The road lies straight before us, andthe going is easy--_if_ the Mass makes up its mind to act. But on onevital point Mr. Hough is right. The sportsman alone never will save thegame! The people who do not kill must act, independently.       *        *        *        *        *PART II.--PRESERVATIONCHAPTER XXIIOUR ANNUAL LOSSES BY INSECTS"You take my life when you do take the means whereby I live.""In no country in the world," says Mr. C.L. Marlatt, of the U.S.Department of Agriculture, "do insects impose a heavier tax on farmproducts than in the United States." These attacks are based upon anenormous and varied annual output of cereals and fruits, and a greatvariety and number of trees. For every vegetable-eating insect, nativeand foreign, we seem to have crops, trees and plant food galore; andtheir ravages rob the market-basket and the dinner-pail. In 1912 therewere riots in the streets of New York over the high cost of food.In 1903, this state of fact was made the subject of a special inquiry bythe Department of Agriculture, and in the "Yearbook" for 1904, thereader will find, on page 461, an article entitled, "The Annual LossOccasioned by Destructive Insects in the United States." The article isnot of the sensational type, it was not written in an alarmist spirit,but from beginning to end it is a calm, cold-blooded analysis ofexisting facts, and the conclusions that fairly may be drawn from them.The opinions of several experts have been considered and quoted, andoften their independent figures are stated.With the disappearance of our birds generally, and especially theslaughter of song and other insect-eating birds both in the South andNorth, the destruction of the national wealth by insects forges to thefront as a subject of vital importance. The logic of the situation is sosimple a child can see it. Short crops mean higher prices. If ten percent of our vegetable food supply is destroyed by insects, as certain asfate we will feel it _in the increased cost of living_.I would like to place Mr. Marlatt's report in the hands of every man,boy and school-teacher in America; but I have not at my disposal themeans to accomplish such a task. I cannot even print it here in full,but the vital facts can be stated, briefly and in plain figures.       *        *        *        *        *CROPS AND INSECTS.CORN.--The principal insect enemies of corn are the chinch bug,corn-root worm (_Diabrotica longicornis_), bill bug, wire worm,boll-worm or ear-worm, cut-worm, army worm, stalk worm, grasshopper,and plant lice, in all a total of about fifty important species! Severalof these pests work secretly. At husking time the wretched ear-worm thatruins the terminal quarter or fifth of an immense number of ears, ispainfully in evidence. The root-worms work insidiously, and the molesand shrews are supposed to attack them and destroy them. The corn-rootworm is charged with causing an annual loss of two per cent of the corncrop, or 20,000,000; the chinch bug another two per cent; the boll orear-worm two per cent more. The remaining insect pests are charged withtwo per cent, which makes eight per cent in all, or a total of80,000,000 lost each year to the American farmer through the ravages ofinsects. This is not evenly distributed, but some areas suffer more thanothers.[Illustration: THE CUT-WORM, (_Peridroma Sancia_)Very Destructive to Crops]WHEAT.--Of all our cereal crops, wheat is the one that suffers most frominsects. There are three insects that cause to the wheat industry anannual loss of about ten per cent. The _chinch bug_ is the worst, and itis charged with five per cent (20,000,000) of the total loss. The_Hessian fly_ comes next in order, and occasionally rolls up enormouslosses. In the year 1900, that insect caused to Indiana and Ohio alonethe loss of 2,577,000 _acres_ of wheat, and the total cost to us of thatinsect in that year "undoubtedly approached 100,000,000." Did thataffect the price of wheat or not? If not, then there is no such thing asa "law of supply and demand."_Wheat plant-lice_ form collectively the third insect pest destructiveto wheat, of which it is reported that "the annual loss occasioned bywheat plant-lice probably does not fall short of two or three per centof the crop."HAY AND FORAGE CROPS.--These are attacked by locusts, grasshoppers, armyworms, cut-worms, web worms, small grass worms and leaf hoppers. Some ofthese pests are so small and work so insidiously that even the farmer isprone to overlook their existence. "A ten per cent shrinkage from theseand other pests in grasses and forage plants is a minimum estimate."COTTON.--The great enemies of the cotton-planter are the cotton bollweevil, the bollworm and the leaf worm; but other insects inflictserious damage. In 1904 the loss occasioned by the boll weevil, chieflyin Texas, was conservatively estimated by an expert, Mr. W.D. Hunter, at20,000,000. The boll worm of the southwestern cotton states hassometimes caused an annual loss of 12,000,000, or four per cent of thecrops in the states affected. Before the use of arsenical poisons, theleaf worm caused an annual loss of from twenty to thirty milliondollars; but of late years that total has been greatly reduced.FRUITS.--The insects that reduce our annual fruit crop attack everyportion of the tree and its product. The woolly aphis attacks the rootsof the fruit tree, the trunk and limbs are preyed upon by millions ofscale insects and borers, the leaves are devastated by the all-devouringleaf worms, canker worms and tent caterpillars, while the fruit itselfis attacked by the codling moth, curculio and apple maggot. To destroyfruit is to take money out of the farmer's pocket, and to attack andinjure the tree is like undermining his house itself. By an annualexpenditure of about 8,250,000 in cash for spraying apple trees, thedestructiveness of the codling moth and curculio have been greatlyreduced, but that money is itself a cash loss. Add to this the12,000,000 of actual shrinkage in the apple crop, and the total annualloss to our apple-growers due to the codling moth and curculio is about20,000,000. In the high price of apples, a part of this loss falls uponthe consumer.In 1889 Professor Forbes calculated that the annual loss to thefruit-growers of Illinois from insect ravages was 2,375,000. In 1892,insects caused to Nebraska apple-growers a loss computed at 2,000,000and, in 1897, New York farmers lost 2,500,000 from that cause. "In manysections of the Pacific Northwest the loss was from fifty toseventy-five per cent." (Yearbook, page 470.)FORESTS.--"The annual losses occasioned by insect pests to forests andforest products (in the United States) have been estimated by Dr. A.D.Hopkins, special agent in charge of forest insect investigations, at notless than 100,000,000.... It covers both the loss from insectdamages to standing timber, and to the crude and manufactured forestproducts. The annual loss to growing timber is conservatively placed at70,000,000."[Illustration: THE GYPSY MOTH, (_Portheria dispar_)Very Destructive to the Finest Shade Trees]There are other insect damages that we will not pause to enumeratehere. They relate to cattle, horses, sheep and stored grain products ofmany kinds. Even cured tobacco has its pest, a minute insect known asthe cigarette beetle, now widespread in America and "frequently thecause of very heavy losses."The millions of the insect world are upon us. Their cost to us has beensummed up by Mr. Marlatt in the table that appears below.       *        *        *        *        *ANNUAL VALUES OF FARM PRODUCTS, AND LOSSES CHARGEABLETO INSECT PESTS._Official Report in the Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture,1904_.                                       % OF  PRODUCT              VALUE            LOSS    AMOUNT OF LOSS Cereals              2,000,000,000     10      200,000,000 Hay                     530,000,000     10        53,000,000 Cotton                  600,000,000     10        60,000,000 Tobacco                  53,000,000     10         5,300,000 Truck Crops             265,000,000     20        53,000,000 Sugars                   50,000,000     10         5,000,000 Fruits                  135,000,000     20        27,000,000 Farm Forests            110,000,000     10        11,000,000 Miscellaneous Crops      58,000,000     10         5,800,000 Total                3,801,000,000             420,100,000 Animal Products       1,750,000,000     10       175,000,000 Natural Forests and                              100,000,000   Forest Products Products in Storage                              100,000,000 GRAND TOTAL          5,551,000,000             795,100,000The millions of the insect world are upon us. The birds fight them forus, and when the birds are numerous and have nestlings to feed, thenumber of insects they consume is enormous. They require absolutelynothing at our hands save _the privilege of being let alone while theywork for us!_ In fighting the insects, our only allies in nature are thesongbirds, woodpeckers, shore-birds, swallows and martins, certainhawks, moles, shrews, bats, and a few other living creatures. All thesewage war at their own expense. The farmers might just as well lose8,250,000 through a short apple crop as to pay out that sum in laborand materials in spraying operations. And yet, fools that we are, we goon slaughtering our friends, and allowing others to slaughter them,under the same brand of fatuous folly that leads the people of Italy tobuild anew on the smoking sides of Vesuvius, after a dozen generationshave been swept away by fire and ashes.In the next chapter we will consider the work of our friends, The Birds.       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XXIII.THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF BIRDSTo-day, from Halifax to Los Angeles, and from Key West to Victoria, adeadly contest is being waged. The fruit-growers, farmers, forest ownersand "park people" are engaged in a struggle with the insect hordes forthe possession of the trees, shrubs and crops. Go out into the open,with your eyes open, and you will see it for yourself. Millions ofdollars are being expended in it. Look at this exhibit of what is goingon around me, at this very moment,--July 19, 1912:The bag insects, in thousands, are devouring the leaves of locust andmaple trees.The elm beetles are trying to devour the elms; and spraying is inprogress.The hickory-bark borers are slaughtering the hickories; and even somepark people are neglecting to take the measures necessary to stop it!The tent caterpillars are being burned.The aphis (scale insects) are devouring the tops of the _white potatoes_in the New York University school garden, just as the potato beetledoes.The codling moth larvae are already at work on the apples.The leaves affected by the witch hazel gall fly are being cut off andburned.These are merely the most conspicuous of the insect pests that I now seedaily. I am not counting those of second or third-rate importance.Some of these hordes are being fought with poisonous sprays, some arebeing killed by hand, and some are being ignored.In view of the known value of the remaining trees of our country, eachwoodpecker in the United States is worth twenty dollars in cash. Eachnuthatch, creeper and chickadee is worth from five to ten dollars,according to local circumstances. You might just as well cut down fourtwenty-inch trees and let them lie and decay, as to permit onewoodpecker to be killed and eaten by an Italian in the North, or a negroin the South. The downy woodpecker is the relentless enemy of thecodling moth, an insect that annually inflicts upon our apple cropdamages estimated by the experts of the U.S. Department of Agricultureat twelve million dollars!Now, is a federal strong-arm migratory bird law needed for such birds ornot? Let the owners of orchards and forests make answer.THE CASE OF THE CODLING MOTH AND CURCULIO.--The codling moth andcurculio are twin terrors to apple-growers, partly because of theirdeadly destructiveness, and partly because man is so weak in resistingthem. The annual cost of the fight made against them, in sprays andlabor and apparatus, has been estimated at 8,250,000. And what do thebirds do to the codling moth,--when there are any birds left alive tooperate? The testimony comes from all over the United States, and it isworth while to cite it briefly as a fair sample of the work of the birdsupon this particularly deadly pest. These facts and quotations are fromthe "Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture," for 1911.[Illustration: DOWNY WOODPECKER]_The Downy Woodpecker_ is the champion tree-protector, and also one ofthe greatest enemies of the codling moth. When man is quite unable tofind the hidden larvae, Downy locates it every time, and digs it out. Itextracts worms from young apples so skillfully that often the fruit isnot permanently injured. Mr. F.M. Webster reports that the labors ofthis bird "afford actual and immediate relief to the infected fruit."Testimony in favor of the downy woodpecker has come from New York, NewJersey, Texas and California, "and no fewer than twenty larvae have beentaken from a single stomach."Take the _Red-Shafted Flicker_ vs. the codling moth. Mr. A.P. Martin ofPetaluma, Cal., states that during the early spring months (of 1890)they were seen by hundreds in his orchard, industriously examining thetrunks and larger limbs of the fruit trees; and he also found greatnumbers of them around sheds where he stored his winter apples andpears. As the result of several hours' search, Mr. Martin found only oneworm, and this one escaped only by accident, for several of the birdshad been within a quarter of an inch of it. "So eager are woodpeckers insearch, of codling moths that they have often been known to riddle theshingle traps and paper bands which are placed to attract the larvaeabout to spin cocoons."Behold the array of birds that devour the larvae of the codling moth toan important extent.       *        *        *        *        *BIRDS THAT DEVOUR THE CODLING MOTHDowny Woodpecker (_Dryobates pubescens_).Hairy Woodpecker (_Dryobates villosus_).Texan Woodpecker (_Dryobates scalaris bairdi_).Red-Headed Woodpecker (_Melanerpes erythrocephalus_).Red-Shafted Flicker (_Colaptes cafer collaris_).Pileated Woodpecker (_Phloeotomus pileatus_).Kingbird (_Tyrranus tyrranus_).Western Yellow-Bellied Flycatcher (_Empidonax difficilis_).Blue Jay (_Cyanocitta cristata_).California Jay (_Aphelocoma californica_).Magpie (_Pica pica hudsonia_).Crow Blackbird (_Quiscalus quiscula_).Brewer Blackbird (_Euphagus cyanocephalus_).Bullock Oriole (_Icterus bullocki_).English Sparrow (_Passer domesticus_).Chipping Sparrow (_Spizella passerina_).California Towhee (_Pipilo crissalis_).Cardinal (_Cardinalis cardinalis_).Black Headed Grosbeak (_Zamelodia melanocephala_).Lazuli Bunting (_Passerina cyanea_).Barn Swallow (_Hirundo erythrogastra_).Western Warbling Vireo (_Vireosylva gilva swainsoni_).Summer, or Yellow Warbler (_Dendroica aestiva_).Lutescent Warbler (_Vermivora celata lutescens_).Brown Creeper (_Certhia familiaris americana_).White-Breasted Nuthatch (_Sitta carolinensis_).Black-Capped Chickadee (_Penthestes atricapillus_).Plain Titmouse (_Baeolophus inornatus_).Carolina Chickadee (_Penthestes carolinensis_).Mountain Chickadee (_Penthestes gambeli_).California Bush Tit (_Psaltriparus minimus californicus_).Ruby-Crowned Kinglet (_Regulus calendula_).Robin (_Planesticus migratorius_).Bluebird (_Sialia sialis_).       *        *        *        *        *In all, says Mr. W.L. McAtee, thirty-six species of birds of thirteenfamilies help man in his irrepressible conflict against his deadlyenemy, the codling moth. "In some places they destroy from sixty-six toeighty-five per cent of the hibernating larvae."Now, are the farmers of this country content to let the Italians of theNorth, and the negroes of the South, shoot those birds for food, anddevour them? What is the great American farmer going to _do_ about thismatter? What he should do is to write and urge his members of Congressto work for and vote for the federal migratory bird bill.THE COTTON BOLL WEEVIL.--Let us take one other concrete case. The cottonboll weevil invaded the United States from Mexico in 1894. Ten yearslater it was costing the cotton planters an annual loss estimated atfifteen million dollars per year. Later on that loss was estimated attwenty million dollars. The cotton boll weevil strikes at the heart ofthe industry by destroying the boll of the cotton plant. While the totalloss never can be definitely ascertained, we know that it has amountedto many millions of dollars. The figure given above has been widelyquoted, and so far as I am aware, never disputed.Fortunately we have at hand a government publication on this subjectwhich gives some pertinent facts regarding the bird enemies of thecotton boll weevil. It is Circular No. 57 of the Biological Survey,Department of Agriculture. Any one can obtain it by addressing thatDepartment. I quote the most important portions of this valuabledocument:       *        *        *        *        *BIRDS USEFUL IN THE WAR AGAINST THE COTTON BOLL WEEVIL.By H.W. Henshaw, Chief of the Biological Survey.The main purpose of this circular is to direct the attention of cottongrowers and others in the cotton growing states to the importance ofbirds in the boll weevil war, to emphasize the need of protection forthem, and to suggest means to increase the numbers and extend the rangeof certain of the more important kinds.Investigations by the Biological Survey show that thirty-eight speciesof birds eat boll weevils. While some eat them only sparingly others eatthem freely, and no fewer than forty-seven adult weevils have been foundin the stomach of a single cliff swallow. Of the birds known at thepresent time to feed on the weevil, among the most important are theorioles, nighthawks, and, foremost of all, the swallows (including thepurple martin).ORIOLES.--Six kinds of orioles live in Texas, though but two inhabit thesouthern states generally. Orioles are among the few birds that evince adecided preference for weevils, and as they persistently hunt for theinsects on the bolls, they fill a place occupied by no other birds. Theyare protected by law in nearly every state in the Union, but theirbright plumage renders them among the most salable of birds formillinery purposes, and despite protective laws, considerable numbersare still killed for the hat trade. It is hardly necessary to point outthat their importance as insect eaters everywhere demands theirprotection, but more especially in the cotton belt.NIGHTHAWK.--The nighthawk, or bull-bat, also renders important servicein the destruction of weevils, and catches them on the wing inconsiderable numbers, especially during its migration. Unfortunately,_the nighthawk is eaten for food in some sections of the South, andconsiderable numbers are shot for this purpose_. The bird's value forfood, however, is infinitesimal as compared with the service it rendersthe cotton grower and other agriculturists, and every effort should bemade to spread broadcast a knowledge of its usefulness as a weevildestroyer, with a view to its complete protection.SWALLOWS.--Of all the birds now known to destroy weevils, swallows arethe most important. Six species occur in Texas and the southern states.The martin, the barn swallow, the bank swallow, the roughwing, and thecliff swallow breed locally in Texas, and all of them, except the cliffswallow, breed in the other cotton states. The white-bellied, or treeswallow, nests only in the North, and by far the greater number of cliffswallows nest in the North and West.[Illustration: THE BALTIMORE ORIOLEThe Deadly Enemy of the Cotton-Boll WeevilFrom the "American Natural History"]As showing how a colony of martins thrives when provided with sufficientroom to multiply, an experiment by Mr. J. Warren Jacobs, of Waynesburg,Pa., may be cited. The first year five pairs were induced to occupy thesingle box provided, and raised eleven young. The fourth year threelarge boxes, divided into ninety-nine rooms, contained fifty-threepairs, and they raised about 175 young. The colony was thus nearly threehundred strong at the close of the fourth season. The effect of thisnumber of hungry martins on the insects infesting the neighborhood maybe imagined.From the standpoint of the farmer and the cotton grower, swallows areamong the most useful birds. Especially designed by nature to captureinsects in midair, their powers of flight and endurance are unexcelled,and in their own field they have no competitors. Their peculiar value tothe cotton grower consists in the fact that, like the nighthawk, theycapture boll weevils when flying over the fields, which no other birdsdo. Flycatchers snap up the weevils near trees and shrubbery. Wrens huntthem out when concealed under bark or rubbish. Blackbirds catch them onthe ground, as do the killdeer, titlark, meadow lark, and others; whileorioles hunt for them on the bolls. But it is the peculiar function ofswallows to catch the weevils as they are making long flights, leavingthe cotton fields in search of hiding places in which to winter orentering them to continue their work of devastation.Means have been taken to inform residents of the northern states of thevalue of the swallow tribe to agriculturists generally, and particularlyto cotton planters, in the belief that the number of swallows breedingin the North can be substantially increased. The cooperation of thenorthern states is important, since birds bred in the North migratedirectly through the southern states in the fall on their way to thedistant tropics, and also in the spring on their return.[Illustration: THE NIGHTHAWKA Goatsucker, not a Song-bird; but it Feeds Exclusively Upon Insects]Important as it is to increase the number of northern breeding swallows,it is still more important to increase the number nesting in the Southand to induce the birds there to extend their range over as much of thecotton area as possible. Nesting birds spend much more time in the Souththan migrants, and during the weeks when the old birds are feeding youngthey are almost incessantly engaged in the pursuit of insects.It is not, of course, claimed that birds alone can stay the ravages ofthe cotton boll weevil in Texas, but they materially aid in checking theadvance of the pest into the other cotton states. Important auxiliaries,in destroying these insects, birds aid in reducing their numbers withinsafe limits, and once within safe limits in keeping them there. Hence itis for the interests of the cotton states that special efforts be madeto protect and care for the weevil-eating species, and to increase theirnumbers in every way possible.--(End of the circular.)       *        *        *        *        *CONDENSED NOTES ON THE FOOD HABITS OF CERTAIN NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS.Millions of Americans and near-Americans, both old and young, now needto be shown the actual figures that represent the value of our birds asdestroyers of the insects, weeds and the small rodents that are swarmingto overrun and devour our fields, orchards and forests. Will our peoplenever learn that in fighting pests the birds are worth ten times more tomen than all the poisons, sprays and traps that ever were invented orused?We cannot spray our forests; and if the wild birds do not protect, themfrom insects, _nothing will_! If you will watch a warbler collecting theinsects out of the top of a seventy-foot forest oak, busy as a bee hourafter hour, it will convince you that the birds do for the forests thatwhich man with all his resources cannot accomplish. You will thenrealize that to this country every woodpecker, chickadee, titmouse,creeper and warbler is easily worth its weight in gold. The killing ofany member of those groups of birds should be punished by a fine oftwenty-five dollars.[Illustration: THE PURPLE MARTINA Representative of the Swallow Family. A Great Insect-eater;one of the Most Valuable of all Birds to the Southern Cottonplanter, and Northern farmer. Shot for "Food" in the South.Driven out of the North by the English Sparrow Pest.]THE BOB-WHITE.--And take the _Bob White Quail_, for example, and theweeds of the farm. To kill weeds costs money--hard cash that the farmerearns by toil. Does the farmer put forth strenuous efforts to protectthe bird of all birds that does most to help him keep down the weeds?Far from it! All that the _average_ farmer thinks about the quail is ofkilling it, for a few ounces of meat on the table.It is fairly beyond question that of all birds that influence thefortunes of the farmers and fruit-growers of North America, the commonquail, or bob white, is one of the most valuable. It stays on the farmall the year round. When insects are most numerous and busy, Bob Whitedevotes to them his entire time. He cheerfully fights them, from sixteento eighteen hours per day. When the insects are gone, he turns hisattention to the weeds that are striving to seed down the fields foranother year. Occasionally he gets a few grains of wheat that have beenleft on the ground by the reapers; but he does _no damage_. InCalifornia, where the valley quail once were very numerous, theysometimes consumed altogether too much wheat for the good of thefarmers; but outside of California I believe such occurrences areunknown.Let us glance over the bob white's bill of fare:_Weed Seeds_.--One hundred and twenty-nine different weeds have beenfound to contribute to the quail's bill of fare. Crops and stomachs havebeen found crowded with rag-weed seeds, to the number of one thousand,while others had eaten as many seeds of crab-grass. A bird shot at PineBrook, N.J., in October, 1902, had eaten five thousand seeds of greenfox-tail grass, and one killed on Christmas Day at Kinsale, Va., hadtaken about ten thousand seeds of the pig-weed. (Elizabeth A. Reed.) InBulletin No. 21, Biological Survey, it is calculated that if in Virginiaand North Carolina there are four bob whites to every square mile, andeach bird consumes one ounce of seed per day, the total destruction toweed seeds from September 1st to April 30th in those states alone willbe 1,341 tons.In 1910 Mrs. Margaret Morse Nice, of Clark University, Worcester, Mass.,finished and contributed to the Journal of Economic Entomology (Vol.III., No. 3) a masterful investigation of "The Food of the Bob-White."It should be in every library in this land. Mrs. Nice publishes theentire list of 129 species of weed seeds consumed by the quail,--and itlooks like a rogue's gallery. Here is an astounding record, which provesonce more that truth is stranger than fiction:       *        *        *        *        *NUMBER OF SEEDS EATEN BY A BOB-WHITE IN ONE DAYBarnyard grass    2,500       Milkweed                   770Beggar ticks      1,400       Peppergrass              2,400Black mustard     2,500       Pigweed                 12,000Burdock             600       Plantain                12,500Crab grass        2,000       Rabbitsfoot clover      30,000Curled dock       4,175       Round-headed bush clover 1,800Dodder            1,560       Smartweed                2,250Evening primrose 10,000       White vervain           18,750Lamb's quarter   15,000       Water smartweed          2,000NOTABLY BAD INSECTS EATEN BY THE BOB-WHITE(Prof. Judd and Mrs. Nice.)Colorado potato beetleCucumber beetleChinch bugBean-leaf beetleWirewormMay beetleCorn billbugImbricated-snout beetlePlant liceCabbage butterflyMosquitoSquash beetleClover leaf beetleCotton boll weevilCotton boll wormStriped garden caterpillarCutwormsGrasshoppersCorn-louse antsRocky Mountain locustCodling mothCanker wormHessian flyStable flySUMMARY OF THE QUAIL'S INSECT FOODOrthoptera--Grasshoppers and locusts                13 species.Hemiptera--Bugs                                     24    "Homoptera--Leaf hoppers and plant lice               6    "Lepidoptera--Moths, caterpillars, cut-worms, etc    19    "Diptera--Flies                                       8    "Coleoptera--Beetles                                 61    "Hymenoptera--Ants, wasps, slugs                      8    "Other insects                                        6    "                                                   ---                                             Total 145    "       *        *        *        *        *[Illustration: THE BOB-WHITEFor the Smaller Pests of the Farm, This Bird is the MostMarvelous Engine of Destruction Ever put Together of Flesh and Blood.]_A few sample meals of insects_.--The following are records of singleindividual meals of the bob white:Of grasshoppers, 84; chinch bugs, 100; squash bugs, 12; army worm, 12;cut-worm, 12; mosquitoes, 568 in three hours; cotton boll weevil, 47;flies, 1,350; rose slugs, 1,286. Miscellaneous insects consumed by alaying hen quail, 1,532, of which 1,000 were grasshoppers; total weighof the lot, 24.6 grams."F.M. Howard, of Beeville, Texas, wrote to the U.S. Bureau ofEntomology, that the bob whites shot in his vicinity had their cropsfilled with the weevils. Another farmer reported his cotton fields fullof quail, and an entire absence of weevils." Texas and Georgia papers(please copy.)And yet, because of its few pitiful ounces of flesh, two million gunnersand ten thousand lawmakers think of the quail _only as a bird that canbe shot and eaten!_ Throughout a great portion of its former range,including New York and New Jersey, the species is surely and certainlyon the verge of _total extinction_. And yet sportsmen gravely discussthe "bag limit," and "enforcement of the bag-limit law" as a means ofbringing back this almost vanished species! Such folly in grown men isvery trying._To my friend, the Epicure_:--The next time you regale a good appetitewith blue points, terrapin stew, filet of sole and saddle of mutton,touched up here and there with the high lights of rare old sherry, richclaret and dry monopole, pause as the dead quail is laid before you, ona funeral pyre of toast, and consider this: "Here lies the charredremains of the Farmer's Ally and Friend, poor Bob White. In life hedevoured 145 different kinds of bad insects, and the seeds of 129anathema weeds. For the smaller pests of the farm, he was the mostmarvelous engine of destruction that God ever put together of flesh andblood. He was good, beautiful and true; and his small life wasblameless. And here he lies, dead; snatched away from his field oflabor, and destroyed, in order that I may be tempted to dine threeminutes longer, after I have already eaten to satiety."Then go on, and finish Bob White.THE CASE OF THE ROBIN.--For a long time this bird has been slaughteredin the South for food, regardless of the agricultural interests of theNorth. No Southern gentleman ever shoots robins, or song birds of anykind, but the negroes and poor whites do it. The worst case of recentoccurrence was the slaughter in the town of Pittsboro, North Carolina.It was in January, 1912. The Mayor of the town, Hon. Bennet Nooe, wasaway from home; and during a heavy fall of snow "the robins came intothe town in great numbers to feed upon the berries of the cedar trees.In order that the birds might be killed without restriction, the Boardof Aldermen suspended the ordinance against the firing of guns in thetown, and permitted the inhabitants to kill the robins."A disgraceful carnival of slaughter immediately followed in which "aboutall the male population" participated. Regarding this, Mayor Nooe lateron wrote to the editor of Bird Lore as follows:"Hearing of this, on my return, I went to the Aldermen, _all of whomwere guilty_, and told them that they and all others who were guiltywould have to be fined. Three out of the five submitted and paid up, butthey insisted that the ordinance be changed to read exactly as it iswritten here, with the exception that _all could shoot_ robins in thetown until the first of March; whereupon I resigned, as wasstated."--(_Bird Lore,_ XIV, 2. p. 140.)The Mayor was quite right. The robin butchers of Pittsboro were notworthy to be governed by him.THE MEADOW LARK is one of the most valuable birds that frequent farmingregions. Throughout the year insects make up 73 per cent of its food,weed-seeds 12 per cent, and grain only 5 per cent. During the insectseason, insects constitute 90 per cent of its food.THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE is as valuable to man as it is beautiful. Its nestis the most wonderful example of bird architecture in our land. In Mayinsects constitute 90 per cent of this bird's food. For the entire year,insects and other animal food make 83.4 per cent and vegetable matter16.6 per cent.THE CROW BLACKBIRD feeds as follows, throughout the whole year: insects,26.9 per cent; other animal food 3.4; corn 37.2; oats, 2.9; wheat, 4.8;other grain, 1.6; fruits, 5; weed seeds and mast 18.2! This report wasbased on the examination (by the Biological Survey) of 2,346 stomachs,and "the charge that the blackbird is an habitual robber of birds' nestswas disproved by the examinations." (F.E.L. Beal.)FLYCATCHERS.--The high-water mark in insect-destruction by our birds isreached by the flycatchers,--dull-colored, modest-mannered littlecreatures that do their work so quietly you hardly notice them. All yousee in your tree-tops is a two-foot flit or glide, now here and nowthere, as the leaves and high branches are combed of their insect life.Bulletin No. 44 of the Department of Agriculture gives the residuum ofan exhausting examination of 3,398 warbler stomachs, from seventeenspecies of birds, and the result is: 94.99 per cent of insectfood,--mostly bad insects, too,--and 5.01 per cent vegetable food. Whatmore can any forester ask of a bird?[Illustration: THE ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK"The Potato-bug Bird," Greatest Enemy of the Potato BeetlesFrom the "American Natural History"]THE SPARROWS.--All our sparrows are great consumers of weed seeds.Professor Beal has calculated the total quantity consumed in Iowa in oneyear,--in the days when sparrows were normally numerous,--at 1,750,000pounds.THE AMERICAN GOLDFINCH as a weed destroyer has few equals. It makes aspecialty of the seeds of the members of the Order Compositae, and isespecially fond of the seeds of ragweed, thistles, wild lettuce and wildsunflower. But, small and beautiful as this bird is, there are hundredsof thousands of grown men in America who would shoot it and eat it ifthey dared!THE HAWKS AND OWLS.--Let no other state repeat the error that once wasmade in Pennsylvania when that state enacted in 1885, her now famoushawk-and-owl bounty law. In order to accomplish the wholesaledestruction of her birds of prey, a law was passed providing for thepayment of a bounty of fifty cents each for the scalps of hawks andowls. Immediately the slaughter began. In two years 180,000 scalps werebrought in, and 90,000 were paid out for them. It was estimated thatthe saving to the farmers in poultry amounted to one dollar for each1,205 paid out in bounties.The awakening came even more swiftly than the ornithologists expected.By the end of two years from the passage of "the hawk law," the farmersfound their fields and orchards thoroughly overrun by destructive rats,mice and insects, and they appealed to the legislature for the quickrepeal of the law. With all possible haste this was brought about; butit was estimated by competent judges that in damages to their crops thehawk law cost the people of Pennsylvania nothing less than two milliondollars.Moral: Don't make any laws providing for the destruction of hawks andowls until you have exact knowledge, and know in advance what theresults will be.In the space at my disposal for this subject, it is impossible to treatour species of hawks and owls separately. The reader can find in the"American Natural History" fifteen pages of text, numerous illustrationsand many figures elucidating this subject. Unfortunately Dr. Fisher'sadmirable work on "The Hawks and Owls" has long been out of print, andunobtainable. There are, however, a few observations that must berecorded here.Each bird of prey is a balanced equation. Each one, I think without asingle exception, does _some_ damage, chiefly in the destruction ofvaluable wild birds. The value of the poultry destroyed by hawks andowls is very small in comparison with their killing of wild prey. _Manyof the species do not touch domestic poultry_! At the same time, when ahawk of any kind, or an owl, sets to work deliberately and persistentlyto clean out a farmer's poultry yard, and is actually doing it, thatfarmer is justified in killing that bird. But, the _occasional_ loss ofa broiler is not to be regarded as justification for a war ofextermination on _all_ the hawks that fly! Individual wild-animalnuisances can occasionally become so exasperating as to justify the useof the gun,--when scarecrows fail; but in all such circumstances thegreatest judgment, and much forbearance also, is desirable andnecessary.The value of hawks and owls rests upon their perpetual warfare on themillions of destructive rats, mice, moles, shrews, weasels, rabbits andEnglish sparrows that constantly prey upon what the farmer produces. Onthis point a few illustrations must be given. One of the most famouscomes via Dr. Fisher, from one of the towers of the Smithsonianbuildings, and relates toTHE BARN OWL, (_Strix flammea_).--Two hundred pellets consisting ofbones, hair and feathers from one nesting pair of these birds werecollected, and found to contain 454 skulls, of which 225 were of meadowmice, 179 of house mice, 2 of pine mice, 20 were of rats, 6 of jumpingmice, 20 were from shrews, 1 was of a mole and 1 a vesper sparrow. _One_bird, and 453 noxious mammals! Compare this with the record of any caton earth. Anything that the barn owl wants from me, or from any farmer,should at once be offered to it, on a silver tray. This bird is oftencalled the Monkey-Faced Owl, and it should be called the Farmer's-FriendOwl.THE LONG-EARED OWL, (_Asio wilsonianus_) has practically the same kindof a record as the barn owl,--scores of mice, rats and shrewsdestroyed, and only an occasional small bird. Its nearest relative, the_Short-eared Owl (A. accipitrinus_) may be described in the same words.[Illustration: THE BARN OWLWonderfully Destructive of Rats and Mice, andAlmost Never Touches Birds]The GREAT HORNED OWL fills us with conflicting passions. For the longlist of dead rats and mice, pocket gophers, skunks, and weasels to hiscredit, we think well of him, and wish his prosperity. For thesong-birds, ruffed grouse, quail, other game birds, domestic poultry,squirrels, chipmunks and hares that he kills, we hate him, and wouldcheerfully wring his neck, wearing gauntlets. He does an unusual amountof good, and a terrible amount of harm. It is impossible to strike abalance for him, and determine with mathematical accuracy whether heshould be shot or permitted to live. At all events, whenever _Bubo_comes up for trial, we must give the feathered devil his due.The names "CHICKEN HAWK or HEN HAWK" as applied usually refer to theRED-SHOULDERED or RED-TAILED species. Neither of these is really verydestructive to poultry, but both are very destructive to mice, rats andother pestiferous creatures. Both are large, showy birds, not so veryswift in flight, and rather easy to approach. Neither of them should bedestroyed,--not even though they do, once in a great while, take achicken or wild bird. They pay for them, four times over, byrat-killing. Mr. J. Alden Loring states that he once knew a pair ofred-shouldered hawks to nest within fifty rods of a poultry farm onwhich there were 800 young chickens and 400 ducks, not one of which wastaken. (See the American Natural History, pages 229-30.)HAWKS THAT SHOULD BE DESTROYED.--There are two small, fierce, daring,swift-winged hawks both of which are so very destructive that theydeserve to be shot whenever possible. They are COOPER'S HAWK _(Accipitercooperi_) and the SHARP-SHINNED HAWK _(A. velox_). They are closelyrelated, and look much alike, but the former has a rounded tail and thelatter a square one. In killing them, _please do not kill any other hawkby mistake_; and if you do not positively recognize the bird, don'tshoot.THE GOSHAWK is a bad one, and so is the PEREGRINE FALCON, or DUCK HAWK.Both deserve death, but they are so rare that we need not take them intoaccount.Some of the hawks and owls are very destructive to song-birds, andmembers of the grouse family. In 159 stomachs of sharp-shinned hawks, 99contained song-birds and woodpeckers. In 133 stomachs of Cooper's hawks,34 contained poultry or game birds, and 52 contained other birds. Thegame birds included 8 quail, 1 ruffed grouse and 5 pigeons.THE WOODPECKERS.[I]--These birds are the natural guardians of the trees.If we had enough of them, our forests would be fairly safe from insectpests. Of the six or seven North American species that are of the mostimportance to our forests, the DOWNY WOODPECKER, (_Dryobates pubescens_)is accorded first rank. It is one of the smallest species. The contentsof 140 stomachs consisted of 74 per cent insects, 25 per cent vegetablematter and 1 per cent sand. The insects were ants, beetles, bugs, flies,caterpillars, grasshoppers and a few spiders.[Footnote I: The reader is advised to consult Prof. F.E.L. Beale'sadmirable report on "The Food of Woodpeckers," Bulletin No. 7, U.S.Department of Agriculture.]THE HAIRY WOODPECKER, (_Dryobates villosus_), a very close relation ofthe preceding species, is also small, and his food supply is as follows:insects, 68 per cent, vegetable matter 31, mineral 1.THE GOLDEN-WINGED WOODPECKER, (_Colaptes auratus_), is the largest andhandsomest of all the woodpeckers that we really see in evidence. ThePileated is one of the largest, but we never see it. This bird makes aspecialty of ants, of which it devours immense numbers. Its food is 56per cent animal matter (three-fourths of which is ants), 39 per cent isvegetable matter, and 5 per cent mineral matter.THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER is a serious fruit-eater, and many complaintshave been lodged against him. Exactly one-half his food supply consistsof vegetable matter, chiefly wild berries, acorns, beechnuts, and theseeds of wild shrubs and weeds. We may infer that about one-tenth of hisfood, in summer and fall, consists of cultivated fruit and berries. Hisproportion of cultivated foods is entirely too small to justify any onein destroying this species.In view of the prevalence of insect pests in the state of New York, Ihave spent hours in trying to devise a practical plan for makingwoodpeckers about ten times more numerous than they now are.Contributions to this problem will be thankfully received. Yes; we _do_put out pork fat and suet in winter, quantities of it; but I grieve tosay that to-day in the Zoological Park there is not more than onewoodpecker for every ten that were there twelve years ago. Where havethey gone? Only one answer is possible. They have been shot and eaten,by the guerrillas of destruction.[Illustration: GOLDEN-WINGED WOODPECKERA Bird of Great Value to Orchards and Forests, nowRapidly Disappearing, Undoubtedly Through Slaughter as "Food"]Surely no man of intelligence needs to be told to protect woodpeckers tothe utmost, and to _feed them in winter_. Nail up fat pork, or largechunks of suet, on the south sides of conspicuous trees, and encouragethe woodpeckers, nuthatches, chickadees and titmice to remain in yourwoods through the long and dreary winter.THE ENGLISH SPARROW is a nuisance and a pest, because it drives awayfrom the house and the orchard the house wren, bluebird, phoebe, purplemartin and swallow, any one of which is more valuable to man than athousand English sparrows. I never yet have seen one of the pestsparrows catch an insect, but Chief Forester Merkel says that he hasseen one catching and eating small moths.There is one place in the country where English sparrows have not yetcome; and whenever they do appear there, they will meet a hostilereception. I shall kill every one that comes,--for the sake of retainingthe wrens, catbirds, phoebes and thrushes that now literally make homehappy for my family. A good way to discourage sparrows is to shoot themen masse when they are feeding on road refuse, such as thewhite-throated, white-crowned and other sparrows never touch. Persistentdestruction of their nests will check the nuisance.THE SHORE BIRDS.--Who is there who thinks of the shore-birds as beingdirectly beneficial to man by reason of their food habits? I warrant notmore than one man in every ten thousand! We think of them only aspossible "food." The amount of actual cash value benefit that theshore-birds confer upon man through the destruction of bad things is, incomparison with the number of birds, enormous.The Department of Agriculture never publishes and circulates anythingthat has already been published, no matter how valuable to the public atlarge. Our rules are different. Because I know that many of the peopleof our country need the information, I am going to reprint here, as anobject lesson and a warning, the whole of the Biological Survey'svaluable and timely circular No. 79, issued April 11, 1911, and writtenby Prof. W.L. McAtee. It should open the eyes of the American people totwo things: the economic value of these birds, and the fact that theyare everywhere far on the road toward extermination!       *        *        *        *        *OUR VANISHING SHOREBIRDSBy Prof. W.L. McAteeThe term shorebird is applied to a group of long-legged, slender-billed,and usually plainly colored birds belonging to the order Limicolae. Morethan sixty species of them occur in North America. True to their namethey frequent the shores of all bodies of water, large and small, butmany of them are equally at home on plains and prairies.Throughout the eastern United States shorebirds are fast vanishing.While formerly numerous species swarmed along the Atlantic coast and inthe prairie regions, many of them have been so reduced thatextermination seems imminent. The black-bellied plover or beetlehead,which occurred along the Atlantic seaboard in great numbers years ago,is now seen only as a straggler. The golden plover, once exceedinglyabundant east of the Great Plains, is now rare. Vast hordes oflong-billed dowitchers formerly wintered in Louisiana; now they occuronly in infrequent flocks of a half dozen or less. The Eskimo curlewwithin the last decade has probably been exterminated and the othercurlews greatly reduced. In fact, all the larger species of shorebirdshave suffered severely.So adverse to shorebirds are present conditions that the wonder is thatany escape. In both fall and spring they are shot along the whole routeof their migration north and south. Their habit of decoying readily andpersistently, coming back in flocks to the decoys again and again, inspite of murderous volleys, greatly lessens their chances of escape.The breeding grounds of some of the species in the United States andCanada have become greatly restricted by the extension of agriculture,and their winter ranges in South America have probably been restrictedin the same way.Unfortunately, shorebirds lay fewer eggs than any of the other speciesgenerally termed game birds. They deposit only three or four eggs, andhatch only one brood yearly. Nor are they in any wise immune from thegreat mortality known to prevail among the smaller birds. Their eggs andyoung are constantly preyed upon during the breeding season by crows,gulls, and jaegers, and the far northern country to which so many ofthem resort to nest is subject to sudden cold storms, which kill many ofthe young. In the more temperate climate of the United States smallbirds, in general, do not bring up more than one young bird for everytwo eggs laid. Sometimes the proportion of loss is much greater, actualcount revealing a destruction of 70 to 80 per cent of nests and eggs.Shorebirds, with sets of three or four eggs, probably do not on theaverage rear more than two young for each breeding pair.It is not surprising, therefore, that birds of this family, with theirlimited powers of reproduction, melt away under the relentless warfarewaged upon them. Until recent years shorebirds have had almost noprotection. Thus, the species most in need of stringent protection havereally had the least. No useful birds which lay only three or four eggsshould be retained on the list of game birds. The shorebirds should berelieved from persecution, and if we desire to save from extermination amajority of the species, action must be prompt.The protection of shorebirds need not be based solely on esthetic orsentimental grounds, for few groups of birds more thoroughly deserveprotection from an economic standpoint. Shorebirds perform an importantservice by their inroads upon mosquitoes, some of which play soconspicuous a part in the dissemination of diseases. Thus, nine speciesare known to feed upon mosquitoes, and hundreds of the larvae or"wigglers" were found in several stomachs. Fifty-three per cent of thefood of twenty-eight northern phalaropes from one locality consisted ofmosquito larvae. The insects eaten include the salt-marsh mosquito(_Aedes sollicitans_), for the suppression of which the State of NewJersey has gone to great expense. The nine species of shorebirds knownto eat mosquitoes are:Northern phalarope (_Lobipes lobatus_).Semipalmated sandpiper (_Ereunetes pusillus_).Wilson phalarope (_Steganopus tricolor_).Stilt sandpiper (_Micropalama himantopus_).Killdeer (_Oxyechus vociferus_).Pectoral sandpiper (_Pisobia maculata_).Semipalmated plover (_Aegialitis semipalmata_).Baird sandpiper (_Pisobia bairdi_).Least sandpiper (_Pisobia minutilla_).Cattle and other live stock also are seriously molested by mosquitoes aswell as by another set of pests, the horse-flies. Adults and larvae ofthese flies have been found in the stomachs of the dowitcher, thepectoral sandpiper, the hudsonian godwit, and the killdeer. Two speciesof shorebirds, the killdeer and upland plover, still further befriendcattle by devouring the North American fever tick.Among other fly larvae consumed are those of the crane flies(leather-jackets) devoured by the following species:Northern phalarope (_Lobipes lobatus_).Pectoral sandpiper (_Pisobia maculata_).Wilson phalarope (_Steganopus tricolor_).Baird sandpiper (_Pisobia bairdi_).Woodcock (_Philohela minor_).Upland plover (_Bartramia longicauda_).Jacksnipe (_Gallinago delicata_).Killdeer (_Oxyechus vociferus_).Crane-fly larvae are frequently seriously destructive locally in grassand wheat fields. Among their numerous bird enemies, shorebirds rankhigh.Another group of insects of which the shorebirds are very fond isgrasshoppers. Severe local infestations of grasshoppers, frequentlyinvolving the destruction of many acres of corn, cotton, and othercrops, are by no means exceptional. Aughey found twenty-three speciesof shorebirds feeding on Rocky Mountain locusts in Nebraska, some ofthem consuming large numbers, as shown below. 9 killdeer stomachs contained an average of 28 locusts each.11 semipalmated plover stomachs contained an average of 38 locusts each.16 mountain plover stomachs contained an average of 45 locusts each.11 jacksnipe stomachs contained an average of 37 locusts each.22 upland plover stomachs contained an average of 36 locusts each.10 long-billed curlew stomachs contained an average of 48 locusts each.[Illustration: TWO MEMBERS OF THE GROUP OF SHORE-BIRDSThe Killdeer Plover     The JacksnipeThese, with 28 other species, destroy enormous numbers of locusts,grasshoppers, crane-fly larvae, mosquito larvae, army-worms, cut-worms,cotton-worms, boll-weevils, curculios, wire-worms and clover-leafweevils. It is insane folly to shoot any birds that do such work! Manyspecies of the shore-birds are rapidly being exterminated.]Even under ordinary conditions grasshoppers are a staple food of manymembers of the shorebird family, and the following species are known tofeed on them:Northern phalarope (_Lobipes lobatus_).Avocet (_Recurvirostra americana_).Black-necked stilt (_Himantopus mexicanus_).Woodcock (_Philohela minor_).Jacksnipe (_Gallinago delicata_).Dowitcher (_Macrorhamphus griseus_).Robin snipe (_Tringa canutus_).White-rumped sandpiper (_Pisobia fuscicollis_).Baird sandpiper (_Pisobia bairdi_).Least sandpiper (_Pisobia minutilla_).Buff-breasted sandpiper (_Tryngites subruficollis_).Spotted sandpiper (_Actitis macularia_).Long-billed curlew (_Numenius americanus_).Black-bellied plover (_Squatarola squatarola_).Golden plover (_Charadrius dominicus_).Killdeer (_Oxyechus vociferus_).Semipalmated plover (_Aegialitis semipalmata_).Marbled godwit _(Limosa fedoa)_.Ringed plover _(Aegialitis hiaticula)_.Yellowlegs _(Totanus flavipes)_.Mountain plover _(Podasocys montanus)_.Solitary sandpiper _(Helodromas solitarius)_.Turnstone _(Arenaria interpres)_.Upland plover _(Bartramia longicauda)_.Shorebirds are fond of other insect pests of forage and grain crops,including the army worm, which is known to be eaten by the killdeer andspotted sandpiper; also cutworms, among whose enemies are the avocet,woodcock, pectoral and Baird sandpipers, upland plover, and killdeer.Two caterpillar enemies of cotton, the cotton worm and the cottoncutworm, are eaten by the upland plover and killdeer. The latter birdfeeds also on caterpillars of the genus _Phlegethontius_, whichincludes, the tobacco and tomato worms.The principal farm crops have many destructive beetle enemies also, andsome of these are eagerly eaten by shorebirds. The boll weevil andclover-leaf weevil are eaten by the upland plover and killdeer, the riceweevil by the killdeer, the cowpea weevil by the upland plover, and theclover-root curculio by the following species of shorebirds:Northern phalarope _(Lobipes lobatus)_.White-rumped sandpiper _(Pisobia fuscicollis)_.Pectoral sandpiper _(Pisobia maculata_).Upland plover _(Bartramia longicauda)_.Baird sandpiper _(Pisobia bairdi)_.Killdeer _(Oxyechus vociferus)_.The last two eat also other weevils which attack cotton, grapes andsugar beets. Bill-bugs, which often do considerable damage to corn, seemto be favorite food of some of the shorebirds. They are eaten by theWilson phalarope, avocet, black-necked stilt, pectoral sandpiper,killdeer, and upland plover. They are an important element of the latterbird's diet, and no fewer than eight species of them have been found inits food.Wireworms and their adult forms, click beetles, are devoured by thenorthern phalarope, woodcock, jacksnipe, pectoral sandpiper, killdeer,and upland plover. The last three feed also on the southern cornleaf-beetle and the last two upon the grapevine colaspis. Othershorebirds that eat leaf-beetles are the Wilson phalarope and dowitcher.Crayfishes, which are a pest in rice and corn fields in the South andwhich injure levees, are favorite food of the black-necked stilt, andseveral other shorebirds feed upon them, notably the jacksnipe, robinsnipe, spotted sandpiper, upland plover, and killdeer.Thus it is evident that shorebirds render important aid by devouring theenemies of farm crops and in other ways, and their services areappreciated by those who have observed the birds in the field. Thus W.A.Clark, of Corpus Christi, Tex., reports that upland plovers areindustrious in following the plow and in eating the grubs that destroygarden stuff, corn, and cotton crops. H.W. Tinkham, of Fall River,Mass., says of the spotted sandpiper: "Three pairs nested in a youngorchard behind my house and adjacent to my garden. I did not see themonce go to the shore for food (shore about 1,500 feet away), but I didsee them many times make faithful search of my garden for cutworms,spotted squash bugs, and green flies. Cutworms and cabbage worms weretheir special prey. After the young could fly, they still kept at workin my garden, and showed no inclination to go to the shore until aboutAugust 15th. They and a flock of quails just over the wall helped mewonderfully."In the uncultivated parts of their range also, shorebirds search out anddestroy many creatures that are detrimental to man's interest. Severalspecies prey upon the predaceous diving beetles _(Dytiscidae),_ whichare a nuisance in fish hatcheries and which destroy many insects, thenatural food of fishes. The birds now known to take these beetles are:Northern phalarope _(Lobipes lobatus)_.Dowitcher _(Macrorhamphus griseus)_.Wilson phalarope _(Steganopus tricolor)_.Robin snipe _(Tringa canutus)_.Avocet _(Recurvirostra americana)_.Pectoral sandpiper _(Pisobia maculata)_.Black-necked stilt _(Himantopus mexicanus_).Red-backed sandpiper _(Pelidna alpina sakhalina)_.Jacksnipe _(Gallinago delicata)_.Kill deer _(Oxyechus vociferus)_.Large numbers of marine worms of the genus _Nereis_, which prey uponoysters, are eaten by shorebirds. These worms are common on both theAtlantic and Gulf coasts and are eaten by shorebirds wherever theyoccur. It is not uncommon to find that from 100 to 250 of them have beeneaten at one meal. The birds known to feed upon them are:Northern phalarope _(Lobipes lobatus)_.White-rumped sandpiper _(Pisobia fuscicollis)_.Dowitcher _(Macrorhamphus griseus_).Stilt sandpiper _(Micropalama himantopus)_.Red-backed sandpiper _(Pelidna alpina sakhalina)_.Robin snipe _(Tringa canutus)_.Purple sandpiper _(Arquatella maritima_).Killdeer _(Oxyechus vociferus)_.The economic record of the shorebirds deserves nothing but praise. Thesebirds injure no crop, but on the contrary feed upon many of the worstenemies of agriculture. It is worth recalling that their diet includessuch pests as the Rocky Mountain locust and other injuriousgrasshoppers, the army worm, cutworms, cabbage worms, cotton worm,cotton cutworm, boll weevil, clover leaf weevil, clover root curculio,rice weevil, corn bill-bugs, wireworms, corn leaf-beetles, cucumberbeetles, white grubs, and such foes of stock as the Texas fever tick,horseflies, and mosquitoes. Their warfare on crayfishes must not beoverlooked, nor must we forget the more personal debt of gratitude weowe them for preying upon mosquitoes. They are the most important birdenemies of these pests known to us.Shorebirds have been hunted until only a remnant of their once vastnumbers is left. Their limited powers of reproduction, coupled with thenatural vicissitudes of the breeding period, make their increase slow,and peculiarly expose them to danger of extermination.In the way of protection a beginning has been made, and a continuousclose season until 1915 has been established for the following birds:The killdeer, in Massachusetts and Louisiana; the upland plover, inMassachusetts, and Vermont; and the piping plover in Massachusetts. But,considering the needs and value of these birds, this modicum ofprotection is small indeed.The above-named species are not the only ones that should be exemptfrom persecution, for all the shorebirds of the United States are ingreat need of better protection. They should be protected, first, tosave them from the danger of extermination, and, second, because oftheir economic importance. So great, indeed, is their economic value,that their retention on the game list and their destruction by sportsmenis a serious loss to agriculture.--(End of the circular.)       *        *        *        *        *The following appeared in the _Zoological Society Bulletin_, forJanuary, 1909, from Richard Walter Tomalin, of Sydney, N.S.W.:"In the subdistricts of Robertson and Kangaloon in the Illawarradistrict of New South Wales, what ten years ago was a waving mass ofEnglish cocksfoot and rye grass, which had been put in gradually as thedense vine scrub was felled and burnt off, is now a barren desert, andnine families out of every ten which were renting properties have beencompelled to leave the district and take up other lands. This is throughthe grubs having eaten out the grass by the roots. Ploughing proved tobe useless, as the grubs ate out the grass just the same. Whilst thererecently I was informed that it took three years from the time the grubswere first seen until to-day, to accomplish this complete devastation;.in other words, three years ago the grubs began work in the beautifulcountry of green mountains and running streams."The birds had all been ruthlessly shot and destroyed in that district,and I was amazed at the absence of bird life. The two sub-districts Ihave mentioned have an area of about thirty square miles, and form atable-land about 1200 feet above sea level."The same kind of common sense that teaches men to go in when it rains,and keep out of fiery furnaces, teaches us that as a businessproposition it is to man's interest to protect the birds. Make themplentiful and keep them so. When we strike the birds, we hurt ourselves.The protection of our insect-eating and seed-eating birds is a cashproposition,--protect or pay.Were I a farmer, no gun ever should be fired on my premises at any birdsave the English sparrow and the three bad hawks. Any man who would killmy friend Bob White I would treat as an enemy. The man who would shootand eat any of the song-birds, woodpeckers, or shorebirds that workedfor me, I would surely molest._Every farmer should post every foot of his lands, cultivated and notcultivated_. The farmer who does not do so is his own enemy; and heneeds a guardian.At this stage of wild life extermination, it is impossible to make ourbird-protection laws too strict, or too far-reaching. The remnant of ourbirds should be protected, with clubs and guns if necessary. All ourshore birds should be accorded a ten-year close season. Don't ask thegunners whether they will _agree_ to it or not. _Of course they will notagree to it,--never_! But our duty is clear,--to go ahead and _do it_!       *        *        *        *        *CHAPTER XXIVGAME AND AGRICULTURE; AND DEER AS A FOOD SUPPLYAs a state and county asset, the white-tailed deer containspossibilities that as yet seem to be ignored by the American people as awhole. It is quite time to consider that persistent, prolific andtoothsome animal.The proposition that large herds of horned game can not becomingly roamat will over farms and vineyards worth one hundred dollars per acre,affords little room for argument. Generally speaking, there is but onecountry in the world that breaks this well-nigh universal rule; and thatcountry is India. On the plains between and adjacent to the Ganges andthe Jumna, for two thousand years herds of black-buck, or sasinantelope, have roamed over cultivated fields so thickly garnished withhuman beings that to-day the rifle-shooting sportsman stands in hourlyperil of bagging a five-hundred-rupee native every time he fires at anantelope.Wherever rich agricultural lands exist, the big game must giveway,--_from those lands_. To-day the bison could not survive in Iowa,eastern Nebraska or eastern Kansas, any longer than a Shawnee Indianwould last on the Bowery. It was foredoomed that the elk, deer, bear andwild turkey should vanish from the rich farming regions of the East andthe middle West.To-day in British East Africa lions are being hunted with dogs and shotwholesale, because they are a pest to the settlers and to the survivingherds of big game. At the same time, the settlers who are striving towrest the fertile plains of B.E.A, from the domain of savagery declarethat the African buffalo, the zebra, the kongoni and the elephant arepublic nuisances that must be suppressed by the rifle.Even the most ardent friend of wild life must admit that when a settlerhas laboriously fenced his fields, and plowed and sowed, only to havehis whole crop ruined in one night by a herd of fence-breaking zebras,the event is sufficient to abrade the nerves of the party most ininterest. While I take no stock in stories of dozens of "rogue"elephants that require treatment with the rifle, and of grown men beingimperiled by savage gazelles, we admit that there are times when wildanimals can make nuisances of themselves. Let us consider that subjectnow.WILD ANIMAL NUISANCES.--Complaints have come to me, at various times, ofgreat destruction of lambs by eagles; of trout by blue herons; of crops(on Long Island) by deer; of pears destroyed by birds, and of valuablepark trees by beavers that chop down trees not wisely but too well. I donot, however, include in this category any cherries eaten by robins, ororioles, or jays; for they are of too small importance to consider inthis court.[Illustration: A FOOD SUPPLY OF WHITE-TAILED DEERThe Killing of the Does was Wrong]To meet the legitimate demands for the abatement of unbearablewild-animal nuisances, I recommend the enactment of a law similar toSection 158 of the Game laws of New York, which provides for the safeand legitimate abatement of unbearable wild creatures as follows:  Section 158. _Power to Take Birds and Quadrupeds_. In the event that  any species of birds protected by the provisions of section two  hundred and nineteen of this article, or quadrupeds protected by  law, shall at any time, in any locality, become destructive of  private or public property, the commission shall have power in its  discretion to direct any game protector, or issue a permit to any  citizen of the state, to take such species of birds or quadrupeds  and dispose of the same in such manner as the commission may  provide. Such permit shall expire within four months after the date  of issuance.This measure should be adopted by every state that is troubled by toomany, or too aggressive, wild mammals or birds.But to return to the subject of big game and farming. We do not complainof the disappearance of the bison, elk, deer and bear from the farms ofthe United States and Canada. The passing of the big game from all suchregions follows the advance of real civilization, just so surely andcertainly as night follows day.But this vast land of ours is not wholly composed of rich agriculturallands; not by any means. There are millions of acres of forest lands,good, bad and indifferent, worth from nothing per acre up to one hundreddollars or more. There are millions of acres of rocky, brush-coveredmountains and hills, wholly unsuited to agriculture, or evenhorticulture. There are other millions of acres of arid plains andarboreal deserts, on which nothing but thirst-proof animals can live andthrive. The South contains vast pine forests and cypress swamps,millions of acres of them, of which the average northerner knows lessthan nothing.We can not stop long enough to look it up, but from the green color onour national map that betokens the forest reserves, and from our ownpersonal knowledge of the deserts, swamps, barrens and rocks that wehave seen, we make the estimate that _fully one-third_ of the total areaof the United States is incapable of supporting the husbandman whodepends for his existence upon tillage of the soil. People may talk andwrite about "dry farming" all they please, but I wish to observe thatfrom Dry-Farming to Success is a long shot, with many limbs in the way.When it rains sufficiently, dry farming is a success; but otherwise itis not; and we heartily wish it were otherwise.The logical conclusion of our land that is utterly unfit for agricultureis a great area of land available for occupancy by valuable wildanimals. Every year the people of the United States are wastinguncountable millions of pounds of venison, because we are neglecting ouropportunities for producing it practically without cost. Imagine for amoment bestowing upon land owners the ability to stock with white-tailedand Indian sambar deer all the wild lands of the United States that aresuitable for those species, and permitting only bucks over one year ofage to be shot. With the does even reasonably protected, the numericalresults in annual pounds of good edible flesh fairly challenges theimagination.About six years ago, Mr. C.C. Worthington's deer, in his fenced park, atShawnee-on-Delaware, Pennsylvania, became so numerous and so burdensomethat he opened his fences and permitted about one thousand head to gofree.We are losing each year a very large and valuable asset in theintangible form of a million hardy deer that we might have raised butdid not! Our vast domains of wooded mountains, hills and valleys liepractically untenanted by big game, save in a few exceptional spots. Welose because we are lawless. We lose because we are too improvident toconserve large forms of wild life unless we are compelled to do so bythe stern edict of the law! The law-breakers, the game-hogs, theconscienceless doe-and-fawn slayers are everywhere! Ten per cent of allthe grown men now in the United States are to-day poachers, thieves andlaw-breakers, or else they are liable to become so to-morrow. If youdoubt it, try risking your new umbrella unprotected in the next mixedcompany of one hundred men that you encounter, in such a situation thatit will be easy to "get away" with it.We could raise two million deer each year on our empty wild lands; butwithout fences it would take half a million real game-wardens, on dutyfrom dawn until dark, to protect them from destructive slaughter. Atpresent our land of liberty contains only 9,354 game wardens.[J] Thestates that contain the greatest areas of wild lands naturally lack inpopulation and in tax funds, and not one such state can afford to putinto the field even half enough salaried game wardens to really protecther game from surreptitious slaughter. The surplus of "personal liberty"in this liberty-cursed land is a curse to the big game. The averagefrontiersman never will admit the divine right of kings, but he doesardently believe in the divine right of settlers,--to reach out and takeany of the products of Nature that they happen to fancy.[Footnote J: Of this force, there are only 1,200 salaried wardens. Themost of those who serve without salaries naturally render but littlecontinuous or regular service.]WILD MEAT AS A FOOD SUPPLY.--We hear much these days about the high costof living, but thus far we have made no move to mend the situation. Withcoal going straight up to ten dollars per ton, beef going up to fifteendollars per hundred on the hoof and wheat and hay going-up--heaven aloneknows where, it is time for all Americans who are not rich to arouse andtake thought for the morrow. _What are we going to do about it_? Thetariff on the coarser necessities of life is now booked to come down;but what about the fresh meat supply?I desire to point out that between Bangor and San Diego and from KeyWest to Bellingham, our country contains millions of acres of wild,practically uninhabited forests, rough foot-hills, bad-lands andmountains that could produce two million deer each year, withoutdeducting 50,000 a year from the wealth of the country. I grant that inthe total number of deer that would be necessary to produce two milliondeer per annum, the farms situated on the edges of forests, and actuallywithin the forests, would suffer somewhat from the depredations of thosedeer. As I will presently show by documentary records, every one ofthose individual damages that exceeds two dollars in value could becompensated in cash, and afterward leave on the credit side of the deeraccount an enormous annual balance.Stop for a moment, you enterprising and restless men and women whotravel all over the United States, and think of the illimitable miles ofunbroken forest that you have looked upon from your Pullman windows inthe East, in the South, in the West and in southern Canada. Recall thewooded mountains of the Appalachian system, the White Mountain region,the pine forests of the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf States, the forestsof Tennessee, Arkansas and southern Missouri; of northern Minnesota, andevery state of the Rocky Mountain region. Then, think of the silent anduntouched forests of the Pacific Coast and tell me whether you thinkfive million deer scattered through all those forests would make anyvisible impression upon them. That would be only about twenty-five timesas many as are there now! I think the forests would not be overpopulated; and they would produce _two million killable deer each year_!Last year, 11,000 deer were forced down out of their hiding places inthe Rocky Mountains, and were killed in Montana. Even the natives hadnot dreamed there were so many available; and they were slaughtered notwisely but too ill. It is not right that six members of one familyshould "hog" twelve deer in one season. At present no deer supply canstand such slaughter.Assuming that the people of the United States _could_ be educated intothe idea of so conserving deer that they could draw two million head peryear from the general stock, what would it be worth?It is not very difficult to estimate the value of a deer, when the wholeanimal can be utilized. In various portions of the United States, deervary in size, but I shall take all this into account, and try to strikea fair average. In some sections, where deer are large and heavy, afull-grown buck is easily worth twenty-five dollars. Let him who doubtsit, try to replace those generous pounds of flesh with purchased beefand mutton and veal, and see how far twenty-five dollars will go towardit. Every man who is a householder knows full well how little meat onedollar will buy at this time.I think that throughout the United States as a whole every full-growndeer, male or female contains on an average ten dollars worth of goodmeat. I know of one large preserve which annually sells its surplus ofdeer at that price, wholesale, to dealers; and in New York City(doubtless in many other cities, also) venison often has sold in themarket at one dollar per pound!Two million deer at 10 each mean 20,000,000. The licenses for thekilling of two million deer should cost one million men one dollar each;and that would pay 1,666 new game wardens each fifty dollars per month,all the year round. The damages that would need to be paid to farmers,on account of crops injured by deer, would be so small that each countycould take care of its own cases, from its own treasury, as is done inthe State of Vermont.There are certain essentials to the realization of a dream of twomillion deer per year that are absolutely required. They are neitherobscure nor impossible.Each state and each county proposing to stock its vacant woods with deermust resolutely educate its own people in the necessity of playing fairabout the killing of deer, and giving every man and every deer a squaredeal. This is _not_ impossible! Not as a general thing, even though itmay be so in some specially lawless communities. If the _leading men_ ofthe state and the county will take this matter seriously in hand, it canbe done in two years' time. The American people are not insensible toappeals to reason, when those appeals are made by their own "homefolks." The governors, senators, assemblymen, judges, mayors andjustices of the peace could, _if they would_, make a campaign ofeducation and appeal that would result in the creation of an immensevolume of free wild food in every state that possesses wild lands.When the shoe of Necessity pinches the People hard enough, remember thepossibilities in deer.[Illustration: WHITE-TAILED DEERIf Honestly and Intelligently Conserved, this Species could be made toProduce on our Wild Lands Two Million Deer per annum, as a new Food SupplyFrom the "American Natural History"]The best wild animal to furnish a serious food supply is thewhite-tailed deer. This is because of its persistence and fertility. Theelk is too large for general use. An elk carcass can not be carried on ahorse; it is impossible to get a sled or a wagon to where it lies; andso, fully half of it usually is wasted! The mule deer is good for theRocky Mountains, and can live where the white-tail can not; but it is_too easy to shoot_! The Columbian black-tail is the natural species forthe forests of the Pacific states; but it is a trifle small in size.THE EXAMPLE OF VERMONT.--In order to show that all the above is notbased on empty theory,--regarding the stocking of forests with deer,their wonderful powers of increase, and the practical handling of thedamage question,--let us take the experience and the fine example ofVermont.In April, 1875, a few sportsmen of Rutland, of whom the late Henry W.Cheney was one, procured in the Adirondacks thirteen white-tailed deer,six bucks and seven does. These were liberated in a forest six milesfrom Rutland, and beyond being protected from slaughter, they were leftto shift for themselves. They increased, slowly at first, then rapidly,and by 1897, they had become so numerous that it seemed right to have ashort annual open season, and kill a few. From first to last, many ofthose deer have been killed contrary to law. In 1904-5, it was knownthat 294 head were destroyed in that way; and undoubtedly there wereothers that were not reported.

Clearly, it is more just that counties should settlethese damages than that they should be paid from the state treasury,because the counties paying damages have large compensation in the valueof the deer killed each year. The hunting appears to be open to allpersons who hold licenses from the state.In order that the public at large may know the cost of the Vermontsystem, I offer the following digest compiled from the last biennialreport of the State Fish and Game Commissioner:DAMAGES PAID FOR DEER DEPREDATIONS IN VERMONT DURING                TWO YEARSTotal damages paid from June 8, 1908, to June 22, 1910    4,865.98Total number of claims paid                                     311Total number of claims under 5                                  80Number between 5 and 10, inclusive                            102Number over 25 and under 51                                    23Number between 50 and 100                                      11Number in excess of 100                                          4Number in excess of 200                                          1Largest claim paid                                          326.50VALUE OF WHITE-TAILED DEER.--Having noted the fact that in two years(1908-9), the people of Vermont paid out 4,865 in compensation fordamages inflicted by deer, it is of interest to determine whether thatmoney was wisely expended. In other words, did it pay?We have seen that in the years 1908 and 9, the people of Vermont killed,legally and illegally, and converted to use, 7,186 deer. This does notinclude the deer killed by dogs and by accidents.Regarding the value of a full-grown deer, it must be remembered thatmuch depends upon the locality of the carcass. In New York or Pittsburgor Chicago, a whole deer is worth, at wholesale, at least twenty-fivedollars. In Vermont, where deer are plentiful, they are worth a lesssum. I think that fifteen dollars would be a fair figure,--at least lowenough!Even when computed at fifteen dollars per carcass, those deer were worthto the people of Vermont 107,790. It would seem, therefore, that thesoundness of Vermont's policy leaves no room for argument; and we hopethat other states, and also private individuals, will profit byVermont's very successful experiment in bringing back the deer to herforests, and in increasing the food supply of her people.KILLING FEMALE DEER.--To say one word on this subject which might by anypossibility be construed as favoring it, is like juggling with a lightedtorch over a barrel of gunpowder. Already, in Pennsylvania at least onegentleman has appeared anxious to represent me as favoring the killingof does, which in
