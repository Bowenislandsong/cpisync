ohalf whisper:"I don't know--what?"Stoddard's face was scarcely less animated as he searched hastily in thepigeon-holes of his desk. The patent might have a company to manage itsaffairs, but the mine on Big Unaka was sacred to these two, in whom theimmortal urchin sufficiently survived to make mine-hunting andexploiting delectable employment."Why, Uncle Pros, it isn't silver at all. It's--" Gray looked up andcaught the woeful drop of the face before him, and hastened on to add,"It's better than silver--it's nickel. The price of silver fluctuates;but the world supply of nickel is limited, and nickel's a sure thing."Pros Passmore leaned back in his chair, digesting this new bit ofinformation luxuriously."Nickel," he said reflectively. And again he repeated the word tohimself. "Nickel. Well, I don't know but what that's finer. Leastways,it's likelier. To say a silver mine, always seemed just like takingmoney out of the ground; but then, nickels are money too--and enough of'em is all a body needs.""These people say the ore is exceptionally fine." Stoddard had got outthe letter now and was glancing over it. "They're sending down anexpert, and you and I will go up with him as soon as he gets here. Thereare likely to be other valuable minerals as by-products in a nickelmine. And we want to build an ideal mining village, as well as modelcotton mills. Oh, we've got the work cut out for us and laid right tohand! If we don't do our little share toward solving some problems, itwill be strange.""Cur'us how things turns out in this world," the old man ruminated."Ever sence I was a little chap settin' on my granddaddy's knees by thehearth--big hickory fire a-roarin' up the chimbly, wind a-goin' 'whooh!'overhead, an' me with my eyes like saucers a-listenin' to his tales ofthe silver mine that the Injuns had--ever sence that time I've huntedthat thar mine." He laughed chucklingly, deep in his throat. "Tharwasn't a wild-catter that could have a hideout safe from me. They justhad to trust me. I crawled into every hole. I came mighty near seein'the end of every cave--but one. And that cave was the one whar my Mammykept her milk and butter--the springhouse whar they put you in prison.Somehow, I never did think about goin' to the end of that. Looked likeit was too near home to have a silver mine in it; and thar the stuff layand waited for the day when I should take a notion to find a pretty rockfor Deanie, and crawl back in thar and keep a crawlin', till I just fellover it, all croppin' out in the biggest kind of vein."Gray had heard Uncle Pros tell the story many times, but it had aperennial charm."Then I lost six months--plumb lost 'em, you know. And time I come tomyself, Johnnie an' me was a-huntin' for you. And there we found youshut in that thar same cave; and I was so tuck up with that matter thatI never once thought, till I got you home, to wonder did Buckheath andthe rest of 'em know that they'd penned you in the silver mine. I ain'tnever asked you, but you'd have knowed if they had.""I should have known anything that Rudd Dawson or Groner or Ventersknew," Gray said, "but I'm not sure about Buckheath or Himes. However,Himes is dead, and Buckheath--I don't suppose anybody in Cottonvillewill ever see him again."Pros's face changed instantly. He leaned abruptly forward and laid ahand on the other's knee."That's exactly what I came down here to speak with you about, Gray," hesaid. "They've fetched Shade Buckheath in--now, what do you make outof that?"Stoddard shoved the letter from the Eastern mining man back in itspigeon-hole."Well," he said slowly, "I didn't expect that. I thought of course Shadewas safely out of the country. I--Passmore, I'm sorry they've got him."After a little silence he spoke again. "What do I make of it? Why, thatthere are some folks up on Big Unaka who need pretty badly to appear asvery law-abiding citizens. I'll wager anything that Groner and RuddDawson brought Shade in."Uncle Pros nodded seriously. "Them's the very fellers," he said. "Reckonthey've talked pretty free to you. I never axed ye, Gray--how did theytreat ye?""Dawson was the best friend I had," Stoddard returned promptly. "When Igot to the big turn on Sultan--coming home that Friday morning--Buckheath met me, and asked me to go down to Burnt Cabin andhelp him with a man that had fallen and hurt himself on the rocks.Dawson told me afterward that he and Jesse Groner were posted at theroadside to stop me and hem me in before I got to the bluff. I'vedescribed to you how Buckheath tried to back Sultan over the edge, and Igot off on the side where the two were, not noticing them till they tiedme hand and foot. They almost came to a clinch with Buckheath then andthere. You ought to have heard Groner swear! It was like prayinggone wrong.""Uh-huh," agreed Pros, "Jess is a terrible wicked man--in speechthat-a-way--but he's good-hearted.""That first scrimmage showed me just what the men were after," Stoddardsaid. "Buckheath plainly wanted me put out of the way; but the othershad some vague idea of holding me for a ransom and getting money out ofthe Hardwicks. Dawson complained always that he thought the mills owedhim money. He said they must have sold his girl's body for as much as ahundred dollars, and he felt that he'd been cheated. Oh, it was allcrazy stuff! But he and the others had justified themselves; and theyhad no notion of standing for what Buckheath was after. I was one of thecotton-mill men to them; they had no personal malice."Through the long evenings when Groner or Dawson or Will Venters wasguarding me--or maybe all three of them--we used to talk; and itsurprised me to find how simple and childish those fellows were. Theywere as kind to me as though I had been a brother, and treated mecourteously always."Little by little, I got at the whole thing from them. It seems thatBuckheath took advantage of the feeling there was in the mountainsagainst the mill men on account of the hospital and some other matters.He went up there and interviewed anybody that he thought might join himin a vendetta. I imagine he found plenty of them that were ready to talkand some that were willing to do; but it chanced that Dawson and JesseGroner were coming down to Cottonville that morning I passed Buckheathat the Hardwick gate, and he must have cut across the turn and followedme, intending to pick a quarrel. Then he met Dawson and Groner andframed up this other plan with their assistance."Uncle Pros, I want you to help me out. If Buckheath has to stand trial,how are we--any of us--going to testify without making it hard on theDawson crowd? I expect to live here the rest of my days. Here's thismine of ours. And right here I mean to build a big mill and work out myplans. I think you know that I hope to marry a mountain wife, and Ican't afford to quarrel with those folks."Uncle Pros's chin dropped to his breast, his eyes half closed as he satthinking intently."Well," he said finally, "they won't have nothing worse thanmanslaughter against Shade. It can't be proved that he intended to shootPap--'cause he didn't. If he was shootin' after us--there's the thing wedon't want to bring up. You was down in the bottom of the cyar, an' Ihad my back to him, and so did Johnnie, and we don't know anything aboutwhat was done--ain't that so? As for you, you've already told Mr.Hardwick and the others that you was taken prisoner and detained byparties unknown. Johnnie an' me was gettin' you out of the springhouseand away in the machine. Then Gid and Shade comes up, and thinkin' we'rethe other crowd stealin' the machine--they try to catch us and turnloose at us--that makes a pretty good story, don't it?""It does if Dawson and Groner and Venters agree to it," Stoddardlaughed. "But somebody will have to communicate with them before theytell another one--or several others.""I'll see to that, Gray," Pros said, rising and preparing to go. "Boy,"he looked down fondly at the younger man, and set a brown right hand onhis shoulder, "you never done a wiser thing nor a kinder in your life,than when you forgave your enemies that time, I'll bet you could ridethe Unakas from end to end, the balance o' your days, the safest manthat ever travelled their trails.""Talking silver mine?" inquired MacPherson, putting his quizzical facein at the door."No," returned Stoddard. "We were just mentioning my pestilentcotton-mill projects. By this time next year, you and Hardwick will bewanting to have me abated as a nuisance.""No, no," remonstrated MacPherson, coming in and leaning withaffectionate familiarity on the younger man's chair. "There's nopestilence in you, Gray. You couldn't be a nuisance if you tried. Peoplewho will work out their theories stand to do good in the world; it'sonly the fellows who are content with bellowing them out that Iobject to.""Better be careful!" laughed Stoddard. "We'll make you vice-president ofthe company.""Is that an offer?" countered MacPherson swiftly. "I've got a bit ofmoney to invest in this county; and Hardwick has ever a newbrother-in-law or such that looks longingly at my shoes.""You'd furnish the conservative element, surely," debated Stoddard."I'd keep you from bankruptcy," grunted the Scotchman, as he laid asmall book on Gray's desk. "I doubt not Providence demands it of me."Evening was closing in with a greenish-yellow sunset, and a big fullmoon pushing up to whiten the sky above it. It was late March now, andthe air was full of vernal promise. Johnnie stepped out on the porch andglanced toward the west. She was expecting Gray that evening. Wouldthere be time before he came, she wondered, for a little errand shewanted to do? Turning back into the hall, she caught a jacket from thehook where it hung and hurried down to the gate, settling her arms inthe sleeves as she ran. There would be time if she went fast. She wishedto get the little packet into which she had made Gray's letters monthsago, dreading to look even at the folded outsides of them, tucking themaway on the high shelf of her dress-closet at the Pap Himesboarding-house, and trying to forget them. Nobody would know where tolook but herself. She got permission from Mavity to go upstairs. Oncethere, the letters made their own plea; and alone in the little roomthat was lately her own, she opened the packet, carrying the contents tothe fading light and glancing over sheet after sheet. She knew them allby heart. How often she had stood at that very window devouring thesesame words, not realizing then, as she did now, what deep meaning was ineach phrase, how the feeling expressed increased from the first to thelast. Across the ravine, one of the loom fixers found the evening warmenough to sit on the porch playing his guitar. The sound of the twangingstrings, and the appealing vibration of his young voice in a plaintiveminor air, came over to her. She gathered the sheets together andpressed them to her face as though they were flowers, or the hands oflittle children."I've got to tell him--to-night," she whispered to herself, in thedusky, small, dismantled room. "I've got to get him to see it as I do. Imust make myself worthy of him before I let him take me for his own."She thrust the letters into the breast-pocket of her coat and randownstairs. Mavity Bence stood in the hall, plainly awaiting her."Honey," she began fondly, "I've been putting away Pap's thingsto-day--jest like you oncet found me putting away Lou's. I came on thishere." And then Johnnie noticed a folded bandanna in her hands."You-all asked me to let ye go through and find that nickel ore, and yebrung it out in a pasteboard box; but this here is what it was in on theday your Uncle Pros fetched hit here, and I thought maybe you'd take ainterest in having the handkercher that your fortune come down themountains in.""Yes, indeed, Aunt Mavity," said Johnnie, taking the bandanna into herown hands."Pap, he's gone," the poor woman went on tremulously, "an' the evil whathe done--or wanted to do--is a thing that I reckon you can afford toforget. You're a mighty happy woman, Johnnie Consadine; the Lord knowsyou deserve to be."She stood looking after the girl as she went out into the twilit street.Johnnie was dressed as she chose now, not as she must, and her clothingshowed itself to be of the best. Anything that might be had in Wautagawas within her means; and the tall, graceful figure passing so quietlydown the street would never have been taken for other than a member ofwhat we are learning to call the "leisure class." When the shadows atthe end of the block swallowed her up, Mavity turned, wiping her eyes,and addressed herself to her tasks."I reckon Lou would 'a' been just like that if she'd 'a' lived," shesaid to Mandy Meacham, with the tender fatuity of mothers. "Johnnieseems like a daughter to me--an' I know in my soul no daughter could bekinder. Look at her makin' me keep every cent Pap had in the bank, whenLaurelly could have claimed it all and kep' it.""Yes, an' addin' somethin' to it," put in Mandy. "I do love 'emboth--Johnnie an' Deanie. Ef I ever was so fortunate as to get a man andbe wedded and have chaps o' my own, I know mighty well and good Icouldn't love any one of 'em any better than I do Deanie. An' yetJohnnie's quare. I always will say that Johnnie Consadine is quare. Whatin the nation does she want to go chasin' off to Yurrup for, when she'sgot everything that heart could desire or mind think of right here inCottonville?"That same question was being put even more searchingly to Johnnie bysomebody else at the instant when Mandy enunciated it. She had foundGray waiting for her at the gate of her home."Let's walk here a little while before we go in," he suggested. "I wentup to the house and found you were out. The air is delightful, and I'vegot something I want to say to you."He had put his arm under hers, and they strolled together down the longwalk that led to the front of the lawn. The evening air was pure andkeen, tingling with the breath of the wakening season."Sweetheart," Gray broke out suddenly, "I've been thinking day and nightsince we last talked together about this year abroad that you'replanning. I certainly don't want to put my preferences before yours. Ionly want to be very sure that I know what your real preferences are,"and he turned and searched her face with a pair of ardent eyes."I think I ought to go," the girl said in a very low voice, her headdrooped, her own eyes bent toward the path at her feet."Why?" whispered her lover."I--oh, Gray--you know. If we should ever be married--well, then," inanswer to a swift, impatient exclamation, "when we are married, if youshould show that you were ashamed of me--I think it would kill me. No,don't say there's not any danger. You might have plenty of reason. AndI--I want to be safe, Gray--safe, if I can."Gray regarded the beautiful, anxious face long and thoughtfully. Yes, ofcourse it was possible for her to feel that way. Assurance was so deepand perfect in his own heart, that he had not reflected what it mightlack in hers."Dear girl," he said, pausing and making her look at him, "how littleyou do know of me, after all! Do I care so much for what people say?Aren't you always having to reprove me because I so persistently likewhat I like, without reference to the opinions of the world? Besides,you're a beauty," with tender brusqueness, "and a charmer that stealsthe hearts of men. If you don't know all this, it isn't from lack oftelling. Moreover, I can keep on informing you. A year of Europeantravel could not make you any more beautiful, Johnnie--or sweeter. Youmay not believe me, but there's little the 'European capitals' could addto your native bearing--you must have learned that simple dignity fromthese mountains of yours. Of course, if you wanted to go for pleasure--"His head a little on one side, he regarded her with a tender,half-quizzical smile, hoping he had sounded the note that would bringhim swift surrender."It isn't altogether for myself--there are the others," Johnnie toldhim, lifting honest eyes to his in the dim moonlight. "They're all I hadin the world, Gray, till you came into my life, and I must keep my own.I belong to a people who never give up anything they love."Stoddard dropped an arm about his beloved, and turned her that she mightface the windows of the house behind them, bending to set his cheekagainst hers and direct her gaze."Look there," he whispered, laughingly.She looked and saw her mother, clad in such wear as Laurella's tastecould select and Laurella's beauty make effective. The slight, darklittle woman was coming in from the dining room with her children allabout her, a noble group."Your mother is much more the fine lady than you'll ever be, JohnnieStoddard," Gray said, giving her the name that always brought the bloodto the girl's cheek and made her dumb before him. "You know your UnclePros and I are warmly attached to each other."What is it you'd be waiting for, girl? Why, Johnnie, a man has just solong to live on this earth, and the years in which he has loved are theonly years that count--would you be throwing one of these away? Ayear--twelve months--three hundred and sixty-five days--cast to thevoid. You reckless creature!"He cupped his hands about her beautiful, fair face and lifted it,studying it."Johnnie--Johnnie--Johnnie Stoddard; the one woman out of all the worldfor me," he murmured, his deep voice dropping to a wooing cadence. "Icouldn't love you better--I shall never love you less. Don't let usfoolishly throw away a year out of the days which will be vouchsafed ustogether. Don't do it, darling--it's folly."Hard-pressed, Johnnie made only a sort of inarticulate response."Come, love, sit a moment with me, here," pleaded Gray, indicating asmall bench hidden among the evergreens and shrubs at the end of thepath. "Sit down, and let's reason this thing out.""Reasoning with you," began Johnnie, helplessly, "isn't--it isn'treasonable!""It is," he told her, in that deep, masterful tone which, like a truewoman, she both loved and dreaded. "It's the height of reasonableness.Why, dear, the great primal reason of all things speaks through me. AndI won't let you throw away a year of our love. Johnnie, it isn't asthough we'd been neighbours, and grown up side by side. I came from theends of the earth to find you, darling--and I knew my own as soon asI saw you."He put out his arms and gathered her into a close embrace.For a space they rested so, murmuring question and reply, checked oranswered by swift, sweet kisses."The first time I ever saw you, love....""Oh, in thoze dusty old shoes and a sunbonnet! Could you love me then,Gray?""The same as at this moment, sweetheart. Shoes and sunbonnets--I'mashamed of you now, Johnnie, in earnest. What do such things matter?""And that morning on the mountain, when we got the moccasin flowers,"the girl's voice took up the theme. "I--it was sweet to be with you--andbitter, too. I could not dream then that you were for me. Andafterward--the long, black, dreadful time when you seemed so utterlylost to me--"At the mention of those months, Gray stopped her words with a kiss."Mine," he whispered with his lips against hers, "Out of all theworld--mine."THE ENDEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Power and the Glory, by Grace MacGowan Cooke*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE POWER AND THE GLORY ******** This file should be named 10068.txt or 10068.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/0/6/10068/Produced by Juliet Sutherland, Sjaani and PG Distributed ProofreadersUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

BY                               ANNIE BESANT                                   1885.                         AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES.I am so often asked for references to some pamphlet or journal in whichmay be found some outline of my life, and the enquiries are so oftencouched in terms of such real kindness, that I have resolved to pen a fewbrief autobiographical sketches, which may avail to satisfy friendlyquestioners, and to serve, in some measure, as defence against unfairattack.I.On October 1st, 1847, I made my appearance in this "vale of tears","little Pheasantina", as I was irreverently called by a giddy aunt, a petsister of my mother's. Just at that time my father and mother werestaying within the boundaries of the City of London, so that I was bornwell "within the sound of Bow bells".Though born in London, however, full three quarters of my blood areIrish. My dear mother was a Morris--the spelling of the name having beenchanged from Maurice some five generations back--and I have often heardher tell a quaint story, illustrative of that family pride which is socommon a feature of a decayed Irish family. She was one of a largefamily, and her father and mother, gay, handsome, and extravagant, hadwasted merrily what remained to them of patrimony. I can remember herfather well, for I was fourteen years of age when he died. A bent oldman, with hair like driven snow, splendidly handsome in his old age,hot-tempered to passion at the lightest provocation, loving and wrath inquick succession. As the family grew larger and the moans grew smaller,many a pinch came on the household, and the parents were glad to acceptthe offer of a relative to take charge of Emily, the second daughter. Avery proud old lady was this maiden aunt, and over the mantel-piece ofher drawing-room ever hung a great diagram, a family tree, which mightilyimpressed the warm imagination of the delicate child she had taken incharge. It was a lengthy and well-grown family tree, tracing back theMorris family to the days of Charlemagne, and branching out from a stockof "the seven kings of France". Was there ever yet a decayed. Irishfamily that did not trace itself back to some "kings"? and these"Milesian kings"--who had been expelled from France, doubtless for goodreasons, and who had sailed across the sea and landed in fair Erin, andthere had settled and robbed and fought--did more good 800 years aftertheir death than they did, I expect, during their ill-spent lives, ifthey proved a source of gentle harmless pride to the old maiden lady whoadmired their names over her mantel-piece in the earlier half of thepresent century. And, indeed, they acted as a kind of moral thermometer,in a fashion that would much have astonished their ill-doing andbarbarous selves. For my mother has told me how when she would commitsome piece of childish naughtiness, her aunt would say, looking gravelyover her spectacles at the small culprit: "Emily, your conduct isunworthy of the descendant of the seven kings of France." And Emily, withher sweet grey Irish eyes, and her curling masses of raven-black hair,would cry in penitent shame over her unworthiness, with some vague ideathat those royal, and to her very real ancestors, would despise her smallsweet rosebud self, as wholly unworthy of their disreputable majesties.But that same maiden aunt trained the child right well, and I keep evergrateful memory of her, though I never knew her, for her share in formingthe tenderest, sweetest, proudest, purest, noblest woman I have everknown. I have never met a woman more selflessly devoted to those sheloved, more passionately contemptuous of all that was mean or base, morekeenly sensitive on every question of honor, more iron in will, moresweet in tenderness, than the mother who made my girlhood sunny asdreamland, who guarded me until my marriage from every touch of pain thatshe could ward off, or could bear for me, who suffered more in everytrouble that touched me in later life than I did myself, and who died inthe little house I had taken for our new home in Norwood, worn out ereold age touched her, by sorrow, poverty and pain, in May, 1874.Of my father my memory is less vivid, for he died when I was but fiveyears old. He was of mixed race, English on his father's side, Irish onhis mother's, and was born in Galway, and educated in Ireland; he tookhis degree at Dublin University, and walked the hospitals as a medicalstudent. But after he had qualified as a medical man a good appointmentwas offered him by a relative in the City of London, and he neverpractised regularly as a doctor.In the City his prospects were naturally promising; the elder branch ofthe Wood Family, to which he belonged, had for many generations beensettled in Devonshire, farming their own land. When the eldest sonWilliam, my father, came of age, he joined with his father to cut off theentail, and the old acres were sold. Meanwhile members of other brancheshad entered commercial life, and had therein prospered exceedingly. Oneof them had become Lord Mayor of London, had vigorously supported theunhappy Queen Caroline, had paid the debts of the Duke of Kent, in orderthat that reputable individual might return to England with his Duchess,so that the future heir to the throne might be born on English soil; hehad been rewarded with a baronetcy as a cheap method of paying hisservices. Another, my father's first cousin once removed, a youngbarrister, had successfully pleaded a suit in which was concerned thehuge fortune of a miserly relative, and had thus laid the foundations ofa great success; he won for himself a vice-chancellorship and aknighthood, and then the Lord Chancellorship of England, with the baronyof Hatherley. A third, a brother of the last, Western Wood, was doinggood service in the House of Commons. A fourth, a cousin of the last two,had thrown himself with such spirit and energy into mining work, that hehad accumulated a fortune. In fact all the scattered branches had madetheir several ways in the world, save that elder one to which my fatherbelonged. That had vegetated on down in the country, and had grown poorerwhile the others grew richer. My father's brothers had somewhat of afight for life. One has prospered and is comfortable and well-to-do. Theother led for years a rough and wandering life, and "came to grief"generally. Some years ago I heard of him as a store-keeper in Portsmouthdock-yard, occasionally boasting in feeble fashion that his cousin wasLord Chancellor of England, and not many months since I heard from him inSouth Africa, where he has secured some appointment in the CommissariatDepartment, not, I fear, of a very lucrative character.Let us come back to Pheasantina, who, I am told, was a delicate andsomewhat fractious infant, giving to both father and mother considerablecause for anxiety. Her first attempts at rising in the world wereattended with disaster, for as she was lying in a cradle, with carvediron canopy, and was for a moment left by her nurse in full faith thatshe could not rise from the recumbent position, Miss Pheasantinadetermined to show that she was capable of unexpected independence, andmade a vigorous struggle to assume that upright position which is theproud prerogative of man. In another moment the recumbent position wasre-assumed, and the nurse returning found the baby's face covered withblood, streaming from a severe wound on the forehead, the iron fretworkhaving proved harder than the baby's head. The scar remains down to thepresent time, and gives me the valuable peculiarity of only wrinkling upone side of my forehead when I raise my eyebrows, a feat that I defy anyof my readers to emulate. The heavy cut has, I suppose, so injured themuscles in that spot that they have lost the normal power of contraction.My earliest personal recollections are of a house and garden that welived in when I was three and four years of age, situated in Grove Road,St. John's Wood. I can remember my mother hovering round the dinner-tableto see that all was bright for the home-coming husband; my brother--twoyears older than myself--and I watching "for papa"; the loving welcome,the game of romps that always preceded the dinner of the elder folks. Ican remember on the first of October, 1851, jumping up in my little cot,and shouting out triumphantly: "Papa! mamma! I am four years old!" andthe grave demand of my brother, conscious of superior age, atdinner-time: "May not Annie have a knife to-day, as she is four yearsold?"It was a sore grievance during that same year 1851, that I was not judgedold enough to go to the Great Exhibition, and I have a faint memory of mybrother consolingly bringing me home one of those folding pictured stripsthat are sold in the streets, on which were imaged glories that I longedonly the more to see. Far-away, dusky, trivial memories, these. What apity it is that a baby cannot notice, cannot observe, cannot remember,and so throw light on the fashion of the dawning of the external world onthe human consciousness. If only we could remember how things looked whenthey were first imaged on the retinae; what we felt when first we becameconscious of the outer world; what the feeling was as faces of father andmother grew out of the surrounding chaos and became familiar things,greeted with a smile, lost with a cry; if only memory would not become amist when in later years we strive to throw our glances backward into thedarkness of our infancy, what lessons we might learn to help ourstumbling psychology, how many questions might be solved whose answers weare groping for in vain.II.The next scene that stands out clearly against the background of the pastis that of my father's death-bed. The events which led to his death Iknow from my dear mother. He had never lost his fondness for theprofession for which he had been trained, and having many medicalfriends, he would now and then accompany them on their hospital rounds,or share with them the labors of the dissecting room. It chanced thatduring the dissection of the body of a person who had died of rapidconsumption, my father cut his finger against the edge of thebreast-bone. The cut did not heal easily, and the finger became swollenand inflamed. "I would have that finger off, Wood, if I were you," saidone of the surgeons, a day or two afterwards, on seeing the state of thewound. But the others laughed at the suggestion, and my father, at firstinclined to submit to the amputation, was persuaded to "leave Naturealone".About the middle of August, 1852, he got wet through, riding on the topof an omnibus, and the wetting resulted in a severe cold, which "settledon his chest". One of the most eminent doctors of the day, as able as hewas rough in manner, was called to see him. He examined him carefully,sounded his lungs, and left the room followed by my mother. "Well?" sheasked, scarcely anxious as to the answer, save as it might worry herhusband to be kept idly at home. "You must keep up his spirits", was thethoughtless answer. "He is in a galloping consumption; you will not havehim with you six weeks longer." The wife staggered back, and fell like astone on the floor. But love triumphed over agony, and half an hour latershe was again at her husband's side, never to leave it again for tenminutes at a time, night or day, till he was lying with closed eyesasleep in death.I was lifted on to the bed to "say good-bye to dear Papa" on the daybefore his death, and I remember being frightened at his eyes whichlooked so large, and his voice which sounded so strange, as he made mepromise always to be "a very good girl to darling Mamma, as Papa wasgoing right away". I remember insisting that "Papa should kiss Cherry", adoll given me on my birthday, three days before, by his direction, andbeing removed, crying and struggling, from the room. He died on thefollowing day, October 5th, and I do not think that my elder brother andI--who were staying at our maternal grandfather's--went to the houseagain until the day of the funeral. With the death, my mother broke down,and when all was over they carried her senseless from the room. Iremember hearing afterwards how, when she recovered her senses, shepassionately insisted on being left alone, and locked herself into herroom for the night; and how on the following morning her mother, at lastpersuading her to open the door, started back at the face she saw withthe cry: "Good God! Emily! your hair is white!" It was even so; her hair,black, glossy and abundant, which, contrasting with her large grey eyes,had made her face so strangely attractive, had turned grey in that nightof agony, and to me my mother's face is ever framed in exquisite silverbands of hair as white as the driven unsullied snow.I have heard that the love between my father and mother was a verybeautiful thing, and it most certainly stamped her character for life. Hewas keenly intellectual, and splendidly educated; a mathematician and agood classical scholar, thoroughly master of French, German, Italian,Spanish, and Portuguese, with a smattering of Hebrew and Gaelic, thetreasures of ancient and of modern literature were his daily householddelight. Nothing pleased him so well as to sit with his wife, readingaloud to her while she worked; now translating from some foreign poet,now rolling forth melodiously the exquisite cadences of Queen Mab.Student of philosophy as he was, he was deeply and steadily sceptical;and a very religious relative has told me that he often drove her fromthe room by his light playful mockery of the tenets of the Christianfaith. His mother and sister were strict Roman Catholics, and near theend forced a priest into his room, but the priest was promptly ejected bythe wrath of the dying man, and by the almost fierce resolve of the wifethat no messenger of the creed he detested should trouble her darling atthe last.This scepticism of his was not wholly shared by his wife, who held to thenotion that women should be "religious," while men might philosophise asthey would; but it so deeply influenced her own intellectual life thatshe utterly rejected the most irrational dogmas of Christianity, such aseternal punishment, the vicarious atonement of Christ, the doctrine thatfaith is necessary to salvation, the equality of Christ with God, theinfallibility of the Bible; she made morality of life, not orthodoxy ofbelief, her measure of "religion"; she was "a Christian", in her own viewof the matter, but it was a Christian of the school of Jowett, ofColenso, and of Stanley. The latter writer had for her, in after years,the very strongest fascination, and I am not sure that his "variegateduse of words", so fiercely condemned by Dr. Pusey, did not exactly suither own turn of mind, which shrank back intellectually from the crudedogmas of orthodox Christianity, but clung poetically to the artisticside of religion, to its art and to its music, to the grandeur of itsglorious fanes, and the solemnity of its stately ritual. She detested themeretricious show, the tinsel gaudiness, the bowing and genuflecting, thecandles and the draperies, of Romanism, and of its pinchbeck imitatorRitualism; but I doubt whether she knew any keener pleasure than to sitin one of the carved stalls of Westminster Abbey, listening to thepolished sweetness of Dean Stanley's exquisite eloquence; or to thethunder of the organ mingled with the voices of the white-robedchoristers, as the music rose and fell, as it pealed up to the archedroof and lost itself in the carven fretwork, or died away softly amongthe echoes of the chapels in which kings and saints and sages laysleeping, enshrining in themselves the glories and the sorrows of thepast.To return to October, 1852. On the day of the funeral my elder brotherand I were taken back to the house where my father lay dead, and while mybrother went as chief mourner, poor little boy swamped in crape andmiserable exceedingly, I sat in an upstairs room with my mother and hersisters; and still comes back to me her figure, seated on a sofa, withfixed white face and dull vacant eyes, counting the minutes till thefuneral procession would have reached Kensal Green, and then following inmechanical fashion, prayer-book in hand, the service, stage by stage,until to my unspeakable terror, with the words, dully spoken, "It is allover", she fell back fainting. And here comes a curious psychologicalproblem which has often puzzled me. Some weeks later she resolved to goand see her husband's grave. A relative who had been present at thefuneral volunteered to guide her to the spot, but lost his way in thatwilderness of graves. Another of the small party went off to find one ofthe officials and to enquire, and my mother said: "If you will take me tothe chapel where the first part of the service was read, I will find thegrave". To humor her whim, he led her thither, and, looking round for amoment or two, she started from the chapel, followed the path along whichthe corpse had been borne, and was standing by the newly-made grave whenthe official arrived to point it out. Her own explanation was that shehad seen all the service; what is certain is, that she had never been toKensal Green before, and that she walked steadily to the grave from thechapel. Whether the spot had been carefully described to her, whether shehad heard others talking of its position or not, we could neverascertain; she had no remembrance of any such description, and the matteralways remained to us a problem. But after the lapse of years a hundredlittle things may have been forgotten which unconsciously served asguides at the time. She must have been, of course, at that time, in astate of abnormal nervous excitation, a state of which another proof wasshortly afterwards given. The youngest of our little family was a boyabout three years younger than myself, a very beautiful child, blue-eyedand golden haired--I have still a lock of his hair, of exquisite palegolden hue--and the little lad was passionately devoted to his father. Hewas always a delicate boy, and had I suppose, therefore, been speciallypetted, and he fretted continually for "papa". It is probable that theconsumptive taint had touched him, for he pined steadily away, with nomarked disease, during the winter months. One morning my mother calmlystated: "Alf is going to die". It was in vain that it was urged on herthat with the spring strength would return to the child. "No", shepersisted. "He was lying asleep in my arms last night, and William cameto me and said that he wanted Alf with him, but that I might keep theother two." She had in her a strong strain of Celtic superstition, andthoroughly believed that this "vision"--a most natural dream under thecircumstances--was a direct "warning", and that her husband had come toher to tell her of her approaching loss. This belief was, in her eyes,thoroughly justified by the little fellow's death in the following March,calling to the end for "Papa! papa!" My brother and I were allowed to seehim just before he was placed in his coffin; I can see him still, sowhite and beautiful, with a black spot in the middle of the fair waxenforehead, and I remember the deadly cold which startled me when I wastold to kiss my little brother. It was the first time that I had touchedDeath. That black spot made a curious impression on me, and longafterwards, asking what had caused it, I was told that at the momentafter his death my mother had passionately kissed the baby brow. Patheticthought, that the mother's kiss of farewell should have been marked bythe first sign of corruption on the child's face.And now began my mother's time of struggle and of anxiety. Hitherto,since her marriage, she had known no money troubles, for her husband wasearning a good income; he was apparently vigorous and well: no thought ofanxiety clouded their future. When he died, he believed that he left hiswife and children safe, at least, from pecuniary distress. It was not so.I know nothing of the details, but the outcome of all was that nothingwas left for the widow and children, save a trifle of ready money. Theresolve to which, my mother came was characteristic. Two of her husband'srelatives, Western and Sir William Wood, offered to educate her son at agood city school, and to start him in commercial life, using their greatcity influence to push him forward. But the young lad's father and motherhad talked of a different future for their eldest boy; he was to go to apublic school, and then to the University, and was to enter one of the"learned professions"--to take orders, the mother wished; to go to theBar, the father hoped. On his death-bed there was nothing more earnestlyurged by my father than that Harry should receive the best possibleeducation, and the widow was resolute to fulfil that last wish. In hereyes, a city school was not "the best possible education", and the Irishpride rebelled against the idea of her son not being "a University man".Many were the lectures poured out on the young widow's head about her"foolish pride", especially by the female members of the Wood family; andher persistence in her own way caused a considerable alienation betweenherself and them. But Western and William, though half-disapproving,remained her friends, and lent many a helping hand to her in her firstdifficult struggles. After much cogitation, she resolved that the boyshould be educated at Harrow, where the fees are comparatively low tolads living in the town, and that he should go thence to Cambridge or toOxford, as his tastes should direct. A bold scheme for a penniless widow,but carried out to the letter; for never dwelt in a delicate body a moreresolute mind and will than that of my dear mother.In a few months' time--during which we lived, poorly enough, in RichmondTerrace, Clapham, close to her father and mother--to Harrow, then, shebetook herself, into lodgings over a grocer's shop, and set herself tolook for a house. This grocer was a very pompous man, fond of long words,and patronised the young widow exceedingly, and one day my mother relatedwith much amusement how he had told her that she was sure to get on ifshe worked hard. "Look at me!" he said swelling visibly with importance;"I was once a poor boy, without a penny of my own, and now I am acomfortable man, and have my submarine villa to go to every evening".That "submarine villa" was an object of amusement when we passed it inour walks for many a long day. "There is Mr. ----'s submarine villa",some one would say, laughing: and I, too, used to laugh merrily, becausemy elders did, though my understanding of the difference between suburbanand submarine was on a par with that of the honest grocer.My mother had fortunately found a boy, whose parents were glad to placehim in her charge, of about the age of her own son, to educate with him;and by this means she was able to pay for a tutor, to prepare the twoboys for school. The tutor had a cork leg, which was a source of serioustrouble to me, for it stuck out straight behind when we knelt down tofamily prayers--conduct which struck me as irreverent and unbecoming, butwhich I always felt a desire to imitate. After about a year, my motherfound a house which she thought would suit her scheme, namely, to obtainpermission from Dr. Vaughan, the then Head Master of Harrow, to take someboys into her house, and so gain means of education for her own son. Dr.Vaughan, who must have been won by the gentle, strong, little woman, fromthat time forth became her earnest friend and helper; and to the counseland active assistance both of himself and of his wife, was due much ofthe success that crowned her toil. He made only one condition in grantingthe permission she asked, and that was, that she should also have in herhouse one of the masters of the school, so that the boys should notsuffer from the want of a house-tutor. This condition, of course, shereadily accepted, and the arrangement lasted for ten years, until afterher son had left school for Cambridge.The house she took is now, I am sorry to say, pulled down, and replacedby a hideous red-brick structure. It was very old and rambling,rose-covered in front, ivy-covered behind; it stood on the top of HarrowHill, between the church and the school, and had once been the vicarageof the parish, but the vicar had left it because it was so far removedfrom the part of the village where all his work lay. The drawing-roomopened by an old-fashioned half-window, half-door--which proved aconstant source of grief to me, for whenever I had on a new frock Ialways tore it on the bolt as I flew through it--into a large gardenwhich sloped down one side of the hill, and was filled with the mostdelightful old trees, fir and laurel, may, mulberry, hazel, apple, pear,and damson, not to mention currant and gooseberry bushes innumerable, andlarge strawberry beds spreading down the sunny slopes. There was not atree there that I did not climb, and one, a widespreading Portugallaurel, was my private country house. I had there my bedroom and mysitting-rooms, my study, and my larder. The larder was supplied by thefruit-trees, from which I was free to pick as I would, and in the study Iwould sit for hours with some favorite book--Milton's "Paradise Lost" thechief favorite of all. The birds must often have felt startled, when fromthe small swinging form perching on a branch, came out in childish tonesthe "Thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues, powers", of Milton'sstately and sonorous verse. I liked to personify Satan, and to declaimthe grand speeches of the hero-rebel, and many a happy hour did I pass inMilton's heaven and hell, with for companions Satan and "the Son",Gabriel and Abdiel. Then there was a terrace running by the side of thechurchyard, always dry in the wettest weather, and bordered by an oldwooden fence, over which clambered roses of every shade; never was such agarden for roses as that of the Old Vicarage. At the end of the terracewas a little summer-house, and in this a trap-door in the fence, whichswung open and displayed one of the fairest views in England. Sheer fromyour feet downwards went the hill, and then far below stretched thewooded country till your eye reached the towers of Windsor Castle, faraway on the horizon. It was the view at which Byron was never tired ofgazing, as he lay on the flat tombstone close by--Byron's tomb, as it isstill called--of which he wrote:"Again I behold where for hours I have pondered,   As reclining, at eve, on yon tombstone I lay,Or round the steep brow of the churchyard I wandered,   To catch the last gleam of the sun's setting ray."Reader mine, if ever you go to Harrow, ask permission to enter the oldgarden, and try the effect of that sudden burst of beauty, as you swingback the small trap-door at the terrace end.Into this house we moved on my eighth birthday, and for eleven years itwas "home" to me, left always with regret, returned to always with joy.Almost immediately afterwards I left my mother for the first time; forone day, visiting a family who lived close by, I found a stranger sittingin the drawing-room, a lame lady with, a strong face, which softenedmarvellously as she smiled at the child who came dancing in; she calledme to her presently, and took me on her lap and talked to me, and on thefollowing day our friend came to see my mother, to ask if she would letme go away and be educated with this lady's niece, coming home for theholidays regularly, but leaving my education in her hands. At first mymother would not hear of it, for she and I scarcely ever left each other;my love for her was an idolatry, hers for me a devotion. [A foolishlittle story, about which I was unmercifully teased for years, markedthat absolute idolatry of her, which has not yet faded from my heart. Intenderest rallying one day of the child who trotted after her everywhere,content to sit, or stand, or wait, if only she might touch hand or dressof "mamma," she said: "Little one (the name by which she always calledme), if you cling to mamma in this way, I must really get a string andtie you to my apron, and how will you like that?" "O mamma darling," camethe fervent answer, "do let it be in a knot." And, indeed, the tie oflove between us was so tightly knotted that nothing ever loosened it tillthe sword of Death cut that which pain and trouble never availed toslacken in the slightest degree.] But it was urged upon her that theadvantages of education offered were such as no money could purchase forme; that it would be a disadvantage for me to grow up in a houseful ofboys--and, in truth, I was as good a cricketer and climber as the best ofthem--that my mother would soon be obliged to send me to school, unlessshe accepted an offer which gave me every advantage of school without itsdisadvantages. At last she yielded, and it was decided that Miss Marryat,on returning home, should take me with her.Miss Marryat--the favorite sister of Captain Marryat, the famousnovelist--was a maiden lady of large means. She had nursed her brotherthrough the illness that ended in his death, and had been living with hermother at Wimbledon Park. On her mother's death she looked round for workwhich would make her useful in the world, and finding that one of herbrothers had a large family of girls, she offered to take charge of oneof them, and to educate her thoroughly. Chancing to come to Harrow, mygood fortune threw me in her way, and she took a fancy to me and thoughtshe would like to teach two little girls rather than one. Hence her offerto my mother.Miss Marryat had a perfect genius for teaching, and took in it thegreatest delight. From time to time she added another child to our party,sometimes a boy, sometimes a girl. At first, with Amy Marryat and myself,there was a little boy, Walter Powys, son of a clergyman with a largefamily, and him she trained for some years, and then sent him on toschool admirably prepared. She chose "her children"--as she loved to callus--in very definite fashion. Each must be gently born and gentlytrained, but in such position that the education freely given should be arelief and aid to a slender parental purse. It was her delight to seekout and aid those on whom poverty presses most heavily, when the need foreducation for the children weighs on the proud and the poor. "Auntie" weall called her, for she thought "Miss Marryat" seemed too cold and stiff.She taught us everything herself except music, and for this she had amaster, practising us in composition, in recitation, in reading aloudEnglish and French, and later, German, devoting herself to training us inthe soundest, most thorough fashion. No words of mine can tell how much Iowe her, not only of knowledge, bit of that love of knowledge which hasremained with me ever since as a constant spur to study.Her method of teaching may be of interest to some, who desire to trainchildren with the least pain, and the most enjoyment to the little onesthemselves. First, we never used a spelling-book--that torment of thesmall child--nor an English grammar. But we wrote letters, telling of thethings we had seen in our walks, or told again some story we had read;these childish compositions she would read over with us, correcting allfaults of spelling, of grammar, of style, of cadence; a clumsy sentencewould be read aloud, that we might hear how unmusical it sounded; anerror in observation or expression pointed out. Then, as the lettersrecorded what we had seen the day before, the faculty of observation wasdrawn out and trained. "Oh, dear! I have nothing to say!" would come froma small child, hanging over a slate. "Did you not go out for a walkyesterday?" Auntie would question. "Yes", would be sighed out; "butthere's nothing to say about it". "Nothing to say! And you walked in thelanes for an hour and saw nothing, little No-eyes? You must use your eyesbetter to-day." Then there was a very favorite "lesson", which proved anexcellent way of teaching spelling. We used to write out lists of all thewords we could think of, which sounded the same but were differentlyspelt. Thus: "key, quay," "knight, night," and so on; and great was theglory of the child who found the largest number. Our French lessons--asthe German later--included reading from the very first. On the day onwhich we began German we began reading Schiller's "Wilhelm Tell," and theverbs given to us to copy out were those that had occurred in thereading. We learned much by heart, but always things that in themselveswere worthy to be learned. We were never given the dry questions andanswers which lazy teachers so much affect. We were taught history by onereading aloud while the others worked--the boys as well as the girlslearning the use of the needle. "It's like a girl to sew," said a littlefellow, indignantly, one day. "It is like a baby to have to run after agirl if you want a button sewn on," quoth Auntie. Geography was learnedby painting skeleton maps--an exercise much delighted in by smallfingers--and by putting together puzzle maps, in which countries in themap of a continent, or counties in the map of a country, were always cutout in their proper shapes. I liked big empires in those days; there wasa solid satisfaction in putting down Russia, and seeing what a large partof the map was filled up thereby.The only grammar that we ever learned as grammar was the Latin, and thatnot until composition had made us familiar with the use of the rulestherein given. Auntie had a great horror of children learning by rotethings they did not understand, and then fancying they knew them. "Whatdo you mean by that expression, Annie?" she would ask me. After feebleattempts to explain, I would answer: "Indeed, Auntie, I know in my ownhead, but I can't explain". "Then, indeed, Annie, you do not know in yourown head, or you could explain, so that I might know in my own head." Andso a healthy habit was fostered of clearness of thought and ofexpression. The Latin grammar was used because it was more perfect thanthe modern grammars, and served as a solid foundation for modernlanguages.Miss Marryat took a beautiful place, Fern Hill, near Charmouth, inDorsetshire, on the borders of Devon, and there she lived for some fiveyears, a centre of beneficence in the district. She started aSunday-school, and a Bible-class after a while for the lads too old forthe school, who clamored for admission to her class in it. She visitedthe poor, taking help wherever she went, and sending food from her owntable to the sick. It was characteristic of her that she would never give"scraps" to the poor, but would have a basin brought in at dinner, andwould cut the best slice to tempt the invalid appetite. Money she rarely,if ever, gave, but she would find a day's work, or busy herself to seekpermanent employment for anyone asking aid. Stern in rectitude herself,and iron to the fawning or the dishonest, her influence, whether she wasfeared or loved, was always for good. Of the strictest sect of theEvangelicals, she was an Evangelical. On the Sunday no books were allowedsave the Bible or the "Sunday at Home"; but she would try to make the daybright by various little devices; by a walk with her in the garden; bythe singing of hymns, always attractive to children; by telling uswonderful missionary stories of Moffat and Livingstone, whose adventureswith savages and wild beasts were as exciting as any tale of MayneReid's. We used to learn passages from the Bible and hymns forrepetition; a favorite amusement was a "Bible puzzle", such as adescription of some Bible scene, which was to be recognised by thedescription. Then we taught in the Sunday-school, for Auntie would tellus that it was useless for us to learn if we did not try to help thosewho had no one to teach them. The Sunday-school lessons had to becarefully prepared on the Saturday, for we were always taught that workgiven to the poor should be work that cost something to the giver. Thisprinciple, regarded by her as an illustration of the text, "Shall I giveunto the Lord my God that which has cost me nothing?" ran through all herprecept and her practice. When in some public distress we children wentto her crying, and asking whether we could not help the little childrenwho were starving, her prompt reply was: "What will you give up forthem?" And then she said that if we liked to give up the use of sugar, wemight thus each save 6d. a week to give away. I doubt if a healthierlesson can be given to children than that of personal self-denial for thegood of others.Daily, when our lessons were over, we had plenty of fun; long walks andrides, rides on a lively pony, who found small children most amusing, andon which the coachman taught us to stick firmly, whatever hiseccentricities of the moment; delightful all-day picnics in the lovelycountry round Charmouth, Auntie our merriest playfellow. Never was ahealthier home, physically and mentally, made for young things than inthat quiet village. And then the delight of the holidays! The pride of mymother at the good report of her darling's progress, and the renewal ofacquaintance with every nook and corner in the dear old house and garden.III.The strong and intense Evangelicalism of Miss Marryat colored the wholeof my early religious thought. I was naturally enthusiastic and fanciful,and was apt to throw myself strongly into the current of the emotionallife around me, and hence I easily reflected the stern and narrow creedwhich ruled over my daily life. It was to me a matter of the most intenseregret that Christians did not go about as in the "Pilgrim's Progress",armed to do battle with Apollyon and Giant Despair, or fight through awhole long day against thronging foes, until night brought victory andrelease. It would have been so easy, I used to think, to do tangiblebattle of that sort, so much easier than to learn lessons, and keep one'stemper, and mend one's stockings. Quick to learn, my lessons of Bible andPrayer Book gave me no trouble, and I repeated page after page withlittle labor and much credit. I remember being praised for my love of theBible, because I had learned by heart all the epistle of St. James's,while, as a matter of fact, the desire to distinguish myself was a farmore impelling motive than any love of "the holy book;" the dignifiedcadences pleased my ear, and were swiftly caught and reproduced, and Iwas proud of the easy fashion in which I mastered and recited page afterpage. Another source of "carnal pride"--little suspected, I fear, by mydear instructress--was found in the often-recurring prayer meetings. Inthese the children were called on to take a part, and we were bidden prayaloud; this proceeding was naturally a sore trial, and being endued withan inordinate amount of "false pride"--the fear of appearing ridiculous,_i.e._, with self conceit--it was a great trouble when the summons came:"Annie dear, will you speak to our Lord". But the plunge once made, andthe trembling voice steadied, enthusiasm and facility for cadenced speechalways swallowed up the nervous "fear of breaking down", and I fear methat the prevailing thought was more often that God must think I prayedvery nicely, than that I was a "miserable sinner", asking "pardon for thesake of Jesus Christ". The sense of sin, the contrition for man's fallenstate, which are required by Evangelicalism, can never be truly felt byany child; but whenever a sensitive, dreamy, and enthusiastic child comesunder strong Evangelistic influence, it is sure to manifest "signs ofsaving grace". As far as I can judge now, the total effect of theCalvinistic training was to make me somewhat morbid, but this tendencywas counteracted by the healthier tone of my mother's thought, and thenatural gay buoyancy of my nature rose swiftly whenever the pressure ofthe teaching that I was "a child of sin", and could "not naturally pleaseGod", was removed.In the spring of 1861, Miss Marryat announced her intention of goingabroad, and asked my dear mother to let me accompany her. A little nephewwhom she had adopted was suffering from cataract, and she desired toplace him under the care of the famous Duesseldorf oculist. Amy Marryathad been recalled home soon after the death of her mother, who had diedin giving birth to the child adopted by Miss Marryat, and named at herdesire after her favorite brother Frederick (Captain Marryat). Her placehad been taken by a girl a few months older than myself, Emma Mann, oneof the daughters of a clergyman who had married a Miss Stanley, closelyrelated, indeed if I remember rightly, a sister of the Miss Mary Stanleywho did such noble work in nursing in the Crimea.For some months we had been diligently studying German, for Miss Marryatthought it wise that we should know a language fairly well before wevisited the country of which it was the native tongue. We had beentrained also to talk French daily during dinner, so we were not quite"helpless foreigners" when we steamed away from St. Catherine's Docks,and found ourselves on the following day in Antwerp, amid what seemed tous a very Babel of conflicting tongues. Alas for our carefully spokenFrench, articulated laboriously. We were lost in that swirl of disputingluggage-porters, and could not understand a word! But Miss Marryat wasquite equal to the occasion, being by no means new to travelling, and herFrench stood the test triumphantly, and steered us safely to a hotel. Onthe morrow we started again through Aix-la-Chapelle to Bonn, the townwhich lies on the borders of the exquisite scenery of which theSiebengebirge and Rolandseck serve as the magic portal. Our experiencesin Bonn were not wholly satisfactory. Dear Auntie was a maiden lady,looking on all young men as wolves to be kept far from her growing lambs.Bonn was a university town, and there was a mania just then prevailingthere for all things English. Emma was a plump, rosy, fair-haired typicalEnglish maiden, full of frolic and harmless fun; I a very slight, pale,black-haired girl, alternating between wild fun and extreme pensiveness.In the boarding-house to which we went at first--the "Chateau du Rhin", abeautiful place overhanging the broad blue Rhine--there chanced to bestaying the two sons of the late Duke of Hamilton, the Marquis of Douglasand Lord Charles, with their tutor. They had the whole drawing-roomfloor: we a sitting-room on the ground floor and bedrooms above. The ladsdiscovered that Miss Marryat did not like her "children" to be onspeaking terms with any of the "male sect". Here was a fine source ofamusement. They would make their horses caracole on the gravel in frontof our window; they would be just starting for their ride as we went forwalk or drive, and would salute us with doffed hat and low bow; theywould waylay us on our way downstairs with demure "Good morning"; theywould go to church and post themselves so that they could survey our pew,and Lord Charles--who possessed the power of moving at will the wholeskin of the scalp--would wriggle his hair up and down till we werechoking with laughter, to our own imminent risk. After a month of this,Auntie was literally driven out of the pretty _Chateau_, and took refugein a girls' school, much to our disgust, but still she was not allowed tobe at rest. Mischievous students would pursue us wherever we went;sentimental Germans, with gashed cheeks, would whisper complimentaryphrases as we passed; mere boyish nonsense of most harmless kind, but therather stern English lady thought it "not proper", and after three monthsof Bonn we were sent home for the holidays, somewhat in disgrace. But wehad some lovely excursions during those months; such clambering upmountains, such rows on the swift-flowing Rhine, such wanderings inexquisite valleys. I have a long picture-gallery to retire into when Iwant to think of something fair, in recalling the moon as it silvered theRhine at the foot of Drachenfels, or the soft mist-veiled island wheredwelt the lady who is consecrated for ever by Roland's love.A couple of months later we rejoined Miss Marryat in Paris, where wespent seven happy workful months. On Wednesdays and Saturdays we werefree from lessons, and many a long afternoon was passed in the galleriesof the Louvre, till we became familiar with the masterpieces of artgathered there from all lands. I doubt if there was a beautiful church inParis that we did not visit during those weekly wanderings; that of St.Germain de l'Auxerrois was my favorite--the church whose bell gave thesignal for the massacre of St. Bartholomew--for it contained suchmarvellous stained glass, deepest purest glory of color that I had everseen. The solemn beauty of Notre Dame, the somewhat gaudy magnificence ofLa Sainte Chapelle, the stateliness of La Madeleine, the impressive gloomof St. Roch, were all familiar to us. Other delights were found inmingling with the bright crowds which passed along the Champs Elysees andsauntered in the Bois de Boulogne, in strolling in the garden of theTuileries, in climbing to the top of every monument whence view of Pariscould be gained. The Empire was then in its heyday of glitter, and wemuch enjoyed seeing the brilliant escort of the imperial carriage, withplumes and gold and silver dancing and glistening in the sunlight, whilein the carriage sat the exquisitely lovely empress with the little boybeside her, touching his cap shyly, but with something of her own grace,in answer to a greeting--the boy who was thought to be born to animperial crown, but whose brief career was to find an ending from thespears of savages in a quarrel in which he had no concern.In the spring of 1862 it chanced that the Bishop of Ohio visited Paris,and Mr. Forbes, then English chaplain at the Church of the Rued'Aguesseau, arranged to have a confirmation. As said above, I was underdeep "religious impressions", and, in fact, with the exception of thatlittle aberration in Germany, I was decidedly a pious girl. I looked ontheatres (never having been to one) as traps set by Satan for thedestruction of foolish souls; I was quite determined never to go to aball, and was prepared to "suffer for conscience sake"--little prig thatI was--if I was desired to go to one. I was consequently quite preparedto take upon myself the vows made in my name at my baptism, and torenounce the world, the flesh, and the devil, with a heartiness andsincerity only equalled by my profound ignorance of the things I soreadily resigned. That confirmation was to me a very solemn matter; thecareful preparation, the prolonged prayers, the wondering awe as to the"sevenfold gifts of the Spirit", which were to be given by "the laying onof hands", all tended to excitement. I could scarcely control myself as Iknelt at the altar rails, and felt as though the gentle touch of the agedBishop, which fluttered for an instant on my bowed head, were the verytouch of the wing of that "Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove", whose presencehad been so earnestly invoked. Is there anything easier, I wonder, thanto make a young and sensitive girl "intensely religious".My mother came over for the confirmation and for the "first communion" onEaster Sunday, and we had a delightful fortnight together, returning homeafter we had wandered hand-in-hand over all my favorite haunts. Thesummer of 1862 was spent with Miss Marryat at Sidmouth, and, wise womanthat she was, she now carefully directed our studies with a view to ourcoming enfranchisement from the "school-room." More and more were wetrained to work alone; our leading-strings were slackened, so that wenever felt them save when we blundered; and I remember that when I oncecomplained, in loving fashion, that she was "teaching me so little", shetold me that I was getting old enough to be trusted to work by myself,and that I must not expect to "have Auntie for a crutch all throughlife". And I venture to say that this gentle withdrawal of constantsupervision and teaching was one of the wisest and kindest things thatthis noble-hearted woman ever did for us. It is the usual custom to keepgirls in the school-room until they "come out"; then, suddenly, they areleft to their own devices, and, bewildered by their unaccustomed freedom,they waste time that might be priceless for their intellectual growth.Lately, the opening of universities to women has removed this danger forthe more ambitious; but at the time of which I am writing no one dreamedof the changes soon to be made in the direction of the "higher educationof women".During the winter of 1862-1863 Miss Marryat was in London, and for a fewmonths I remained there with her, attending the admirable French classesof M. Roche. In the spring I returned home to Harrow, going up each weekto the classes; and when these were over, Auntie told me that she thoughtall she could usefully do was done, and that it was time that I shouldtry my wings alone. So well, however, had she succeeded in her aims, thatmy emancipation from the school-room was but the starting-point of moreeager study, though now the study turned into the lines of thoughttowards which my personal tendencies most attracted me. German Icontinued to read with a master, and music, under the marvellously ableteaching of Mr. John Farmer, musical director of Harrow School, took upmuch of my time. My dear mother had a passion for music, and Beethovenand Bach were her favorite composers. There was scarcely a sonata ofBeethoven's that I did not learn, scarcely a fugue of Bach's that I didnot master. Mendelssohn's "Lieder" gave a lighter recreation, and many ahappy evening did we spend, my mother and I, over the stately strains ofthe blind Titan, and the sweet melodies of the German wordless orator.Musical "At Homes", too, were favorite amusements at Harrow, and at thesemy facile fingers made me a welcome guest.A very pleasant place was Harrow to a light-hearted serious-brained girl.The picked men of the Schools of Oxford and Cambridge came there asjunior masters, so that one's partners at ball and croquet and archerycould talk as well as flirt. Never girl had, I venture to say, a brightergirlhood than mine. Every morning and much of the afternoon spent ineager earnest study: evenings in merry party or quiet home-life, one asdelightful as the other. Archery and croquet had in me a most devoteddisciple, and the "pomps and vanities" of the ballroom found the happiestof votaries. My darling mother certainly "spoiled" me, so far as wereconcerned all the small roughnesses of life. She never allowed a troubleof any kind to touch me, and cared only that all worries should fall onher, all joys on me. I know now what I never dreamed then, that her lifewas one of serious anxiety. The heavy burden of my brother's school andcollege-life pressed on her constantly, and her need of money was oftenserious. A lawyer whom she trusted absolutely cheated her systematically,using for his own purposes the remittances she made for payment ofliabilities, thus keeping upon her a constant drain. Yet for me all thatwas wanted was ever there. Was it a ball to which we were going? I neednever think of what I would wear till the time for dressing arrived, andthere laid out ready for me was all I wanted, every detail complete fromtop to toe. No hand but hers must dress my hair, which, loosed, fell indense curly masses nearly to my knees; no hand but hers must fasten dressand deck with flowers, and if I sometimes would coaxingly ask if I mightnot help by sewing in laces, or by doing some trifle in aid, she wouldkiss me and bid me run to my books or my play, telling me that her onlypleasure in life was caring for her "treasure". Alas! how lightly we takethe self-denying labor that makes life so easy, ere yet we have knownwhat life means when the protecting mother-wing is withdrawn. So guardedand shielded had been my childhood and youth from every touch of pain andanxiety that love could bear for me, that I never dreamed that life mightbe a heavy burden, save as I saw it in the poor I was sent to help; allthe joy of those happy years I took, not ungratefully I hope, butcertainly with as glad unconsciousness of anything rare in it as I tookthe sunlight. Passionate love, indeed, I gave to my darling, but I neverknew all I owed her till I passed out of her tender guardianship, till Ileft my mother's home. Is such training wise? I am not sure. It makes theordinary roughnesses of life come with so stunning a shock, when one goesout into the world, that one is apt to question whether some earlierinitiation into life's sterner mysteries would not be wiser for theyoung. Yet it is a fair thing to have that joyous youth to look backupon, and at least it is a treasury of memory that no thief can steal inthe struggles of later life.During those happy years my brain was given plenty of exercise. I used tokeep a list of the books I read, so that I might not neglect my work; andfinding a "Library of the Fathers" on the shelves, I selected that forone _piece de resistance_. Soon those strange mystic writers won over mea great fascination, and I threw myself ardently into a study of thequestion: "Where is now the Catholic Church?". I read Pusey, and Liddon,and Keble, with many another of that school, and many of the seventeenthcentury English divines. I began to fast--to the intense disapproval ofmy mother, who cared for my health far more than for all the Fathers theChurch could boast of--to use the sign of the cross, to go to weeklycommunion. Indeed, the contrast I found between my early Evangelicaltraining and the doctrines of the Primitive Christian Church would havedriven me over to Rome, had it not been for the proofs afforded by Puseyand his co-workers, that the English Church might be Catholic althoughnon-Roman. But for them I should most certainly have joined the PapalCommunion; for if the Church of the early centuries be compared with Romeand with Geneva, there is no doubt that Rome shows marks of primitiveChristianity of which Geneva is entirely devoid. I became content when Ifound that the practices and doctrines of the Anglican Church could beknitted on to those of the martyrs and confessors of the early Church,for it had not yet struck me that the early Church might itself bechallenged. To me, at that time, the authority of Jesus was supreme andunassailable; his apostles were his infallible messengers; Clement ofRome, Polycarp, and Barnabas, these were the very pupils of the apostlesthemselves. I never dreamed of forgeries, of pious frauds, of writingsfalsely ascribed to venerated names. Nor do I now regret that so it was;for, without belief, the study of the early Fathers would be anintolerable weariness; and that old reading of mine has served me well inmany of my later controversies with Christians, who knew the literatureof their Church less well than I.To this ecclesiastical reading was added some study of stray scientificworks, but the number of these that came in my way was very limited. Theatmosphere surrounding me was literary rather than scientific. I rememberreading a translation of Plato that gave me great delight, and beingrather annoyed by the insatiable questionings of Socrates. Lord Derby'stranslation of the Iliad also charmed me with its stateliness and melody,and Dante was another favorite study. Wordsworth and Cowper I muchdisliked, and into the same category went all the 17th and 18th century"poets," though I read them conscientiously through. Southey fascinatedme with his wealth of Oriental fancies, while Spencer was a favoritebook, put beside Milton and Dante. My novel reading was extremelylimited; indeed the "three volume novel" was a forbidden fruit. My motherregarded these ordinary love-stories as unhealthy reading for a younggirl, and gave me Scott and Kingsley, but not Miss Braddon or Mrs. HenryWood. Nor would she take me to the theatre, though we went to really goodconcerts. She had a horror of sentimentality in girls, and loved to seethem bright and gay, and above all things absolutely ignorant of all evilthings and of premature love-dreams. Happy, healthy and workful werethose too brief years.IV.My grandfather's house, No. 8, Albert Square, Clapham Road, was a secondhome from my earliest childhood.That house, with its little strip of garden at the back, will alwaysremain dear and sacred to me. I can see now the two almond trees, so richin blossom every spring, so barren in fruit every autumn; the largespreading tufts of true Irish shamrock, brought from Ireland, andlovingly planted in the new grey London house, amid the smoke; the littlenooks at the far end, wherein I would sit cosily out of sight reading afavorite book. Inside it was but a commonplace London house, only oneroom, perhaps, differing from any one that might have been found in anyother house in the square. That was my grandfather's "work-room", wherehe had a lathe fitted up, for he had a passion and a genius for inventivework in machinery. He took out patents for all sorts of ingeniouscontrivances, but always lost money. His favorite invention was of a"railway chair", for joining the ends of rails together, and in theultimate success of this he believed to his death. It was (and is) usedon several lines, and was found to answer splendidly, but the old mannever derived any profit from his invention. The fact was he had nomoney, and those who had took it up and utilised it, and kept all theprofit for themselves. There were several cases in which his patentsdropped, and then others took up his inventions, and made a commercialsuccess thereof.A strange man altogether was that grandfather of mine, whom I can onlyremember as a grand-looking old man, with snow-white hair and piercinghawk's eyes. The merriest of wild Irishmen was he in his youth, and Ihave often wished that his biography had been written, if only as apicture of Dublin society at the time. He had an exquisite voice, and onenight he and some of his wild comrades went out singing through thestreets as beggars. Pennies, sixpences, shillings, and even half-crownscame showering down in recompense of street music of such unusualexcellence; then the young scamps, ashamed of their gains, poured themall into the hat of a cripple they met, who must have thought that allthe blessed saints were out that night in the Irish capital. On anotheroccasion he went to the wake of an old woman who had been bent nearlydouble by rheumatism, and had been duly "laid out", and tied down firmly,so as to keep the body straight in the recumbent position. He hid underthe bed, and when the whisky was flowing freely, and the orgie was at itsheight, he cut the ropes with a sharp knife, and the old woman suddenlysat up in bed, frightening the revellers out of their wits, and, luckilyfor my grandfather, out of the room. Many such tales would he tell, withquaint Irish humor, in his later days. He died, from a third stroke ofparalysis, in 1862.The Morrises were a very "clannish" family, and my grandfather's housewas the London centre. All the family gathered there on eachChristmastide, and on Christmas day was always held high festival. Forlong my brother and I were the only grandchildren within reach, and werenaturally made much of. The two sons were out in India, married, withyoung families. The youngest daughter was much away from home, and asecond was living in Constantinople, but three others lived with theirfather and mother. Bessie, the eldest of the whole family, was a woman ofrigid honor and conscientiousness, but poverty and the struggle to keepout of debt had soured her, and "Aunt Bessie" was an object of dread, notof love. One story of her early life will best tell her character. Shewas engaged to a young clergyman, and one day when Bessie was at churchhe preached a sermon taken without acknowledgment from some old divine.The girl's keen sense of honor was shocked at the deception, and shebroke off her engagement, but remained unmarried for the rest of herlife. "Careful and troubled about many things" was poor Aunt Bessie, andI remember being rather shocked one day at hearing her express hersympathy with Martha, when her sister left her to serve alone, and at hersaying: "I doubt very much whether Jesus would have liked it if Marthahad been lying about on the floor as well as Mary, and there had been nosupper. But there! it's always those who do the work who are scolded,because they have not time to be as sweet and nice as those who donothing." Nor could she ever approve of the treatment of the laborers inthe parable, when those who "had borne the burden and heat of the day"received but the same wage as those that had worked but one hour. "It wasnot just", she would say doggedly. A sad life was hers, for she repelledall sympathy, and yet later I had reason to believe that she half brokeher heart because none loved her well. She was ever gloomy,unsympathising, carping, but she worked herself to death for those whoselove she chillily repulsed. She worked till, denying herself everycomfort, she literally dropped. One morning, when she got out of bed, shefell, and crawling into bed again, quietly said she could do no more; laythere for some months, suffering horribly with unvarying patience; anddied, rejoicing that at last she would have "rest".Two other "Aunties" were my playfellows, and I their pet. Minnie, abrilliant pianiste, earned a precarious livelihood by teaching music. Thelong fasts, the facing of all weathers, the weary rides in omnibuses withsoaked feet, broke down at last a splendid constitution, and after somethree years of torture, commencing with a sharp attack of Englishcholera, she died the year before my marriage. But during my girlhood shewas the gayest and merriest of my friends, her natural buoyancyre-asserting itself whenever she could escape from her musicaltread-mill. Great was my delight when she joined my mother and myself forour spring or summer trips, and when at my favorite St. Leonards--at thefar unfashionable end, right away from the gay watering-place folk--wesettled down for four or five happy weeks of sea and country, and whenMinnie and I scampered over the country on horseback, merry as childrenset free from school. My other favorite auntie was of a quieter type, asoft pretty loving little woman. "Co" we called her, for she was "such acosy little thing", her father used to say. She was my mother's favoritesister, her "child", she would name her, because "Co" was so much herjunior, and when she was a young girl the little child had been hercharge. "Always take care of little Co", was one of my mother's dyingcharges to me, and fortunately "little Co" has--though the only one of myrelatives who has done so--clung to me through change of faith, andthrough social ostracism. Her love for me, and her full belief that,however she differed from me, I meant right, have never varied, havenever been shaken. She is intensely religious--as will be seen in thelater story, wherein her life was much woven with mine--but however much"darling Annie's" views or actions might shock her, it is "darling Annie"through it all; "You are so good" she said to me the last time I saw her,looking up at me with all her heart in her eyes; "anyone so good as youmust come to our dear Lord at last!" As though any, save a brute, couldbe aught but good to "little Co".On the Christmas following my eighteenth birthday, a little MissionChurch in which Minnie was much interested, was opened near AlbertSquare. My High Church enthusiasm was in full bloom, and the services inthis little Mission Church were "high", whereas those in all theneighboring churches were "low". A Mr. Hoare, an intensely earnest man,was working there in most devoted fashion, and was glad to welcome anyaid; we decorated his church, worked ornaments for it, and thought wewere serving God when we were really amusing ourselves in a small placewhere our help was over-estimated, and where the clergy, very likelyunconsciously, flattered us for our devotion. Among those who helped tocarry on the services there, was a young undermaster of Stockwell GrammarSchool, the rev. Frank Besant, a Cambridge man, who had passed as 28thwrangler in his year, and who had just taken orders. At Easter we wereagain at Albert Square, and devoted much time to the little church,decking it on Easter Eve with soft yellow tufts of primrose blossom, andtaking much delight in the unbounded admiration bestowed on the daintyspring blossoms by the poor who crowded in. I made a lovely white crossfor the super-altar with camelias and azaleas and white geraniums, butafter all it was not really as spring-like, as suitable for a"Resurrection", as the simple sweet wild flowers, still dewy from theirnests in field and glade and lane.That Easter was memorable to me for another cause. It saw waked andsmothered my first doubt. That some people did doubt the historicalaccuracy of the Bible I knew, for one or two of the Harrow masters werefriends of Colenso, the heretic Bishop of Natal, but fresh from myPatristic studies, I looked on heretics with blind horror, possibly thestronger from its very vagueness, and its ignorance of what it feared. Mymother objected to my reading controversial books which dealt with thepoints at issue between Christianity and Freethought, and I did not carefor her favorite Stanley, who might have widened my views, regarding him(on the word of Pusey) as "unsound in the faith once delivered to thesaints". I had read Pusey's book on "Daniel the prophet", and, knowingnothing of the criticisms he attacked, I felt triumphant at hisconvincing demonstrations of their error, and felt sure that none but thewilfully blind could fail to see how weak were the arguments of theheretic writers. That stately preface of his was one of my favoritepieces of reading, and his dignified defence against all novelties of"that which must be old because it is eternal, and must be unchangeablebecause it is true", at once charmed and satisfied me. The delightfulvagueness of Stanley, which just suited my mother's broad views, becauseit _was_ vague and beautiful, was denounced by Pusey--not unwarrantably--as that "variegated use of words which destroys all definiteness ofmeaning". When she would bid me not be uncharitable to those with whom Idiffered in matters of religion, I would answer in his words, that"charity to error is treason to truth", and that to speak out the truthunwaveringly as it was revealed, was alone "loyalty to God and charity tothe souls of men".Judge, then, of my terror at my own results when I found myself betrayedinto writing down some contradictions from the Bible. With that poeticdreaming which is one of the charms of Catholicism, whether English orRoman, I threw myself back into the time of the first century as the"Holy Week" of 1866 approached. In order to facilitate the realisation ofthose last sacred days of God incarnate on earth, working out man'ssalvation, I resolved to write a brief history of that week, compiledfrom the four gospels, meaning then to try and realise each day theoccurrences that had happened on the corresponding date in A.D. 33, andso to follow those "blessed feet" step by step, till they were  "... nailed for our advantage to the bitter cross."With the fearlessness which springs from ignorance I sat down to mytask. My method was as follows:     MATTHEW.     |      MARK.      |      LUKE.      |     JOHN.                  |                 |                 |   PALM SUNDAY.   |   PALM SUNDAY.  |   PALM SUNDAY.  |   PALM SUNDAY.                  |                 |                 |Rode into         | Rode into       | Rode into       | Rode intoJerusalem.        | Jerusalem.      | Jerusalem.      | Jerusalem.

I had been getting more and more uneasy anddistressed as I went on, but when I found that the Jews would not go intothe judgment hall lest they should be defiled, because they desired toeat the passover, having previously seen that Jesus had actually eatenthe passover with his disciples the evening before; when after writingdown that he was crucified at 9 a.m., and that there was darkness overall the land from 12 to 3 p.m., I found that three hours after he wascrucified he was standing in the judgment hall, and that at the very hourat which the miraculous darkness covered the earth; when I saw that I waswriting a discord instead of a harmony, I threw down my pen and shut upmy Bible. The shock of doubt was, however only momentary. I quicklyrecognised it as a temptation of the devil, and I shrank backhorror-stricken and penitent for the momentary lapse of faith. I saw thatthese apparent contradictions were really a test of faith, and that therewould be no credit in believing a thing in which there were nodifficulties. _Credo quia impossibile_; I repeated Tertullian's words atfirst doggedly, at last triumphantly. I fasted as penance for myinvoluntary sin of unbelief. I remembered that the Bible must not becarelessly read, and that St. Peter had warned us that there were in it"some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned andunstable wrest unto their own destruction". I shuddered at the"destruction" to the edge of which my unlucky "harmony" had drawn me, andresolved that I would never again venture on a task for which I was soevidently unfitted. Thus the first doubt was caused, and though swiftlytrampled down, it had none the less raised its head. It was stifled, notanswered, for all my religious training had led me to regard a doubt as asin to be repented of, not examined. And it left in my mind the dangerousfeeling that there were some things into which it was safer not toenquire too closely; things which must be accepted on faith, and not toonarrowly scrutinised. The awful threat: "He that believeth not shall bedamned," sounded in my ears, and, like the angel with the flaming sword,barred the path of all too curious enquiry.V.The spring ripened into summer in uneventful fashion, so far as I wasconcerned, the smooth current of my life flowing on untroubled, hardreading and merry play filling the happy days. I learned later that twoor three offers of marriage reached my mother for me; but she answered toeach: "She is too young. I will not have her troubled." Of love-dreams Ihad absolutely none, partly, I expect, from the absence of fiery novelsfrom my reading, partly because my whole dream-tendencies were absorbedby religion, and all my fancies ran towards a "religious life". I longedto spend my time in worshipping Jesus, and was, as far as my inner lifewas concerned, absorbed in that passionate love of "the Savior" which,among emotional Catholics, really is the human passion of lovetransferred to an ideal--for women to Jesus, for men to the Virgin Mary.In order to show that I am not here exaggerating, I subjoin a few of theprayers in which I found daily delight, and I do this in order to showhow an emotional girl may be attracted by these so-called devotionalexercises."O crucified Love, raise in me fresh ardors of love and consolation, thatit may henceforth be the greatest torment I can endure ever to offendThee; that it may be my greatest delight to please Thee.""Let the remembrance of Thy death, O Lord Jesu, make me to desire andpant after Thee, that I may delight in Thy gracious presence.""O most sweet Jesu Christ, I, unworthy sinner, yet redeemed by Thyprecious blood.... Thine I am and will be, in life and in death.""O Jesu, beloved, fairer than the sons of men, draw me after Thee withthe cords of Thy love.""Blessed are Thou, O most merciful God, who didst vouchsafe to espouse meto the heavenly Bridegroom in the waters of baptism, and hast impartedThy body and blood as a new gift of espousal and the meet consummation ofThy love.""O most sweet Lord Jesu, transfix the affections of my inmost soul withthat most joyous and most healthful wound of Thy love, with true, serene,most holy, apostolic charity; that my soul may ever languish and meltwith entire love and longing for Thee. Let it desire Thee and faint forThy courts; long to be dissolved and be with Thee.""Oh, that I could embrace Thee with that most burning love of angels.""Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth; for Thy love is betterthan wine. Draw me, we will run after Thee. The king hath brought me intohis chambers.... Let my soul, O Lord, feel the sweetness of Thy presence.May it taste how sweet Thou art.... May the sweet and burning power ofThy love, I beseech Thee, absorb my soul."To my dear mother this type of religious thought was revolting. But then,she was a woman who had been a wife and a devoted one, while I was achild awaking into womanhood, with emotions and passions dawning and notunderstood, emotions and passions which craved satisfaction, and found itin this "Ideal Man". Thousands of girls in England are to-day in exactlythis mental phase, and it is a phase full of danger. In America it isavoided by a frank, open, unsentimental companionship between boys andgirls, between young men and young women. In England, where this wiselyfree comradeship is regarded as "improper", the perfectly harmless andnatural sexual feeling is either dwarfed or forced, and so we have"prudishness" and "fastness". The sweeter and more loving natures becomeprudes; the more shallow as well as the more high-spirited and merrynatures become flirts. Often, as in my own case, the merry side finds itssatisfaction in amusements that demand active physical exercise, whilethe loving side finds its joy in religious expansion, in which theidealised figure of Jesus becomes the object of passion, and the life ofthe nun becomes the ideal life, as being dedicated to that one devotion.To the girl, of course, this devotion is all that is most holy, mostnoble, most pure. But analysing it now, after it has long been a thing ofthe past, I cannot but regard it as a mere natural outlet for the dawningfeelings of womanhood, certain to be the more intense and earnest as thenature is deep and loving.One very practical and mischievous result of this religious feeling isthe idealisation of all clergymen, as being the special messengers of,and the special means of communication with, the "Most High". The priestis surrounded by the halo of Deity. The power that holds the keys ofheaven and of hell becomes the object of reverence and of awe. Far morelofty than any title bestowed by earthly monarch is that patent ofnobility straight from the hand of the "King of kings", which seems togive to the mortal something of the authority of the immortal, to crownthe head of the priest with the diadem which belongs to those who are"kings and priests unto God". Swayed by these feelings, the position of aclergyman's wife seems second only to that of the nun, and has thereforea wonderful attractiveness, an attractiveness in which the particularclergyman affected plays a very subordinate part; it is the "sacredoffice", the nearness to "holy things", the consecration involved, whichseem to make the wife a nearer worshipper than those who do not partakein the immediate "services of the altar"--it is all these that shed aglamor over the clerical life which attracts most those who are most aptto self-devotion, most swayed by imagination. I know how incomprehensiblethis will seem to many of my readers, but it is a fact none the less, andthe saddest pity of it is that the glamor is most over those whose brainsare quick and responsive to all forms of noble emotions, all suggestionsof personal self-sacrifice; and if such later rise to the higher emotionswhose shadows have attracted them, and to that higher self-sacrificewhose whispers reached them in their early youth, then the falseprophet's veil is raised, and the life is either wrecked, or throughstorm-wind and surge of battling billows, with loss of mast and sail, issteered by firm hand into the port of a higher creed.My mother, Minnie, and I passed the summer holidays at St. Leonards, andmany a merry gallop had we over our favorite fields, I on a favoriteblack mare, Gipsy Queen, as full of life and spirits as I was myself, whodanced gaily over ditch and hedge, thinking little of my weight, for Irode barely eight stone. At the end of those, our last free summerholidays, we returned as usual to Harrow, and shortly afterwards I wentto Switzerland with some dear friends of ours named Roberts.Everyone about Manchester will remember Mr. Roberts, the solicitor, the"poor man's lawyer". Close friend of Ernest Jones, and hand-in-hand withhim through all his struggles, Mr. Roberts was always ready to fight apoor man's battle for him without fee, and to champion any workerunfairly dealt with. He worked hard in the agitation which saved womenfrom working in the mines, and I have heard him tell how he had seen themtoiling, naked to the waist, with short petticoats barely reaching totheir knees, rough, foul-tongued, brutalised out of all womanly decencyand grace; and how he had seen little children working there too, babiesof three and four set to watch a door, and falling asleep at their workto be roused by curse and kick to the unfair toil. The old man's eyewould begin to flash and his voice to rise as he told of these horrors,and then his face would soften as he added that, after it was all overand the slavery was put an end to, as he went through a coal-district thewomen standing at their doors would lift up their children to see "LawyerRoberts" go by, and would bid "God bless him" for what he had done. Thisdear old man was my first tutor in Radicalism, and I was an apt pupil. Ihad taken no interest in politics, but had unconsciously reflected moreor less the decorous Whiggism which had always surrounded me. I regarded"the poor" as folk to be educated, looked after, charitably dealt with,and always treated with most perfect courtesy, the courtesy being duefrom me, as a lady, to all equally, whether they were rich or poor. Butto Mr. Roberts "the poor" were the working-bees, the wealth producers,with a right to self-rule, not to looking after, with a right to justice,not to charity, and he preached his doctrines to me, in season and out ofseason. "What do you think of John Bright?" he demanded of me one day. "Ihave never thought of him at all," I answered lightly. "Isn't he a ratherrough sort of man, who goes about making rows?" "There, I thought so," hebroke out fiercely. "That's just what they say. I believe some of youfine ladies would not go to heaven if you had to rub shoulders with JohnBright, the noblest man God ever gave to the cause of the poor." And thenhe launched out into stories of John Bright's work and John Bright'seloquence, and showed me the changes that work and eloquence had made inthe daily lives of the people.With Mr. Roberts, his wife, and two daughters, I went to Switzerland asthe autumn drew near. It would be of little interest to tell how we wentto Chamounix and worshipped Mont Blanc, how we crossed the Mer de Glaceand the Mauvais Pas, how we visited the Monastery of St. Bernard (Ilosing my heart to the beautiful dogs), how we went by steamer down thelake of Thun, how we gazed at the Jungfrau and saw the exquisiteStaubbach, how we visited Lausanne, and Berne, and Geneva, how we stoodbeside the wounded Lion, and shuddered in the dungeon of Chillon, how wewalked distances we never should have attempted in England, how weyounger ones lost ourselves on a Sunday afternoon, after ascending amountain, and returned footsore and weary, to meet a party going out toseek us with lanterns and ropes. All these things have been so oftendescribed that I will not add one more description to the list, nor dwellon that strange feeling of awe, of wonder, of delight, that everyone musthave felt, when the glory of the peaks clad in "everlasting snow" is forthe first time seen against the azure sky on the horizon, and you whisperto yourself, half breathless: "The Alps! The Alps!"During that autumn I became engaged to the Rev. Frank Besant, giving upwith a sigh of regret my dreams of the "religious life", and substitutingfor them the work which would have to be done as the wife of a priest,laboring ever in the church and among the poor. A queer view, some peoplemay think, for a girl to take of married life, but it was the naturalresult of my living the life of the Early Church, of my enthusiasm forreligious work. To me a priest was a half-angelic creature, whose wholelife was consecrated to heaven; all that was deepest and truest in mynature chafed against my useless days, longed for work, yearned to devoteitself, as I had read women saints had done, to the service of the churchand the poor, to the battling against sin and misery. "You will have moreopportunity for doing good as a clergyman's wife than as anything else,"was one of the pleas urged on my reluctance. My ignorance of all thatmarriage meant was as profound as though I had been a child of four, andmy knowledge of the world was absolutely _nil_. My darling mother meantall that was happiest for me when she shielded me from all knowledge ofsorrow and of sin, when she guarded me from the smallest idea of themarriage relation, keeping me ignorant as a baby till I left her home awife. But looking back now on all, I deliberately say that no more fatalblunder can be made than to train a girl to womanhood in ignorance of alllife's duties and burdens, and then to let her face them for the firsttime away from all the old associations, the old helps, the old refuge onthe mother's breast. That "perfect innocence" maybe very beautiful, butit is a perilous possession, and Eve should have the knowledge of goodand of evil ere she wanders forth from the paradise of a mother's love.When a word is never spoken to a girl that is not a caress; whennecessary rebuke comes in tone of tenderest reproach; when "You havegrieved me" has been the heaviest penalty for a youthful fault; when noanxiety has ever been allowed to trouble the young heart--then, when thehothouse flower is transplanted, and rough winds blow on it, it droopsand fades.The spring and summer of 1867 passed over with little of incident, saveone. We quitted Harrow, and the wrench was great. My brother had leftschool, and had gone to Cambridge; the master, who had lived with us forso long, had married and had gone to a house of his own; my motherthought that as she was growing older, the burden of management wasbecoming too heavy, and she desired to seek an easier life. She had savedmoney enough to pay for my brother's college career, and she determinedto invest the rest of her savings in a house in St. Leonard's, where shemight live for part of the year, letting the house during the season. Sheaccordingly took and furnished a house in Warrior Square, and we movedthither, saying farewell to the dear Old Vicarage, and the friends lovedfor so many happy years.At the end of the summer, my mother and I went down to Manchester, to paya long visit to the Roberts's; a very pleasant time we passed there, alarge part of mine being spent on horseback, either leaping over a bar inthe meadow, or scouring the country far and wide. A grave break, however,came in our mirth. The Fenian troubles were then at their height. OnSeptember 11th, Colonel Kelly and Captain Deasy, two Fenian leaders, werearrested in Manchester, and the Irish population was at once thrown intoa terrible ferment. On the 18th, the police van containing them wasreturning from the Court to the County Gaol at Salford, and as it reachedthe railway arch which crosses the Hyde Road at Bellevue, a man sprangout, shot one of the horses, and thus stopped the van. In a moment it wassurrounded by a small band, armed with revolvers and with crowbars, andthe crowbars were wrenching at the locked door. A reinforcement of policewas approaching, and there was no time to be lost. The rescuers called toBrett, a sergeant of police who was in charge inside the van, to pass thekeys out, and, on his refusal, there was a cry: "Blow off the lock!". Themuzzle of a revolver was placed against the lock, and the revolver wasdischarged. Unhappily, poor Brett had stooped down to try and see throughthe keyhole what was going on outside, and the bullet, fired to blow openthe lock, entered his head, and he fell dying on the floor. The rescuersrushed in, and one Allen, a lad of seventeen, opened the doors of thecompartments in which were Kelly and Deasy, and hurriedly pulled themout. Two or three of the band, gathering round them, carried them offacross the fields to a place of safety, while the rest gallantly threwthemselves between their rescued friends and the strong body of policewhich charged down after the fugitives. With their revolvers pointed,they kept back the police, until they saw that the two Fenian leaderswere beyond all chance of capture, and then they scattered, flying in alldirections. Young William Allen, whose one thought had been for hischiefs, was the earliest victim. As he fled, he raised his hand and firedhis revolver straight in the air; he had been ready to use it in defenceof others, he would not shed blood for himself. Disarmed by his own act,he was set upon by the police, brutally struck down, kicked and stoned byhis pursuers, and then, bruised and bleeding, he was dragged off to gaol,to meet there some of his comrades in much the same plight. The wholecity of Manchester went mad over the story, and the fiercestrace-passions at once blazed out into flame; it became dangerous for anIrish workman to be alone in a group of Englishmen, for an Englishman toventure into the Irish quarter of the city. The friends of the arrestedIrishmen went straight to "Lawyer Roberts", and begged his aid, and hethrew himself heart and soul into their defence. He soon found that theman who had fired the fatal shot was safe out of the way, having leftManchester at once, and he trusted that it would at least be possible tosave his clients from the death-penalty. A Special Commission was issued,with Mr. Justice Blackburn at its head. "They are going to send thathanging judge," groaned Mr. Roberts when he heard it, and we felt therewas small chance of escape for the prisoners. He struggled hard to havethe _venue_ of the trial changed, protesting that in the state ofexcitement in which Manchester was, there was no chance of obtaining animpartial jury. But the cry for blood and for revenge was ringing throughthe air, and of fairness and impartiality there was no chance. On the25th of October, the prisoners were actually brought up before themagistrates _in irons_, and Mr. Ernest Jones, the counsel briefed todefend them, after a vain protest against the monstrous outrage, threwdown his brief and quitted the Court. The trial was hurried on, and onOctober 29th, Allen, Larkin, Gould (O'Brien), Maguire, and Condon, stoodbefore their judges.We drove up to the court; the streets were barricaded; soldiers wereunder arms; every approach was crowded by surging throngs. At last, ourcarriage was stopped in the midst of excited Irishmen, and fists wereshaken in the window, curses levelled at the "d----d English who weregoing to see the boys murdered". For a moment things were uncomfortable,for we were five women of helpless type. Then I bethought myself that wewere unknown, and, like the saucy girl I was, I leant forward and touchedthe nearest fist. "Friends, these are Mr. Roberts' wife and daughters.""Roberts! Lawyer Roberts! God bless Roberts. Let his carriage through."And all the scowling faces became smile-wreathen, and cheers sounded outfor curses, and a road was cleared for us to the steps.Very sad was that trial. On the first day Mr. Roberts got himself intotrouble which threatened to be serious. He had briefed Mr. Digby Seymour,Q.C. as leader, with Mr. Ernest Jones, for the defence, and he did notthink that the jurymen proposed were challenged as they should be. Weknew that many whose names were called were men who had proclaimed theirhostility to the Irish, and despite the wrath of Judge Blackburn, Mr.Roberts would jump up and challenge them. In vain he threatened to committhe sturdy solicitor. "These men's lives are at stake, my lord," he saidindignantly. At last the officers of the court were sharply told: "Removethat man," but as they advanced reluctantly--for all poor men loved andhonored him--Judge Blackburn changed his mind and let him remain. At lastthe jury was empanelled, containing one man who had loudly proclaimedthat he "didn't care what the evidence was, he would hang every d----dIrishman of the lot". In fact, the verdict was a foregone conclusion. Themost disreputable evidence was admitted; the suppositions of women oflowest character were accepted as conclusive; the _alibi_ for Maguire--clearly proved, and afterwards accepted by the Crown, a free pardon beingissued on the strength of it--was rejected with dogged obstinacy; howpremeditated was the result may be guessed from the fact that I saw--withwhat shuddering horror may be estimated--some official in the room behindthe judges' chairs, quietly preparing the black caps before the verdicthad been given. The verdict of "Guilty" was repeated in each of the fivecases, and the prisoners were asked by the presiding judge if they hadanything to say why sentence should not be passed on them. Allen spokebriefly and bravely; he had not fired a shot, but he had helped to freeKelly and Deasy; he was willing to die for Ireland. The others followedin turn, Maguire protesting his innocence, and Condon declaring also thathe was not present (he also was reprieved). Then the sentence of deathwas passed, and "God save Ireland"! rang out in five clear voices inanswer from the dock.We had a sad scene that night; the young girl to whom poor Allen wasengaged was heartbroken at her lover's doom, and bitter were her cries to"save my William!". No protests, no pleas, however, availed to mitigatethe doom, and on November 23rd, Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien were hangedoutside Salford gaol. Had they striven for freedom in Italy, Englandwould have honored them as heroes; here she buried them as commonmurderers in quicklime in the prison yard.I have found, with a keen sense of pleasure, that Mr. Bradlaugh andmyself were in 1867 to some extent co-workers, although we knew not ofeach other's existence, and although he was doing much, and I only givingsuch poor sympathy as a young girl might, who was only just awakening tothe duty of political work. I read in the _National Reformer_ forNovember 24, 1867, that in the preceding week, he was pleading onClerkenwell Green for these men's lives:"According to the evidence at the trial, Deasy and Kelly were illegallyarrested. They had been arrested for vagrancy of which no evidence wasgiven, and apparently remanded for felony without a shadow ofjustification. He had yet to learn that in England the same state ofthings existed as in Ireland; he had yet to learn that an illegal arrestwas sufficient ground to detain any of the citizens of any country in theprisons of this one. If he were illegally held, he was justified in usingenough force to procure his release. Wearing a policeman's coat gave noauthority when the officer exceeded his jurisdiction. He had argued thisbefore Lord Chief Justice Erle in the Court of Common Pleas, and thatlearned judge did not venture to contradict the argument which hesubmitted. There was another reason why they should spare these men,although he hardly expected the Government to listen, because theGovernment sent down one of the judges who was predetermined to convictthe prisoners; it was that the offence was purely a political one. Thedeath of Brett was a sad mischance, but no one who read the evidencecould regard the killing of Brett as an intentional murder. Legally, itwas murder; morally, it was homicide in the rescue of a politicalcaptive. If it were a question of the rescue of the political captives ofVarignano, or of political captives in Bourbon, in Naples, or in Poland,or in Paris, even earls might be found so to argue. Wherein is our sisterIreland less than these? In executing these men, they would throw downthe gauntlet for terrible reprisals. It was a grave and solemn question.It had been said by a previous speaker that they were prepared to go toany lengths to save these Irishmen. They were not. He wished they were.If they were, if the men of England, from one end to the other, wereprepared to say, "These men shall not be executed," they would not be. Hewas afraid they had not pluck enough for that. Their moral courage wasnot equal to their physical strength. Therefore he would not say thatthey were prepared to do so. They must plead _ad misericordiam_. Heappealed to the press, which represented the power of England; to thatpress which in its panic-stricken moments had done much harm, and whichought now to save these four doomed men. If the press demanded it, noGovernment would be mad enough to resist. The memory of the blood whichwas shed in 1798 rose up like a bloody ghost against them to-day. He onlyfeared that what they said upon the subject might do the poor men moreharm than good. If it were not so, he would coin words that should speakin words of fire. As it was, he could only say to the Government: You arestrong to-day; you hold these men's lives in your hands; but if you wantto reconcile their country to you, if you want to win back Ireland, ifyou want to make her children love you--then do not embitter their heartsstill more by taking the lives of these men. Temper your strength withmercy; do not use the sword of justice like one of vengeance; for the daymay come when it shall be broken in your hands, and you yourselvesbrained by the hilt of the weapon you have so wickedly wielded."In October he had printed a plea for Ireland, strong and earnest,asking:--"Where is our boasted English freedom when you cross to Kingstown pier?Where has it been for near two years? The Habeas Corpus Act suspended,the gaols crowded, the steamers searched, spies listening at shebeenshops for sedition, and the end of it a Fenian panic in England. Oh,before it be too late, before more blood shall stain the pages of ourpresent history, before we exasperate and arouse bitter animosities, letus try and do justice to our sister land. Abolish once and for all theland laws, which in their iniquitous operation have ruined her peasantry.Sweep away the leech-like Church which has sucked her vitality, and hasgiven her back no word even of comfort in her degradation. Turn herbarracks into flax mills, encourage a spirit of independence in hercitizens, restore to her people the protection of the law, so that theymay speak without fear of arrest, and beg them to plainly and boldlystate their grievances. Let a commission of the best and wisest amongstIrishmen, with some of our highest English judges added, sit solemnly tohear all complaints, and then let us honestly legislate, not for thepunishment of the discontented, but to remove the causes of thediscontent. It is not the Fenians who have depopulated Ireland's strengthand increased her misery. It is not the Fenians who have evicted tenantsby the score. It is not the Fenians who have checked cultivation. Thosewho have caused the wrong at least should frame the remedy."VI.In December, 1867, I was married at St. Leonards, and after a brief tripto Paris and Southsea, we went to Cheltenham where Mr. Besant hadobtained a mastership. We lived at first in lodgings, and as I was verymuch alone, my love for reading had full swing. Quietly to myself Ifretted intensely for my mother, and for the daily sympathy andcomradeship that had made my life so fair. In a strange town, amongstrangers, with a number of ladies visiting me who talked only ofservants and babies--troubles of which I knew nothing--who wereprofoundly uninterested in everything that had formed my previous life,in theology, in politics, in questions of social reform, and who lookedon me as "strange" because I cared more for the great struggles outsidethan for the discussions of a housemaid's young man, or the amount of"butter when dripping would have done perfectly well, my dear," used bythe cook--under such circumstances it will not seem marvellous that Ifelt somewhat forlorn. I found refuge, however, in books, andenergetically carried on my favorite studies; next, I thought I would trywriting, and took up two very different lines of composition; I wrotesome short stories of a very flimsy type, and also a work of a much moreambitious character, "The Lives of the Black Letter Saints". For the sakeof the unecclesiastically trained it may be well to mention that in theCalendar of the Church of England there are a number of Saints' Days;some of these are printed in red, and are Red Letter Days, for whichservices are appointed by the Church; others are printed in black, andare Black Letter Days, and have no special services fixed for them. Itseemed to me that it would be interesting to take each of these days andwrite a sketch of the life of the saint belonging to it, and accordinglyI set to work to do so, and gathered various books of history and legendwherefrom to collect my "facts". I don't in the least know what became ofthat valuable book; I tried Macmillans with it, and it was sent on bythem to someone who was preparing a series of church books for the young;later I had a letter from a Church brotherhood offering to publish it, ifI would give it as an "act of piety" to their order; its ultimate fate isto me unknown.The short stories were more fortunate. I sent the first to the _FamilyHerald_, and some weeks afterwards received a letter from which dropped acheque as I opened it. Dear me! I have earned a good deal of money sinceby my pen, but never any that gave me the intense delight of that firstthirty shillings. It was the first money I had ever earned, and the prideof the earning was added to the pride of authorship. In my childishdelight and practical religion, I went down on my knees and thanked Godfor sending it to me, and I saw myself earning heaps of golden guineas,and becoming quite a support of the household. Besides, it was "my veryown", I thought, and a delightful sense of independence came over me. Ihad not then realised the beauty of the English law, and the dignifiedposition in which it placed the married woman; I did not understand thatall a married woman earned by law belonged to her owner, and that shecould have nothing that belonged to her of right.[1] I did not want themoney: I was only so glad to have something of my own to give, and it wasrather a shock to learn that it was not really mine at all.[Footnote 1: This odious law has now been altered, and a married woman isa person, not a chattel.]From time to time after that, I earned a few pounds for stories in thesame journal; and the _Family Herald,_ let me say, has one peculiaritywhich should render it beloved by poor authors; it pays its contributorwhen it accepts the paper, whether it prints it immediately or not; thusmy first story was not printed for some weeks after I received thecheque, and it was the same with all others accepted by the same journal.Encouraged by these small successes, I began writing a novel! It took along time to do, but was at last finished, and sent off to the _FamilyHerald._ The poor thing came back, but with a kind note, telling me thatit was too political for their pages, but that if I would write one of"purely domestic interest", and up to the same level, it would probablybe accepted. But by that time I was in the full struggle of theologicaldoubt, and that novel of "purely domestic interest" never got itselfwritten.I contributed further to the literature of my country a theologicalpamphlet, of which I forget the exact title, but it dealt with the dutyof fasting incumbent on all faithful Christians, and was very patristicin its tone.In January, 1869, my little son was born, and as I was very ill for somemonths before,--and was far too much interested in the tiny creatureafterwards, to devote myself to pen and paper, my literary career waschecked for a while. The baby gave a new interest and a new pleasure tolife, and as we could not afford a nurse I had plenty to do in lookingafter his small majesty. My energy in reading became less feverish whenit was done by the side of the baby's cradle, and the little one'spresence almost healed the abiding pain of my mother's loss.I may pass very quickly over the next two years. In August, 1870, alittle sister was born to my son, and the recovery was slow and tedious,for my general health had been failing for some time. I was, among otherthings, fretting much about my mother, who was in sore trouble. A lawyerin whom she had had the most perfect confidence betrayed it; for yearsshe had paid all her large accounts through him, and she had placed hermoney in his hands. Suddenly he was discovered by his partners to havebeen behaving unfairly; the crash came, and my mother found that all themoney given by her for discharge of liabilities had vanished, while theaccounts were unpaid, and that she was involved in debt to a very seriousextent. The shock was a very terrible one to her, for she was too old tobegin the world afresh. She sold off all she had, and used the money, asfar as it would go, to pay the debts she believed to have been long agodischarged, and she was thus left penniless after thinking she had made alittle competence for her old age. Lord Hatherley's influence obtainedfor my brother the post of undersecretary to the Society of Arts, andalso some work from the Patent Office, and my mother went to live withhim. But the dependence was intolerable to her, though she never letanyone but myself know she suffered, and even I, until her last illness,never knew how great her suffering had been. The feeling of debt weighedon her, and broke her heart; all day long while my brother was at hisoffice, through the bitter winter weather, she would sit without a fire,lighting it only a little before his home-coming, so that she might saveall the expense she could; often and often she would go out abouthalf-past twelve, saying that she was going out to lunch, and would walkabout till late in the afternoon, so as to avoid the lunch-hour at home.I have always felt that the winter of 1870-1 killed her, though she livedon for three years longer; it made her an old broken woman, and crushedher brave spirit. How often I have thought since: "If only I had not lefther! I should have seen she was suffering, and should have saved her."One little chance help I gave her, on a brief visit to town. She waslooking very ill, and I coaxed out of her that her back was alwaysaching, and that she never had a moment free from pain. Luckily I hadthat morning received a letter containing L2 2s. from my liberal _FamilyHerald_ editor, and as, glancing round the room, I saw there were onlyordinary chairs, I disregarded all questions as to the legal ownership ofthe money, and marched out without saying a word, and bought for L1 15s.a nice cushiony chair, just like one she used to have at Harrow, and hadit sent home to her. For a moment she was distressed, but I told her Ihad earned the money, and so she was satisfied. "Oh, the rest!" she saidsoftly once or twice during the evening. I have that chair still, andmean to keep it as long as I live.In the spring of 1871 both my children were taken ill with hooping-cough.The boy, Digby, vigorous and merry, fought his way through it with nodanger, and with comparatively little suffering; Mabel, the baby, hadbeen delicate since her birth; there had been some little difficulty ingetting her to breathe after she was born, and a slight tendencyafterwards to lung-delicacy. She was very young for so trying a diseaseas hooping-cough, and after a while bronchitis set in, and was followedby congestion of the lungs. For weeks she lay in hourly peril of death;we arranged a screen round the fire like a tent, and kept it full ofsteam to ease the panting breath, and there I sat all through those wearyweeks with her on my lap, day and night. The doctor said that recoverywas impossible, and that in one of the fits of coughing she must die; themost distressing thing was that at last the giving of a drop or two ofmilk brought on the terrible convulsive choking, and it seemed cruel totorture the apparently dying child. At length, one morning when thedoctor was there, he said that she could not last through the day; I hadsent for him hurriedly, for her body had swollen up rapidly, and I didnot know what had happened; the pleura of one lung had become perforated,and the air escaping into the cavity of the chest had caused theswelling; while he was there, one of the fits of coughing came on, and itseemed as though it would be the last; the doctor took a small bottle ofchloroform out of his pocket, and putting a drop on a handkerchief, heldit near the child's face, till the drug soothed the convulsive struggle."It can't do any harm at this stage," he said, "and it checks thesuffering." He went away, saying that he would return in the afternoon,but he feared he would never see the child alive again. One of thekindest friends I had in my married life was that same doctor, Mr.Lauriston Winterbotham; he was as good as he was clever, and, like somany of his noble, profession, he had the merits of discretion and ofsilence.That chance thought of his about the chloroform, verily, I believe, savedthe child's life. Whenever one of the convulsive fits was coming on Iused it, and so not only prevented to a great extent the violence of theattacks, but also the profound exhaustion that followed them, when ofbreath at the top of the throat showing that she still lived. At last,though more than once we had thought her dead, a change took place forthe better, and the child began slowly to mend. For years, however, thatstruggle for life left its traces on her, not only in seriouslung-delicacy but also in a form of epileptic fits. In her play she wouldsuddenly stop, and become fixed for about a minute, and then go on againas though nothing had occurred. On her mother a more permanent trace wasleft.Not unnaturally, when the child was out of danger, I collapsed from sheerexhaustion, and I lay in bed for a week. But an important change of minddated from those silent weeks with a dying child on my knees. There hadgrown up in my mind a feeling of angry resentment against the God who hadbeen for weeks, as I thought, torturing my helpless baby. For some monthsa stubborn antagonism to the Providence who ordained the sufferings oflife had been steadily increasing in me, and this sullen challenge, "IsGod good?" found voice in my heart during those silent nights and days.My mother's sufferings, and much personal unhappiness, had been,intensifying the feeling, and as I watched my baby in its agony, and feltso helpless to relieve, more than once the indignant cry broke from mylips: "How canst thou torture a baby so? What has she done that sheshould suffer so? Why dost thou not kill her at once, and let her be atpeace?" More than once I cried aloud: "O God, take the child, but do nottorment her." All my personal belief in God, all my intense faith in hisconstant direction of affairs, all my habit of continual prayer and ofrealisation of his presence, were against me now. To me he was not anabstract idea, but a living reality, and all my mother-heart rose up inrebellion against this person in whom I believed, and whose individualfinger I saw in my baby's agony.At this time I met a clergyman--I do not give his name lest I shouldinjure him--whose wider and more liberal views of Christianity exercisedmuch influence over me during the months of struggle that followed. Mr.Besant had brought him to me while the child was at her worst, and Isuppose something of the "Why is it?" had, unconsciously to me, shownitself to his keen eyes. On the day after his visit, I received from himthe following letter, in which unbeliever as well as believer mayrecognise the deep human sympathy and noble nature of the writer:--"April 21st, 1871."MY DEAR MRS. BESANT,--I am painfully conscious that I gave you butlittle help in your trouble yesterday. It is needless to say that it wasnot from want of sympathy. Perhaps it would be nearer the truth to saythat it was from excess of sympathy. I shrink intensely from meddlingwith the sorrow of anyone whom I feel to be of a sensitive nature.'The heart hath its own bitterness, and the stranger meddleth nottherewith.'It is to me a positively fearful thought that I might await a reflectionas  'And common was the common place,  And vacant chaff well meant for grain'.Conventional consolations, conventional verses out of the Bible andconventional prayers are, it seems to me, an intolerable aggravation ofsuffering. And so I acted on a principle that I mentioned to yourhusband, that 'there is no power so great as that of one human faithlooking upon another human faith'. The promises of God, the love ofChrist for little children, and all that has been given to us of hope andcomfort, are as deeply planted in your heart as in mine, and I did notcare to quote them. But when I talk face to face with one who is in soreneed of them, my faith in them suddenly becomes so vast andheart-stirring that I think I must help most by talking naturally, andletting the faith find its own way from soul to soul. Indeed I could notfind words for it if I tried. And yet I am compelled, as a messenger ofthe glad tidings of God, to solemnly assure you that all is well. We haveno key to the 'Mystery of Pain', excepting the Cross of Christ. But thereis another and a deeper solution in the hands of our Father. And it willbe ours when we can understand it. There is--in the place to which wetravel--some blessed explanation of your baby's pain and your grief,which will fill with light the darkest heart. Now you must believewithout having seen; that is true faith. You must  'Reach a hand through time to catch  The far-oft interest of tears'.That you may have strength so to do is part of your share in the prayersof yours very faithfully, W. D----."During the summer months I saw much of this clergyman, Mr. D---- and hiswife. We grew into closer intimacy in consequence of the dangerousillness of their only child, a beautiful boy a few months old. I hadgained quite a name in Cheltenham as a nurse--my praises having been sungby the doctor--and Mrs. D---- felt she could trust me even with herdarling boy while she snatched a night's sorely needed rest. Myquestionings were not shirked by Mr. D----, nor discouraged; he wasneither horrified nor sanctimoniously rebuking, but met them all with awide comprehension inexpressibly soothing to one writhing in the firstagony of real doubt. The thought of hell was torturing me; somehow out ofthe baby's pain through those seemingly endless hours had grown a dimrealisation of what hell might be, full of the sufferings of the beloved,and my whole brain and heart revolted from the unutterable cruelty of acreating and destroying God. Mr. D---- lent me Maurice and Robertson, andstrove to lead me into their wider hope for man, their more trustfulfaith in God.Everyone who has doubted after believing knows how, after the firstadmitted and recognised doubt, others rush in like a flood, and howdoctrine after doctrine starts up in new and lurid light, looking sodifferent in aspect from the fair faint outlines in which it had shoneforth in the soft mists of faith. The presence of evil and pain in theworld made by a "good God", and the pain falling on the innocent, as onmy seven months' old babe; the pain here reaching on into eternityunhealed; these, while I yet believed, drove me desperate, and I believedand hated, instead of like the devils, "believed and trembled". Next, Ichallenged the righteousness of the doctrine of the Atonement, and whileI worshipped and clung to the suffering Christ, I hated the God whorequired the death sacrifice at his hands. And so for months the turmoilwent on, the struggle being all the more terrible for the verydesperation with which I strove to cling to some planks of the wreckedship of faith on the tossing sea of doubt.After Mr. D---- left Cheltenham, as he did in the early autumn of 1871,he still aided me in my mental struggles. He had advised me to readMcLeod Campbell's work on the Atonement, as one that would meet many ofthe difficulties that lay on the surface of the orthodox view, and inanswer to a letter dealing with this really remarkable work, he wrote(Nov. 22, 1871):"(1) The two passages on pp. 25 and 108 you doubtless interpret quiterightly. In your third reference to pp. 117, 188, you forget one greatprinciple--that God is impassive; cannot suffer. Christ, qua _God_, didnot suffer, but as Son of _Man_ and in his _humanity_. Still, it may becorrectly stated that He felt to sin and sinners 'as God eternallyfeels'--_i.e., abhorrence of sin and love of the sinner_. But to inferfrom that that the Father in his Godhead feels the sufferings whichChrist experienced solely in humanity, and because incarnate, is, Ithink, wrong."(2) I felt strongly inclined to blow you up for the last part of yourletter. You assume, I think quite gratuitously, that God condemns themajor part of his children to objectless future suffering. You say thatif he does not, he places a book in their hands which threatens what hedoes not mean to inflict. But how utterly this seems to me opposed to thegospel of Christ. All Christ's reference to eternal punishment may beresolved into reference to the Valley of Hinnom, by way of imagery; withthe exception of the Dives parable, where is distinctly inferred a moralamendment beyond the grave. I speak of the unselfish desire of Dives tosave his brothers. The more I see of the controversy the more baselessdoes the eternal punishment theory appear. It seems, then, to me, thatinstead of feeling aggrieved and shaken, you ought to feel encouraged andthankful that God is so much better than you were taught to believe him.You will have discovered by this time, in Maurice's 'What is Revelation'(I suppose you have the 'Sequel' too?) that God's truth _is_ our truth,and his love is our love, only more perfect and full. There is noposition more utterly defeated in modern philosophy and theology, thanDean Mansel's attempt to show that God's justice, love, etc., aredifferent in kind from ours. Mill and Maurice, from totally alien pointsof view, have shown up the preposterous nature of the notion."(3) A good deal of what you have thought is, I fancy, based on a strangeforgetfulness of your former experience. If you have known Christ (whomto know is eternal life)--and that you have known him I am certain--canyou really say that a few intellectual difficulties, nay, a few moraldifficulties if you will, are able at once to obliterate the testimony ofthat higher state of being?"Why, the keynote of all my theology is that Christ is loveable because,and _just_ because, he is the perfection of all that I know to be nobleand generous, and loving, and tender, and true. If an angel from heavenbrought me a gospel which contained doctrines that would not stand thetest of such perfect loveableness--doctrines hard, or cruel, or unjust--Ishould reject him and his trumpery gospel with scorn, knowing thatneither could be Christ's."Know Christ and judge religions by him; don't judge him by religions,and then complain because you find yourself looking at him through ablood-colored glass...."I am saturating myself with Maurice, who is the antidote given by God tothis age against all dreary doubtings and temptings of the devil todespair."On these lines weary strife went on for months, until at last brain andhealth gave way completely, and for weeks I lay prostrate and helpless,in terrible ceaseless head-pain, unable to find relief in sleep. Thedoctor tried every form of relief in vain; he covered my head with ice,he gave me opium--which only drove me mad--he used every means his skillcould dictate to remove the pain, but all failed. At last he gave up theattempt to cure physically, and tried mental diversion; he brought me upbooks on anatomy and persuaded me to study them; I have still an analysismade by me at that time of Luther Holden's "Human Osteology ". He waswise enough to see that if I were to be brought back to reasonable life,it could only be by diverting thought from the currents in which it hadbeen running to a dangerous extent.No one who has not felt it knows the fearful agony caused by doubt to theearnestly religious mind. There is in this life no other pain sohorrible. The doubt seems to shipwreck everything, to destroy the onesteady gleam of happiness "on the other side" that no earthly storm couldobscure; to make all life gloomy with a horror of despair, a darknessthat may verily be felt. Fools talk of Atheism as the outcome of foullife and vicious thought. They, in their shallow heartlessness, theirbrainless stupidity, cannot even dimly imagine the anguish of the merepenumbra of the eclipse of faith, much less the horror of that greatdarkness in which the orphaned soul cries out into the infiniteemptiness: "Is it a Devil who has made this world? Are we the sentienttoys of an Almighty Power, who sports with our agony, and whose peals ofawful mocking laughter echo the wailings of our despair?"VII.On recovering from that prostrating physical pain, I came to a verydefinite decision. I resolved that, whatever might be the result, I wouldtake each dogma of the Christian religion, and carefully and thoroughlyexamine it, so that I should never again say "I believe" where I had notproved. So, patiently and steadily, I set to work. Four problems chieflyat this time pressed for solution. I. The eternity of punishment afterdeath. II. The meaning of "goodness" and "love" as applied to a God whohad made this world with all its evil and its misery. III. The nature ofthe atonement of Christ, and the "justice" of God in accepting avicarious suffering from Christ, and a vicarious righteousness from thesinner. IV. The meaning of "inspiration" as applied to the Bible, and thereconciliation of the perfection of the author with the blunders and theimmoralities of the work.Maurice's writings now came in for very careful study, and I read alsothose of Robertson, of Brighton, and of Stopford Brooke, striving to findin these some solid ground whereon I might build up a new edifice offaith. That ground, however, I failed to find; there were poetry, beauty,enthusiasm, devotion; but there was no rock on which I might take mystand. Mansel's Bampton lectures on "The Limits of Religious Thought"deepened and intensified my doubts. His arguments seemed to makecertainty impossible, and I could not suddenly turn round and believe toorder, as he seemed to recommend, because proof was beyond reach. I couldnot, and would not, adore in God as the highest Righteousness that which,in man was condemned as harsh, as cruel, and as unjust.In the midst of this long mental struggle, a change occurred in theoutward circumstances of my life. I wrote to Lord Hatherley and asked himif he could give Mr. Besant a Crown living, and he offered us first onein Northumberland, near Alnwick Castle, and then one in Lincolnshire, thevillage of Sibsey, with a vicarage house, and an income of L410 perannum. We decided to accept the latter.The village was scattered over a considerable amount of ground, but thework was not heavy. The church was one of the fine edifices for which thefen country is so famous, and the vicarage was a comfortable house, withlarge and very beautiful gardens and paddock, and with outlying fields.The people were farmers and laborers, with a sprinkling of shopkeepers;the only "society" was that of the neighboring clergy, Tory and prim toan appalling extent. There was here plenty of time for study, and of thattime I vigorously availed myself. But no satisfactory light came to me,and the suggestions and arguments of my friend Mr. D---- failed to bringconviction to my mind. It appeared clear to me that the doctrine ofEternal Punishment was taught in the Bible, and the explanations given ofthe word "eternal" by men like Maurice and Stanley, did not recommendthemselves to me as anything more than skilful special pleading--evasions, not clearings up, of a moral difficulty. For the problem was:Given a good God, how can he have created mankind, knowing beforehandthat the vast majority of those whom he had created were to be torturedfor evermore? Given a just God, how can he punish people for beingsinful, when they have inherited a sinful nature without their own choiceand of necessity? Given a righteous God, how can he allow sin to existfor ever, so that evil shall be as eternal as good, and Satan shall reignin hell, as long as Christ in Heaven? The answer of the Broad churchschool was, that the word "eternal" applied only to God and to life whichwas one with his; that "everlasting" only meant "lasting for an age", andthat while the punishment of the wicked might endure for ages it waspurifying, not destroying, and at last all should be saved, and "Godshould be all in all". These explanations had (for a time) satisfied Mr.D----, and I find him writing to me in answer to a letter of mine datedMarch 25th, 1872:"On the subject of Eternal punishment I have now not the remotest doubt.It is impossible to handle the subject exhaustively in a letter, with asermon to finish before night. But you _must_ get hold of a few valuablebooks that would solve all kinds of difficulties for you. For most pointsread Stopford Brooke's Sermons--they are simply magnificent, and arecalled (1) Christian modern life, (2) Freedom in the Church of England,(3) and (least helpful) 'Sermons'. Then again there is an appendix toLlewellyn Davies' 'Manifestation of the Son of God', which treats offorgiveness in a future state as related to Christ and Bible. As to thatspecial passage about the Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost (to which yourefer), I will write you my notions on it in a future letter."A little later, according, he wrote:"With regard to your passage of difficulty about the unpardonable sin, Iwould say: (1) If that sin is not to be forgiven in the world to come, itis implied that all other sins _are forgiven in the world to come_. (2)You must remember that our Lord's parables and teachings mainly concernedcontemporary events and people. I mean, for instance, that in his greatprophecy of _judgment_ he simply was speaking of the destruction of theJewish polity and nation. The _principles_ involved apply through alltime, but He did not apply them except to the Jewish nation. He wasspeaking then, not of 'the end of the _world_, (as is wronglytranslated), but of 'the end of the _age_'. (Every age is wound up with ajudgment. French Revolutions, Reformations, etc., are all ends of agesand judgments.) [Greek aion] does not, cannot, will not, and never didmean _world_, but _age_. Well, then, he has been speaking of the Jewishpeople. And he says that all words spoken against the Son of Man will beforgiven. But there is a blasphemy against the Holy Spirit of God--thereis a confusion of good with evil, of light with darkness--which goesdeeper down than this. When a nation has lost the faculty ofdistinguishing love from hatred, the spirit of falsehood and hypocrisyfrom the spirit of truth, God from the Devil--_then its doom ispronounced_--the decree is gone forth against it. As the doom of Judaism,guilty of this sin, _was then_ pronounced. As the _decree against it hadalready gone forth. It is a national warning, not an individual one. Itapplies to two ages of this world, and not to two worlds_. All itsteaching was primarily _national_, and is only thus to be rightly read--if not all, rather _most of it_. If you would be sure of this andunderstand it, see the parables, etc., explained in Maurice's 'Gospel ofthe Kingdom of Heaven' (a commentary on S. Luke). I can only indicatebriefly in a letter the line to be taken on this question."With regard to the [Greek: elui, elui, lama sabbachthani]. I don'tbelieve that the Father even momentarily hid his face from Him. The lifeof sonship was unbroken. Remark: (1) It is a quotation from a Psalm. (2)It rises naturally to a suffering man's lips as expressive of agony,though not exactly framed for _his_ individual _agony_. (3) The spirit ofthe Psalm is one of trust, and hope, and full faith, notwithstanding the1st verse. (4) Our Lord's agony was very extreme, not merely of body butof _soul_. He spoke out of the desolation of one forsaken, not by hisdivine Father but by his human brothers. I have heard sick and dying menuse the words of beloved Psalms in just such a manner."The impassibility of God (1) With regard to the Incarnation, thispresents no difficulty. Christ suffered simply and entirely as man, wastoo truly a man not to do so. (2) With regard to the Father, the key ofit is here. 'God _is_ love.' He does not need suffering to train intosympathy, because his nature is sympathy. He can afford to dispense withhysterics, because he sees ahead that his plan is working to the perfectresult. I am not quite sure whether I have hit upon your difficulty here,as I have destroyed your last letter but one. But the 'Gospel of theKingdom' is a wonderful 'eye-opener'."Worst of all the puzzles, perhaps, was that of the existence of evil andof misery, and the racking doubt whether God _could_ be good, and yetlook on the evil and the misery of the world unmoved and untouched. Itseemed so impossible to believe that a Creator could be either cruelenough to be indifferent to the misery, or weak enough to be unable tostop it: the old dilemma faced me unceasingly. "If he can prevent it, anddoes not, he is not good; if he wishes to prevent it, and cannot, he isnot almighty;" and out of this I could find no way of escape. Not yet hadany doubt of the existence of God crossed my mind.In August, 1872 Mr. D---- tried to meet this difficulty. He wrote:"With regard to the impassibility of God, I think there is a stone wrongamong your foundations which causes your difficulty. Another wrong stoneis, I think, your view of the nature of the _sin_ and _error_ which issupposed to grieve God. I take it that sin is an absolutely necessaryfactor in the production of the perfect man. It was foreseen and allowedas a means to an end--as in fact an _education_."The view of all the sin and misery in the world cannot grieve God, anymore than it can grieve you to see Digby fail in his first attempt tobuild a card-castle or a rabbit-hutch. All is part of the training. Godlooks at the ideal man to which all tends. The popular idea of the fallis to me a very absurd one. There was never an ideal state in the past,but there will be in the future. The Genesis allegory simply typifies thefirst awakening of consciousness of good and evil--of two _wills_ in amind hitherto only animal-psychic."Well then--there being no occasion for grief in watching the progress ofhis own perfect and unfailing plans--your difficulty in God'simpassibility vanishes. Christ, _qua_ God, was, of course, impassibletoo. It seems to me that your position implies that God's 'designs' havepartially (at least) failed, and hence the grief of perfect benevolence.Now I stoutly deny that any jot or tittle of God's plans can fail. Ibelieve in the ordering of all for the best. I think that the painconsequent on broken law is only an inevitable necessity, over which weshall some day rejoice."The indifference shown to God's love cannot pain Him. Why? because it issimply a sign of defectiveness in the creature which the ages willrectify. The being who is indifferent is not yet educated up to the pointof love. But he _will be_. The pure and holy suffering of Christ was(pardon me) _wholly_ the consequence of his human nature. True it wasbecause of the _perfection_ of his humanity. But his Divinity had nothingto do with it. It was his _human heart_ that broke. It was because heentered a world of broken laws and of incomplete education that he becameinvolved in suffering with the rest of his race....."No, Mrs. Besant; I never feel at all inclined to give up the search, orto suppose that the other side may be right. I claim no merit for it, butI have an invincible faith in the morality of God and the moral order ofthe world. I have no more doubt about the falsehood of the populartheology than I have about the unreality of six robbers who attacked methree nights ago in a horrid dream. I exult and rejoice in the grandeurand freedom of the little bit of truth it has been given me to see. I amtold that 'Present-day Papers', by Bishop Ewing (edited) are a wonderfulhelp, many of them, to puzzled people: I mean to get them. But I am sureyou will find that the truth will (even so little as we may be able tofind out) grow on you, make you free, light your path, and dispel, at nodistant time, your _painful_ difficulties and doubts. I should say on noaccount give up your reading. I think with you that you could not dowithout it. It will be a wonderful source of help and peace to you. Forthere are struggles far more fearful than those of intellectual doubt. Iam keenly alive to the gathered-up sadness of which your last two pagesare an expression. I was sorrier than I can say to read them. Theyreminded me of a long and very dark time in my own life, when I thoughtthe light never would come. Thank God it came, or I think I could nothave held out much longer. But you have evidently strength to bear itnow. The more dangerous time, I should fancy, has passed. You will haveto mind that the fermentation leaves clear spiritual wine, and not (astoo often) vinegar."I wish I could write something more helpful to you in this great matter.But as I sit in front of my large bay window, and see the shadows on thegrass and the sunlight on the leaves, and the soft glimmer of therosebuds left by the storms, I cannot but believe that all will be verywell. 'Trust in the Lord; wait patiently for him'--they are trite words.But he made the grass, the leaves, the rosebuds, and the sunshine, and heis the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. And now the trite words haveswelled into a mighty argument."Despite reading and argument, my scepticism grew only deeper and deeper.The study of W.R. Greg's "Creed of Christendom", of Matthew Arnold's"Literature and Dogma", helped to widen the mental horizon, while makinga return to the old faith more and more impossible. The church serviceswere a weekly torture, but feeling as I did that I was only a doubter, Ispoke to none of my doubts. It was possible, I felt, that all mydifficulties might be cleared up, and I had no right to shake the faithof others while in uncertainty myself. Others had doubted and hadafterwards believed; for the doubter silence was a duty; the blinded hadbetter keep their misery to themselves. I found some practical relief inparish work of a non-doctrinal kind, in nursing the sick, in trying tobrighten a little the lot of the poor of the village. But here, again, Iwas out of sympathy with most of those around me. The movement among theagricultural laborers, due to the energy and devotion of Joseph Arch, wasbeginning to be talked of in the fens, and bitter were the comments ofthe farmers on it, while I sympathised with the other side. One typicalcase, which happened some months later, may stand as example of all.There was a young man, married, with two young children, who was wickedenough to go into a neighboring county to a "Union Meeting", and who was,further, wicked enough to talk about it when he returned. He became amarked man; no farmer would employ him. He tramped about vainly, lookingfor work, grew reckless, and took to drink. Visiting his cottage one dayI found his wife ill, a dead child in the bed, a sick child in her arms;yes, she "was pining; there was no work to be had". "Why did she leavethe dead child on the bed? because there was no other place to put it."The cottage consisted of one room and a "lean-to", and husband and wife,the child dead of fever and the younger child sickening with it, were allobliged to lie on the one bed. In another cottage I found fourgenerations sleeping in one room, the great-grandfather and his wife, thegrandmother (unmarried), the mother (unmarried), and the little child,while three men-lodgers completed the tale of eight human beings crowdedinto that narrow, ill-ventilated garret. Other cottages were hovels,through the broken roofs of which poured the rain, and wherein rheumatismand ague lived with the dwellers. How could I do aught but sympathisewith any combination that aimed at the raising of these poor? But tosympathise with Joseph Arch was a crime in the eyes of the farmers, whoknew that his agitation meant an increased drain on their pockets. For itnever struck them that, if they paid less in rent to the absent landlord,they might pay more in wage to the laborers who helped to make theirwealth, and they had only civil words for the burden that crushed them,and harsh ones for the builders-up of their ricks and the mowers of theirharvests. They made common cause with their enemy, instead of with theirfriend, and instead of leaguing themselves with the laborers, as formingtogether the true agricultural interest, they leagued themselves with thelandlords against the laborers, and so made fratricidal strife instead ofeasy victory over the common foe.In the summer and autumn of 1872, I was a good deal in London with mymother.--My health had much broken down, and after a severe attack ofcongestion of the lungs, my recovery was very slow. One Sunday in London,I wandered into St. George's Hall, in which Mr. Charles Voysey waspreaching, and there I bought some of his sermons. To my delight I foundthat someone else had passed through the same difficulties as I abouthell and the Bible and the atonement and the character of God, and hadgiven up all these old dogmas, while still clinging to belief in God. Iwent to St. George's Hall again on the following Sunday, and in thelittle ante-room, after the service, I found myself in a stream ofpeople, who were passing by Mr. and Mrs. Voysey, some evidently known tohim, some strangers, many of the latter thanking him for his morning'swork. As I passed in my turn I said: "I must thank you for very greathelp in what you have said this morning", for indeed the possibilityopened of a God who was really "loving unto every man", and in whose careeach was safe for ever, had come like a gleam of light across the stormysea of doubt and distress on which I had been tossing for nearly twelvemonths. On the following Sunday, I saw them again, and was cordiallyinvited down to their Dulwich home, where they gave welcome to all indoubt. I soon found that the Theism they professed was free from thedefects which revolted me in Christianity. It left me God as a SupremeGoodness, while rejecting all the barbarous dogmas of the Christianfaith. I now read Theodore Parker's "Discourse on Religion", FrancisNewman's "Hebrew Monarchy", and other works, many of the essays of MissFrances Power Cobbe and of other Theistic writers, and I no longerbelieved in the old dogmas and hated while I believed; I no longerdoubted whether they were true or not; I shook them off, once for all,with all their pain, and horror, and darkness, and felt, with relief andjoy inexpressible, that they were all but the dreams of ignorant andsemi-savage minds, not the revelation of a God. The last remnant ofChristianity followed swiftly these cast-off creeds, though, in partingwith this, one last pang was felt. It was the doctrine of the Deity ofChrist. The whole teaching of the Broad Church School tends, of course,to emphasise the humanity at the expense of the Deity of Christ, and whenthe eternal punishment and the substitutionary atonement had vanished,there seemed to be no sufficient reason left for so stupendous a miracleas the incarnation of the Deity. I saw that the idea of incarnation wascommon to all Eastern creeds, not peculiar to Christianity; the doctrineof the unity of God repelled the doctrine of the incarnation of a portionof the Godhead. But the doctrine was dear from association; there wassomething at once soothing and ennobling in the idea of a union betweenMan and God, between a perfect man and divine supremacy, between a humanheart and an almighty strength. Jesus as God was interwoven with all art,with all beauty in religion; to break with the Deity of Jesus was tobreak with music, with painting, with literature; the Divine Child in hismother's arms, the Divine Man in his Passion and in his triumph, thehuman friend encircled with the majesty of the Godhead--did inexorableTruth demand that this ideal figure, with all its pathos, its beauty, itshuman love, should pass into the Pantheon of the dead Gods of the Past?VIII.The struggle was a sharp one ere I could decide that intellectual honestydemanded that the question of the Deity of Christ should be analysed asstrictly as all else, and that the conclusions come to from an impartialstudy of facts should be faced as steadily as though they dealt with someunimportant question. I was bound to recognise, however, that more thanintellectual honesty would be here required, for if the result of thestudy were--as I dimly felt it would be--to establish disbelief in thesupernatural claims of Christ, I could not but feel that such disbeliefwould necessarily entail most unpleasant external results. I might giveup belief in all save this, and yet remain a member of the Church ofEngland: views on Inspiration, on Eternal Torture, on the VicariousAtonement, however heterodox, might be held within the pale of theChurch; many broad church clergymen rejected these as decidedly as I didmyself, and yet remained members of the Establishment; the judgment on"Essays and Reviews" gave this wide liberty to heresy within the Church,and a laywoman might well claim the freedom of thought legally bestowedon divines. The name "Christian" might well be worn while Christ wasworshipped as God, and obeyed as the "Revealer of the Father's will",the "well-beloved Son", the "Savior and Lord of men". But once challengethat unique position, once throw off that supreme sovereignty, and thenit seemed to me that the name "Christian" became a hypocrisy, and itsrenouncement a duty incumbent on an upright mind. But I was a clergyman'swife; my position made my participation in the Holy Communion anecessity, and my withdrawal therefrom would be an act marked andcommented upon by all. Yet if I lost my faith in Christ, how could Ihonestly approach "the Lord's Table", where Christ was the central figureand the recipient of the homage paid there by every worshipper to "Godmade man"? Hitherto mental pain alone had been the price demandedinexorably from the searcher after truth; now to the inner would be addedthe outer warfare, and how could I tell how far this might carry me?One night only I spent in this struggle over the question: "Shall Iexamine the claims to Deity of Jesus of Nazareth?". When morning brokethe answer was clearly formulated: "Truth is greater than peace orposition. If Jesus be God, challenge will not shake his Deity; if he beMan, it is blasphemy to worship him." I re-read Liddon's "BamptonLectures" on this controversy and Renan's "Vie de Jesus". I studied theGospels, and tried to represent to myself the life there outlined; Itested the conduct there given as I should have tested the conduct of anyordinary historical character; I noted that in the Synoptics no claim toDeity was made by Jesus himself, nor suggested by his disciples; Iweighed his own answer to an enquirer, with its plain disavowal ofGodhood: "Why callest thou me good? There is none good save one, that isGod" (Matt, xix., 17); I conned over his prayers to "my Father", his reston divine protection, his trust in a power greater than his own; I notedhis repudiation of divine knowledge: "Of that day and that hour knowethno man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, _neither the Son_, butthe Father" (Mark xiii., 32); I studied the meaning of his prayer ofanguished submission: "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup passfrom me! nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matt, xxvi.,39); I dwelt on his bitter cry in his dying agony: "My God, my God, whyhast thou forsaken me?" (Matt, xxvii., 46); I asked the meaning of thefinal words of rest: "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit" (Lukexxiii., 46). And I saw that, if there were any truth in the Gospels atall, they told the story of a struggling, suffering, sinning, prayingman, and not of a God at all and the dogma of the Deity of Christfollowed the rest of the Christian doctrines into the limbo of pastbeliefs.Yet one other effort I made to save myself from the difficulties Iforesaw in connexion with this final breach with Christianity. There wasone man who had in former days wielded over me a great influence, onewhose writings had guided and taught me for many years--Dr. Pusey, thevenerable leader of the Catholic party in the Church, the learnedPatristic scholar, full of the wisdom of antiquity. He believed in Christas God; what if I put my difficulties to him? If he resolved them for meI should escape the struggle I foresaw; if he could not resolve them,then no answer to them was to be hoped for. My decision was quickly made;being with my mother, I could write to him unnoticed, and I sat down andput my questions clearly and fully, stating my difficulties and askinghim whether, out of his wider knowledge and deeper reading, he couldresolve them for me. I wish I could here print his answer, together withtwo or three other letters I received from him, but the packet wasunfortunately stolen from my desk and I have never recovered it. Dr.Pusey advised me to read Liddon's "Bampton Lectures", referred me tovarious passages, chiefly from the Fourth Gospel, if I remember rightly,and invited me to go down to Oxford and talk over my difficulties.Liddon's "Bampton Lectures" I had thoroughly studied, and the FourthGospel had no weight with me, the arguments in favor of its Alexandrianorigin being familiar to me, but I determined to accept his invitation toa personal interview, regarding it as the last chance of remaining in theChurch.To Oxford, accordingly, I took the train, and made my way to the famousDoctor's rooms. I was shown in, and saw a short, stout gentleman, dressedin a cassock, and looking like a comfortable monk; but the keen eyes,steadfastly gazing straight into mine, told me of the power and subtletyhidden by the unprepossessing form. The head was fine and impressive, thevoice low, penetrating, drilled into a somewhat monotonous andartificially subdued tone. I quickly found that no sort of enlightenmentcould possibly result from our interview. He treated me as a penitentgoing to confession, seeking the advice of a director, not as an enquirerstruggling after truth, and resolute to obtain some firm standing-groundin the sea of doubt, whether on the shores of orthodoxy or of heresy. Hewould not deal with the question of the Deity of Jesus as a question forargument; he reminded me: "You are speaking of your judge," when Ipressed some question. The mere suggestion of an imperfection in Jesus'character made him shudder in positive pain, and he checked me withraised hand, and the rebuke: "You are blaspheming; the very thought is aterrible sin". I asked him if he could recommend to me any books whichwould throw light on the subject: "No, no, you have read too muchalready. You must pray; you must pray." Then, as I said that I could notbelieve without proof, I was told: "Blessed are they that have not seen,and yet have believed," and my further questioning was checked by themurmur: "O my child, how undisciplined! how impatient!". Truly, he musthave found in me--hot, eager, passionate in my determination to know,resolute not to profess belief while belief was absent--but very littleof that meek, chastened, submissive spirit to which he was accustomed inthe penitents wont to seek his counsel as their spiritual guide. In vaindid he bid me pray as though I believed; in vain did he urge the duty ofblind submission to the authority of the Church, of yielding, unreasoningfaith, which received but questioned not. He had no conception of thefeelings of the sceptical spirit; his own faith was solid as a rock--firm, satisfied, unshakeable; he would as soon have committed suicide ashave doubted of the infallibility of the "Universal Church"."It is not your duty to ascertain the truth," he told me sternly. "It isyour duty to accept and to believe the truth as laid down by the Church;at your peril you reject it; the responsibility is not yours so long asyou dutifully accept that which the Church has laid down for youracceptance. Did not the Lord promise that the presence of the Spiritshould be ever with his Church, to guide her into all truth?""But the fact of the promise and its value are the very points on which Iam doubtful," I answered.He shuddered. "Pray, pray," he said. "Father, forgive her, for she knowsnot what she says."It was in vain I urged that I had everything to gain and nothing to loseby following his directions, but that it seemed to me that fidelity totruth forbade a pretended acceptance of that which was not believed."Everything to lose? Yes, indeed. You will be lost for time and lost foreternity.""Lost or not," I rejoined, "I must and will try to find out what is true,and I will not believe till I am sure.""You have no right to make terms with God," he answered, "as to what youwill believe and what you will not believe. You are full of intellectualpride."I sighed hopelessly. Little feeling of pride was there in me just then,and I felt that in this rigid unyielding dogmatism there was nocomprehension of my difficulties, no help for me in my strugglings. Irose and, thanking him for his courtesy, said that I would not waste histime further, that I must go home and just face the difficulties out,openly leaving the Church and taking the consequences. Then for the firsttime his serenity was ruffled."I forbid you to speak of your disbelief," he cried. "I forbid you tolead into your own lost state the souls for whom Christ died."Slowly and sadly I took my way back to the station, knowing that my lastchance of escape had failed me. I recognised in this famous divine thespirit of the priest, which could be tender and pitiful to the sinner,repentant, humble, submissive, craving only for pardon and for guidance,but which was iron to the doubter, to the heretic, and would crush outall questionings of "revealed truth", silencing by force, not byargument, all challenge of the traditions of the Church. Out of such menwere made the Inquisitors of the Middle Ages, perfectly conscientious,perfectly rigid, perfectly merciless to the heretic. To them hereticswere and are centres of infectious disease, and charity to them "theworst cruelty to the souls of men". Certain that they hold "by no meritof our own, but by the mercy of our God the one truth which he hathrevealed", they can permit no questionings, they can accept nought butthe most complete submission. But while man aspires after truth, whilehis brain yearns after knowledge, while his intellect soars upward intothe heaven of speculation and "beats the air with tireless wing", so longshall those who demand faith be met by challenge for proof, and those whowould blind him shall be defeated by his determination to gazeunblenching on the face of Truth, even though her eyes should turn himinto stone.During this same visit to London I saw Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Scott for thefirst time. I had gone down to Dulwich to see Mr. and Mrs. Voysey, andafter dinner we went over to Upper Norwood, and I was introduced to oneof the most remarkable men I have ever met. At that time Mr. Scott was anold man, with beautiful white hair, and eyes like those of a hawkgleaming from under shaggy eyebrows; he had been a man of magnificentphysique, and though his frame was then enfeebled, the splendid lion-likehead kept its impressive strength and beauty, and told of a uniquepersonality. Of Scotch descent and wellborn, Thomas Scott had, as a boy,been a page at the French Court; his manhood was spent in many lands, forhe "was a mighty hunter", though not "before the Lord". He had lived formonths among the North American Indians, sharing the hardships of theirwild life; he had hunted and fished all over the world. At last, he camehome, married, and ultimately settled down at Ramsgate, where he made hishome a centre of heretical thought. He issued an enormous number oftracts and pamphlets, and each month he sent out a small packet tohundreds of subscribers and friends. This monthly issue of hereticalliterature soon made itself a power in the world of thought; the tractswere of various shades of opinion, but were all heretical: some moderate,some extreme; all were well-written, cultured and polished in tone--thiswas a rule to which Mr. Scott made no exceptions; his writers might saywhat they liked, but they must have something real to say, and they mustsay that something in good English. The little white packets found theirway into many a quiet country parsonage, into many a fashionable home.His correspondence was world-wide and came from all classes--now a letterfrom a Prime Minister, now one from a blacksmith. All were equallywelcome, and all were answered with equal courtesy. At his house metpeople of the most varying opinions. Colenso, Bishop of Natal, EdwardMaitland, E. Vansittart Neale, Charles Bray, Sara Hennell, W.J. Birch, R.Suffield, and hundreds more, clerics and laymen, scholars and thinkers,all gathered in this one home, to which the right of _entree_ was gainedonly by love of Truth and desire to spread Freedom among men.Mr. Scott devoted his fortune to this great work. He would never letpublishers have his pamphlets in the ordinary way of trade, but issuedthem all himself and distributed them gratuitously. If anyone desired tosubscribe, well and good, they might help in the work, but make it amatter of business he would not. If anyone sent money for some tracts, hewould send out double the worth of the money enclosed, and thus for yearshe carried on this splendid propagandist work. In all he was noblyseconded by his wife, his "right hand" as he well named her, a sweet,strong, gentle, noble woman, worthy of her husband, and than that nohigher praise can be spoken. Of both I shall have more to say hereafter,but at present we are at the time of my first visit to them at UpperNorwood, whither they had removed from Ramsgate.Kindly greeting was given by both, and on Mr. Voysey suggesting thatjudging by one essay of mine that he had seen--an essay which was laterexpanded into the one on "Inspiration", in the Scott series--my pen wouldbe useful for propagandist work, Mr. Scott bade me try what I could do,and send him for criticism anything I thought good enough forpublication; he did not, of course, promise to accept an essay, but hepromised to read it. A question arose as to the name to be attached tothe essay, in case of publication, and I told him that my name was not myown to use, and that I did not suppose that Mr. Besant could possibly, inhis position, give me permission to attach it to a heretical essay; weagreed that any essays I might write should for the present be publishedanonymously, and that I should try my hand to begin with on the subjectof the "Deity of Jesus of Nazareth". And so I parted from those who wereto be such good friends to me in the coming time of struggle.IX.My resolve was now made, and henceforth there was at least no more doubtso far as my position towards the Church was concerned. I made up my mindto leave it, but was willing to make the leaving as little obtrusive aspossible. On my return to Sibsey I stated clearly the ground on which Istood. I was ready to attend the Church services, joining in such partsas were addressed to "the Supreme Being", for I was still heartilyTheistic; "the Father", shorn of all the horrible accessories hung roundhim by Christianity, was still to me an object of adoration, and I couldstill believe in and worship One who was "righteous in all His ways, andholy in all His works", although the Moloch to whom was sacrificed thewell-beloved son had passed away for ever from my creed. Christian I wasnot, though Theist I was, and I felt that the wider and more generousfaith would permit me to bow to the common God with my Christianbrethren, if only I was not compelled to pay homage to that "Son of Man"whom Christians believed divine, homage which to me had become idolatry,insulting to the "One God", to him of whom Jesus himself had spoken as of"my God and your God".Simply enough was the difficulty arranged for the moment. It was agreedthat I should withdraw myself from the "Holy Communion"--for in thatservice, full of the recognition of Jesus as Deity, I could not joinwithout hypocrisy. The ordinary services I would attend, merely remainingsilent during those portions of them in which I could not honestly takepart, and while I knew that these changes in a clergyman's wife could notpass unnoticed in a country village, I yet felt that nothing less thanthis was consistent with barest duty. While I had merely doubted, I hadkept silence, and no act of mine had suggested doubt to others. Now thatI had no doubt that Christianity was a delusion, I would no longer act asthough I believed that to be of God which heart and intellect rejected asuntrue.For awhile all went smoothly. I daresay the parishioners gossipped aboutthe absence of their vicar's wife from the Sacrament, and indeed Iremember the pain and trembling wherewith, on the first "SacramentSunday" after my return, I rose from my seat and walked quietly from thechurch, leaving the white-spread altar. That the vicar's wife should"communicate" was as much a matter of course as that the vicar should"administer"; I had never in my life taken public part in anything thatmade me noticeable in any way among strangers, and still I can recall thefeeling of deadly sickness that well nigh overcame me, as rising to goout I felt that every eye in the church was on me, and that my exit wouldbe the cause of unending comment. As a matter of fact, everyone thoughtthat I was taken suddenly ill, and many were the calls and enquiries onthe following day. To any direct question, I answered quietly that I wasunable to take part in the profession of faith required from an honestcommunicant, but the statement was rarely necessary, for the idea ofheresy in a vicar's wife did not readily suggest itself to the ordinarybucolic mind, and I did not proffer information when it was unasked for.It happened that, shortly after that (to me) memorable Christmas of 1872,a sharp epidemic of typhoid fever broke out in the village of Sibsey. Thedrainage there was of the most primitive type, and the contagion spreadrapidly. Naturally fond of nursing, I found in this epidemic work justfitted to my hand, and I was fortunate enough to be able to lend personalhelp that made me welcome in the homes of the stricken poor. The motherswho slept exhausted while I watched beside their darlings' bedsides willnever, I like to fancy, think over harshly of the heretic whose hand wasas tender and often more skilful than their own. I think Mother Naturemeant me for a nurse, for I take a sheer delight in nursing anyone,provided only that there is peril in the sickness, so that there is thestrange and solemn feeling of the struggle between the human skill onewields and the supreme enemy, Death. There is a strange fascination infighting Death, step by step, and this is of course felt to the fullwhere one fights for life as life, and not for a life one loves. When thepatient is beloved, the struggle is touched with agony, but where onefights with Death over the body of a stranger, there is a weirdenchantment in the contest without personal pain, and as one forces backthe hated foe there is a curious triumph in the feeling which marks thedeath-grip yielding up its prey, as one snatches back to earth the lifewhich had well-nigh perished.Meanwhile, the promise to Mr. Scott was not forgotten, and I penned theessay on "The Deity of Jesus of Nazareth" which stands first in thecollection of essays published later under the title, "My Path toAtheism". The only condition annexed to my sending it to Mr. Scott wasthe perfectly fair one that if published it should appear without myname. Mr. Scott was well pleased with the essay, and before long it wasprinted as one of the "Scott Series", to my great delight.But unfortunately a copy sent to a relative of Mr. Besant's brought abouta storm. That gentlemen did not disagree with it--indeed he admitted thatall educated persons must hold the views put forward--but what wouldSociety say? What would "the county families" think if one of theclerical party was known to be a heretic. This dreadful little paper borethe inscription "By the wife of a beneficed clergyman"; what would happenif the "wife of the beneficed clergyman" were identified with Mrs. Besantof Sibsey?After some thought I made a compromise. Alter or hide my faith I wouldnot, but yield personal feelings I would. I gave up my correspondencewith Mr. and Mrs. Voysey, which might, it was alleged, he noticed in thevillage and so give rise to mischievous gossip. In this Mr. and Mrs.Voysey most generously helped me, bidding me rest assured of theircordial friendship while counselling me for awhile to cease thecorrespondence which was one of the few pleasures of my life, but was notpart of my duty to the higher and freer faith which we had all embraced.With keen regret I bade them for awhile farewell, and went back to mylonely life.In that spring of 1873, I delivered my first lecture. It was delivered tono one, queer as that may sound to my readers. And indeed, it was queeraltogether. I was learning to play the organ, and was in the habit ofpractising in the church by myself, without a blower. One day, beingsecurely locked in, I thought I would like to try how "it felt" to speakfrom the pulpit. Some vague fancies were stirring in me, that I couldspeak if I had the chance; very vague they were, for the notion that Imight ever speak on the platform had never dawned on me; only the longingto find outlet in words was in me; the feeling that I had something tosay, and the yearning to say it. So, queer as it may seem? I ascended thepulpit in the big, empty, lonely church, and there and then I deliveredmy first lecture! I shall never forget the feeling of power and ofdelight which came upon me as my voice rolled down the aisles, and thepassion in me broke into balanced sentences, and never paused forrhythmical expression, while I felt that all I wanted was to see thechurch full of upturned faces, instead of the emptiness of the silentpews. And as though in a dream the solitude became peopled, and I saw thelistening faces and the eager eyes, and as the sentences came unbiddenfrom my lips, and my own tones echoed back to me from the pillars of theancient church, I knew of a verity that the gift of speech was mine, andthat if ever--and it seemed then so impossible--if ever the chance cameto me of public work, that at least this power of melodious utteranceshould win hearing for any message I had to bring.But that knowledge remained a secret all to my own self for many a longmonth, for I quickly felt ashamed of that foolish speechifying in anempty church, and I only recall it now because, in trying to trace outone's mental growth, it is only fair to notice the first silly strivingafter that expression in spoken words, which, later, has become to me oneof the deepest delights of life. And indeed none can know save they whohave felt it what joy there is in the full rush of language which, movesand sways; to feel a crowd respond to the lightest touch; to see thefaces brighten or graven at your bidding; to know that the sources ofhuman passion and human emotion gush at the word of the speaker, as thestream from the riven rock; to feel that the thought that thrills througha thousand hearers has its impulse from you and throbs back to you thefuller from a thousand heart-beats; is there any joy in life morebrilliant than this, fuller of passionate triumph, and of the veryessence of intellectual delight?My pen was busy, and a second pamphlet, dealing with the Johanninegospel, was written and sent up to Mr. Scott under the same conditions ofanonymity as before, for it was seen that my authorship could in nowisebe suspected, and Mr. Scott paid me for my work. I had also made acollection of Theistic, but non-Christian, hymns, with a view of meetinga want felt by Mr. Voysey's congregation at St. George's Hall, and thiswas lying idle, while it might be utilised. So it was suggested that Ishould take up again my correspondence with Mr. and Mrs. Voysey, and gladenough was I to do so. During this time my health was rapidly failing,and in the summer of 1873 it broke down completely. At last I went up toLondon to consult a physician, and was told I was suffering from generalnervous exhaustion, which, was accompanied by much disturbance of thefunctions of the heart. "There is no organic disease yet," said Dr.Sibson, "but there soon will be, unless you can completely change yourmanner of life." Such a change was not possible, and I grew rapidlyworse. The same bad adviser who had before raised the difficulty of "whatwill Society say?" again interfered, and urged that pressure should beput on me to compel me at least to conform to the outward ceremonies ofthe Church, and to attend the Holy Communion. This I was resolved not todo, whatever might be the result of my "obstinacy ", and the result wasnot long in coming.I had been with the children to Southsea, to see if the change wouldrestore my shattered health, and stayed in town with my mother on myreturn under Dr. Sibson's care. Very skilful and very good to me was Dr.Sibson, giving me for almost nothing all the wealthiest could have boughtwith their gold, but he could not remove all then in my life which madethe re-acquiring of health impossible. What the doctor could not do,however, others did. It was resolved that I should either resumeattendance at the Communion, or should not return home; hypocrisy orexpulsion--such was the alternative; I chose the latter.A bitterly sad time followed; my dear mother was heartbroken; to her,with her wide and vague form of Christianity, loosely held, the intensityof my feeling that where I did not believe I would not pretend belief,was incomprehensible. She recognised far more fully than I all that aseparation from my home meant for me, and the difficulties which wouldsurround a young woman not yet six-and-twenty, living alone. She knew howbrutally the world judges, and how the mere fact that a woman is youngand alone justifies any coarseness of slander. Then, I did not guess howcruel men and women could be, but knowing it from eleven years'experience, I deliberately say that I would rather go through it allagain with my eyes wide open from the first, than have passed thoseeleven years "in Society" under the burden of an acted lie.But the struggle was hard when she prayed me for her sake to give way;against harshness I had been rigid as steel, but to remain steadfast whenmy darling mother, whom I loved as I loved nothing else on earth, beggedme on her knees to yield, was indeed hard. I felt as though it must be acrime to refuse submission when she urged it, but still--to live a lie?Not even for her was that possible.Then there were the children, the two little ones who worshipped me, Iwho was to them mother, nurse, and playfellow. Were these also to beresigned? For awhile, at least, this complete loss was spared me, forfacts (which I have not touched on in this record) came accidentally tomy brother's knowledge, and he resolved that I should have the protectionof legal separation, and should not be turned wholly penniless and aloneinto the world. So, when everything was arranged, I found myselfpossessed of my little girl, of complete personal freedom, and of a smallmonthly income sufficient for respectable starvation.X.The "world was all before us where to choose", but circumstances narrowedthe choice down to Hobson's. I had no ready money beyond the firstmonth's payment of my annuity; furnished lodgings were beyond my means,and I had nothing wherewith to buy furniture. My brother offered me ahome, on condition that I should give up my "heretical friends" and keepquiet; but, being freed from one bondage, nothing was further from mythoughts than to enter another. Besides, I did not choose to be a burdenon anyone, and I resolved to "get something to do", to rent a tiny house,and to make a nest where my mother, my little girl, and I could livehappily together. The difficulty was the "something"; I spent variousshillings in agencies, with a quite wonderful unanimity of failures. Itried to get some fancy needlework, advertised as an infallible source ofincome to "ladies in reduced circumstances"; I fitted the advertisementadmirably, for I was a lady, and my circumstances were decidedly reduced,but I only earned 4s. 6d. by weeks of stitching, and the materials costnearly as much as the finished work. I experimented with a Birminghamfirm, who generously offered everyone an opportunity of adding to theirincomes, and received in answer to the small fee demanded a pencil-case,with an explanation that I was to sell little articles of thatdescription--going as far as cruet-stands--to my friends; I did not feelequal to springing pencil-cases and cruet-stands casually on myacquaintances, so did not start in that business. It would be idle torelate all the things I tried, and failed in, until I began to think thatthe "something to do" was not so easy to find as I had expected.I made up my mind to settle at Upper Norwood, near Mr. and Mrs. Scott,who were more than good to me in my trouble; and I fixed on a very littlehouse in Colby Road, Gipsy Hill, to be taken from the ensuing Easter.Then came the question of furniture; a friend of Mr. Scott's gave me anintroduction to a manufacturer, who agreed to let me have furniture for abedroom and sitting-room, and to let me pay him by monthly instalments.The next thing was to save a few months' annuity, and so have a littlemoney in hand, wherewith to buy necessaries on starting, and to this endI decided to accept a loving invitation to Folkestone, where mygrandmother was living with two of my aunts, and there to seek someemployment, no matter what, provided it gave me food and lodging, andenabled me to put aside my few pounds a month.Relieved from the constant strain of fear and anxiety, my health wasquickly improving, and the improvement became more rapid after I wentdown with my mother to Folkestone. The hearty welcome offered to me therewas extended with equal warmth to little Mabel, who soon arrived, a mostforlorn little maiden. She was only three years old, and she had not seenme for some weeks; her passion of delight was pitiful; she clung to me,in literal fashion, for weeks afterwards, and screamed if she lost sightof me for a moment; it was long before she got over the separation andthe terror of her lonely journey from Sibsey and London in charge only ofthe guard. But she was a "winsome wee thing", and danced into everyone'sheart; after "mamma", "granny" was the prime favorite, and my dear motherworshipped her first grand-daughter; never was prettier picture than thered-golden hair nestled against the white, the baby-grace contrastingwith the worn stateliness of her tender nurse. From that time forward--with the exception of a few weeks of which I shall speak presently and ofthe yearly stay of a month with her father--little Mabel was my constantcompanion, until Sir George Jessel's brutality robbed me of my child. Shewould play contentedly while I was working, a word now and again enoughto make her happy; when I had to go out without her she would run to thedoor with me, and the "good-bye" came from down-curved lips, and she wasever watching at the window for my return, and the sunny face was alwaysthe first to welcome me home. Many and many a time have I been cominghome, weary and heart-sick, and the glimpse of the little face watchinghas reminded me that I must not carry in a grave face to sadden mydarling, and the effort to throw off the dreariness for her sake shook itoff altogether, and brought back the sunshine. I have never forgiven SirGeorge Jessel, and I never shall, though his death has left me only hismemory to hate.At Folkestone, I continued my search for "something to do", and for someweeks sought for pupils, thinking I might thus turn my heresy to account.But pupils are not readily attainable by a heretic woman, away from hernatural home, and with a young child as "encumbrance". It chanced,however, that the vicar of Folkestone, Mr. Woodward, was then without agoverness, and his wife was in very delicate health. My people knew himwell, and as I had plenty of spare time, I offered to teach the childrenfor a few hours a day. The offer was gladly accepted, and I soon arrangedto go and stay at the house for awhile, until he could find a regulargoverness. I thought that at least I could save my small income while Iwas there, and Mabel and I were to be boarded and lodged in exchange formy work. This work was fairly heavy, but I did not mind that; it soonbecame heavier. Some serious fault on the part of one or both servantsled to their sudden retirement, and I became head cook as well asgoverness and nurse. On the whole, I think I shall not try to live bycooking, if other trades fail; I don't mind boiling and frying, andmaking pie-crust is rather pleasant, but I do object to lifting saucepansand blistering my hands over heavy kettles. There is a certain charm inmaking a stew, especially to the unaccustomed cook, because of theexcitement of wondering what the result of such various ingredients willbe, and whether any flavor save that of onions will survive thecompetition in the mixture. On the whole my services as cook were votedvery successful; I did my cooking better than I did my sweeping: thelatter was a failure from sheer want of muscular strength.This curious episode came to an end abruptly. One of my little pupilsfell ill with diptheria, and I was transformed from cook into sick-nurse.I sent my Mabel off promptly to her dear grandmother's care, and gavemyself up to my old delight in nursing. But it is a horrible disease,diptheria, and the suffering of the patient is frightful to witness. Ishall never forget the poor little girl's black parched lips and gaspingbreath.Scarcely was she convalescent, when the youngest boy, a fine, strong,healthy little fellow, sickened with scarlet fever. We elders held aconsultation, and decided to isolate the top floor from the rest of thehouse, and to nurse the little lad there; it seemed almost hopeless toprevent such a disease from spreading through a family of children, butour vigorous measures were successful, and none other suffered. I wasvoted to the post of nurse, and installed myself promptly, taking up thecarpets, turning out the curtains, and across the door ways hangingsheets which I kept always wet with chloride of lime. My meals werebrought upstairs and put on the landing outside; my patient and Iremained completely isolated, until the disease had run its course; andwhen all risk was over, I proudly handed over my charge, the diseasetouching no other member of the flock.It was a strange time, those weeks of the autumn and early winter in Mr.Woodward's house. He was a remarkably good man, very religious and to avery remarkable extent not "of this world". A "priest" to the tips of hisfinger-nails, and looking on his priestly office as the highest a mancould fill, he yet held it always as one which put him at the service ofthe poorest who needed help. He was very good to me, and, while deeplylamenting my "perversion", held, by some strange unpriestlike charity,that my "unbelief" was but a passing cloud, sent as trial by "the Lord",and soon to vanish again, leaving me in the "sunshine of faith". Hemarvelled much, I learned afterwards, where I gained my readiness to workheartily for others, and to remain serenely content amid the roughnessesof my toiling life. To my great amusement I heard later that his elderdaughters, trained in strictest observance of all Church ceremonies, hadmuch discussed my non-attendance at the Sacrament, and had finallyarrived at the conclusion that I had committed some deadly sin, for whichthe humble work which I undertook at their house was the appointedpenance, and that I was excluded from "the Blessed Sacrament" until thepenance was completed!Very shortly after the illness above-mentioned, my mother went up totown, whither I was soon to follow her, for now the spring had arrived,and it was time to prepare our new home. How eagerly we had lookedforward to taking possession; how we had talked over our life togetherand knitted on the new one we anticipated to the old one we remembered;how we had planned out Mabel's training and arranged the duties thatshould fall to the share of each! Day-dreams, that never were to berealised!But a brief space had passed since my mother's arrival in town, when Ireceived a telegram from my brother, stating that she was dangerouslyill, and summoning me at once to her bedside. As swiftly as express traincould carry me to London I was there, and found my darling in bed,prostrate, the doctor only giving her three days to live. One moment'ssight I caught of her face, drawn and haggard; then as she saw me it allchanged into delight; "At last! now I can rest."The brave spirit had at length broken down, never again to rise; theaction of her heart had failed, the valves no longer performed theirduty, and the bluish shade of forehead and neck told that the blood wasno longer sent pure and vivifying through the arteries. But her death wasnot as near as the doctor had feared; "I do not think she can livefour-and-twenty hours," he said to me, after I had been with her for twodays. I told her his verdict, but it moved her little; "I do not feelthat I am going to die just yet," she said resolutely, and she was right.There was an attack of fearful prostration, a very wrestling with death,and then the grim shadow drew backwards, and she struggled back to life.Soon, as is usual in cases of such disease, dropsy intervened, with allits weariness of discomfort, and for week after week her long martyrdomdragged on. I nursed her night and day, with a very desperation oftenderness, for now fate had touched the thing that was dearest to me inlife. A second horrible crisis came, and for the second time her tenacityand my love beat back the death-stroke. She did not wish to die--the loveof life was strong in her; I would not let her die; between us we keptthe foe at bay.At this period, after eighteen months of abstention, and for the lasttime, I took the Sacrament. This statement will seem strange to myreaders, but the matter happened in this wise:My dear mother had an intense longing to take it, but absolutely refusedto do so unless I partook of it with her."If it be necessary to salvation," she persisted doggedly, "I will nottake it if darling Annie is to be shut out. I would rather be lost withher than saved without her." In vain I urged that I could not take itwithout telling the officiating clergyman of my heresy, and that undersuch circumstances the clergyman would be sure to refuse to administer tome. She insisted that she could not die happy if she did not take it withme. I went to a clergyman I knew well, and laid the case before him; as Iexpected, he refused to allow me to communicate. I tried a second; theresult was the same. I was in despair; to me the service was foolish andsuperstitious, but I would have done a great deal more for my mother thaneat bread and drink wine, provided that the eating and drinking did not,by pretence of faith on my part, soil my honesty. At last a thoughtstruck me; there was Dean Stanley, my mother's favorite, a man known tobe of the broadest school within the Church of England; suppose I askedhim? I did not know him, though as a young child I had known his sisteras my mother's friend, and I felt the request would be something of animpertinence. Yet there was just the chance that he might consent, andthen my darling's death-bed would be the easier. I told no one, but setout resolutely for the Deanery, Westminster, timidly asked for the Dean,and followed the servant upstairs with a very sinking heart. I was leftfor a moment alone in the library, and then the Dean came in. I don'tthink I ever in my life felt more intensely uncomfortable than I did inthat minute's interval, as he stood waiting for me to speak, his clear,grave, piercing eyes gazing right into mine.Very falteringly I preferred my request, stating baldly that I was not abeliever in Christ, that my mother was dying, that she was fretting totake the Sacrament, that she would not take it unless I took it with her,that two clergymen had refused to allow me to take part in the service,that I had come to him in despair, feeling how great was the intrusion,but--she was dying."You were quite right to come to me," he said as I concluded, in thatsoft musical voice of his, his keen gaze having changed into one no lessdirect, but marvellously gentle: "of course, I will go and see yourmother, and I have little doubt that if you will not mind talking overyour position with me, we may see our way clear to doing as your motherwishes."I could barely speak my thanks, so much did the kindly sympathy move me;the revulsion from the anxiety and fear of rebuff was strong enough to bealmost pain. But Dean Stanley did more than I asked. He suggested that heshould call that afternoon, and have a quiet chat with my mother, andthen come again on the following day to administer the Sacrament."A stranger's presence is always trying to a sick person," he said, withrare delicacy of thought; "and joined to the excitement of the service itmight be too much for your dear mother. If I spend half-an-hour with herto-day, and administer the Sacrament to-morrow, it will, I think, bebetter for her."So Dean Stanley came that afternoon, and remained talking with my motherfor about half-an-hour, and then set himself to understand my ownposition. He finally told me that conduct was far more important thantheory, and that he regarded all as "Christians" who recognised and triedto follow the moral law. On the question of the absolute Deity of Jesushe laid but little stress; Jesus was, "in a special sense", the "Son ofGod", but it was folly to jangle about words with only human meaningswhen dealing with the mysteries of divine existence, and above all it wasfolly to make such words into dividing lines between earnest souls. Theone important matter was the recognition of "duty to God and man", andall who were one in that recognition might rightfully join in an act ofworship, the essence of which was not acceptance of dogma, but love ofGod and self-sacrifice for man. "The Holy Communion", he said, in hissoft tones, "was never meant to divide from each other hearts that aresearching after the one true God; it was meant by its founder as a symbolof unity, not of strife".On the following day he came again, and celebrated the "Holy Communion"by the bedside of my dear mother. Well was I repaid for the struggle ithad cost me to ask so great a kindness from a stranger, when I saw thecomfort that gentle noble heart had given to my mother. He soothed awayall her anxiety about my heresy with tactful wisdom, bidding her have nofear of differences of opinion where the heart was set on truth."Remember", she told me he had said to her, "remember that our God is theGod of truth, and that therefore the honest search for truth can never bedispleasing in his eyes".Once again after that he came, and after his visit to my mother we hadanother long talk. I ventured to ask him, the conversation having turnedthat way, how, with views so broad as his own, he found it possible toremain in communion with the Church of England. "I think", he saidgently, "that I am of more service to true religion by remaining in theChurch and striving to widen its boundaries from within, than if I leftit and worked from without". And he went on to explain how, as Dean ofWestminster, he was in a rarely independent position, and could make theAbbey of a wider national service than would otherwise be possible. Inall he said on this his love for and his pride in the glorious Abbey weremanifest, and it was easy to see that old historical associations, loveof music, of painting, and of stately architecture, were the bonds thatheld him bound to the "old historic Church of England". His emotions, nothis intellect, kept him Churchman, and he shrunk with theover-sensitiveness of the cultured scholar from the idea of allowing theold traditions, to be handled roughly by inartistic hands. Naturally of arefined and delicate nature, he had been rendered yet more sensitive bythe training of the college and the court; the exquisite courtesy of hismanners was but the high polish of a naturally gentle and artisticspirit, a spirit whose gentleness sometimes veiled its strength. I haveoften heard Dean Stanley harshly spoken of, I have heard his honestyroughly challenged, but never in my presence has he been attacked that Ihave not uttered my protest against the injustice done him, and thusstriven to repay some small fraction of that great debt of gratitudewhich I shall owe to his memory as long as I live.As the spring grew warmer, my mother rallied wonderfully, and we began todare to hope. At last it was decided to move her down to Norwood; she waswearying for change, and it was thought that the purer air of the countrymight aid the system to recover tone and strength. The furniture waswaiting for me to send for it, and it was soon, conveyed to Colby Road;it only furnished two rooms, but I could easily sleep on the floor, and Imade the two rooms on the ground floor into bedroom and sitting-room formy dear invalid. One little servant-maid was all our slender resourcescould afford, and a very charming one was found for me by Mrs. Scott.Through the months of hard work and poor living that followed, Mary wasthe most thoughtful and most generous of comrades. And, indeed, I havebeen very fortunate in my servants, always finding in them willingness tohelp, and freely-rendered, ungrudging kindness.I have just said that I could only furnish two rooms, but on my nextvisit to complete all the arrangements for my mother's reception, I foundthe bedroom that was to be mine neatly and prettily furnished. The goodfairy was Mrs. Scott, who, learning the "nakedness of the land" fromMary, had determined that I should not be as uncomfortable as I hadexpected.It was the beginning of May, and the air was soft and bright and warm. Wehired an invalid carriage and drove slowly down to Norwood. My motherseemed to enjoy the drive, and when we lifted her into the bright cosyroom prepared for her, she was delighted with the change. On thefollowing morning the improvement was continued, but in the evening shewas taken suddenly worse, and we lifted her into bed and telegraphed forthe doctor. But now the end had come; her strength completely failed, andshe felt that death was upon her; but selfless to the last, her only fearwas for me. "I am leaving you alone," she would sigh from time to time,and truly I felt, with an anguish I dared not realise, that when she diedI should indeed be alone on earth.For two days longer she was with me, and, miser with my last few hours, Inever left her side for five minutes. At last on the 10th of May theweakness passed into delirium, but even then the faithful eyes followedme about the room, until at length they closed for ever, and as thesun sank low in the heavens, the breath came slower and slower, till thesilence of death came down upon us and she was gone.All that followed was like a dream. I would have none touch my dead savemyself and her favorite sister, who was with us at the last; she weptover her, but I could not, not even when they hid her beneath thecoffin-lid, nor all that weary way to Kensal Green, whither we took herto lay her with her husband and her baby-son. I could not believe thatour day-dream was dead and buried, and the home destroyed ere it wasfairly made. My "house was left unto" me "desolate", and the rooms filledwith sunshine, but unlighted by her presence, seemed to reiterate to me:"You are all alone ".XI.The two months after my mother's death were the dreariest my life hasknown, and they were months of tolerably hard struggle. The little housein Colby Road taxed my slender resources heavily, and the search for workwas not yet successful. I do not know how I should have managed but forthe help, ever at hand, of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Scott. During this time Iwrote for Mr. Scott pamphlets on Inspiration, Atonement, Mediation andSalvation, Eternal Torture, Religious Education of Children, Natural _v._Revealed Religion, and the few guineas thus earned were very valuable.Their house, too, was always open to me, and this was no small help, foroften in those days the little money I had was enough to buy food for twobut not enough to buy it for three, and I would go out and study all dayat the British Museum, so as to "have my dinner in town", the said dinnerbeing conspicuous by its absence. If I was away for two evenings runningfrom the hospitable house in the terrace, Mrs. Scott would come down tosee what had happened, and many a time the supper there was of realphysical value to me. Well might I write, in 1879, when Thomas Scott laydead: "It was Thomas Scott whose house was open to me when my need wassorest, and he never knew, this generous noble heart, how sometimes, whenI went in, weary and overdone, from a long day's study in the BritishMuseum, with scarce food to struggle through the day--he never knew howhis genial 'Well, little lady', in welcoming tone, cheered the then utterloneliness of my life. To no living man or woman--save one--do I owe thedebt of gratitude that I owe to Thomas Scott."The small amount of jewellery I possessed, and all my superfluousclothes, were turned into more necessary articles, and the child, atleast, never suffered a solitary touch of want. Mary was a wonderfulcontriver, and kept house on the very slenderest funds that could be putinto a servant's hands, and she also made the little place so bright andfresh-looking that it was always a pleasure to go into it. Recallingthose days of "hard living", I can now look on them without regret. More,I am glad to have passed through them, for they have taught me how tosympathise with those who are struggling as I struggled then, and I nevercan hear the words fall from pale lips: "I am hungry", withoutremembering how painful a thing hunger is, and without curing that pain,at least for the moment.But I turn from this to the brighter side of my life, the intellectualand social side, where I found a delight unknown in the old days ofbondage. First, there was the joy of freedom, the joy of speaking outfrankly and honestly each thought. Truly, I had the right to say: "With agreat price obtained I this freedom," and having paid the price, Irevelled in the Liberty I had bought. Mr. Scott's valuable library was atmy service; his keen brain challenged my opinions, probed my assertions,and suggested phases of thought hitherto untouched. I studied harder thanever, and the study now was unchecked by any fear of possibleconsequences. I had nothing left of the old faith save belief in "a God",and that began slowly to melt away. The Theistic axiom: "If there be aGod at all he must be at least as good as his highest creature", beganwith an "if", and to that "if" I turned my attention. "Of all impossiblethings", writes Miss Frances Power Cobbe, "the most impossible mustsurely be that a man should dream something of the good and the noble,and that it should prove at last that his Creator was less good and lessnoble than he had dreamed." But, I questioned, are we sure that there isa Creator? Granted that, if there is, he must be above his highestcreature, but--is there such a being? "The ground", says the Rev. CharlesVoysey, "on which our belief in God rests is man. Man, parent of Biblesand Churches, inspirer of all good thoughts and good deeds. Man, themaster-piece of God's thought on earth. Man, the text-book of allspiritual knowledge. Neither miraculous nor infallible, man isnevertheless the only trustworthy record of the Divine mind in thingsperhaps pertaining to God. Man's reason, conscience, and affections arethe only true revelation of his Maker." But what if God were only man'sown image reflected in the mirror of man's mind? What if man were thecreator, not the revelation of his God?It was inevitable that such thoughts should arise after the more palpablyindefensible doctrines of Christianity had been discarded. Once encouragethe human mind to think, and bounds to the thinking can never again beset by authority. Once challenge traditional beliefs, and the challengewill ring on every shield which is hanging in the intellectual arena.Around me was the atmosphere of conflict, and, freed from its longrepression, my mind leapt up to share in the strife with a joy in theintellectual tumult, the intellectual strain.At this time I found my way to South Place Chapel, to which Mr. MoncureD. Conway was attracting many a seeker after truth. I was fortunateenough to be introduced to this remarkable religious leader, and to hischarming wife, one of the sweetest and steadiest natures which it hasbeen my lot to meet. It was from. Mrs. Conway that I first heard of Mr.Bradlaugh as a speaker that everyone should hear. She asked me one day ifI had been to the Hall of Science, and I said, with the stupid, ignorantreflexion of other people's prejudices which is but too common:"No, I have never been. Mr. Bradlaugh is rather a rough sort of speaker,is he not?""He is the finest speaker of Saxon English that I have ever heard," Mrs.Conway answered, "except, perhaps, John Bright, and his power over acrowd is something marvellous. Whether you agree with him or not, youshould hear him."I replied that I really did not know what his views were, beyond having avague notion that he was an Atheist of a rather pronounced type, but thatI would go and hear him when I had an opportunity.Mr. Conway had passed beyond the emotional Theism of Mr. Voysey, and talkwith him did something towards widening my views on the question of aDivine Existence. I re-read carefully Mansel's Bampton Lectures, andfound in them much to provoke doubt, nothing to induce faith. Take thefollowing phrases, and think whither they carry us. Dean Mansel isspeaking of God as Infinite, and he says: "That a man can be conscious ofthe Infinite is, then, a supposition which, in the very terms in which itis expressed, annihilates itself.... The Infinite, if it is to beconceived at all, must be conceived as potentially everything andactually nothing; for if there is anything in general which it cannotbecome, it is thereby limited; and if there is anything in particularwhich it actually is, it is thereby excluded from being any other thing.But again, it must also be conceived as actually everything andpotentially nothing: for an unrealised potentiality is likewise alimitation. If the infinite can be that which it is not, it is by thatvery possibility marked out as incomplete and capable of a higherperfection. If it is actually everything, it possesses no characteristicfeature by which it can be distinguished from anything else and discernedas an object of consciousness."Could any argument more thoroughly Atheistic be put before a mind whichdared to think out to the logical end any train of thought? Suchreasoning can lead but to one of two ends: despair of truth andconsequent acceptance of the incomprehensible as Divine, or else theresolute refusal to profess belief where reason is helpless, and wherefaith is but the credulity of ignorance. In my case, it had the lattereffect.At the same time I re-read Mill's "Examination of Sir W. Hamilton'sPhilosophy", and also went through a pretty severe study of Comte's_Philosophic Positive_. I had entirely given up the use of prayer, notbecause I was an Atheist but because I was still a Theist. It seemed tome to be absurd to pray, if I believed in a God who was wiser and betterthan myself. An all-wise God did not need my suggestions: an all-good Godwould do all that was best without my prompting. Prayer appeared to me tobe a blasphemous impertinence, and for a considerable time I haddiscontinued its use. But God fades gradually out of the daily life ofthose who never pray; a God who is not a Providence is a superfluity;when from the heaven does not smile a listening Father, it soon becomesan empty space whence resounds no echo of man's cry.At last I said to Mr. Scott: "Mr. Scott, may I write a tract on thenature and existence of God?"He glanced at me keenly: "Ah, little lady; you are facing then thatproblem at last? I thought it must come. Write away."The thought that had been driving me forward found its expression in theopening words of the essay (published a few months later, with one or twoadditions that were made after I had read two of Mr. Bradlaugh's essays,his "Plea for Atheism", and "Is there a God?"): "It is impossible forthose who study the deeper religious problems of our time to stave offmuch longer the question which lies at the root of them all, 'What do youbelieve in regard to God?' We may controvert Christian doctrines oneafter another; point by point we may be driven from the various beliefsof our churches; reason may force us to see contradictions where we hadimagined harmony, and may open our eyes to flaws where we had dreamed ofperfection; we resign all idea of a revelation; we seek for God in Natureonly: we renounce for ever the hope (which glorified our former creedinto such alluring beauty) that at some future time we should verily'see' God; that 'our eyes should behold the King in his beauty', in thatfairy 'land which is very far off'. But every step we take onwardstowards a more reasonable faith and a surer light of Truth, leads usnearer and nearer to the problem of problems: 'What is THAT which mencall God?".I sketched out the plan of my essay and had written most of it when onreturning one day from the British Museum I stopped at the shop of Mr.Edward Truelove, 256 High Holborn. I had been working at some Comtistliterature, and had found a reference to Mr. Truelove's shop as one atwhich Comtist publications might be bought. Lying on the counter was acopy of the _National Reformer_, and attracted by the title I bought it.I had never before heard of nor seen the paper, and I read it placidly inthe omnibus; looking up, I was at first puzzled and then amused to see anold gentleman gazing at me with indignation and horror printed on hiscountenance; I realised that my paper had disturbed his peace of mind,and that the sight of a young woman, respectably dressed in crape,reading an Atheistic journal in an omnibus was a shock too great to beendured by the ordinary Philistine without sign of discomposure. Helooked so hard at the paper that I was inclined to offer it to him forhis perusal, but repressed the mischievous inclination, and read ondemurely.This first copy of the paper with which I was to be so closely connectedbore date July 19th, 1874, and contained two long letters from a Mr.Arnold of Northampton, attacking Mr. Bradlaugh, and a brief andsingularly self-restrained answer from the latter. There was also anarticle on the National Secular Society, which made me aware that therewas an organisation devoted to the propagandism of Free Thought. I feltthat if such a society existed, I ought to belong to it, and Iconsequently wrote a short note to the editor of the _National Reformer_,asking whether it was necessary for a person to profess Atheism beforebeing admitted to the Society. The answer appeared in the _NationalReformer_:--"S.E.--To be a member of the National Secular Society it is onlynecessary to be able honestly to accept the four principles, as given inthe _National Reformer_ of June 14th. This any person may do withoutbeing required to avow himself an Atheist. Candidly, we can see nological resting-place between the entire acceptance of authority, as inthe Roman Catholic Church, and the most extreme nationalism. If, on againlooking to the Principles of the Society, you can accept them, we repeatto you our invitation."I sent my name in as an active member, and find it recorded in the_National Reformer_ of August 9th. Having received an intimation thatLondoners could receive their certificates at the Hall of Science fromMr. Bradlaugh on any Sunday evening, I betook myself thither, and it wason the 2nd August, 1874, that I first set foot in a Freethought hall.As I sat, much crushed, surveying the crowded audience with much interestand longing to know which were members of the brotherhood I had entered,a sudden roar of cheering startled me. I saw a tall figure passingswiftly along and mounting the stairs, and the roar deepened and swelledas he made a slight acknowledgment of the greeting and sat down. Iremember well my sensations as I looked at Charles Bradlaugh for thefirst time. The grave, quiet, _strong_ look, as he sat facing the crowd,impressed me strangely, and most of all was I surprised at the breadth offorehead, the massive head, of the man I had heard described as a mereignorant demagogue.The lecture was on "The ancestry and birth of Jesus", and was largelydevoted to tracing the resemblance between the Christ and Krishna myths.As this ground was well-known to me, I was able to judge of thelecturer's accuracy, and quickly found that his knowledge was as sound ashis language was splendid. I had never before heard eloquence, sarcasm,fire, and passion brought to bear on the Christian superstition, nor hadI ever before felt the sway of the orator, nor the power that dwells inspoken words.After the lecture, Mr. Bradlaugh came down the Hall with somecertificates of membership of the National Secular Society in his hand,and glancing round for their claimants caught, I suppose, some look ofexpectancy in my face, for he paused and handed me mine, with aquestioning, "Mrs. Besant?". Then he said that if I had any doubt at allon the subject of Atheism, he would willingly discuss it with me, if Iwould write making an appointment for that purpose. I made up my mind totake advantage of the opportunity, and a day or two later saw me walkingdown Commercial Road, looking for Turner Street.My first conversation with Mr. Bradlaugh was brief, direct, andsatisfactory. We found that there was little real difference between ourtheological views, and my dislike of the name "Atheist" arose from mysharing in the vulgar error that the Atheist asserted, "There is no God".This error I corrected in the draft of my essay, by inserting a fewpassages from pamphlets written by acknowledged Atheists, to which Mr.Bradlaugh drew my attention; with this exception the essay remained as itwas sketched, being described by Mr. Bradlaugh as "a very good Atheisticessay", a criticism which ended with the smiling comment: "You havethought yourself into Atheism without knowing it."Very wise were some of the suggestions made: "You should never say youhave an opinion on a subject until you have tried to study the strongestthings said against the view to which you are inclined". "You must notthink you know a subject until you are acquainted with all that the bestminds have said about it." "No steady work can be done in public unlessthe worker study at home far more than he talks outside." And let me sayhere that among the many things for which I have to thank Mr. Bradlaugh,there is none for which I owe him more gratitude than for the fashion inwhich he has constantly urged the duty of all who stand forward asteachers to study deeply every subject they touch, and the impetus he hasgiven to my own love of knowledge by the constant spur of criticism andof challenge, criticism of every weak statement, challenge of everyhastily-expressed view. It will be a good thing for the world when afriendship between a man and a woman no longer means protectivecondescension on one side and helpless dependence on the other, but whenthey meet on equal ground of intellectual sympathy, discussing,criticising, studying, and so aiding the evolution of stronger andclearer thought-ability in each.A few days after our first discussion, Mr. Bradlaugh offered me a placeon the staff of the _National Reformer_ at a small weekly salary; and myfirst contribution appeared in the number for August 30th, over thesignature of "Ajax"; I was obliged to use a _nom de guerre_ at first, forthe work I was doing for Mr. Scott would have been injured had my nameappeared in the columns of the terrible _National Reformer_, and untilthe work commenced and paid for was concluded I did not feel at libertyto use my own name. Later, I signed my _National Reformer_ articles, andthe tracts written for Mr. Scott appeared anonymously.The name was suggested by the famous statue of "Ajax crying for light", acast of which stands in the centre walk of the Crystal Palace. The crythrough the darkness for light, even if light brought destruction, wasone that awoke the keenest sympathy of response from my heart:  "If our fate be death,  Give light, and let us die!"To see, to know, to understand, even though the seeing blind, though theknowledge sadden, though the understanding shatter the dearest hopes,such has ever been the craving of the upward-striving mind of man. Someregard it as a weakness, as a folly, but I am sure that it exists moststrongly in some of the noblest of our race; that from the lips of thosewho have done most in lifting the burden of ignorance from theoverstrained and bowed shoulders of a stumbling world has gone out mostoften into the empty darkness the pleading, impassioned cry :--"Give light."XII.My first lecture was delivered at the Co-operative Society's Hall, 55,Castle Street, on August 25, 1873. Twice before this, I had ventured toraise my voice in discussion, once at a garden-party at which I wasinvited to join in a brief informal debate, and discovered that wordscame readily and smoothly, and the second time at the Liberal SocialUnion, in a discussion on a paper read by a member--I forget by whom--dealing with the opening of Museums and Art Galleries on Sunday.My membership of that same "Liberal" Social Union was not, by the way, ofvery long duration. A discussion arose, one night, on the admissibilityof Atheists to the society. Dr. Zerffi declared that he would not remaina member if avowed Atheists were admitted. I declared that I was anAtheist, and that the basis of the Union was liberty. The result was thatI found myself coldshouldered, and those who had been warmly cordial tome as a Theist looked askance at me after I had avowed that my scepticismhad advanced beyond their "limits of religious thought". The LiberalSocial Union knew me no more, but in the wider field of work open beforeme the narrowmindedness of this petty clique troubled me not at all.To return from this digression to my first essay in lecturing work. Aninvitation to read a paper before the Co-operative Society came to mefrom Mr. Greenwood, who was, I believe, the Secretary, and as the subjectwas left to my own choice, I determined that my first public attempt atspeech should be on behalf of my own sex, and selected for it, "ThePolitical Status of Women". With much fear and trembling was that paperwritten, and it was a very nervous person who presented herself at theCo-operative Hall. When a visit to the dentist is made, and one stands onthe steps outside, desiring to run away ere the neat little boy inbuttons opens the door and beams on one with a smile of compassionatecontempt and implike triumph, then the world seems dark and life is as ahuge blunder. But all such feelings are poor and weak when compared withthe sinking of the heart, and the trembling of the knees, which, seizeupon the unhappy lecturer as he advances towards his first audience, andas before his eyes rises a ghastly vision of a tongue-tied would-bespeaker facing rows of listening faces, listening to--silence.All this miserable feeling, however, disappeared the moment I rose to myfeet and looked at the faces before me. No tremor of nervousness touchedme from the first word to the last. And a similar experience has beenmine ever since. I am still always nervous before a lecture, and feelmiserable and ill-assured, but, once on my feet, I am at my ease, and notonce on the platform after the lecture has commenced have I experiencedthe painful feeling of hesitancy and "fear of the sound of my own voice"of which I have often heard people speak.The death of Mr. Charles Gilpin in September left vacant one of the seatsfor Northampton, and Mr. Bradlaugh at once announced his intention ofagain presenting himself to the constituency as a candidate. He had atfirst stood for the borough in 1868, and had received 1086 votes; onFebruary 5th, 1874, he received 1653 votes, and of these 1060 wereplumpers; the other candidates were Messrs. Merewether, Phipps, Gilpin,and Lord Henley; Mr. Merewether had 12 plumpers; Mr. Phipps, 113; Mr.Gilpin, 64; Lord Henley, 21. Thus signs were already seen of the compactand personally loyal following which was to win the seat for its chief in1880, after twelve years of steady struggle. In 1868, Mr. John StuartMill had strongly supported Mr. Bradlaugh's candidature, and had sent adonation to his election fund. Mr. Mill wrote in his Autobiography (pp.311,312):"He had the support of the working classes; having heard him speak I knewhim to be a man of ability, and he had proved that he was the reverse ofa demagogue by placing himself in strong opposition to the prevailingopinion of the Democratic party on two such important subjects asMalthusianism. and Personal Representation. Men of this sort, who, whilesharing the democratic feelings of the working classes, judge politicalquestions for themselves, and have courage to assert their individualconvictions against popular opposition, were needed, as it seemed to me,in Parliament; and I did not think that Mr. Bradlaugh's anti-religiousopinions (even though he had been intemperate in the expression of them)ought to exclude him."When the election was over, and after Mr. Mill had himself been beaten atWestminster, he wrote, referring to his donation: "It was the right thingto do, and if the election were yet to take place, I would do it again".The election in February, 1874 took place while Mr. Bradlaugh was away inAmerica, and this second one in the same year took place on the eve ofhis departure on another American lecturing tour.I went down to Northampton to report electioneering incidents for the_National Reformer_, and spent some days there in the whirl of thestruggle. The Whig party was more bitter against Mr. Bradlaugh than wasthe Tory, and every weapon that could be forged out of slander andfalsehood was used against him by "Liberals", who employed theirChristianity as an electioneering dodge to injure a man whose sturdyRadicalism they feared. Over and over again Mr. Bradlaugh was told thathe was an "impossible candidate", and gibe and sneer and scoff were flungat the man who had neither ancestors nor wealth to recommend him, whofought his battle with his brain and his tongue, and whose electionexpenses were paid by hundreds of contributions from poor men and womenin every part of the land. Strenuous efforts were made to procure a"Liberal" candidate, who should be able at least to prevent Mr.Bradlaugh's return by obtaining the votes of the Liberal as against theRadical party. Messrs. Bell and James and Dr. Pearce came on the sceneonly to disappear. Mr. Jacob Bright and Mr. Arthur Arnold were suggested.Mr. Ayrton's name was whispered. Major Lumley was recommended by Mr.Bernal Osborne. Dr. Kenealy proclaimed himself ready to rescue theLiberal party in their dire strait. Mr. Tillet of Norwich, Mr. Cox ofBelper, were invited, but neither of these would consent to oppose asound Radical, who had fought two elections at Northampton and who hadbeen before the constituency for six years. At last Mr. William Fowler, abanker, was invited, and accepted the task of handing over therepresentation of a Radical borough to a Tory.October 6th was fixed as the election day, and at 7.30 on that day Mr.Merewether, the Tory, was declared elected with 2,171 votes. Mr.Bradlaugh polled 1,766, having added another 133 voters to those who hadpolled for him in the previous February.The violent abuse levelled against Mr. Bradlaugh by the Whigs, and thefoul and wicked slanders circulated against him, had angered almost tomadness those who knew and loved him, and when it was found that theunscrupulous Whig devices had succeeded in turning the election againsthim, the fury broke out into open violence. As Mr. Bradlaugh was sittingwell-nigh exhausted in the hotel, the landlord rushed in, crying to himto go out and try to stop the people, or there would be murder done atthe "Palmerston", Mr. Fowler's head-quarters; the crowd was charging thedoor, and the windows were being broken, with showers of stones. Weary ashe was, Mr. Bradlaugh sprang to his feet and swiftly made his way to therescue of those who had defeated him. Flinging himself before the door,he drove the crowd back, scolded them into quietness and dispersed them.But at nine o'clock he had to leave the town to catch the mail forQueenstown, where he was to join the steamer for America, and after hehad left, the riot he had quelled broke out afresh. The soldiers werecalled out, the Riot Act was read, stones flew freely, heads and windowswere broken, but no very serious harm was done. The "Palmerston" and theprinting office of the _Mercury_, the Whig organ, were the principalsufferers, windows and doors vanishing somewhat completely.In this same month of October I find I noted in the _National Reformer_that it was rumored "that on hearing that the Prince of Wales hadsucceeded the Earl of Ripon as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge ofEngland, Mr. Bradlaugh immediately sent in his resignation". "Thereport", I added demurely, "seems likely to be a true one". I had notmuch doubt of the fact, having seen the cancelled certificate.My second lecture was delivered on September 27th, during the electionstruggle, at Mr. Moncure D. Conway's Chapel in St. Paul's Road, CamdenTown, and was on "The true basis of morality.". The lecture wasre-delivered a few weeks later at a Unitarian chapel, where the ministerwas the Rev. Peter Dean, and gave, I was afterwards told, great offenceto some of the congregation, especially to Miss Frances Power Cobbe, whodeclared that she would have left the chapel had not the speaker been awoman. The ground of complaint was that the suggested "basis" wasUtilitarian and human instead of Intuitional and Theistic. Published as apamphlet, the lecture has reached its seventh thousand.In October I had a severe attack of congestion of the lungs, and soonafter my recovery I left Norwood to settle in London. I found that mywork required that I should be nearer head-quarters, and I arranged torent part of a house--19, Westbourne Park Terrace, Bayswater--two ladyfriends taking the remainder. The arrangement proved a very comfortableone, and it continued until my improved means enabled me, in 1876, totake a house of my own.In January, 1875, I made up my mind to lecture regularly, and in the_National Reformer_ for January 17th I find the announcement that "Mrs.Annie Besant (Ajax) will lecture at South Place Chapel, Finsbury, on'Civil and religious liberty'", Mr. Conway took the chair at this firstidentification of "Ajax" with myself, and sent a very kindly notice ofthe lecture to the _Cincinnati Commercial_. Mr. Charles Watts wrote areport in the _National Reformer_ of January 24th. Dr. Maurice Daviesalso wrote a very favorable article in a London journal, butunfortunately he knew Mr. Walter Besant, who persuaded him to suppress myname, so that although the notice appeared it did me no service. Mystruggle to gain my livelihood was for some time rendered considerablymore difficult by this kind of ungenerous and underhand antagonism. Awoman's road to the earning of her own living, especially when she isweighted with the care of a young child, is always fairly thorny at theoutset, and does not need to be rendered yet more difficult by secretattempts to injure, on the part of those who trust that suffering andpoverty may avail to bend pride to submission.My next lecture was given in the Theatre Royal, Northampton, and in the_National Reformer_ of February 14th appears for the first time my listof lecturing engagements, so that in February next I shall complete myfirst decade of lecturing for the Freethought and Republican Cause.Never, since first I stood on the Freethought platform, have I felt onehour's regret for the resolution taken in solitude in January, 1875, todevote to that sacred Cause every power of brain and tongue that Ipossessed. Not lightly was that resolution taken, for I know no task ofweightier responsibility than that of standing forth as teacher, andswaying thousands of hearers year after year. But I pledged my word thento the Cause I loved that no effort on my part should be wanting torender myself worthy of the privilege of service which I took; that Iwould read, and study, and would train every faculty that I had; that Iwould polish my language, discipline my thought, widen my knowledge; andthis, at least, I may say, that if I have written and spoken much I havestudied and thought more, and that at least I have not given to mymistress, Liberty, that "which hath cost me nothing".A queer incident occurred on February 17th. I had been invited by theDialectical Society to read a paper, and selected for subject "Theexistence of God". The Dialectical Society had for some years held theirmeetings in a room in Adam Street rented from the Social ScienceAssociation. When the members gathered as usual on this 17th February,the door was found closed, and they were informed that Ajax's paper hadbeen too much for the Social Science nerves, and that entrance to theordinary meeting-place was henceforth denied. We found refuge in theCharing Cross Hotel, where we speculated merrily on the eccentricities ofreligious charity.On February 12th, I started on my first lecturing tour in the provinces.After lecturing at Birkenhead on the evening of that day, I started bythe night mail for Glasgow. Some races--dog races, I think--had beengoing on, and very unpleasant were many of the passengers waiting on theplatform. Some Birkenhead friends had secured me a compartment, andwatched over me till the train began to move. Then, after we had fairlystarted, the door was flung open by a porter and a man was thrust in whohalf tumbled on to the seat. As he slowly recovered, he stood up, and ashis money rolled out of his hand on to the floor and he gazed vaguely atit, I saw, to my horror, that he was drunk. The position was pleasant,for the train was an express and was not timed to stop for a considerabletime. My odious fellow-passenger spent some time on the floor hunting forhis scattered coins. Then he slowly gathered himself up, and presentlybecame conscious of my presence. He studied me for some time and thenproposed to shut the window. I assented quietly, not wanting to discuss atrifle, and feeling in deadly terror. Alone at night in an express, witha man not drunk enough to be helpless but too drunk to be controlled.Never, before or since, have I felt so thoroughly frightened, but I satthere quiet and unmoved, only grasping a penknife in my pocket, with adesperate resolve to use my feeble weapon as soon as the need arose. Theman had risen again to his feet and had come over to me, when a jarringnoise was heard and the train began to slacken."What is that?" stammered my drunken companion."They are putting on the brakes to stop the train," I said very slowlyand distinctly, though a very passion of relief made it hard to sayquietly the measured words.The man sat down stupidly, staring at me, and in a minute or two more thetrain pulled up at a station. It had been stopped by signal. In a momentI was at the window, calling the guard. I rapidly explained to him that Iwas travelling alone, that a half-drunken man was with me, and I beggedhim to put me into another carriage. With the usual kindliness of arailway official, the guard at once moved my baggage and myself into anempty compartment, into which he locked me, and he kept a friendly watchover me at every station at which we stopped until he landed me safely atGlasgow.At Glasgow a room had been taken for me at a Temperance Hotel, and itseemed to me a new and lonely sort of thing to be "on my own account" ina strange city in a strange hotel. By the way, why are Temperance Hotelsso often lacking in cleanliness? Surely abstinence from wine andsuperfluity of "matter in the wrong place" need not necessarily becorrelated in hotel-life, and yet my experience leads me to look for thetwain together. Here and there I have been to Temperance Hotels in whichwater is used for other purposes than that of drinking, but these are, Iregret to say, the exceptions to a melancholy rule.From Glasgow I went north to Aberdeen, and from Aberdeen home again toLondon. A long weary journey that was, in a third-class carriage in thecold month of February, but the labor had in it a joy that outpaid allphysical discomfort, and the feeling that I had found my work in theworld gave a new happiness to my life.I reported my doings to the chief of our party in America, and found themonly half approved. "You should have waited till I returned, and at leastI could have saved you some discomforts," he wrote; but the discomfortstroubled me little, and I think I rather preferred the independent launchout into lecturing work, trusting only to my own courage and ability towin my way. So far as health was concerned, the lecturing acted as atonic. My chest had always been a little delicate, and when I consulted adoctor on the possibility of my lecturing he answered: "It will eitherkill you or cure you". It has entirely cured the lung weakness, and Ihave grown strong and vigorous instead of being frail and delicate as ofold.On February 28th I delivered my first lecture at the Hall of Science,London, and was received with that warmth of greeting which Freethinkersare ever willing to extend to one who sacrifices aught to join theirranks. From that day to this that hearty welcome at our central Londonhall has never failed me, and the love and courage wherewith Freethinkershave ever stood by me have overpaid a thousandfold any poor services Ihave been fortunate enough to render to the common cause.It would be wearisome to go step by step over the ten years' journeys andlectures; I will only select, here and there, incidents illustrative ofthe whole.Some folk say that the lives of Freethought lecturers are easy, and thattheir lecturing tours are lucrative in the extreme. On one occasion Ispent eight days in the north lecturing daily, with three lectures on thetwo Sundays, and made a deficit of 11s. on the journey! I do not pretendthat such a thing would happen now, but I fancy that every Freethoughtlecturer could tell of a similar experience in the early days of "winninghis way".There is no better field for Freethought and Radical work thanNorthumberland and Durham; the miners there are as a rule shrewd andhard-headed men, and very cordial is the greeting given by them to thosewhom they have reason to trust. At Seghill and at Bedlington I have sleptin their cottages and have been welcomed to their tables, and I rememberone evening at Seghill, after a lecture, that my host invited about adozen miners to supper to meet me; the talk ran on politics, and I soonfound that my companions knew more of English politics and had a farshrewder notion of political methods than I had found among the ordinary"diners-out" in "society". They were of the "uneducated" class despisedby "gentlemen" and had not the vote, but politically they were far bettereducated than their social superiors, and were far better fitted todischarge the duties of citizenship.On May 16th I attended, for the first time, the Annual Conference calledby the National Secular Society. It was held at Manchester, in theSociety's rooms in Grosvenor Street, and it is interesting andencouraging to note how the Society has grown and strengthened since thatsmall meeting held nearly ten years ago. Mr. Bradlaugh was electedPresident; Messrs. A. Trevelyan, T. Slater, C. Watts, C.C. Cattell, R.A.Cooper, P.A.V. Le Lubez, N. Ridgway, G.W. Foote, G.H. Reddalls, and Mrs.Besant Vice Presidents. Messrs. Watts and Standring were elected asSecretary and Assistant-Secretary--both offices were then honorary, forthe Society was too poor to pay the holders--and Mr. Le Lubez Treasurer.The result of the Conference was soon seen in the energy infused into theFreethought propaganda, and from that time to this the Society hasincreased in numbers and in influence, until that which was scarcely morethan a skeleton has become a living power in the land on the side of allsocial and political reforms. The Council for 1875 consisted of butthirty-nine members, including President, Vice-Presidents, and Secretary,and of these only nine were available as a Central Executive. LetFreethinkers compare this meagre list with the present, and then let them"thank" man "and take courage".Lecturing at Leicester in June, I came for the first time across afalsehood of which I have since heard plenty. An irate Christian declaredthat I was responsible for a book entitled the "Elements of SocialScience", which was, he averred, the "Bible of Secularists". I had neverheard of the book, but as he insisted that it was in favor of theabolition of marriage, and that Mr. Bradlaugh agreed with it, I promptlycontradicted him, knowing that Mr. Bradlaugh's views on marriage wereconservative rather than revolutionary. On enquiry afterwards I foundthat the book in question had been written some years before by a Doctorof Medicine, and had been sent for review by its publisher to the_National Reformer_ among other papers. I found further that it consistedof three parts; the first dealt with the sexual relation, and advocated,from the standpoint of an experienced medical man, what is roughly knownas "free love"; the second was entirely medical, dealing with diseases;the third consisted of a very clear and able exposition of the law ofpopulation as laid down by Malthus, and insisted--as John Stuart Mill haddone--that it was the duty of married persons to voluntarily limit theirfamilies within their means of subsistence. Mr. Bradlaugh, in the_National Reformer_, in reviewing the book, stated that it was written"with honest and pure intent and purpose", and recommended to working menthe exposition of the law of population. Because he did this Christiansand Tories who desire to injure him still insist that he shares theauthor's views on sexual relations, and despite his reiteratedcontradictions, they quote detached pieces of the work, speaking againstmarriage, as containing his views. Anything more meanly vile anddishonest than this it would be difficult to imagine, yet such are theweapons used against Atheists in a Christian country. Unable to find inMr. Bradlaugh's own writings anything to serve their purpose, they takeisolated passages from a book he neither wrote nor published, but oncereviewed with a recommendation of a part of it which says nothing againstmarriage.That the book is a remarkable one and deserves to be read has beenacknowledged on all hands. Personally, I cordially dislike a large partof it, and dissent utterly from its views on the marital relation, butnone the less I feel sure that the writer is an honest, good, and rightmeaning man. In the _Reasoner_, edited by Mr. George Jacob Holyoake, Ifind warmer praise of it than in the _National Reformer_; in the reviewthe following passage appears:--"In some respects all books of this class are evils: but it would beweakness and criminal prudery--a prudery as criminal as vice itself--notto say that such a book as the one in question is not only a far lesserevil than the one that it combats, but in one sense a book which it is amercy to issue and courage to publish."The _Examiner_, reviewing the same book, declared it to be"A very valuable, though rather heterogeneous book.... This is, webelieve, the only book that has fully, honestly, and in a scientificspirit recognised all the elements in the problem--How are mankind totriumph over poverty, with its train of attendant evils?--and fearlesslyendeavored to find a practical solution."The _British Journal of Homaeopathy_ wrote:"Though quite out of the province of our journal, we cannot refrain fromstating that this work is unquestionably the most remarkable one, in manyrespects, we have ever met with. Though we differ _toto coelo_ from theauthor in his views of religion and morality, and hold some of hisremedies to tend rather to a dissolution than a reconstruction ofsociety, yet we are bound to admit the benevolence and philanthropy ofhis motives. The scope of the work is nothing less than the whole fieldof political economy."Ernest Jones and others wrote yet more strongly, but out of all theseCharles Bradlaugh alone has been selected for reproach, and has had thepeculiar views of the anonymous author fathered on himself. Why? Thereason is not far to seek. None of the other writers are active Radicalpoliticians, dangerous to the luxurious idleness of the non-producing butall-consuming "upper classes" of society. These know how easy it is toraise social prejudice against a man by setting afloat the idea that hedesires to "abolish marriage and the home". It is the most convenientponiard and the one most certain to wound. Therefore those whoseprofligacy is notorious, who welcome into their society the Blandfords,Aylesburys, and St. Leonards, rave against a man as a "destroyer ofmarriage" whose life is pure, and whose theories on this, as it happens,are "orthodox", merely because his honest Atheism shames theirhypocritical professions, and his sturdy Republicanism menaces theircorrupt and rotting society.XIII.Sometimes my lecturing experiences were not of the smoothest. In June,1875, I visited Darwen in Lancashire, and found that stone-throwing wasconsidered a fair argument to be addressed to "the Atheist lecturer". Onmy last visit to that place in May, 1884, large and enthusiasticaudiences attended the lectures, and not a sign of hostility was to beseen outside the hall. At Swansea, in March, 1876, the fear of violencewas so great that no local friend had the courage to take the chair forme (a guarantee against damage to the hall had been exacted by theproprietor). I had to march on to the platform in solitary state,introduce myself, and proceed with my lecture. If violence had beenintended, none was offered: it would have needed much brutality to chargeon to a platform occupied by a solitary woman. (By the way, those whofancy that a lecturer's life is a luxurious one may note that the Swansealecture spoken of was one of a series of ten, delivered within eight daysat Wednesbury, Bilston, Kidderminster, Swansea, and Bristol, most of thetravelling being performed through storm, rain, and snow.) On September,4th, 1876, I had rather a lively time at Hoyland, a village nearBarnsley. A Mr. Hebblethwaite, a Primitive Methodist minister, "preparedthe way of the" Atheist by pouring out virulent abuse on Atheism ingeneral, and this Atheist in particular; two Protestant missionariesaided him vigorously, exhorting the pious Christians to "sweepSecularists out". The result was a very fair row; I got through thelecture, despite many interruptions, but when it was over a regular riotensued; the enraged Christians shook their fists at me, swore at me, andfinally took to kicking as I passed out to the cab; only one kick,however, reached me, and the attempts to overturn the cab were foiled bythe driver, who put his horse at a gallop. A somewhat barbarous village,that same village of Hoyland. Congleton proved even livelier on September25th and 26th. Mr. Bradlaugh lectured there on September 25th to anaccompaniment of broken windows; I was sitting with Mrs. WolstenholmeElmy in front of the platform, and received a rather heavy blow at theback of the head from a stone thrown by someone in the room. We had amile and a half to walk from the hall to Mrs. Elmy's house, and this wasdone in the company of a mud-throwing crowd, who yelled curses, hymns,and foul words with delightful impartiality. On the following evening Iwas to lecture, and we were escorted to the hall by a stone-throwingcrowd; while I was lecturing a man shouted "Put her out!" and awell-known wrestler of the neighborhood, named Burbery, who had come tothe hall with seven friends, stood up in the front row and loudlyinterrupted. Mr. Bradlaugh, who was in the chair, told him to sit down,and as he persisted in making a noise, informed him that he must eitherbe quiet or go out. "Put me out!" said Burbery, striking an attitude. Mr.Bradlaugh left the platform and walked up to the noisy swashbuckler, whoat once grappled with him and tried to throw him; but Mr. Burbery had notreckoned on his opponent's strength, and when the "throw" was completeMr. Burbery was underneath. Amid much excitement Mr. Burbery waspropelled to the door, where he was handed over to the police, and thechairman resumed his seat and said "Go on", whereupon on I went andfinished the lecture. There was plenty more stone-throwing outside, andMrs. Elmy received a cut on the temple, but no serious harm was done--except to Christianity.In the summer of 1875 a strong protest was made by the working classesagainst the grant of L142,000 for the Prince of Wales visit to India, andon Sunday, July 18th, I saw for the first time one of the famous "HydePark Demonstrations". Mr. Bradlaugh called a meeting to support Messrs.Taylor, Macdonald, Wilfrid Lawson, Burt, and the other fourteen membersof the House of Commons who voted in opposition to the grant, and toprotest against burdening the workers to provide for the amusement of aspendthrift prince. I did not go into the meeting, but, with Mr.Bradlaugh's two daughters, hovered on the outskirts. A woman isconsiderably in the way in such a gathering, unless the speakers reachthe platform in carriages, for she is physically unfitted to push her waythrough the dense mass of people, and has therefore to be looked afterand saved from the crushing pressure of the crowd. I have always thoughtthat a man responsible for the order of such huge gatherings ought not tobe burdened in addition with the responsibility of protecting his femalefriends, and have therefore preferred to take care of myself outside themeetings both at Hyde Park and in Trafalgar Square. The method oforganisation by which the London Radicals have succeeded in holdingperfectly orderly meetings of enormous size is simple but effective. Alarge number of "marshals" volunteer, and each of these hands in to Mr.Bradlaugh a list of the "stewards" he is prepared to bring; the"marshals" and "stewards" alike are members of the Radical and Secularassociations of the metropolis. These officials all wear badges, arosette of the Northampton election colors; directions are given to themarshals by Mr. Bradlaugh himself, and each marshal, with his stewards,turns up at the appointed place at the appointed time, and does the shareof the work allotted to him. A ring two or three deep is formed round theplace whence the speakers are to address the meeting, and those who formthe ring stand linked arm-in-arm, making a living barrier round thisempty spot. There a platform, brought thither in pieces, is screwedtogether, and into this enclosure only the chosen speakers and newspaperreporters are admitted. The marshals and stewards who are not told offfor guarding the platform are distributed over the ground which themeeting is to occupy, and act as guardians of order.The Hyde Park meeting against the royal grant was a thoroughly successfulone, and a large number of protests came up from all parts of thecountry. Being from the poorer classes, they were of course disregarded,but none the less was a strong agitation against royal grants carried onthroughout the autumn and winter months. The National Secular Societydetermined to gather signatures to a "monster petition against royalgrants", and the superintendence of this was placed in my hands. Thepetition was drafted by Mr. Bradlaugh, and ran as follows:--"TO THE HONORABLE THE COMMONS OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND, IN PARLIAMENTASSEMBLED."The humble petition of the undersigned,"Prays,--That no further grant or allowance may be made to any member ofthe Royal Family until an account shall have been laid before yourHonorable House, showing the total real and personal estates and incomesof each and every member of the said Royal Family who shall be in receiptof any pension or allowance, and also showing all posts and places ofprofit severally held by members of the said Royal Family, and alsoshowing all pensions, if any, formerly charged on any estates now enjoyedby any member or members of the said Royal Family, and in case any suchpensions shall have been transferred, showing how and at what date suchtransfer took place."Day after day, week after week, month after month, the postman deliveredrolls of paper, little and big, each roll containing names and addressesof men and woman who protested against the waste of public money on ourgreedy and never-satisfied Royal House. The sheets often bore the marksof the places to which they had been carried; from a mining district somewould come coal-dust-blackened, which had been signed in the mines byworkers who grudged to idleness the fruits of toil; from an agriculturaldistrict the sheets bore often far too many "crosses", the "marks" ofthose whom Church and landlord had left in ignorance, regarding them onlyas machines for sowing and reaping. From September, 1875, to March, 1876,they came in steady stream, and each was added to the ever-lengtheningroll which lay in one corner of my sitting-room and which assumed everlarger and larger proportions. At last the work was over, and on June16th, 1876, the "monster"--rolled on a mahogany pole presented by aLondon friend, and encased in American cloth--was placed in a carriage tobe conveyed to the House of Commons; the heading ran: "The petition ofthe undersigned Charles Bradlaugh, Annie Besant, Charles Watts, and102,934 others". Unrolled, it was nearly a mile in length, and a veryhappy time we had in rolling the last few hundred yards. When we arrivedat the House, Mr. Bradlaugh and Mr. Watts carried the petition upWestminster Hall, each holding one end of the mahogany pole. Messrs. Burtand Macdonald took charge of the "monster" at the door of the House, and,carrying it in, presented it in due form. The presentation causedconsiderable excitement both in the House and in the press, and the_Newcastle Daily Chronicle_ said some kindly words of the "labor andenthusiasm" bestowed on the petition by myself.At the beginning of August, 1875, the first attempt to deprive me of mylittle daughter, Mabel, was made, but fortunately proved unsuccessful.The story of the trick played is told in the _National Reformer_ ofAugust 22nd, and I quote it just as it appeared there :--"PERSONAL.--Mrs. Annie Besant, as some of our readers are aware, was thewife of a Church of England clergyman, the Rev. Frank Besant, Vicar ofSibsey, near Boston, in Lincolnshire. There is no need, _at present_, tosay anything about the earlier portion of her married life; but when Mrs.Besant's opinions on religious matters became liberal, the conduct of herhusband rendered a separation absolutely necessary, and in 1873 a formaldeed of separation was drawn up, and duly executed. Under this deed Mrs.Besant is entitled to the sole custody and control of her infant daughterMabel until the child becomes of age, with the proviso that the littlegirl is to visit her father for one month in each year. Having recentlyobtained possession of the person of the little child under cover of theannual visit, the Rev. Mr. Besant sought to deprive Mrs. Besant entirelyof her daughter, on the ground of Mrs. Besant's Atheism. Vigorous stepswere at once taken by Messrs. Lewis and Lewis (to whom our readers willremember we entrusted the case of Mr. Lennard against Mr. Woolrych), bywhose advice Mrs. Besant at once went down herself to Sibsey to demandthe child; the little girl had been hidden, and was not at the Vicarage,but we are glad to report that Mrs. Besant has, after some littledifficulty, recovered the custody of her daughter. It was decided againstPercy Bysshe Shelley that an Atheist father could not be the guardian ofhis own children. If this law be appealed to, and anyone dares to enforceit, we shall contest it step by step; and while we are out of England, weknow that in case of any attempt to retake the child by force we maysafely leave our new advocate to the protection of the stout arms of ourfriends, who will see that no injustice of this kind is done her. So faras the law courts are concerned, we have the most complete confidence inMr. George Henry Lewis, and we shall fight the case to House of Lords ifneed be.CHARLES BRADLAUGH."The attempt to take the child from me by force indeed failed, but laterthe theft was successfully carried out by due process of law. It isalways a blunder from a tactical point of view for a Christian to usemethods of illegal violence in persecuting an Atheist in this Christianland; legal violence is a far safer weapon, for courage can checkmate thefirst, while it is helpless before the second. All Christians who adoptthe sound old principle that "no faith need be kept with the heretic"should remember that they can always guard themselves against unpleasantconsequences by breaking faith under cover of the laws against heresy,which still remain on our Statute Book _ad majorem Dei gloriam_.In September, 1875, Mr. Bradlaugh again sailed for America, leavingplenty of work to be done by his colleagues before he returned. TheExecutive of the National Secular Society had determined to issue a"Secular Song Book", and the task of selection and of editing wasconfided to me. The little book was duly issued, and ran through twoeditions; then, feeling that it was marred by many sins both ofcommission and omission, I set my face against the publication of a thirdedition, hoping that a compilation more worthy of Free Thought might bemade. I am half inclined to take the matter up again, and set to work ata fresh collection.The delivery and publication of a course of six lectures on the earlypart of the French Revolution was another portion of that autumn's work;they involved a large amount of labor, as I had determined to tell thestory from the people's point of view, and was therefore compelled toread a large amount of the current literature of the time, as well as thegreat standard histories of Louis Blanc, Michelet, and others.Fortunately for me, Mr. Bradlaugh had a splendid collection of works onthe subject, and before he left England he brought to me two cabs full ofbooks, French and English, from all points of view, aristocratic,ecclesiastical, democratic, and I studied these diligently andimpartially until the French Revolution became to me as a drama in whichI had myself taken part, and the actors therein became personal friendsand foes. In this, again, as in so much of my public work, I have tothank Mr. Bradlaugh for the influence which led me to read fully allsides of a question, and to read most carefully those from which Idiffered most, ere I judged myself competent to write or to speakthereon.The late autumn was clouded by the news of Mr. Bradlaugh's seriousillness in America. After struggling for some time against ill-health hewas struck down by an attack of pleurisy, to which soon was added typhoidfever, and for a time lay at the brink of the grave. Dr. Otis, his ablephysician, finding that it was impossible to give him the necessaryattendance at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, put him into his own carriage anddrove him to the Hospital of St. Luke's, where he confided him to thecare of Dr. Leaming, himself also visiting him daily. Of this illness the_Baltimore Advertiser_ wrote:"Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, the famous English Radical lecturer, has been sovery dangerously ill that his life has almost been despaired of. He wastaken ill at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, and partially recovered; but on theday upon which a lecture had been arranged from him before the LiberalClub he was taken down a second time with a relapse, which has been verynear proving fatal. The cause was overwork and complete nervousprostration which brought on low fever. His physician has allowed onefriend only to see him daily for five minutes, and removed him to St.Luke's Hospital for the sake of the absolute quiet, comfort, andintelligent attendance he could secure there, and for which he was gladto pay munificently. This long and severe illness has disappointed thehopes and retarded the object for which he came to this country; but heis gentleness and patience itself in his sickness in this strange land,and has endeared himself greatly to his physicians and attendants by hisgratitude and appreciation of the slightest attention."There is no doubt that the care so willingly lavished on the Englishstranger saved his life, and those who in England honor Charles Bradlaughas chief and love him as friend must always keep in grateful memory thosewho in his sorest need served him so nobly well. Those who think that anAtheist cannot calmly face the prospect of death might well learn alesson from the fortitude and courage shown by an Atheist as he lay atthe point of death, far from home and from all he loved best. The Rev.Mr. Frothingham bore public and admiring testimony in his own church toMr. Bradlaugh's perfect serenity, at once fearless and unpretending, and,himself a Theist, gave willing witness to the Atheist's calm strength.Mr. Bradlaugh returned to England at the end of December, worn to ashadow and terribly weak, and for many a long month he bore the traces ofhis wrestle with death. Indeed, he felt the effect of the illness foryears, for typhoid fever is a foe whose weapons leave scars even afterthe healing of the wounds it inflicts.The first work done by Mr. Bradlaugh on resuming the editorial chair ofthe _National Reformer_, was to indite a vigorous protest against theinvestment of national capital in the Suez Canal Shares. He exposed thefinancial condition of Egypt, gave detail after detail of the Khedive'sindebtedness, unveiled the rottenness of the Egyptian Government, warnedthe people of the danger of taking the first steps in a path which mustlead to continual interference in Egyptian finance, denounced theshameful job perpetrated by Mr. Disraeli in borrowing the money for thepurchase from the Rothschilds at enormous interest. His protest was, ofcourse, useless, but its justice has been proved by the course of events.The bombarding of Alexandria, the shameful repression of the nationalmovement in Egypt, the wholesale and useless slaughter in the Soudan, thewaste of English lives and English money, the new burden of debt and ofresponsibility now assumed by the Government, all these are the resultsof the fatal purchase of shares in the Suez Canal by Mr. Disraeli; yetagainst the chorus of praise which resounded from every side when thepurchase was announced, but one voice of disapproval and of warning wasraised at first; others soon caught the warning and saw the dangers itpointed out, but for awhile Charles Bradlaugh stood alone in hisopposition, and to him belongs the credit of at once seeing the perilwhich lay under the purchase.The 1876 Conference of the National Secular Society held at Leeds showedthe growing power of the organisation, and was made notable by a verypleasant incident--the presentation to a miner, William Washington, of asilver tea-pot and some books, in recognition of a very noble act ofself-devotion. An explosion had occurred on December 6th, 1875, atSwaithe Main pit, in which 143 miners were killed; a miner belonging to aneighboring pit, named William Washington, an Atheist, when every one washanging back, sprang into the cage to descend into the pit in forlornhope of rescue, when to descend seemed almost certain death. Othersswiftly followed the gallant volunteer, but he had set the example, andit was felt by the Executive of the National Secular Society that hisheroism deserved recognition, William Washington set his face against anygift to himself, so the subscription to a testimonial was limited to 6d.,and a silver teapot was presented to him for his wife and some books forhis children. At this same Conference a committee was appointed,consisting of Messrs. Charles Bradlaugh, G.J. Holyoake, C. Watts, R.A.Cooper,--Gimson, T. Slater, and Mrs. Besant, to draw up a fresh statementof the principles and objects of the National Secular Society; it wasdecided that this statement should be submitted to the ensuingConference, that the deliberation on the report of the Committee should"be open to all Freethinkers, but that only those will be entitled tovote on the ratification who declare their determination to enter theSociety on the basis of the ratified constitution". It was hoped that bythis means various scattered and independent societies might be broughtinto union, and that the National Secular Society might he therebystrengthened. The committee held a very large number of meetings andfinally decided on the following statement, which was approved of at theConference held at Nottingham in 1877, and stands now as the "Principlesand Object of the National Secular Society":--"The National Secular Society has been formed to maintain the principlesand rights of Freethought, and to direct their application to the Secularimprovement of this life."By the principle of Freethought is meant the exercise of theunderstanding upon relevant facts, and independently of penal or priestlyintimidation."By the rights of Freethought are meant the liberty of free criticism forthe security of truth, and the liberty of free publicity for theextension of truth."Secularism relates to the present existence of man, and to actions theissue of which can be tested by experience."It declares that the promotion of human improvement and happiness is thehighest duty, and that morality is to be tested by utility."That in order to promote effectually the improvement and happiness ofmankind, every individual of the human family ought to be well placed andwell instructed, and that all who are of a suitable age ought to beusefully employed for their own and the general good."That human improvement and happiness cannot be effectually promotedwithout civil and religious liberty; and that, therefore, it is the dutyof every individual to actively attack all barriers to equal freedom ofthought and utterance for all, upon political, theological, and socialsubjects."A Secularist is one who deduces his moral duties from considerationswhich pertain to this life, and who, practically recognising the aboveduties, devotes himself to the promotion of the general good."The object of the National Secular Society is to disseminate the aboveprinciples by every legitimate means in its power."At this same Conference of Leeds was inaugurated the subscription to thestatue to be erected in Rome to the memory of Giordano Bruno, burned inthat city for Atheism in 1600; this resulted in the collection of L60.The Executive appointed by the Leeds Conference made great efforts toinduce the Freethinkers of the country to work for the repeal of theBlasphemy Laws, and in October 1876 they issued a copy of a petitionagainst those evil laws to every one of the forty branches of theSociety. The effort proved, however, of little avail. The laws had notbeen put in force for a long time, and were regarded with apathy as beingobsolete, and it has needed the cruel imprisonments inflicted by Mr.Justice North on Messrs. Foote, Ramsey, and Kemp, to arouse theFreethought party to a sense of their duty in the matter.The year 1877 had scarcely opened ere we found ourselves with a seriousfight on our hands. A pamphlet written early in the present century byCharles Knowlton, M.D., entitled "The Fruits of Philosophy", which hadbeen sold unchallenged in England for nearly forty years, was suddenlyseized at Bristol as an obscene publication. The book had been suppliedin the ordinary course of business by Mr. Charles Watts, but the Bristolbookseller had altered its price, had inserted some indecent pictures init, and had sold it among literature to which the word obscene was fairlyapplied. In itself, Dr. Knowlton's work was merely a physiologicaltreatise, and it advocated conjugal prudence and parental responsibility;it argued in favor of early marriage, but as over-large families amongpersons of limited incomes imply either pauperism, or lack of necessaryfood, clothing, education, and fair start in life for the children, Dr.Knowlton advocated the restriction of the number of the family within themeans of existence, and stated the means by which this restriction shouldbe carried out. On hearing of the prosecution, Mr. Watts went down toBristol, and frankly announced himself as the publisher of the book. Soonafter his return to London he was arrested on the charge of havingpublished an obscene book, and was duly liberated on bail. Mr. and Mrs.Watts, Mr. Bradlaugh and myself met to arrange our plan of united actionon Friday, January 12th, and it was decided that Mr. Watts should defendthe book, that a fund should at once be raised for his legal expenses,and that once more the right of publication of useful knowledge in acheap form should be defended by the leaders of the Freethought party.After long and friendly discussion we separated with the plan of thecampaign arranged, and it was decided that I should claim the sympathyand help of the Plymouth friends, whom I was to address on the followingSunday, January 14th. I went down to Plymouth on January 13th, and therereceived a telegram from Mr. Watts, saying that a change of plan had beendecided on. I was puzzled, but none the less I appealed for help as I hadpromised to do, and a collection of L8 1s. 10d. for Mr. Watts' DefenceFund was made after my evening lecture. To my horror, on returning toLondon, I found that Mr. Watts had given way before the peril ofimprisonment, and had decided to plead guilty to the charge of publishingan obscene book, and to throw himself on the mercy of the Court, relyingon his previous good character and on an alleged ignorance of thecontents of the incriminated work. The latter plea we knew to be false,for Mr. Watts before going down to Bristol to declare himself responsiblefor the pamphlet had carefully read it and had marked all the passageswhich, being physiological, might be attacked as "obscene". This markedcopy he had sent to the Bristol bookseller, before he himself went toBristol to attend the trial, and under these circumstances any pretenceof ignorance of the contents of the book was transparently inaccurate.Mr. Watts' surrender, of course, upset all the arrangements we had agreedon; Mr. Bradlaugh and myself were prepared to stand by him in battle, butnot in surrender. I at once returned to the Secretary of the PlymouthBranch the money collected for defence, not for capitulation, and Mr.Bradlaugh published the following brief statement in the _NationalReformer_ for January 21st:"PROSECUTION OF Mr. CHARLES WATTS.--Mr. Charles Watts, as most of ourreaders will have already learned, has been committed for trial at theCentral Criminal Court for February 5th, for misdemeanor, for publicationof a work on the population question, entitled "Fruits of Philosophy", byCharles Knowlton, M.D. This book has been openly published in England andAmerica for more than thirty years. It was sold in England by JamesWatson, who always bore the highest repute. On James Watson's retirementfrom business it was sold by Holyoake & Co., at Fleet Street House, andwas afterwards sold by Mr. Austin Holyoake until the time of his death;and a separate edition was, up till last week, still sold by Mr. Brooks,of 282, Strand, W.C. When Mr. James Watson died, Mr. Charles Watts boughtfrom James Watson's widow a large quantity of stereotype plates,including this work. If this book is to be condemned as obscene, so alsoin my opinion must be many published by Messrs. W.H. Smith & Son, andother publishers, against whose respectability no imputation has beenmade. Such books as Darwin's 'Origin of Species' and 'Descent of Man'must immediately be branded as obscene, while no medical work must bepermitted publication; and all theological works, like those of Dulaure,Inman, etc., dealing with ancient creeds, must at once be suppressed. Thebulk of the publications of the society for the repeal of the ContagiousDiseases Acts, together with its monthly organ, the _Shield_, would beequally liable. The issue of the greater part of classic authors, and ofLempriere, Shakspere, Sterne, Fielding, Richardson, Rabelais, etc., mustbe stopped: while the Bible--containing obscene passages omitted from thelectionary--must no longer be permitted circulation. All these containobscenity which is either inserted to amuse or to instruct, and themedical work now assailed deals with physiological points purely toinstruct, and to increase the happiness of men and women."If the pamphlet now prosecuted had been brought to me for publication, Ishould probably have declined to publish it, not because of thesubject-matter, but because I do not like its style. If I had oncepublished it, I should defend it until the very last. Here Mr. Watts andmyself disagree in opinion; and as he is the person chiefly concerned, itis, of course, right that his decision should determine what is done. Hetells me that he thinks the pamphlet indefensible, and that he was misledin publishing it without examination as part of James Watson's stock. Ithink it ought to be fought right through. Under these circumstances Ican only leave Mr. Watts to speak for himself, as we so utterly differ inopinion on this case that I cease to be his proper interpreter. I have,therefore, already offered Mr. Watts the columns of the _NationalReformer_, that he may put before the party his view of the case, whichhe does in another column."--C. BRADLAUGH.XIV.Up to this time (January, 1877) Mr. Watts had acted as sub-editor of the_National Reformer_, and printer and publisher of the books and pamphletsissued by Mr. Bradlaugh and myself. The continuance of this common workobviously became impossible after Mr. Watts had determined to surrenderone of his publications under threat of prosecution. We felt that for twomain reasons we could no longer publicly associate ourselves with him:(1) We could not retain on our publications the name of a man who hadpleaded guilty to the publication of an obscene work; (2) Many of ourwritings were liable to prosecution for blasphemy, and it was necessarythat we should have a publisher who could be relied on to stand firm intime of peril; we felt that if Mr. Watts surrendered one thing he wouldbe likely to surrender others. This feeling on my part was strengthenedby the remembrance of a request of his made a few months before, that Iwould print my own name instead of his as publisher of a political song Ihad issued, on the ground that it might come within the law of seditiouslibel. I had readily acceded at the time, but when absolute surrenderunder attack followed on timid precaution against attack, I felt that abolder publisher was necessary to me. No particular blame should be laidon persons who are constitutionally timid; they have their own line ofusefulness, and are often pleasant and agreeable folk enough; but theyare out of place in the front rank of a fighting movement, for theirdesertion in face of the enemy means added danger for those left to carryon the fight. We therefore decided to sever ourselves from Mr. Watts; andMr. Bradlaugh, in the _National Reformer_ of January 28th, inserted thefollowing statement:"The divergence of opinion between myself and Mr. Charles Watts is socomplete on the Knowlton case, that he has already ceased to besub-editor of this journal, and I have given him notice determining ourconnexion on and from March 25th. My reasons for this course are asfollows. The Knowlton pamphlet is either decent or indecent. If decent itought to be defended; if indecent it should never have been published. Tojudge it indecent is to condemn, with the most severe condemnation, JamesWatson whom I respected, and Austin Holyoake with whom I worked. I holdthe work to be defensible, and I deny the right of any one to interferewith the full and free discussion of social questions affecting thehappiness of the nation. The struggle for a free press has been one ofthe marks of the Freethought Party throughout its history, and as long asthe Party permits me to hold its flag, I will never voluntarily lower it.I have no right and no power to dictate to Mr. Watts the course he shouldpursue, but I have the right and duty to refuse to associate my name witha submission which is utterly repugnant to my nature, and inconsistentwith my whole career."After a long discussion, Mr. Bradlaugh and I made up our minds as to thecourse we would pursue. We decided that we would never again placeourselves at a publisher's mercy, but would ensure the defence of all wepublished by publishing everything ourselves; we resolved to becomeprinters and publishers, and to take any small place we could find andopen it as a Freethought shop. I undertook the sub-editorship of the_National Reformer_, and the weekly Summary of News, which had hithertobeen done by Mr. Watts, was placed in the hands of Mr. Bradlaugh'sdaughters. The next thing to do was to find a publishing office.Somewhere within reach of Fleet Street the office must be; small it mustbe, as we had no funds and the risk of starting a business of which weknew nothing was great. Still "all things are possible to" those who areresolute; we discovered a tumble-down little place in Stonecutter Streetand secured it by the good offices of our friend, Mr. Charles Herbert; weborrowed a few hundred pounds from personal friends, and made our newtenement habitable; we drew up a deed of partnership, founding the"Freethought Publishing Company", Mr. Bradlaugh and myself being the onlypartners; we engaged Mr. W.J. Ramsey as manager of the business; and inthe _National Reformer_ of February 25th we were able to announce:"The publishing office of the _National Reformer_ and of all the works ofCharles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant is now at 28, Stonecutter Street,E.C., three doors from Farringdon Street, where the manager, Mr. W.J.Ramsey, will be glad to receive orders for the supply of any Freethoughtliterature".A week later we issued the following address:"ADDRESS FROM THE FREETHOUGHT PUBLISHING COMPANY TO THE READERS OF THE'NATIONAL REFORMER'."When the prospectus of the _National Reformer_ was issued by thefounder, Charles Bradlaugh, in 1859, he described its policy as'Atheistic in theology, Republican in politics, and Malthusian in socialeconomy', and a free platform was promised and has been maintained forthe discussion of each of these topics. In ventilating the populationquestion the stand taken by Mr. Bradlaugh, both here and on the platform,is well known to our old readers, and many works bearing on this vitalsubject have been advertised and reviewed in these columns. In this the_National Reformer_ has followed the course pursued by Mr. George JacobHolyoake, who in 1853 published a 'Freethought Directory', giving a listof the various books supplied from the 'Fleet Street House', and whichlist contained amongst others:"'Anti-Marcus on the Population Question.'"Fowler's Tracts on Physiology, etc."Dr. C. Knowlton's 'Fruits of Philosophy'."'Moral Physiology: a plain treatise on the Population Question.'"In this Directory Mr. G.J. Holyoake says:"'No. 147 Fleet Street is a Central Secular Book Depot, where all worksextant in the English language on the side of Freethought in Religion,Politics, Morals, and Culture are kept in stock, or are procured at shortnotice.'"We shall try to do at 28 Stonecutter Street that which Mr. Holyoake'sDirectory promised for Fleet Street House."The partners in the Freethought Publishing Company are Annie Besant andCharles Bradlaugh, who have entered into a legal partnership for thepurpose of sharing the legal responsibility of the works they publish."We intend to publish nothing that we do not think we can morally defend.All that we do publish we shall defend. We do not mean that we shallagree with all we publish, but we shall, so far as we can, try to keepthe possibility of free utterance of earnest, honest opinion."It may not be out of place here to remind new readers of this journal ofthat which old readers well know, that no articles are editorial exceptthose which are unsigned or bear the name of the editor, or that of thesub-editor; for each and every other article the author is allowed to sayhis own say in his own way; the editor only furnishes the means toaddress our readers, leaving to him or to her the right andresponsibility of divergent thought."ANNIE BESANT"CHARLES BRADLAUGH."Thus we found ourselves suddenly launched on a new undertaking, and withsome amusement and much trepidation I realised that I was "in business",with business knowledge amounting to _nil_. I had, however, fair abilityand plenty of goodwill, and I determined to learn my work, feeling proudthat I had become one of the list of "Freethought publishers", whopublished for love of the cause of freedom, and risked all for thetriumph of a principle ere it wore "silver slippers and walked in thesunshine with applause".On February 8th Mr. Watts was tried at the Old Bailey. He withdrew hisplea of "Not Guilty", and pleaded "Guilty". His counsel urged that he wasa man of good character, that Mr. George Jacob Holyoake had sold theincriminated pamphlet, that Mr. Watts had bought the stereo-plates of itin the stock of the late Mr. Austin Holyoake, which he had taken overbodily, and that he had never read the book until after the Bristolinvestigation. "Mr. Watts pledges himself to me", the counsel stated,"that he was entirely ignorant of the contents of this pamphlet until heheard passages read from it in the prosecution at Bristol". The counselfor the prosecution pointed out that this statement was inaccurate, andread passages from Mr. Watts' deposition made on the first occasion atBristol, in which Mr. Watts stated that he had perused the book, and wasprepared to justify it as a medical work. He, however, did not wish topress the case, if the plates and stock were destroyed, and Mr. Watts wasaccordingly discharged on his own recognisances in L500 to come up forjudgment when called on.While this struggle was raging, an old friend of Mr. Bradlaugh's, Mr.George Odger, was slowly passing away; the good old man lay dying in hispoor lodgings in High Street, Oxford Street, and I find recorded in the_National Reformer_ of March 4th, that on February 28th we had been tosee him, and that "he is very feeble and is, apparently, sinking fast;but he is as brave and bright, facing his last enemy, as he has ever beenfacing his former ones". He died on March 4th, and was buried in BromptonCemetery on the 10th of the same month.A grave question now lay before us for decision. The Knowlton pamphlethad been surrendered; was that surrender to stand as the last word of theFreethought party on a book which had been sold by the most prominent menin its ranks for forty years? To our minds such surrender, leftunchallenged, would be a stain on all who submitted to it, and we decidedthat faulty as the book was in many respects it had yet become the symbolof a great principle, of the right to circulate physiological knowledgeamong the poor in pamphlets published at a price they could afford topay. Deliberately counting the risk, recognising that by our action weshould subject ourselves to the vilest slander, knowing that Christianmalice would misrepresent and ignorance would echo the misrepresentation--we yet resolved that the sacrifice must be made, and made by us invirtue of our position in the Freethought Party. If the leaders flinchedhow could the followers be expected to fight? The greatest sacrifice hadto be made by Mr. Bradlaugh. How would an indictment for publishing anobscene book affect his candidature for Northampton? What a new weaponfor his foes, what a new difficulty for his friends! I may say here thatour worst forebodings were realised by the event; we have been assailedas "vendors of obscene literature", as "writers of obscene books", as"living by the circulation of filthy books". And it is because suchaccusations have been widely made that I here place on permanent recordthe facts of the case, for thus, at least, some honest opponents willlearn the truth and will cease to circulate the slanders they may haverepeated in ignorance.On February 27th our determination to republish the Knowlton pamphlet wasannounced by Mr. Bradlaugh in an address delivered by him at the Hall ofScience on "The Right of Publication". Extracts from a brief report,published in the _National Reformer_ of March 11th, will show the driftof his statement:"Mr. Bradlaugh was most warmly welcomed to the platform, and reiteratedcheers greeted him as he rose to make his speech. Few who heard him thatevening will forget the passion and the pathos with which he spoke. Thedefence of the right to publish was put as strongly and as firmly aswords could put it, and the determination to maintain that right, in dockand in jail as on the platform, rang out with no uncertain sound. Truly,as the orator said: 'The bold words I have spoken from this place wouldbe nothing but the emptiest brag and the coward's boast, if I flinchednow in the day of battle'. Every word of praise of the fighters of oldwould fall in disgrace on the head of him who spoke it, if when the timecame to share in their peril he shrunk back from the danger of thestrife.... Mr. Bradlaugh drew a graphic picture of the earlier strugglesfor a free press, and then dealt with the present state of the law; fromthat he passed on to the pamphlet which is the test-question of the hour;he pointed out how some parts of it were foolish, such as the'philosophical proem', but remarked that he knew no right in law toforbid the publication of all save wisdom; he then showed how, had heoriginally been asked to publish the pamphlet, he should have raised someobjections to its style, but that was a very different matter frompermitting the authorities to stop its sale; the style of many booksmight be faulty without the books being therefore obscene. He contendedthe book was a perfectly moral medical work, and was no more indecentthan every other medical work dealing with the same subject. Theknowledge it gave was useful knowledge; many a young man might be savedfrom disease by such a knowledge as was contained in the book; if it wasargued that such books should not be sold at so cheap a rate, he repliedthat it was among the masses that such physiological knowledge wasneeded, 'and if there is one subject above all others', he exclaimed,'for which a man might gladly sacrifice his hopes and his life, surely itis for that which would relieve his fellow-men from poverty, the motherof crimes, and would make happy homes where now only want and sufferingreign'. He had fully counted the cost; he knew all he might lose; butCarlile before him had been imprisoned for teaching the same doctrine,'and what Carlile did for his day, I, while health and strength remain,will do for mine'."The position we took up in republishing the pamphlet was clearly statedin the preface which we wrote for it, and which I here reprint, as itgives plainly and briefly the facts of the case:"PUBLISHERS' PREFACE TO DR. KNOWLTON'S 'FRUITS OF PHILOSOPHY'."The pamphlet which we now present to the public is one which has beenlately prosecuted under Lord Campbell's Act, and which we now republishin order to test the right of publication. It was originally written byCharles Knowlton, M.D., an American physician, whose degree entitles himto be heard with respect on a medical question. It is openly sold andwidely circulated in America at the present time. It was first publishedin England, about forty years ago, by James Watson, the gallant Radicalwho came to London and took up Richard Carlile's work when Carlile was injail. He sold it unchallenged for many years, approved it, andrecommended it. It was printed and published by Messrs. Holyoake and Co.,and found its place, with other works of a similar character, in their'Freethought Directory' of 1853, and was thus identified with Freethoughtliterature at the then leading Freethought _depot_ . Mr. Austin Holyoake,working in conjunction with Mr. Bradlaugh at the _National Reformer_office, Johnson's Court, printed and published it in his turn, and thiswell-known Freethought advocate, in his 'Large or Small Families'.selected this pamphlet, together with R.D. Owen's 'Moral Physiology' andthe 'Elements of Social Science', for special recommendation. Mr. CharlesWatts, succeeding to Mr. Austin Holyoake's business, continued the sale,and when Mr. Watson died in 1875, he bought the plates of the work (withothers) from Mrs. Watson, and continued to advertise and to sell it untilDecember 23rd, 1876. For the last forty years the book has thus beenidentified with Freethought, advertised by leading Freethinkers,published under the sanction of their names, and sold in thehead-quarters of Freethought literature. If during this long period theparty has thus--without one word of protest--circulated an indecent work,the less we talk about Freethought morality the better; the work has beenlargely sold, and if leading Freethinkers have sold it--profiting by thesale--in mere carelessness, few words could be strong enough to brand theindifference which thus scattered obscenity broadcast over the land. Thepamphlet has been withdrawn from circulation in consequence of theprosecution instituted against Mr. Charles Watts, but the question of itslegality or illegality has not been tried; a plea of 'Guilty' was put inby the publisher, and the book, therefore, was not examined, nor was anyjudgment passed upon it; no jury registered a verdict, and the judgestated that he had not read the work."We republish this pamphlet, honestly believing that on all questionsaffecting the happiness of the people, whether they be theological,political, or social, fullest right of free discussion ought to bemaintained at all hazards. We do not personally endorse all that Dr.Knowlton says: his 'Philosophical Proem' seems to us full ofphilosophical mistakes, and--as we are neither of us doctors--we are notprepared to endorse his medical views; but since progress can only bemade through discussion, and no discussion is possible where differingopinions are suppressed, we claim the right to publish all opinions, sothat the public, enabled to see all sides of a question, may have thematerials for forming a sound judgment."The alterations made are very slight; the book was badly printed, anderrors of spelling and a few clumsy grammatical expressions have beencorrected; the sub-title has been changed, and in one case four lineshave been omitted, because they are repeated word for word further on. Wehave, however, made some additions to the pamphlet, which are in allcases kept distinct from the original text. Physiology has made greatstrides during the past forty years, and not considering it right tocirculate erroneous physiology, we submitted the pamphlet to a doctor inwhose accurate knowledge we have the fullest confidence, and who iswidely known in all parts of the world as the author of the "Elements ofSocial Science"; the notes signed "G.R." are written by this gentleman.References to other works are given in foot notes for the assistance ofthe reader, if he desires to study the subject further."Old Radicals will remember that Richard Carlile published a workentitled 'Every Woman's Book', which deals with the same subject, andadvocates the same object, as Dr. Knowlton's pamphlet. E.D. Owen objectedto the 'style and tone' of Carlile's 'Every Woman's Book' as not being'in good taste', and he wrote his 'Moral Physiology', to do in Americawhat Carlile's work was intended to do in England. This work of Carlile'swas stigmatised as 'indecent' and 'immoral' because it advocated, as doesDr. Knowlton's, the use of preventive checks to population. In strivingto carry on Carlile's work, we cannot expect to escape Carlile'sreproach, but whether applauded or condemned we mean to carry it on,socially as well as politically and theologically."We believe, with the Rev. Mr. Malthus, that population has a tendency toincrease faster than the means of existence, and that _some_ checks musttherefore exercise control over population; the checks now exercised aresemi-starvation and preventible disease; the enormous mortality among theinfants of the poor is one of the checks which now keeps down thepopulation. The checks that ought to control population are scientific,and it is these which we advocate. We think it more moral to prevent theconception of children, than, after they are born, to murder them by wantof food, air, and clothing. We advocate scientific checks to population,because, so long as poor men have large families, pauperism is anecessity, and from pauperism grow crime and disease. The wage whichwould support the parents and two or three children in comfort anddecency is utterly insufficient to maintain a family of twelve orfourteen, and we consider it a crime to bring into the world human beingsdoomed to misery or to premature death. It is not only the hand-workingclasses which are concerned in this question. The poor curate, thestruggling man of business, the young professional man, are often madewretched for life by their inordinately large families, and their yearsare passed in one long battle to live; meanwhile the woman's health issacrificed and her life embittered from the same cause. To all of these,we point the way of relief and of happiness; for the sake of these wepublish what others fear to issue, and we do it, confident that if wefail the first time, we shall succeed at last, and that the Englishpublic will not permit the authorities to stifle a discussion of the mostimportant social question which can influence a nation's welfare."CHARLES BRADLAUGH."ANNIE BESANT."We advertised the sale of the pamphlet in the _National Reformer_ ofMarch 25th (published March 22nd) in the following words:FRUITS OF PHILOSOPHY. By CHARLES KNOWLTON, M.D. PRICE SIXPENCE.This Pamphlet will be republished on Saturday, March 24th, _in extenso_,with some additional Medical Notes by a London Doctor of Medicine. Itwill be on sale at 28, Stonecutter Street, E.G., after 4 p.m. until closeof shop. No one need apply before this time, as none will be on sale. Mr.Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant will be in attendance from thathour, and will sell personally the first hundred copies.FREETHOUGHT PUBLISHING COMPANY, 28, Stonecutter Street, E.C.In addition to this we ourselves delivered copies on March 23rd to Mr.Martin, the Chief Clerk of the magistrates at Guildhall, to the officerin charge at the City Police Office in Old Jewry, and to the Solicitorfor the City of London. With each pamphlet we handed in a notice that weshould attend personally to sell the book on March 24th, at StonecutterStreet, from 4 to 5 p.m. These precautions were taken in order to forcethe authorities to prosecute us, and not any of our subordinates, if theyprosecuted at all. The account of the first sale will interest many:"On Saturday we went down to Stonecutter Street, accompanied by theMisses Bradlaugh and Mr. and Mrs. Touzeau Parris; we arrived at No. 28 atthree minutes to four, and found a crowd awaiting us. We promptly filledthe window with copies of the pamphlet, as a kind of general notice ofthe sale within, and then opened the door. The shop was filledimmediately, and in twenty minutes over 500 copies were sold. No one soldsave Mr. Bradlaugh and myself, but Miss Bradlaugh sorted dozens with askill that seemed to stamp her as intended by nature for the business,while her sister supplied change with a rapidity worthy of a bank clerk.Several detectives favored us with a visit, and one amused us by comingin and buying two copies from Mr. Bradlaugh, and then retiringgracefully; after an interval of perhaps a quarter of an hour hereappeared, and purchased one from me. Two policemen outside madethemselves useful; one patrolled the street calmly, and the other verykindly aided Norrish, Mr. Eamsey's co-worker, in his efforts to keep thestream flowing quietly, without too much pressure. Mr. Bradlaugh's voicewas heard warningly from time to time, bidding customers not to crowd,and everything went well and smoothly, save that I occasionally got intofearful muddles in the intricacies of 'trade price'; I disgusted onecustomer, who muttered roughly 'Ritchie', and who, when I gave him twocopies, and put his shilling in the till, growled: 'I shan't take them'.I was fairly puzzled, till Mr. Bradlaugh enlightened me as to thedifficulty, 'Ritchie' to me being unknown; it appeared that 'Ritchie',muttered by the buyer, meant that the copies were wanted by a booksellerof that name, and his messenger was irate at being charged full price.Friends from various parts appeared to give a kindly word; a number ofthe members of the Dialectical Society came in, and many were thecongratulations and promises of aid in case of need. Several who came inoffered to come forward as bail, and their names were taken by Mr.Parris. The buyer that most raised my curiosity was one of Mr. Watts'sons, who came in and bought seven copies, putting down only trade-priceon the counter; no one is supplied at trade-price unless he buys to sellagain, and we have all been wondering why Mr. Watts should intend to sellthe Knowlton pamphlet, after he has proclaimed it to be obscene andindecent. At six o'clock the shutters were put up, and we gave up ouramateur shop-keeping; our general time for closing on Saturday is 2 p.m.,but we kept the shop open on Saturday for the special purpose of sellingthe Knowlton pamphlet. We sold about 800 copies, besides sending out alarge number of country parcels, so that if the police now amusethemselves in seizing the work, they will entirely have failed instopping its circulation. The pamphlet, during the present week, willhave been sold over England and Scotland, and the only effect of thefoolish police interference will be to have sold a large edition. We mustadd one word of thanks to them for the kindly aid given us by theirgratuitous advertisement."[I may note here, in passing, that we printed our edition verbatim fromthat issued by James Watson, not knowing that various editions were incirculation. It was thereupon stated by Mr. Watts that we had notreprinted the pamphlet for which he was prosecuted, so we at once issuedanother edition, printed from his own version.]The help that flowed in to us from all sides was startling both inquantity and quality; a Defence Committee was quickly formed, consistingof the following persons:"C.R. Drysdale, M.D., Miss Vickery, H.R.S. Dalton, B.A., W.J. Birch,M.A., J. Swaagman, Mrs. Swaagman, P.A.V. Le Lubez, Mdme. Le Lubez, MissBradlaugh, Miss H. Bradlaugh, Mrs. Parris, T. Allsop, E.

Talandier (Member of the Chamber of Deputies), J.Baxter Langley, LL.D., M.R.C.S., F.L.S."Mrs. Fenwick Miller's letter of adhesion is worthy republication; it putsso tersely the real position:"59, Francis Terrace. Victoria Park."March 31st."My dear Mrs. Besant,--I feel myself privileged in having the opportunityof expressing both to you and to the public, by giving you my small aidto your defence, how much I admire the noble position taken up by Mr.Bradlaugh and yourself upon this attempt to suppress free discussion, andto keep the people in enforced ignorance upon the most important ofsubjects. It is shameful that you should have to do it through thecowardice of the less important person who might have made himself a heroby doing as you now do, but was too weak for his opportunities. Since youhave had to do it, however, accept the assurance of my warm sympathy, andmy readiness to aid in any way within my power in your fight. Please addmy name to your Committee. You will find a little cheque within: I wish Ihad fifty times as much to give."Under other circumstances, the pamphlet might well have been withdrawnfrom circulation, since its physiology its obsolete, and consequently itspractical deductions to some extent unsound. But it must be everywherecomprehended that _this is not the point_. The book would have beenequally attacked had its physiology been new and sound; the prosecutionis against the right to issue a work upon the special subject, andagainst the freedom of the press and individual liberty.--Believe me,yours very faithfully,R. FENWICK MILLER."Among the many received were letters of encouragement from GeneralGaribaldi, M. Talandier, Professor Emile Acollas, and the Rev. S.D.Headlam.As we did not care to be hunted about London by the police, we offered tobe at Stonecutter Street daily from 10 to 11 a.m. until we were arrested,and our offer was readily accepted. Friends who were ready to act as bailcame forward in large numbers, and we arranged with some of them thatthey should be within easy access in case of need. There was a littledelay in issuing the warrants for our arrest. A deputation from theChristian Evidence Society waited on Mr. (now Sir Richard) Cross, to askthat the Government should prosecute us, and he acceded to their request.The warrants were issued on April 3rd, and were executed on April 5th.The story of the arrest I take from my own article in the _NationalReformer,_ premising that we had been told that "the warrants were in thehands of Simmons"."Thursday morning found us again on our way to Stonecutter Street, and aswe turned into it we were aware of three gentlemen regarding usaffectionately from beneath the shelter of a ladder on the off-side ofFarringdon Street. 'That's Simmons,' quoth Mr. Bradlaugh, as we went in,and I shook my head solemnly, regarding 'Simmons' as the unsubstantialshadow of a dream. But as the two Misses Bradlaugh and myself reached theroom above the shop, a gay--'I told you so', from Mr. Bradlaughdownstairs, announced a visit, and in another moment Mr. Bradlaugh cameup, followed by the three unknown. 'You know what we have come for,' saidthe one in front; and no one disputed his assertion. Detective-SergeantR. Outram was the head officer, and he produced his warrant at Mr.Bradlaugh's request; he was accompanied by two detective officers,Messrs. Simmons and Williams. He was armed also with a search warrant, amost useful document, seeing that the last copy of the edition (of 5,000copies) had been sold on the morning of the previous day, and a high pileof orders was accumulating downstairs, orders which we were unable tofulfil. Mr. Bradlaugh told him, with a twinkle in his eye, that he wastoo late, but offered him every facility for searching. A large packet of'Text Books'--left for that purpose by Norrish, if the truth were known--whose covers were the same color as those of the 'Fruits', attracted Mr.Outram's attention, and he took off some of the brown paper wrapper, butfound the goods unseizable. He took one copy of the 'Cause of Woman', byBen Elmy, and wandered up and down the house seeking for goods to devour,but found nothing to reward him for his energy. Meanwhile we wrote a fewtelegrams and a note or two, and after about half-an-hour's delay, westarted for the police-station in Bridewell Place, arriving there at10.25. The officers, who showed us every courtesy and kindness consistentwith the due execution of their duty, allowed Mr. Bradlaugh and myself towalk on in front, and they followed us across the roar of Fleet Street,down past Ludgate Hill Station, to the Police Office. Here we passed intoa fair-sized room, and were requested to go into a funny iron-barredplace; it was a large oval railed in, with a brightly polished iron barrunning round it, the door closing with a snap. Here we stood while twoofficers in uniform got out their books; one of these reminded Mr.Bradlaugh of his late visits there, remarking that he supposed the'gentleman you were so kind to will do you the same good turn now'. Mr.Bradlaugh dryly replied that he didn't think so, accepting service andgiving it were two very different things. Our examination then began;names, ages, abodes, birth-places, number of children, color of hair andeyes, were all duly enrolled; then we were measured, and our heights putdown; next we delivered up watches, purses, letters, keys--in factemptied our pockets; then I was walked off by the housekeeper into aneighboring cell and searched--a surely most needless proceeding; itstrikes me this is an unnecessary indignity to which to subject anuncondemned prisoner, except in cases of theft, where stolen propertymight be concealed about the person. It is extremely unpleasant to behandled, and on such a charge as that against myself a search was anabsurdity. The woman was as civil as she could be, but, as she fairlyenough said, she had no option in the matter. After this, I went back tothe room and rejoined my fellow prisoner and we chatted peaceably withour guardians; they quite recognised our object in our proceedings, andone gave it as his opinion that we ought to have been summoned, and nottaken by warrant. Taken, however, we clearly were, and we presently droveon to Guildhall, Mr. Outram in the cab with us, and Mr. Williams on thebox."At Guildhall, we passed straight into the court, through the dock, anddown the stairs. Here Mr. Outram delivered us over to the gaoler, and themost uncomfortable part of our experiences began. Below the court are anumber of cells, stone floored and whitewashed walled; instead of doorsthere are heavy iron gates, covered with thick close grating; thepassages are divided here and there with similar strong iron gates, onlysome of which are grated. The rules of the place of course divided thesexes, so Mr. Bradlaugh and myself were not allowed to occupy the samecell; the gaoler, however, did the best he could for us, by allowing meto remain in a section of the passage which separated the men's from thewomen's cells, and by putting Mr. Bradlaugh into the first of the men's.Then, by opening a little window in the thick wall, a grating wasdiscovered, through which we could dimly see each other. Mr. Bradlaugh'sface, as seen from my side, scored all over with the little oblong holesin the grating reflected by the dull glimmer of the gas in the passage,was curious rather than handsome; mine was, probably, not moreattractive. In this charming place we passed two hours-and-a-half, and itwas very dull and very cold. We solaced ourselves, at first, by readingthe _Secular Review_, Mr. Bradlaugh tearing it into pages, and passingthem one by one through the grating. By pushing on his side and pullingon mine, we managed to get them through the narrow holes. Our positionwhen we read them was a strange satire on one article (which I read withgreat pain), which expressed the writer's opinion that the book was soaltered as not to be worth prosecuting. Neither the police nor themagistrate recognised any difference between the two editions. As I knewthe second edition, taken from Mr. Watts', was almost ready for deliveryas I read, I could not help smiling at the idea that no one 'had thecourage' to reprint it."Mr. Bradlaugh paced up and down his limited kingdom, and after I hadfinished correcting an _N.R._, I sometimes walked and sometimes sat, andwe chatted over future proceedings, and growled at our long detention,and listened to names of prisoners being called, until we were at lastsummoned to 'go up higher', and we joyfully obeyed. It was a strange sortof place to stand in, the dock of a police-court the position struck oneas really funny, and everyone who looked at us seemed to feel the sameincongruity: officials, chief clerk, magistrate, all were equally polite,and Mr. Bradlaugh seemed to get his own way from the dock as much aseverywhere else. The sitting magistrate was Alderman Figgins, a nice,kindly old gentleman, robed in marvellous, but not uncomely, garments ofblack velvet, purple, and dark fur. Below the magistrate, on either hand,sat a gentleman writing, one of whom was Mr. Martin, the chief clerk, whotook the purely formal evidence required to justify the arrest. Thereporters all sat at the right, and Mr. Touzeau Parris shared theirbench, sitting on the corner nearest us. Just behind him Mr. Outram hadkindly found seats for the two Misses Bradlaugh, who surveyed usplacidly, and would, I am sure, had their duty called them to do so, havegladly and willingly changed places with us. The back of the court wasfilled with kindly faces, and many bright smiles greeted us; among thepeople were those who so readily volunteered their aid, those describedby an official as 'a regular waggon-load of bail'. Their presence therewas a most useful little demonstration of support, and the telegrams thatkept dropping in also had their effect. 'Another of your friends, Mr.Bradlaugh,' quoth the chief clerk, as the fourth was handed to him, and Ihear that the little buff envelopes continued to arrive all theafternoon. I need not here detail what happened in the court, as a fullreport by a shorthand writer appears in another part of the paper, and Ionly relate odds and ends. It amused me to see the broad grin which ranround when the detective was asked whether he had executed the seizurewarrant, and he answered sadly that there was 'nothing to seize'. Whenbail was called for, Dr. Drysdale, Messrs. Swaagman, Truelove, and Bellwere the first summoned, and no objections being raised to them, norfurther securities asked for, these four gentlemen were all that wereneeded. We were then solemnly and severally informed that we were boundover in our own recognizances of L200 each to appear on Tuesday, April17th, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, to answer, etc., etc., etc., towhich adjuration I only replied by a polite little bow. After all this wepassed into a small room at one side, and there waited till divers paperswere delivered unto us, and we were told to depart in peace. A number ofpeople had gathered outside and cheered us warmly as we came out, onevoice calling: 'Bravo! there's some of the old English spirit left yet'.Being very hungry (it was nearly three o'clock), we went off to luncheon,very glad that the warrant was no longer hanging over our heads, and onour way home we bought a paper announcing our arrest. The evening papersall contained reports of the proceedings, as did also the papers of thefollowing morning. I have seen the _Globe, Standard, Daily News, Times,Echo, Daily Telegraph_, and they all give perfectly fair reports of whattook place. It is pleasant that they all seem to recognise that ourreason for acting as we have done is a fair and honorable desire to testthe right of publication."XV.The preliminary investigation before the magistrates at Guildhall dulycame on upon April 17th, the prosecution being conducted by Mr. DouglasStraight and Mr. F. Mead. The case was put by Mr. Straight with extremecare and courtesy, the learned counsel stating, "I cannot conceal frommyself, or from those who instruct me, that everything has been done inaccordance with fairness and _bona fides_ on the part of Mr. Bradlaughand the lady sitting by the side of him". Mr. Straight contended that thegood intentions of a publisher could not be taken as proving that a bookwas not indictable, and laid stress on the cheapness of the work, "theprice charged is so little as sixpence". Mr. Bradlaugh proved that therewas no physiological statement in Knowlton, which was not given in farfuller detail in standard works on physiology, quoting Carpenter, Dalton,Acton, and others; he showed that Malthus, Professor Fawcett, Mrs.Fawcett, and others, advocated voluntary limitation of the family,establishing his positions by innumerable quotations. A number of eminentmen were in Court, subpoenaed to prove their own works, and I find onthem the following note, written by myself at the time:--"We necessarily put some of our medical and publishing witnesses to greatinconvenience in summoning them into court, but those who were reallymost injured were the most courteous. Mr. Truebner, although sufferingfrom a painful illness, and although, we had expressed our willingness toaccept in his stead some member of his staff, was present, kindly andpleasant as usual. Dr. Power, a most courteous gentleman, called awayfrom an examination of some 180 young men, never thought of asking thathe should be relieved from the citizen's duty, but only privately askedto be released as soon as possible. Dr. Parker was equally worthy of thenoble profession to which he belonged, and said he did not want to staylonger than he need, but would be willing to return whenever wanted.Needless to say that Dr. Drysdale was there, ready to do his duty. Dr.W.B. Carpenter was a strange contrast to these; he was rough anddiscourteous in manner, and rudely said that he was not responsible for'Human Physiology, by Dr. Carpenter', as his responsibility had ceasedwith the fifth edition. It seems a strange thing that a man of eminence,presumably a man of honor, should disavow all responsibility for a bookwhich bears his name as author on the title-page. Clearly, if the 'HumanPhysiology' is not Dr. Carpenter's, the public is grossly deceived by thepretence that it is, and if, as Dr. Carpenter says, the wholeresponsibility rests on Dr. Power, then that gentleman should have thewhole credit of that very useful book. It is not right that Dr. Carpentershould have all the glory and Dr. Power all the annoyance resulting fromthe work."Among all the men we came into contact with during the trial, Dr.Carpenter and Professor Fawcett were the only two who shrank fromendorsing their own written statements.The presiding magistrate, Mr. Alderman Figgins, devoted himself gallantlyto the unwonted task of wading through physiological text books, the poorold gentleman's hair sometimes standing nearly on end, and his composurebeing sadly ruffled when he found that Dr. Carpenter's florid treatise,with numerous illustrations of a, to him, startling character, was givento young boys and girls as a prize in Government examinations. Hecompared Knowlton with the work of Dr. Acton's submitted to him, and saiddespondingly that one was just the same as the other. At the end of theday the effect made on him by the defence was shown by his letting us gofree without bail. Mr. Bradlaugh finished his defence at the next hearingof the case on April 19th, and his concluding remarks, showing theposition we took, may well find their place here:"The object of this book is to circulate amongst the masses of the poorand wretched (as far as my power will circulate it), and to seek toproduce in their minds such prudential views on the subject of populationas shall at least hinder some of the horrors to be witnessed amongst thestarving. I have not put you to the trouble of hearing proof--even if Iwere, in this court, permitted to do so--of facts on the PopulationQuestion, because the learned counsel for the prosecution, with thefrankness which characterises this prosecution, admitted there was thetendency on the part of animated nature to increase until checked by theabsence or deficiency of the means of subsistence. This being so, somechecks must step in; these checks must be either positive or preventiveand prudential. What are positive checks? The learned counsel has toldyou what they are. They are war, disease, misery, starvation. They are inChina--to take a striking instance--accompanied by habits so revoltingthat I cannot now allude to them. See the numbers of miserable starvingchildren in the great cities and centres of population. Is it right to goto these people and say, 'bring into the world children who cannot live',who all their lives are prevented by the poverty-smitten frames of theirparents, and by their own squalid surroundings, from enjoying almostevery benefit of the life thrust on them! who inherit the diseases andadopt the crimes which poverty and misery have provided for them? Thevery medical works I have put in in this case show how true this is intoo many cases, and if you read the words of Dr. Acton, crime issometimes involved of a terrible nature which the human tongue governedby training shrinks from describing. We justly or erroneously believethat we are doing our duty in putting this information in the hands ofthe people, and we contest this case with no kind of bravado; the penaltywe already have to pay is severe enough, for even while we are defendingthis, some portion of the public press is using words of terrorismagainst the witnesses to be called, and is describing myself and myco-defendant in a fashion that I feel sure will find no sanction here,and that I hope will never occur again. We contest this because theadvocacy of such views on population has been familiar to me for manyyears. The _Public Journal of Health_, edited by Dr. Hardwicke, thecoroner for Central Middlesex, will show you that in 1868 I was known, inrelation to this question, to men high in position in the land asoriginal thinkers and political economists; that the late John StuartMill has left behind him, in his Autobiography, testimony concerning meon this subject, according unqualified praise to me for the views thereonwhich I had labored to disseminate; and that Lord Amberley thanked me, ina society of which we were then both associates, for having achieved whatI had in bringing these principles to the knowledge of the poorer classesof the people. With taxation on every hand extending, with the cost ofliving increasing, and with wages declining--and, as to the last element,I am reminded that recently I was called upon to arbitrate in a wages'dispute in the north of England for a number of poor men, and, havingminutely scrutinised every side of the situation, was compelled to reducetheir wages by 15 per cent., there having been already a reduction of 35per cent, in the short space of some twenty months previously--I say,with wages declining, with the necessaries of life growing dearer andstill dearer, and with the burden of rent and taxation ever increasing--if, in the presence of such a condition of life among the vast industrialand impoverished masses of this land, I am not to be allowed to tell themhow best to prevent or to ameliorate the wretchedness of their lot--if,with all this, I may not speak to them of the true remedy, but the law isto step in and say to me, 'Your mouth is closed'; then, I ask you, whatremedy is there remaining by which I am to deal with this awful misery?"The worthy magistrate duly committed us for trial, accepting our ownrecognizances in L200 each to appear at the Central Criminal Court on May7th. To the Central Criminal Court, however, we had not the smallestintention of going, if we could possibly avoid it, so Mr. Bradlaughimmediately took steps to obtain a writ of _certiorari_ to remove theindictment to the Court of Queen's Bench. On April 27th Mr. Bradlaughmoved for the writ before Lord Chief Justice Cockburn and Mr. JusticeMellor, and soon after he began his argument the judge stopped him,saying that he would grant the writ if, "upon, looking at it we think itsobject is the legitimate one of promoting knowledge on a matter of humaninterest, then, lest there should be any miscarriage resulting from anyundue prejudice, we might think it is a case for trial by a judge and aspecial jury. I do not say it is so, mark, but only put it so, that if,on the other hand, science and philosophy are merely made the pretence ofpublishing a book which is calculated to arouse the passions of those whoperuse it, then it follows that we must not allow the pretence toprevail, and treat the case otherwise than as one which may come beforeanybody to try. If we really think it is a fair question as to whether itis a scientific work or not, and its object is a just one, then we shouldbe disposed to accede to your application, and allow it to be tried by ajudge and special jury, and for that purpose allow the proceedings to beremoved into this court. But, before we decide that, we must look intothe book and form our own judgment as to the real object of the work."Two copies of the book were at once handed up to the Bench, and on April30th the Court granted the writ, the Lord Chief Justice saying: "We havelooked at the book which is the subject-matter of the indictment, and wethink it really raises a fair question as to whether it is a scientificproduction for legitimate purposes, or whether it is what the indictmentalleged it to be, an obscene publication." Further, the Court acceptedMr. Bradlaugh's recognisances for L400 for the costs of the prosecution.Some, who have never read the Knowlton pamphlet, glibly denounce it as afilthy and obscene publication. The Lord Chief Justice of England and Mr.Justice Mellor, after reading it, decided to grant a writ which they haddetermined not to grant if the book had merely a veneer of science andwas "calculated to arouse the passions". Christian bigotry has ever since1877 striven to confound our action with the action of men who sell filthfor gain, but only the shameless can persist in so doing when theirfalsehoods are plainly exposed, as they are exposed here.The most touching letters from the poor came to us from all parts of thekingdom. One woman, who described herself as "very poor", and who had hadthirteen children and was expecting another, wrote saying, "if you wantmoney we will manage to send you my husband's pay one week". An armyofficer wrote thanking us, saying he had "a wife, seven children, andthree servants to keep on 11s. 8d. a day; 5d. per head per diem keepslife in us. The rest for education and raiment." A physician wrote of hishospital experience, saying that it taught him that "less dangerouspreventive checks to large families [than over-lactation] should betaught to the lower classes". Many clergymen wrote of their experienceamong the poor, and their joy that some attempt was being made to teachthem how to avoid over-large families, and letter after letter came to mefrom poor curates' wives, thanking me for daring to publish informationof such vital importance. In many places the poor people taxed themselvesso much a week for the cost of the defence, because they could not affordany large sum at once.As soon as we were committed for trial, we resigned our posts on theExecutive of the National Secular Society, feeling that we had no rightto entangle the Society in a fight which it had not authorised us tocarry on. We stated that we did not desire to relinquish our positions,"but we do desire that the members of the Executive shall feel free toact as they think wisest for the interest of Freethought". The letter wassent to the branches of the Society, and of the thirty-three who answeredall, except Burnley and Nottingham, refused to accept our resignation. Onthe Executive a very clever attempt was made to place us in a difficultposition by stating that the resignations were not accepted, but that, aswe had resigned, and as the Council had no power to renew appointmentsmade by the Conference, it could not invite us to resume our offices.This ingenious proposal was made by Mr. George Jacob Holyoake, who allthrough the trial did his best to injure us, apparently because he hadhimself sold the book long before we had done so, and was anxious toshield himself from condemnation by attacking us. His resolution wascarried by five votes to two. Mr. Haines and Mr. Ramsey, detecting itsmaliciousness, voted against it. The votes of the Branches, of course,decided the question overwhelmingly in our favor, but we declined to siton the Executive with such a resolution standing, and it was thencarried--Mr. Holyoake and Mr. Watts only voting against--that "ThisCouncil acknowledge the consideration shown by Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs.Besant for the public repute of the National Secular Society by tenderingtheir resignations, and whilst disclaiming all responsibility for thebook, 'Fruits of Philosophy', decline to accept such resignations". Sothoroughly did we agree that the Society ought not to be held responsiblefor our action, that we published the statement: "The Freethought partyis no more the endorser of our Malthusianism than it is of ourRepublicanism, or of our advocacy of Woman Suffrage, or of our support ofthe North in America, or of the part we take in French politics". I mayadd that at the Nottingham Conference Mr. Bradlaugh was re-electedPresident with only four dissentients, the party being practicallyunanimous in its determination to uphold a Free Press.The next stage of the prosecution was the seizure of our book packets andletters in the Post-office by the Tory Government. The "Freethinker'sText Book", the _National Reformer_, and various pamphlets were seized,as well as the "Fruits of Philosophy", and sealed letters were opened.Many meetings were held denouncing the revival of a system of Government_espionage_ which, it was supposed, had died out in England, and so greatwas the commotion raised that a stop was soon put to this form ofGovernment theft, and we recovered the stolen property. On May 15th Mr.Edward Truelove was attacked for the publication of Robert Dale Owen's"Moral Physiology", and of a pamphlet entitled "Individual, Family, andNational Poverty", and as both were pamphlets dealing with the PopulationQuestion, Mr. Truelove's case was included in the general defence.Among the witnesses we desired to subpoena was Charles Darwin, as weneeded to use passages from his works; he wrote back a most interestingletter, telling us that he disagreed with preventive checks to populationon the ground that over-multiplication was useful, since it caused astruggle for existence in which only the strongest and the ablestsurvived, and that he doubted whether it was possible for preventivechecks to serve as well as positive. He asked us to avoid calling him ifwe could: "I have been for many years much out of health, and have beenforced to give up all society or public meetings, and it would be greatsuffering to me to be a witness in court.... If it is not asking toogreat a favor, I should be greatly obliged if you would inform me whatyou decide, as apprehension of the coming exertion would prevent the restwhich I require doing me much good." Needless to add that I at once wroteto Mr. Darwin that we would not call him, but his gentle courtesy hasalways remained a pleasant memory to me. Another kind act was that of thefamous publisher, Mr. H.G. Bohn, who volunteered himself as a witness,and drew attention to the fact that every publisher of serious literaturewas imperilled by the attempt to establish a police censorship.The trial commenced on June 18th, in the Court of Queen's Bench atWestminster, before the Lord Chief Justice of England and a special jury.Sir Hardinge Giffard, the Solicitor-General of the Tory Government, Mr.Douglas Straight, and Mr. Mead, were the prosecuting counsel. The specialjury consisted of the following: Alfred Upward, Augustus Voelcker,Captain Alfred Henry Waldy, Thomas Richard Walker, Robert Wallace, EdmundWaller, Arthur Walter, Charles Alfred Walter, John Ward, Arthur Warre;the two talesmen, who were afterwards added to make up the number, wereGeorge Skinner and Charles Wilson.The Solicitor-General made a bitter and violent speech, full of partyhate and malice, endeavoring to prejudice the jury against the work bypicking out bits of medical detail and making profuse apologies forreading them, and shuddering and casting up his eyes with all the skillof a finished actor. For a man accustomed to Old Bailey practice he wasreally marvellously easily shocked; a simple physiological fact broughthim to the verge of tears, while the statement that people often had toolarge families covered him with such modest confusion that he found ithard to continue his address. It fell to my lot to open the defence, andto put the general line of argument by which we justified thepublication; Mr. Bradlaugh dealt with the defence of the book as amedical work--until the Lord Chief Justice suggested that there was no"redundancy of details, or anything more than it is necessary for amedical man to know"--and strongly urged that the knowledge given by thepamphlet was absolutely necessary for the poor. We called as witnessesfor the defence Miss Alice Vickery--the first lady who passed theexamination of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, and who hassince passed the examinations qualifying her to act as a physician--Dr.Charles Drysdale, and Mr. H.G. Bohn. Dr. Drysdale bore witness to themedical value of the pamphlet, stating that "considering it was writtenforty years ago ... the writer must have been a profound student ofphysiology, and far advanced in the medical science of his time". "I havealways considered it an excellent treatise, and I have found among myprofessional brethren that they have had nothing to say against it." Mr.Bohn bore witness that he had published books which "entirely coveredyour book, and gave a great deal more." Mr. Bradlaugh and myself thenseverally summed up our case, and the Solicitor-General made a speech forthe prosecution very much of the character of his first one, doing all hecould to inflame the minds of the jury against us. The Lord ChiefJustice, to quote a morning paper, "summed up strongly for an acquittal".He said that "a more ill-advised and more injudicious proceeding in theway of a prosecution was probably never brought into a Court of Justice".He described us as "two enthusiasts, who have been actuated by the desireto do good in a particular department of Society". He bade the jury becareful "not to abridge the full and free right of public discussion, andthe expression of public and private opinion on matters which areinteresting to all, and materially affect the welfare of society." Thencame an admirable statement of the law of population, and of his own viewof the scope of the book which I present in full as our bestjustification."The author, Doctor Knowlton, professes to deal with the subject ofpopulation. Now, a century ago a great and important question ofpolitical economy was brought to the attention of the scientific andthinking world by a man whose name everybody is acquainted with, namely,Malthus. He started for the first time a theory which astonished theworld, though it is now accepted as an irrefragable truth, and has sincebeen adopted by economist after economist. It is that population has astrong and marked tendency to increase faster than the means ofsubsistence afforded by the earth, or that the skill and industry of mancan produce for the support of life. The consequence is that thepopulation of a country necessarily includes a vast number of personsupon whom poverty presses with a heavy and sad hand. It is true that theeffects of over-population are checked to a certain extent by thosepowerful agencies which have been at work since the beginning of theworld. Great pestilences, famines, and wars have constantly swept awaythousands from the face of the earth, who otherwise must have contributedto swell the numbers of mankind. The effect, however, of this tendency toincrease faster than the means of subsistence, leads to still moreserious evils amongst the poorer classes of society. It necessarilylowers the price of labor by reason of the supply exceeding the demand.It increases the dearth of provisions by making the demand greater thanthe supply, and produces direful consequences to a large class of personswho labor under the evils, physical and moral, of poverty. You find it,as described by a witness called yesterday, in the overcrowding of ourcities and country villages, and the necessarily demoralising effectsresulting from that over-crowding. You have heard of the way in whichwomen--I mean child-bearing women--are destroyed by being obliged tosubmit to the necessities of their position before they are fullyrestored from the effects of child-birth, and the effects thus producedupon the children by disease and early death. That these are evils--evilswhich, if they could be prevented, it would be the first business ofhuman charity to prevent--there cannot be any doubt. That the evils ofover-population are real, and not imaginary, no one acquainted with thestate of society in the present day can possibly deny. Malthus suggested,years ago, and his suggestion has been supported by economists since histime, that the only possible way of keeping down population was byretarding marriage to as late a period as possible, the argument beingthat the fewer the marriages the fewer would be the people. But anotherclass of theorists say that that remedy is bad, and possibly worse thanthe disease, because, although you might delay marriage, you cannotrestrain those instincts which are implanted in human nature, and peoplewill have the gratification and satisfaction of passions powerfullyimplanted, if not in one way, in some other way. So you have the evils ofprostitution substituted for the evils of over-population. Now, what saysDr. Knowlton? There being this choice of evils--there being thisunquestioned evil of over-population which exists in a great part of thecivilised world--is the remedy proposed by Malthus so doubtful thatprobably it would lead to greater evils than the one which it is intendedto remedy? Dr. Knowlton suggests--and here we come to the critical pointof this inquiry--he suggests that, instead of marriage being postponed,it shall be hastened. He suggests that marriage shall take place in thehey-day of life, when the passions are at their highest, and that theevils of over-population shall be remedied by persons, after they havemarried, having recourse to artificial means to prevent the procreationof a numerous offspring, and the consequent evils, especially to thepoorer classes, which the production of a too numerous offspring iscertain to bring about. Now, gentlemen, that is the scope of the book.With a view to make those to whom these remedies are suggestedunderstand, appreciate, and be capable of applying them, he enters intodetails as to the physiological circumstances connected with theprocreation of the species. The Solicitor-General says--and that was thefirst proposition with which he started--that the whole of this is adelusion and a sham. When Knowlton says that he wishes that marriageshould take place as early as possible--marriage being the most sacredand holy of all human relations--he means nothing of the kind, but meansand suggests, in the sacred name of marriage, illicit intercourse betweenthe sexes, or a kind of prostitution. Now, gentlemen, whatever may beyour opinion about the propositions contained in this work, when you cometo weigh carefully the views of this undoubted physician and would-bephilosopher, I think you will agree with me that to say that he meant todepreciate marriage for the sake of prostitution, and that all he saysabout marriage is only a disguise, and intended to impress upon the mindsentiments of an entirely different character for the gratification ofpassion, otherwise than by marriage, is a most unjust accusation.(Applause in court.) I must say that I believe that every word he saysabout marriage being a desirable institution, and every word he says withreference to the enjoyments and happiness it engenders, is said ashonestly and truly as anything probably ever uttered by any man. I canonly believe that when the Solicitor-General made that statement he hadnot half studied the book. But I pass that by. I come to the plain issuebefore you. Knowlton goes into physiological details connected with thefunctions of the generation and procreation of children. The principlesof this pamphlet, with its details, are to be found in greater abundanceand distinctness in numerous works to which your attention has beendirected, and, having these details before you, you must judge foryourselves whether there is anything in them which is calculated toexcite the passions of man and debase the public morals. If so, everymedical work is open to the same imputation."The Lord Chief Justice then dealt with the question whether conjugalprudence was in itself immoral, and pointed out to the jury that thedecision of this very serious question was in their hands:"A man and woman may say, 'We have more children than we can supply withthe common necessaries of life: what are we to do? Let us have recourseto this contrivance.' Then, gentlemen, you should consider whether thatparticular course of proceeding is inconsistent with morality, whether itwould have a tendency to degrade and deprave the man or woman. TheSolicitor-General, while doubtless admitting the evils and mischiefs ofexcessive population, argues that the checks proposed are demoralising intheir effects, and that it is better to bear the ills we have than haverecourse to remedies having such demoralising results. These arequestions for you, twelve thinking men, probably husbands and fathers offamilies, to consider and determine. That the defendants honestly believethat the evils that this work would remedy, arising from over-populationand poverty, are so great that these checks may be resorted to as aremedy for the evils, and as bettering the condition of humanity,although there might be things to be avoided, if it were possible toavoid them, and yet remedy the evils which they are to prevent--that suchis the honest opinion of the defendants, we, who have read the book, andwho have heard what they have said, must do them the justice ofbelieving. I agree with the Solicitor-General if, with a view to what isadmitted to be a great good, they propose something to the world, andcirculate it especially among the poorer classes, if they proposesomething inconsistent with public morals, and tending to destroy thedomestic purity of women, that it is not because they do not see theevils of the latter, while they see the evils of the former, that theymust escape; if so, they must abide the consequences of their actions,whatever may have been their motive. They say, 'We are entitled to submitto the consideration of the thinking portion of mankind the remedieswhich we propose for these evils. We have come forward to challenge theinquiry whether this is a book which we are entitled to publish.' They doit fairly, I must say, and in a very straightforward manner they come todemand the judgment of the proper tribunal. You must decide that with adue regard and reference to the law, and with an honest and determineddesire to maintain the morals of mankind. But, on the other hand, youmust carefully consider what is due to public discussion, and with ananxious desire not, from any prejudiced view of this subject, to stiflewhat may be a subject of legitimate inquiry. But there is another view ofthis subject, that Knowlton intended to reconcile with marriage theprevention of over-population. Upon the perusal of this work, I cannotbring myself to doubt that he honestly believed that the remedies heproposed were less evils than even celibacy or over-population on the onehand, or the prevention of marriage on the other hand--in that honesty ofintention I entirely concur. But whether, in his desire to reconcilemarriage with a check on over-population, he did not overlook one veryimportant consideration connected with that part of society which shouldabuse it, is another and a very serious consideration."When the jury retired there was but one opinion in court, namely, thatwe had won our case. But they were absent for an hour and thirty-fiveminutes, and we learned afterwards that several were anxious to convict,not so much because of the book as because we were Freethinkers. At lastthey agreed to a compromise, and the verdict delivered was: "We areunanimously of opinion that the book in question is calculated to depravepublic morals, but at the same time we entirely exonerate the defendantsfrom any corrupt motives in publishing it."The Lord Chief Justice looked troubled, and said gravely that he wouldhave to direct them to return a verdict of guilty on such a finding. Theforeman, who was bitterly hostile, jumped at the chance withoutconsulting his colleagues, some of whom had turned to leave the box, andthus snatched a technical verdict of "guilty" against us. Mr. GeorgeSkinner, of 27, Great Chapel Gate, Westminster, wrote to me on thefollowing day to say that six of the jurymen did not consent to theverdict of "guilty", and that they had agreed that if the judge would notaccept the verdict as handed in they would then retire again, and thatthey would never have given a verdict of guilty; but the stupid men hadnot the sense to speak out at the right time, and their foreman had hisway. The Lord Chief Justice at once set us free to come up for judgmenton that day week, June 28th--the trial had lasted till the 21st--and wewent away on the same recognizances given before by Mr. Bradlaugh, anabsolutely unprecedented courtesy to two technically "convictedprisoners".[1][Footnote 1: A Report of the Trial can be obtained from the FreethoughtPublishing Company, price 5s. It contains an exact report of all that wassaid and done.]XVI.The week which intervened between the verdict of the jury and the day onwhich we were ordered to appear in Court to receive sentence was spent byus in arranging all our affairs, and putting everything in train for ouranticipated absence. One serious question had to be settled, but it didnot need long consideration. What were we to do about the Knowltonpamphlet? We promptly decided to ignore the verdict and to continue thesale. Recognising that the fact of this continued sale would be broughtup against us in Court and would probably seriously increase oursentence, we none the less considered that as we had commenced the fightwe were bound to maintain it, and we went on with the sale as before.On June 28th we attended the Court of Queen's Bench to receive judgment,the Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Mellor being on the Bench. Wemoved to quash the indictment, on arrest of judgment, and for a newtrial, the first on the ground that the indictment did not set out thewords complained of. The judges were against us on this, but it isinteresting to note that the Lord Chief Justice remarked that "thelanguage of the book is not open to any particular objection". I arguedthat the jury, having exonerated us from any corrupt motive, could not beregarded as having found us guilty on an indictment which charged us witha corrupt motive: the Lord Chief Justice held that "in the unnecessaryand superfluous part of the indictment, there is no judgment againstyou", and refused to believe that anyone would be found afterwards sobase as to accuse us of evil intent, because of the formal words of theindictment, the jury having acquitted us of any corrupt intention. Thejudge unfortunately imputed to others his own uprightness, and we havefound many--among them Sir W.T. Charley, the present Common Sergeant--vile enough to declare what he thought impossible, that we were foundguilty of wilfully corrupting the morals of the people. The judgesdecided against us on all the points raised, but it is due to them to saythat in refusing to quash the indictment, as Mr. Bradlaugh asked, theywere misled by the misrepresentation of an American case by Sir HardingeGiffard, and, to quote the words of the Lord Chief Justice, theysheltered themselves "under the decisions of the American Courts, andleft this matter to be carefully gone into by the Court of Error".The question of sentence then arose, and two affidavits were put in, oneby a reporter of the _Morning Advertiser_, named Lysaght. This individualpublished in the _Advertiser_ a very garbled report of a meeting at theHall of Science on the previous Sunday, evidently written to anger theLord Chief Justice, and used by Sir Hardinge Giffard with the sameobject. In one thing, however, it was accurate, and that was in statingthat we announced our intention to continue the sale of the book. On thisarose an argument with the Lord Chief Justice; he pointed out that we didnot deny that the circulation of the book was going on, and we assentedthat it was so. It was almost pathetic to see the judge, angry at ourresolution, unwilling to sentence us, but determined to vindicate the lawhe administered. "The question is," he urged, "what is to be the futurecourse of your conduct? The jury have acquitted you of any intention todeliberately violate the law; and that, although you did publish thisbook, which was a book that ought not to have been published, you werenot conscious of the effect it might have, and had no intention toviolate the law. That would induce the Court, if it saw a readysubmission on your part, to deal with the case in a very lenient way. Thejury having found that it was a violation of the law, but with a goodmotive or through ignorance, the Court, in awarding punishment upon sucha state of things, would, of course, be disposed to take a most indulgentview of the matter. But if the law has been openly set at defiance, thematter assumes a very different aspect, and it must be dealt with as avery grave and aggravated case." We could not, however, pledge ourselvesto do anything more than stop the sale pending the appeal on the writ oferror which we had resolved to go for. "Have you anything to say inmitigation?" was the judge's last appeal; but Mr. Bradlaugh answered: "Irespectfully submit myself to the sentence of the Court"; and I: "I havenothing to say in mitigation of punishment".The sentence and the reason for its heavy character have been somisrepresented, that I print here, from the shorthand report taken at thetime, the account of what passed:--"The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE, after having conferred for some minutes with Mr.Justice Mellor, said: The case has now assumed a character of very, verygrave importance. We were prepared, if the defendants had announcedopenly in this Court that having acted in error as the jury found--ofwhich finding I think they are entitled to the benefit--but still havingbeen, after a fair and impartial trial, found by the jury guilty of doingof that which was an offence against the law, they were ready to submitto the law and to do everything in their power to prevent the furtherpublication and circulation of a work which has been declared by the juryto be a work calculated to deprave public morals, we should have beenprepared to discharge them on their own recognizances to be of goodbehavior in the future. But we cannot help seeing in what has been saidand done pending this trial, and since the verdict of the jury waspronounced, that the defendants, instead of submitting themselves to thelaw, have set it at defiance by continuing to circulate this book. Thatbeing so I must say that that which before was an offence of acomparatively slight character--looking to what the jury have found inreference to the contention of the defendants--now assumes the form of amost grave and aggravated offence, and as such we must deal with it. Thesentence is that you, Charles Bradlaugh, and you, Annie Besant, beimprisoned for the term of six calendar months; that you each pay a fineof L200 to the Queen; and that you enter further into your ownrecognizances in a sum of L500 each to be of good behavior for the termof two years; and I tell you at the same time that you will not be of'good behavior' and will be liable to forfeit that sum if you continue topublish this book. No persuasion or conviction on your part that you aredoing that which is morally justifiable can possibly warrant you inviolating the law or excuse you in doing so. No one is above the law; allowe obedience to the law from the highest to the lowest, and if youchoose to set yourself at defiance against the law--to break it and defyit--you must expect to be dealt with accordingly. I am very sorry indeedthat such should be the result, but it is owing to your being thuscontumacious, notwithstanding that you have had a fair trial, and theverdict of a competent jury, which ought to have satisfied you that youought to abstain from doing what has been clearly demonstrated and shownto be wrong."Mr. BRADLAUGH: Would your lordship entertain an application to stayexecution of the sentence?"The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE: Certainly not. On consideration, if you willpledge yourselves unreservedly that there shall be no repetition of thepublication of the book, at all events, until the Court of Appeal shallhave decided contrary to the verdict of the jury and our judgment; if wecan have that positive pledge, and you will enter into your recognizancesthat you will not avail yourselves of the liberty we extend to continuethe publication of this book, which it is our bounden duty to suppress,or do our utmost to suppress, we may stay execution; but we can show noindulgence without such a pledge."Mr. BRADLAUGH: My lord, I meant to offer that pledge in the fullest andmost unreserved sense, because, although I have my own view as to what isright, I also recognise that the law having pronounced sentence, that isquite another matter so far as I, as a citizen, am concerned. I do notwish to ask your lordship for a favor without yielding to the Courtduring the time that I take advantage of its indulgence."The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE: I wish you had taken this position sooner."Mr. BRADLAUGH: If the sentence goes against us, it is another matter;but if you should consent to give us time for the argument of this writof error, we would bind ourselves during that time. I should not likeyour lordship to be induced to grant this request on the understandingthat in the event of the ultimate decision being against me I should feelbound by that pledge."The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE: I must do you the justice to say that throughoutthe whole of this battle our conduct has been straightforward since youtook it up."Mr. BRADLAUGH: I would not like your lordship to think that, in theevent of the ultimate decision being against us, there was any sort ofpledge. I simply meant that the law having pronounced against us, if yourlordship gives us the indulgence of fighting it in the higher Court, nosort of direct or indirect advantage shall be taken of the indulgence."The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE: You will not continue the publication?"Mr. BRADLAUGH: Not only will I stop the circulation of the book myself,but I will do all in my power to prevent other people circulating it."The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE: Then you can be discharged on your ownrecognizances for L100, 'to be of good behavior,' which you willunderstand to mean, that you will desist from the publication of thiswork until your appeal shall have been heard, and will engage toprosecute the appeal without delay."Mr. BRADLAUGH: Certainly; until the present, I have undoubtedlycirculated the book. Although there is a blunder in the affidavits I donot disguise the matter of fact. I shall immediately put the thing undermy own control, and I will at once lock up every copy in existence, andwill not circulate another copy until the appeal is decided."Mr. JUSTICE MELLOR: It must be that you will really, to the best of yourability, prevent the circulation of this book until this matter has beendetermined."The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE: And what Mr. Bradlaugh says, I understand thatyou, Mrs. Besant, also assent to?"Mrs. BESANT: Yes: that is my pledge until the writ of error has beendecided. I do not want to give a pledge which you may think was not givenhonestly. I will give my pledge, but it must be understood that thepromise goes no further than that decision."Mr. JUSTICE MELLOR: You will abstain yourself from circulating the book,and, so far as you can, suppress its circulation?"Mr. BRADLAUGH: Every copy that is unsold shall be at once put under lockand key until the decision of the case."The SOLICITOR-GENERAL: My lord, I think there should be nomisunderstanding upon this; I understand that the defendants haveundertaken that during the pendency of the appeal this book shall not becirculated at all. But if the decision should be against them they areunder no pledge not to publish."Mr. BRADLAUGH: I hope your lordship will not ask us what we shall do infuture."The LORD CHIEF JUSTICE: We have meted out the amount of punishment uponthe assumption--there being no assertion to the contrary, but rather anadmission--that they do intend to set the law at defiance. If we hadunderstood that they were prepared to submit themselves to the law, weshould have been disposed to deal with them in the most indulgent manner;but as we understood that they did not intend this, we have meted out tothem such a punishment as we hope, when undergone, will have a deterrenteffect upon them, and may prevent other people offending in like manner.We have nothing to do with what may happen after the defendants obtain ajudgment in their favor, if they do so, or after the sentence is carriedout, if they do not. Our sentence is passed, and it will stand, subjectonly to this, that we stay execution until a writ of error may bedisposed of, the defendants giving the most unqualified and unreservedpledge that they will not allow another copy of the book to be sold."Mr. BRADLAUGH: Quite so, my lord; quite so."We were then taken into custody, and went down to the Crown Office to getthe form for the recognizances, the amount of which, L100, after such asentence, was a fair proof of the view of the Court as to our good faithin the whole matter. As a married woman, I was unable to giverecognizances, being only a chattel, not a person cognisable by law; theCourt mercifully ignored this--or I should have had to go to prison--andaccepted Mr. Bradlaugh's sole recognizance as covering us both. Itfurther inserted in the sentence that we were "to be placed in the FirstClass of Misdemeanants", but as the sentence was never executed, we didnot profit by this alleviation.The rest of the story of the Knowlton pamphlet is soon told. We appearedin the Court of Appeal on January 29th, 30th, and 31st, 1878. Mr.Bradlaugh argued the case, I only making a brief speech, and on February12th the Court, composed of Lords Justices Bramwell, Brett, and Cotton,gave judgment in our favor and quashed the indictment. Thus we triumphedall along the line; the jury acquitted us of all evil motive, and left usmorally unstained; the Court of Appeal quashed the indictment, and set uslegally free. None the less have the ignorant, the malicious, and thebrutal, used this trial and sentence against us as a proof of moralobliquity, and have branded us as "vendors of obscene books" on this soleground.With the decision of the Court of Appeal our pledge not to sell theKnowlton pamphlet came to an end, and we at once recommenced the sale.The determination we came to was announced in the _National Reformer_ ofMarch 3rd, and I reprint here the statement I wrote at the time in Mr.Bradlaugh's name as well as my own."THE PLAN OF THE CAMPAIGN."The first pitched battle of the new campaign for the Liberty of thePress has, as all our readers know, ended in the entire defeat of theattacking army, and in the recapture of the position originally lost.There is no conviction--of ours--registered against the KnowltonPamphlet, the whole of the proceedings having been swept away; and theprosecutors are left with a large sum out of pocket, and no one any theworse for all their efforts. The banker's account of the unknownprosecutor shows a long and melancholy catalogue of expenses, and thereis no glory and no success to balance them on the other side of theledger. On the contrary, our prosecutors have advertised the attackedpamphlet, and circulated it by thousands and by hundreds of thousands;they have caused it to be reprinted in Holland and in America, and havespread it over India, Australia, New Zealand, and the whole continent ofEurope; they have caused the Population Question to be discussed, both athome and abroad, in the press and in the public meeting; they havecrammed the largest halls in England and Scotland to listen to thepreaching of Malthusianism; they have induced the publication of a modernpamphlet on the question which is selling by thousands; they haveenormously increased the popularity of the defendants, and made newfriends for them in every class of society; in the end, Knowlton is beingcirculated as vigorously as ever, and since the case was decided morecopies have been sold than would have been disposed of in ten years atthe old rate of sale. Truly, our prosecutors must feel delighted at theresults of their labors."So much for the past: what as to the future? Some, fancying we shouldact as they themselves would do under the like circumstances, dream thatwe shall now give way. We have not the smallest intention of doinganything of the kind. We said, nearly a year ago, that so long asKnowlton was prosecuted we should persist in selling him; we repeated thesame determination in Court, and received for it a heavy sentence; werepeat the same to-day, in spite of the injudicious threat of LordJustice Brett. Before we went up for judgment in the Court of Appeal wehad made all preparations for the renewal of the struggle; parcels wereready to be forwarded to friends who had volunteered to sell in varioustowns; if we had gone to jail from the Court these would at once havebeen sent; as we won our case, they were sent just the same. On thefollowing day orders were given to tell any wholesale agents who inquiredthat the book was again on sale, and the bills at 28, Stonecutter Street,announcing the suspension, of the sale, were taken down; from that dayforward all orders received have been punctually attended to, and thesale has been both rapid and steady. There is, however, one differencebetween the sale of Knowlton and that of our other literature: Knowltonis not sold across the counter at Stonecutter Street. When we werearrested in April 1877, we stopped the sale across counter, and we donot, at present, intend to recommence it. Our reason is very simple. Thesale across counter does not, in any fashion, cause us any additionalrisk; the danger of it falls entirely on Mr. Ramsey and on Mr. and Mrs.Norrish; we fail to see that there is any courage in running other peopleinto danger, and we prefer, therefore, to take the risk on ourselves. Wedo not intend to go down again and personally sell behind the counter; wethought it right to challenge a prosecution once, but, having done so, weintend now to go quietly on our ordinary way of business, and wait forany attack that may come."Meanwhile, we are not only selling the 'Fruits of Philosophy', but wealso are striving to gain the legal right to do so. In the appeal fromMr. Vaughan's decision Mr. Bradlaugh again raises all the disputedquestions, and that appeal will be argued as persistently as was the onejust decided in our favor. We are also making efforts to obtain analteration of the law of libel, and we hope soon to be able to announcethe exact terms of the proposed Bill."My own pamphlet, on 'The Law of Population', is another effort in thesame direction. At our trial the Lord Chief Justice said, that it was theadvocacy of the preventive checks which was the assailable part ofKnowlton; that advocacy is strongly and clearly to be found in the newpamphlet, together with facts useful to mothers, as to the physicalinjury caused by over-rapid child-bearing, which Knowlton did not give.The pamphlet has the advantage of being written fifty years later thanthe 'Fruits of Philosophy', and is more suitable, therefore, forcirculation at the present day. We hope that it may gradually replaceKnowlton as a manual for the poor. While we shall continue to print andsell Knowlton as long as any attempt is made to suppress it, we hope thatthe more modern pamphlet may gradually supersede the old one."If another prosecution should be instituted against us, our prosecutorswould have a far harder task before them than they had last time. In thefirst place, they would be compelled to state, clearly and definitely,what it is to which they object; and we should, therefore, be able tobring our whole strength to bear on the assailed point. In the secondplace, they would have to find a jury who would be ready to convict, andafter the full discussion of the question which has taken place thefinding of such a jury would be by no means an easy thing to do. Lastly,they must be quite sure not to make any legal blunders, for they may besure that such sins will find them out. Perhaps, on the whole, they hadbetter leave us alone."I believe that our readers will be glad to have this statement of ouraction, and this assurance that we feel as certain of winning the battleof a Free Press as when we began it a year ago, and that ourdetermination is as unwavering as when Serjeant Outram arrested us in thespring of last year.--ANNIE BESANT."Several purchases were made from us by detectives, and we were more thanonce threatened with prosecution. At last evidence for a new prosecutionwas laid before the Home Office, and the Government declined to institutefresh proceedings or to have anything more to do with the matter. Thebattle was won. As soon as we were informed of this decision, we decidedto sell only the copies we had in stock, and not to further reprint thepamphlet. Out-of-date as was much of its physiology, it was defended as asymbol, not for its intrinsic worth. We issued a circular stating that--"The Knowlton pamphlet is now entirely out of print, and, 185,000 havingbeen printed, the Freethought Publishing Company do not intend tocontinue the publication, which has never at any time been advertised bythem except on the original issue to test the question. 'The Law ofPopulation', price 6d., post free 8d., has been specially written by Mrs.Besant to supersede the Knowlton pamphlet."Thus ended a prolonged resistance to an unfair attempt to stiflediscussion, and, much as I have suffered in consequence of the part Itook in that fight, I have never once regretted that battle for thesaving of the poor.In July, 1877, a side-quarrel on the pamphlet begun which lasted untilDecember 3rd, 1878, and was fought through court after court right out toa successful issue. We had avoided a seizure warrant by removing all ourstock from 28, Stonecutter Street, but 657 of the pamphlets had beenseized at Mr. Truelove's, in Holborn, and that gentleman was alsoproceeded against for selling the work. The summons for selling waswithdrawn, and Mr. Bradlaugh succeeded in having his name and mineinserted as owners of the books in the summons for their destruction. Thebooks remained in the custody of the magistrate until after the decisionof the Court of Queen's Bench, and on February 12th, 1878, Mr. Bradlaughappeared before Mr. Vaughan at Bow Street, and claimed that the booksshould be restored to him. Mr. Collette, of the Vice Society, argued onthe other hand that the books were obscene, and ought therefore to bedestroyed. Mr. Vaughan reserved his decision, and asked for the LordChief Justice's summing-up in the Queen _v._ Bradlaugh and Besant. OnFebruary 19th he made an order for the destruction of the pamphlets,against which Mr. Bradlaugh appealed to the General Sessions on thefollowing grounds:"1st. That the said book is not an obscene book within the meaning of the20th and 21st Victoria, cap. 83. 2nd. That the said book is a scientifictreatise on the law of population and its connexion with poverty, andthat there is nothing in the book which is not necessary and legitimatein the description of the question. 3rd. That the advocacy ofnon-life-destroying checks to population is not an offence either atcommon law or by statute, and that the manner in which that advocacy israised in the said book, 'The Fruits of Philosophy', is not such as makesit an indictable offence. 4th. That the discussion and recommendation ofchecks to over-population after marriage is perfectly lawful, and thatthere is in the advocacy and recommendations contained in the book'Fruits of Philosophy' nothing that is prurient or calculated to inflamethe passions. 5th. That the physiological information in the said book issuch as is absolutely necessary for understanding the subjects treated,and such information is more fully given in Carpenter's treatises onPhysiology, and Kirke's 'Handbook of Physiology', which later works areused for the instruction of the young under Government sanction. 6th.That the whole of the physiological information contained in the saidbook, 'The Fruits of Philosophy', has been published uninterruptedly forfifty years, and still is published in dear books, and that thepublication of such information in a cheap form cannot constitute anoffence."After a long argument before Mr. Edlin and a number of other Middlesexmagistrates, the Bench affirmed Mr. Vaughan's order, whereupon Mr.Bradlaugh promptly obtained from the Lord Chief Justice and Mr. JusticeMellor a writ of _certiorari_, removing their order to the Queen's BenchDivision of the High Court of Justice with a view to quashing it. Thematter was not argued until the following November, on the 9th of whichmonth it came on before Mr. Justice Mellor and Mr. Justice Field. TheCourt decided in Mr. Bradlaugh's favor and granted a rule quashing Mr.Vaughan's order, and with this fell the order of the Middlesexmagistrates. The next thing was to recover the pamphlets thus rescuedfrom destruction, and on December 3rd Mr. Bradlaugh appeared before Mr.Vaughan at Bow Street in support of a summons against Mr. Henry Wood, apolice inspector, for detaining 657 copies of the "Fruits of Philosophy".After a long argument Mr. Vaughan ordered the pamphlets to be given up tohim, and he carried them off in triumph, there and then, on a cab. Welabelled the rescued pamphlets and sold every one of them, in mockingdefiance of the Vice Society.The circulation of literature advocating prudential checks to populationwas not stopped during the temporary suspension of the sale of theKnowlton pamphlet between June, 1877, and February, 1878. In October,1877, I commenced in the _National Reformer_ the publication of apamphlet entitled: "The Law of Population, its consequences, and itsbearing upon human conduct and morals". This little book included astatement of the law, evidence of the serious suffering among the poorcaused by over-large families, and a clear statement of the checksproposed, with arguments in their favor. The medical parts were omittedin the _National Reformer_ articles, and the pamphlet was publishedcomplete early in November, at the price of sixpence--the same asKnowlton's--the first edition consisting of 5,000 copies. A secondedition of 5,000 was issued in December, but all the succeeding editionswere of 10,000 copies each. The pamphlet is now in its ninetieththousand, and has gone all over the civilised world. It has beentranslated into Swedish, Danish, Dutch, French, German, and Italian, and110,000 copies have been sold of an American reprint. On the whole, theprosecution of 1877 did not do much in stopping the circulation ofliterature on the Population Question.The "Law" has been several times threatened with prosecution, and theinitial steps have been taken, but the stage of issuing a warrant for itsseizure has never yet been reached. Twice I have had the stock removed toavoid seizure, but on each occasion the heart of the prosecutors hasfailed them, and the little book has carried its message of mercyunspeeded by the advertisement of prosecution.The struggle on the right to discuss the prudential restraint ofpopulation did not, however, conclude without a martyr. Mr. EdwardTruelove, alluded to above, was prosecuted for selling a treatise byRobert Dale Owen on "Moral Physiology", and a pamphlet entitled,"Individual, Family, and National Poverty". He was tried on February 1st,1878, before the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of Queen's Bench, andwas most ably defended by Professor W.A. Hunter. The jury spent two hoursin considering their verdict, and then returned into Court and statedthat they were unable to agree. The majority of the jury were ready toconvict, if they felt sure that Mr. Truelove would not be punished, butone of them boldly declared in Court: "As to the book, it is written inplain language for plain people, and I think that many more persons oughtto know what the contents of the book are". The jury was discharged, inconsequence of this one man's courage, but Mr. Truelove's persecutors--the wretched Vice Society--were determined not to let their victim free.They proceeded to trial a second time, and wisely endeavored to secure aspecial jury, feeling that as prudential restraint would raise wages bylimiting the supply of labor, they would be more likely to obtain averdict from a jury of "gentlemen" than from one composed of workers.This attempt was circumvented by Mr. Truelove's legal advisers, who let a_procedendo_ go which sent back the trial to the Old Bailey. The secondtrial was held on May 16th at the Central Criminal Court before BaronPollock and a common jury, Professor Hunter and Mr. J.M. Davidsonappearing for the defence. The jury convicted, and the brave old man,sixty-eight years of age, was condemned to four months' imprisonment andL50 fine for selling a pamphlet which had been sold unchallenged, duringa period of forty-five years, by James Watson, George Jacob Holyoake,Austin Holyoake, and Charles Watts. Mr. Grain, the counsel employed bythe Vice Society, most unfairly used against Mr. Truelove my "Law ofPopulation", a pamphlet which contained, Baron Pollock said, "the headand front of the offence in the other [the Knowlton] case". I find anindignant protest against this odious unfairness in the _NationalReformer_ for May 19th: "'My Law of Population' was used against Mr.Truelove as an aggravation of his offence; passing over the uttermeanness--worthy only of Collette--of using against a prisoner a bookwhose author has never been attacked for writing it--does Mr. Collette,or do the authorities, imagine that the severity shown to Mr. Truelovewill in any fashion deter me from continuing the Malthusian propaganda?Let me here assure them, one and all, that it will do nothing of thekind; I shall continue to sell the 'Law of Population' and to advocatescientific checks to population, just as though Mr. Collette and his ViceSociety were all dead and buried. In commonest justice they are bound toprosecute me, and if they get, and keep, a verdict against me, andsucceed in sending me to prison, they will only make people more anxiousto read my book, and make me more personally powerful as a teacher of theviews which they attack."A persistent attempt was made to obtain a writ of error in Mr. Truelove'scase, but the Tory Attorney-General, Sir John Holker, refused it,although the ground on which it was asked was one of the grounds on whicha similar writ had been granted to Mr. Bradlaugh and myself. Mr. Truelovewas therefore compelled to suffer his sentence, but memorials, signed by11,000 persons, asking for his release, were sent to the Home Secretaryfrom every part of the country, and a crowded meeting in St. James' Hall,London, demanded his liberation with only six dissentients. The wholeagitation did not shorten Mr. Truelove's sentence by a single day, and hewas not released from Coldbath Fields' Prison until September 5th. On the12th of the same month the Hall of Science was crowded with enthusiasticfriends, who assembled to do him honor, and he was presented with abeautifully-illuminated address and a purse containing L177 (subsequentsubscriptions raised the amount to L197 16s. 6d.).It is scarcely necessary to say that one of the results of theprosecution was a great agitation throughout the country, and a widepopularisation of Malthusian views. Some huge demonstrations were held infavor of free discussion; on one occasion the Free Trade Hall,Manchester, was crowded to the doors; on another the Star Music Hall,Bradford, was crammed in every corner; on another the Town Hall,Birmingham, had not a seat or a bit of standing-room unoccupied. Whereverwe went, separately or together, it was the same story, and not only wereMalthusian lectures eagerly attended, and Malthusian literature eagerlybought, but curiosity brought many to listen to our Radical andFreethought lectures, and thousands heard for the first time whatSecularism really meant.The press, both London and provincial, agreed in branding the prosecutionas foolish, and it was widely remarked that it resulted only in the widercirculation of the indicted book, and the increased popularity of thosewho had stood for the right of publication. The furious attacks sincemade upon us have been made chiefly by those who differ from us intheological creed, and who have found a misrepresentation of ourprosecution served them as a convenient weapon of attack. During the lastfew years public opinion has been gradually coming round to our side, inconsequence of the pressure of poverty resulting from widespreaddepression of trade, and during the sensation caused in 1884 by "TheBitter Cry of Outcast London", many writers in the _Daily News_--notablyMr. G.R. Sims--boldly alleged that the distress was to a great extent dueto the large families of the poor, and mentioned that we had beenprosecuted for giving the very knowledge which would bring salvation tothe sufferers in our great cities.Among the useful results of the prosecution was the establishment of theMalthusian League, "to agitate for the abolition of all penalties on thepublic discussion of the population question", and "to spread among thepeople, by all practicable means, a knowledge of the law of population,of its consequences, and of its bearing upon human conduct and morals".The first general meeting of the League was held at the Hall of Scienceon July 26th, 1877, and a council of twenty persons was elected, and thisCouncil on August 2nd elected Dr. C.R. Drysdale, M.D. President, Mr.Swaagman Treasurer, Mrs. Besant Secretary, Mr. Shearer AssistantSecretary, and Mr. Hember Financial Secretary. Since 1877 the League,under the same indefatigable president, has worked hard to carry out itsobjects; it has issued a large number of leaflets and tracts; it supportsa monthly journal, the _Malthusian_; numerous lectures have beendelivered under its auspices in all parts of the country; and it has nowa medical branch, into which none but duly qualified medical men andwomen are admitted, with members in all European countries.Another result of the prosecution was the accession of "D." to the staffof the _National Reformer_. This able and thoughtful writer came forwardand joined our ranks as soon as he heard of the attack on us, and hefurther volunteered to conduct the journal during our imprisonment. Fromthat time to this--a period of eight years--articles from his pen haveappeared in our columns week by week, and during all that time not onesolitary difficulty has arisen between editors and contributor. In publica trustworthy colleague, in private a warm and sincere friend, "D." hasproved an unmixed benefit bestowed upon us by the prosecution.Nor was "D." the only friend brought to us by our foes. I cannot everthink of that time without remembering that the prosecution brought mefirst into close intimacy with Mrs. Annie Parris--the wife of Mr. TouzeauParris, the Secretary of the Defence Committee throughout all the fight--a lady who, during that long struggle, and during the, for me, far worsestruggle that succeeded it, over the custody of my daughter, proved to methe most loving and sisterly of friends. One or two other friendshipswhich will, I hope, last my life, date from that same time of strife andanxiety.The amount of money subscribed by the public during the Knowlton andsucceeding prosecutions gives some idea of the interest felt in thestruggle. The Defence Fund Committee in March, 1878, presented abalance-sheet, showing subscriptions amounting to L1,292 5s. 4d., andtotal expenditure in the Queen _v._ Bradlaugh and Besant, the Queen _v._Truelove, and the appeal against Mr. Vaughan's order (the last two up todate) of L1,274 10s. This account was then closed and the balance of L1715s. 4d. passed on to a new Fund for the defence of Mr. Truelove, thecarrying on of the appeal against the destruction of the Knowltonpamphlet, and the bearing of the costs incident on the petition lodgedagainst myself. In July this new fund had reached L196 16s. 7d., andafter paying the remainder of the costs in Mr. Truelove case, a balanceof L26 15s. 2d. was carried on. This again rose to L247 15s. 2-1/2d., andthe fund bore the expenses of Mr. Bradlaugh's successful appeal on theKnowlton pamphlet, the petition and subsequent proceedings in which I wasconcerned in the Court of Chancery, and an appeal on Mr. Truelove'sbehalf, unfortunately unsuccessful, against an order for the destructionof the Dale Owen pamphlet. This last decision was given on February 21st,1880, and on this the Defence Fund was closed. On Mr. Truelove's release,as mentioned above, a testimonial to the amount of L197 16s. 6d. waspresented to him, and after the close of the struggle some anonymousfriend sent to me personally L200 as "thanks for the courage and abilityshown". In addition to all this, the Malthusian League received no lessthan L455 11s. 9d. during the first year of its life, and started on itssecond year with a balance in hand of L77 5s. 8d.The propaganda of Freethought was not forgotten while this Malthusianquarrel was raging, and in August 1877 the Freethought Publishing Companyissued the first English edition of lectures by Colonel Robert Ingersoll,the eminent Freethought advocate of the United States. Since that timevarious other publishers have circulated thousands of his lectures, butit has always been to me a matter of satisfaction that we were the firstto popularise the eloquent American in England. The ruling of the LordChief Justice that a book written with pure intention and meant to conveyuseful knowledge might yet be obscene, drew from me a pamphlet entitled,"Is the Bible Indictable?", in which I showed that the Bible came clearlywithin the judge's ruling. This turning of the tables on our persecutorscaused considerable sensation at the time, and the pamphlet had, andstill has, a very wide circulation. It is needless to add that the SundayFreethought lectures were carried on despite the legal toils of the week,and, as said above, the large audiences attracted by the prosecution gavea splendid field for the inculcation of Freethought views. The NationalSecular Society consequently increased largely in membership, and ageneral impulse towards Freethought was manifest throughout the land.The year 1878, so far as lecturing work was concerned, was largely takenup with a crusade against the Beaconsfield Government and in favor ofpeace. Lord Beaconsfield's hired roughs broke up several peace meetingsduring the winter, and on February 24th Mr. Bradlaugh and Mr. AuberonHerbert, at the request of a meeting of working-class delegates, held inHyde Park a "Demonstration in favor of Peace". The war party attacked themeeting and some sharp fighting took place, but a resolution "That thismeeting declares in favor of peace" was carried despite them. A secondmeeting was called by the Working Men's Committee for March 10th, and alarge force of medical students, roughs, militia-men, and "gentlemen",armed with loaded bludgeons, heavy pieces of iron, sticks with metaltwisted round them, and various sharp-cutting weapons, went to Hyde Parkto make a riot. The meeting was held and the resolution carried, butafter it had dissolved there was some furious fighting. We learnedafterwards that a large money reward had been offered to a band of roughsif they would disable Mr. Bradlaugh, and a violent organised attack wasmade on him. The stewards of the meeting carried short policemen'struncheons to defend themselves, and a number of these gathered roundtheir chief and saved his life. He and his friends had to fight their wayout of the park; a man, armed with some sharp instrument, struck at Mr.Bradlaugh from behind, and cut one side of his hat from top to brim; histruncheon was dinted with the jagged iron used as weapon; and his leftarm, with which he guarded his head, was one mass of bruises from wristto elbow. Lord Beaconsfield's friends very nearly succeeded in theirattempt at murder, after all, for a dangerous attack of erysipelas setin, in the injured arm, and confined Mr. Bradlaugh to his room forsixteen days.The provinces were far more strongly against war than was the capital,and in them we held many large and enthusiastic meetings in favor ofpeace. At Huddersfield the great Drill Hall was crammed for a lecture byme against war, and throughout Yorkshire and Lancashire scarcely a voicewas ever raised in crowded meetings in defence of the Beaconsfieldianpolicy. A leaflet of mine, entitled "Rushing into War", was reprinted invarious parts of the country, and was circulated in tens of thousands,and each Freethought leader worked with tongue and pen, on platform andin press, to turn the public feeling against war. The Freethought partymay well take credit to itself for having been first in the field againstthe Tory policy, and for having successfully begun the work later carriedon by Mr. Gladstone in his Midlothian campaign. They did more than anyother party in the country to create that force of public opinion whichoverthrew the Tory Government in 1880.XVII.The year 1878 was a dark one for me; it saw me deprived of my littledaughter, despite the deed of separation by which the custody of thechild had been assigned to me. The first notice that an application wasto be made to the High Court of Chancery to deprive me of this custodyreached me in January, 1878, while the decision on the Knowlton case wasstill pending, but the petition was not filed till April. The time wasill-chosen; Mabel had caught scarlet fever at a day-school she wasattending, and for some days was dangerously ill. The fact of her illnesswas communicated to her father, and while the child was lying ill in bed,and I had cancelled all engagements so that I might not leave her side, Ireceived a copy of the petition to deprive me of her custody. Thisdocument alleged as grounds for taking away the child:"The said Annie Besant is, by addresses, lectures, and writings,endeavoring to propagate the principles of Atheism, and has published abook intituled: 'The Gospel of Atheism'. She has also associated herselfwith an infidel lecturer and author, named Charles Bradlaugh, in givinglectures and in publishing books and pamphlets, whereby the truth of theChristian religion is impeached, and disbelief in all religion isinculcated."The said Annie Besant has also, in conjunction with the said CharlesBradlaugh, published an indecent and obscene pamphlet called 'The Fruitsof Philosophy'."The said pamphlet has recently been the subject of legal proceedings, inthe course of which the said Annie Besant publicly justified its contentsand publication, and stated, or inferred, that in her belief it would beright to teach young children the physiological facts contained in thesaid pamphlet. [This was a deliberate falsehood: I had never stated orinferred anything of the kind.] The said Annie Besant has also edited andpublished a pamphlet intituled 'The Law of Population; its consequences,and its bearing upon human conduct and morals', to which book or pamphletyour petitioners crave leave to refer."The petition was unfortunately heard before the Master of the Rolls, SirGeorge Jessel, a man animated by the old spirit of Hebrew bigotry, andwho had superadded to this the coarse time-serving morality of "a man ofthe world", sceptical of all sincerity, and contemptuous of allself-devotion to a cause that did not pay, as of a weakness by which hewas himself singularly unassailable. The treatment I received at hishands on my first appearance in Court told me what I had to expect. Aftermy previous experience of the courtesy of English judges, I was startledto hear a harsh, loud voice exclaim, in answer to a statement from Mr.Ince. Q.C., that I appeared in person:"Appear in person? A lady appear in person? Never heard of such a thing!Does the lady really appear in person?"After a variety of similar remarks, delivered in the most grating tonesand with the roughest manner, Sir George Jessel tried to attain hisobject by browbeating me directly."Is this the lady?""I am the respondent to the petition, my lord--Mrs. Besant." "Then Iadvise you, Mrs. Besant, to employ counsel to represent you, if you canafford it, and I suppose you can.""With all submission to your lordship, I am afraid I must claim my rightof arguing my case in person.""You will do so if you please, of course, but I think you had much betterappear by counsel. I give you notice that, if you do not, you must notexpect to be shown any consideration. You will not be heard by me at anygreater length than the case requires, nor allowed to go into irrelevantmatter, as persons who argue their own cases generally do.""I trust I shall not do so, my lord; but in any case I shall be arguingunder your lordship's complete control."This encouraging beginning may be taken as a sample of the case. Mr.Ince, the counsel on the other side, was constantly practising in theRolls' Court, knew all the judge's peculiarities, how to flatter andhumor him on the one hand, and how to irritate him against his opponenton the other. Nor was Mr. Ince above using his influence with the Masterof the Rolls to obtain an unfair advantage, knowing that whatever he saidwould be believed against any contradiction of mine: thus he tried toobtain costs against me on the ground that the public helped me, whereashis client received no subscriptions in aid of his suit; yet as a matterof fact subscriptions had been collected for his client, and the Bishopof Lincoln, and many of the principal clergy and churchmen of the diocesehad contributed liberally towards the persecution of the Atheist.Mr. Ince and Mr. Bardswell argued that my Atheism and Malthusianism mademe an unfit guardian for my child; Mr. Ince declared that Mabel, educatedby me, would "be helpless for good in this world", and "hopeless for goodhereafter"; outcast in this life and damned in the next; Mr. Bardswellimplored the Judge to consider that my custody of her "would bedetrimental to the future prospects of the child in society, to saynothing of her eternal prospects". I could have laughed, had not thematter been so terribly serious, at the mixture of Mrs. Grundy,marriage-establishment, and hell, presented as an argument for robbing amother of her child. Once only did judge and counsel fall out; Mr.Bardswell had carelessly forgotten that Sir George Jessel was a Jew, andlifting eyes to heaven said:"Your lordship, I think, will scarcely credit it, but Mrs. Besant says ina later affidavit that she took away the Testament from the child,because it contained coarse passages unfit for a child to read."To his horror, Sir George Jessel considered there were "some passageswhich a child had better not read in the New Testament", and went on:"It is not true to say there are no passages that are unfit for a child'sreading, because I think there are a great many."Mr. BARDSWELL: I do not know of any passages that could fairly be calledcoarse."Sir G. JESSEL: I cannot quite assent to that."With the exception of this little outburst of religious feeling againstthe book written by apostate Jews, Jewish judge and Christian counselwere united in their hatred of the Atheist. My argument fell on deafears; I distinctly admitted that I was an Atheist, that I had withdrawnthe child from religious instruction at school, that I was the author ofthe "Gospel of Atheism", "The Fruits of Christianity", "The Freethinkers'Text Book, Part II.", and "The Law of Population", produced against me: Iclaimed her custody on the ground that it was given me by the deed ofseparation executed by the father who was trying to set it aside, andthat no pretence was made that the child was neglected, the admissionbeing, on the contrary, that she was admirably cared for: I offeredlastly, if she were taken from me, to devote L110 a-year to hermaintenance and education, provided that she were placed in the hands ofa third person, not of her father. Sir George Jessel decided against me,as he had clearly intended to do from the very outset, and as the part ofhis judgment affecting Freethinkers as parents is of continued interest Ireprint it here."I am glad to say that, so far as I can see, Mrs. Besant has been kindand affectionate in her conduct and behavior towards the child, and hastaken the greatest possible care of her so far as regards her physicalwelfare. I have no doubt she entertains that sincere affection for thechild which a mother should always feel, and which no merely speculativeopinions can materially affect. But, unfortunately, since her separationfrom her husband, Mrs. Besant has taken upon herself not merely to ignorereligion, not merely to believe in no religion, but to publish and avowthat non-belief--to become the publisher of pamphlets written by herself,and to deliver lectures composed by herself, stating her disbelief inreligion altogether, and stating that she has no belief in the existenceof a providence or a God. She has endeavored to convince others, by herlectures and by her pamphlets, that the denial of all religion is a rightand proper thing to recommend to mankind at large. It is not necessaryfor me to express any opinion as to the religious convictions of any one,or even as to their non-religious convictions. But I must, as a man ofthe world, consider what effect on a woman's position this course ofconduct must lead to. I know, and must know as a man of the world, thather course of conduct must quite cut her off, practically, not merelyfrom the sympathy of, but from social intercourse with, the greatmajority of her sex. I do not believe a single clergyman's wife inEngland living with her husband would approve of such conduct, orassociate with Mrs. Besant; and I must take that into consideration inconsidering what effect it would have upon the child if brought up by awoman of such reputation. But the matter does not stop there. Not onlydoes Mrs. Besant entertain those opinions which are reprobated by thegreat mass of mankind--whether rightly or wrongly I have no business tosay, though I, of course, think rightly--but she carries thosespeculative opinions into practice as regards the education of the child,and from the moment she does that she brings herself within the lines ofthe decisions of Lord Chancellors and eminent judges with reference tothe custody of children by persons holding speculative opinions, and inthose cases it has been held that before giving the custody of a child tothose who entertain such speculative opinions the Court must considerwhat effect infusing those opinions as part of its practical educationwould have upon the child. That is undoubtedly a matter of the greatestimportance. Upon this point there is no conflict of testimony whatever.Mrs. Besant herself says that she prohibited the governess from givingany religious education to the child, and has prevented the child fromobtaining any religious education at all. When the child went to school--a day school, as I understand--Mrs. Besant prohibited the governess ofthat school from imparting any religious education, in the same way thatshe had prohibited the former governess, who was a home governess, fromgiving any religious education, and Mrs. Besant gave none herself. It is,therefore, not only the entertaining and publishing these opinions, butshe considers it her duty so to educate the child as to prevent herhaving any religious opinions whatever until she attains a proper age. Ihave no doubt that Mrs. Besant is conscientious in her opinions upon allthese matters, but I also have a conscientious opinion, and I am bound togive effect to it. I think such a course of education not onlyreprehensible but detestable, and likely to work utter ruin to the child,and I certainly should upon this ground alone decide that this childought not to remain another day under the care of her mother."As to the publication of the Knowlton pamphlet, Sir George Jessel decidedthat that also was a good ground for separating mother and child. Hecommitted himself to the shameful statement, so strongly condemned by theLord Chief Justice, that Dr. Knowlton was in favor of "promiscuousintercourse without marriage", and then uttered the gross falsehood thathis view "was exactly the same as was entertained by the Lord ChiefJustice of England". After this odious misrepresentation, I was notsurprised to hear from him words of brutal insult to myself. I print herean article on him written at the time, not one word of which I nowregret, and which I am glad to place on record in permanent form, nowthat only his memory remains for me to hate."SIR GEORGE JESSEL."During the long struggle which began in March, 1877, no word has escapedme against the respective judges before whom I have had to plead. Somehave been harsh, but, at least, they have been fairly just, and even if asign of prejudice appeared, it was yet not sufficient to be a scandal tothe Bench. Of Sir George Jessel, however, I cannot speak in terms even ofrespect, for in his conduct towards myself he has been rough, coarse, andunfair, to an extent that I never expected to see in any English judge.Sir George Jessel is subtle and acute, but he is rude, overbearing, andcoarse; he has the sneer of a Mephistopheles, mingled with a curiousmonkeyish pleasure in inflicting pain. Sir George Jessel prides himselfon being 'a man of the world', and he expresses the low morality commonto that class when the phrase is taken in its worst sense; he holds, likethe 'men of the world', who 'see life' in Leicester Square and theHaymarket, that women are kept chaste only through fear and from lack ofopportunity; that men may be loose in morals if they will, and that womenare divided into two classes for their use--one to be the victims and thetoys of the moment, the others to be kept ignorant and strictly guarded,so as to be worthy of being selected as wives. Sir George Jesselconsiders that a woman becomes an outcast from society because she thinksthat women would be happier, healthier, safer, if they had some slightacquaintance with physiology, and were not condemned, through ignorance,to give birth to human lives foredoomed to misery, to disease, and tostarvation. Sir George Jessel says that no 'modest woman' will associatewith one who spreads among her sex the knowledge which will enable hersisters to limit their families within their means. The old brutal Jewishspirit, regarding women as the mere slaves of men, breaks out in thecoarse language which disgraced himself rather than the woman at whom itwas aimed. Sir George Jessel might have been surprised, had he been inthe Free Trade Hall, Manchester, on the following day, and had seen itfilled with men and women, quiet looking, well dressed, and respectable,and had heard the cries of 'Shame on him!' which rang round the hall,when his brutal remark was quoted. Such language only causes a re-actiontowards the insulted person even among those who would otherwise beantagonistic, and Sir George Jessel has ranged on my side many a womanwho, but for him, would have held aloof."Sir George Jessel is a Jew; he thinks that a parent should be deprivedof a child if he or she withholds from it religious training. Two hundredyears ago, Sir George Jessel's children might have been taken from himbecause he did not bring them up as Christians; Sir George Jessel and hisrace have been relieved from disabilities, and he now joins thepersecuting majority, and deals out to the Atheist the same measure dealtto his forefathers by the Christians. The Master of the Rolls pretendedthat by depriving me of my child he was inflicting no punishment on me!If the Master of the Rolls have any children, he must be as hard-heartedin the home as he is on the bench, if he would not feel that any penaltywas inflicted on him if his little ones were torn from him and handedover to a Christian priest, who would teach them to despise him as a Jew,and hate him as a denier of Christ. Even now, Jews are under many socialdisabilities, and even when richly gilt, Christian society looks uponthem with thinly-concealed dislike. The old wicked prejudice stillsurvives against them, and it is with shame and with disgust thatLiberals see a Jew trying to curry favor with Christian society byreviving the obsolete penalties once inflicted on his own people."Sir George Jessel was not only brutally harsh; he was also utterlyunfair. He quoted the Lord Chief Justice as agreeing with him in hisjudgment on Knowlton, on points where the Chief had distinctly expressedthe contrary opinion, and he did this not through ignorance, but with theeloquent words of Sir Alexander Cockburn lying in front of him, and afterI had pointed out to him, and he had deliberately read, or professed toread, the passages which contained the exact contrary of that which heput into the Chief's mouth."Of one thing Sir George Jessel and his Christian friends may be sure:that neither prosecution nor penalty will prevent me from teaching bothAtheism and Malthusianism to all who will listen to me, and sinceChristianity is still so bigoted as to take the child from the motherbecause of a difference of creed, I will strain every nerve to convertthe men and women around me, and more especially the young, to a creedmore worthy of humanity."Sir George Jessel pretended to have the child's interests at heart: inreality he utterly ignored them. I offered to settle L110 a year on thechild if she was placed in the charge of some trustworthy and respectableperson, but the Master did not even notice the offer. He takes away thechild from plenty and comfort, and throws her into comparative poverty;he takes her away from most tender and watchful care, and places herunder the guardianship of a man so reckless of her health, that he chosethe moment of her serious illness to ask for her removal; he takes heraway from cultured and thoughtful society to place her amonghalf-educated farmers. Nay, he goes further: Dr. Drysdale's affidavitstated that it was absolutely necessary at present that she should haveher mother's care; and Sir George Jessel disregards this, and, in herstill weak state, drags her from her home and from all she cares for,and throws her into the hands of strangers. If any serious resultsfollow, Sir George Jessel will be morally, though not legally,responsible for them. In her new home she can have no gentle womanlyattendance. No Christian lady of high character will risk themisconstruction to which she would be exposed by living alone at SibseyVicarage with a young clergyman who is neither a bachelor nor a widower;the child will be condemned either to solitary neglect at home, or to thecold strictness of a boarding-school. She is bright, gay, intelligent,merry now. What will she be at a year's end? My worst wish for Sir GeorgeJessel is that the measure he has meted out to me may, before he dies, bemeasured out to him or his."There is little to add to the story. I gave the child up, as I wascompelled to do, and gave notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal againstthe order of the Master of the Rolls. Meanwhile, as all access to thechildren was denied me by the father, I gave him notice that unlessaccess were given I would sue for a restitution of conjugal rights,merely for the sake of seeing my children. As the deed of separation hadbeen broken by his action, I supposed that the courts would not permit itto be broken for his advantage while holding it binding on me. Unhappily,at this critical point, my health gave way; the loneliness and silence ofthe house, of which my darling had always been the sunshine and themusic, weighed on me like an evil dream: at night I could not sleep,missing in the darkness the soft breathing of the little child; her criesas she clung to me and was forcibly carried away rang ever in my ears; atlast, on July 25th, I was suddenly struck down with fever, and had therest of pain and delirium instead of the agony of conscious loss. While Iwas lying there prostrate an order was served on me from the Master ofthe Rolls, granted on Mr. Besant's application, to restrain me frombringing any suit against him. As soon as I recovered, I took steps forcontesting this order, but no definite action could be taken until afterthe Long Vacation. The case came on for hearing first in November, 1878,and then in January, 1879. All access to the children had been denied me,and the money due to me had been withheld. By this my opponent had puthimself so completely in the wrong that even the Master of the Rollsuttered words of severe condemnation of the way in which I had beentreated. Then a curious interlude took place. The Master of the Rollsadvised me to file a counter-claim for divorce or for judicialseparation, and I gladly agreed to do so, feeling very doubtful as to theMaster of the Rolls' power to do anything of the kind, but very glad thathe should think he had the authority. While the claim was being prepared,I obtained access to the children under an interim order, as well as themoney owing to me, and at the end of March the case again came before theMaster of the Rolls. The claim filed alleged distinct acts of cruelty,and I brought witnesses to support the claim, among them the doctor whohad attended me during my married life. Mr. Ince filed an answer ofgeneral denial, adding that the acts of cruelty, if any, were "done inthe heat of the moment". He did not, however, venture to contest thecase, although I tendered myself for cross-examination, but pleaded thedeed of separation as a bar to further proceedings on my part; I arguedon the other hand that as the deed had been broken by the plaintiff'sact, all my original rights revived. Sir George Jessel held that the deedof separation condoned all that had gone before it, if it was raised as abar to further proceedings, and expressed his regret that he had notknown there would be "any objection on the other side", when he advised aclaim for a judicial separation. On the final hearing of the case inApril in the Rolls' Court Sir George Jessel decided that the deed ofseparation was good as protecting Mr. Besant from any suit on my part toobtain a decree for the restitution of conjugal rights, although it hadbeen set aside on the one matter of value to me--the custody of my child.The net result of the proceedings was that had I gone to the DivorceCourt in 1873, I might at least have obtained a divorce _a mensa ethoro_; that in my desire to avoid publicity, and content in what Ibelieved to be secure possession of my child, I had agreed to a deedwhich fully protected Mr. Besant against any action on my part, but whichcould be set aside by him for the purpose of robbing me of my child.The argument in the Court of Appeal came on during April, and was, as Iexpected, decided against me, the absolute right of the father beingdeclared, and a married mother held to have no sort of claim over her ownchildren. The worst stigma affixed to marriage by the law of England isthis ignoring of any right of the married mother to her child; the lawprotects the unmarried, but insults the married, mother, and places inthe hands of the legal husband an instrument of torture whose power toagonise depends on the tenderness and strength of the motherliness of thewife. In fact the law says to every woman: "Choose which of these twopositions you will have: if you are legally your husband's wife you canhave no legal claim to your children; if legally you are your husband'smistress, then your rights as mother are secure".But one thing I gained in the Court of Appeal. The Court expressed astrong view as to my right of access, and directed me to apply to SirGeorge Jessel for it, stating that it could not doubt that he would giveit. I made the application and obtained an order of access to thechildren, seeing them alone, once a month; of a visit of the children toLondon twice a year, with their governess, for a week each time; of aweek at the seaside in similar fashion once a year; of a weekly letterfrom each of them with the right of reply. This order, obtained aftersuch long struggle, has proved useless. The monthly visit so upset mypoor little daughter, and made her fret so constantly after me, that inmercy to her I felt compelled to relinquish it; on the first visit to theseaside, I was saddled with the cost of maintaining the Rev. Mr. and Mrs.Child, who were placed as guardians of the children, and who treated mein their presence as though I were a dangerous animal from whom they wereto be protected. To give but an instance of the sort of treatment Ireceived, I wished Mabel to have the benefit of sea-bathing, and was toldthat she could not be allowed to bathe with me, and this with asuggestiveness that sorely taxed my self-control. I could not apply tothe Court against the ingenious forms of petty insult employed, while Ifelt that they must inevitably estrange the children from me if practisedalways in their presence. After a vain appeal that some sort ofconsideration should be shown to me, an appeal answered by a mockingsuggestion that I should complain to the Master of the Rolls, I made upmy mind as to my future course. I resolved neither to see nor to write tomy children until they were old enough to understand and to judge forthemselves, and I know that I shall win my daughter back in herwomanhood, though I have been robbed of her childhood. By effacing myselfthen, I saved her from a constant and painful struggle unfitted forchildhood's passionate feelings, and left her only a memory that sheloves, undefaced by painful remembrances of her mother insulted in herpresence.Unhappily Sir George Jessel has terribly handicapped her future; left tome she would have had the highest education now open to girls; left toher present guardian she receives only fifth-rate teaching, utterlyunfitted for the present day. Twice I have offered to bear the wholeexpense of her education in the High School at Cheltenham, or in someLondon College, without in any way appearing in the matter, but each timemy offer has been roughly and insultingly refused, and the influence thatmarred the mother's life is undermining the future happiness of thechild's. But I am not without hope that I may be able to obtain from theCourt of Chancery an order for the benefit of its ward, and I trustbefore very long that I shall be able to insure to my child an educationwhich will fit her to play her part worthily when she reaches womanhood.I had hoped to save her from the pain of rejecting a superstitious faith,but that is now impossible, and she must fight her way out of darknessinto light as her mother did before her. But in order that she may do so,education now is of vital importance, and that I am striving to obtainfor her. I live in the hope that in her womanhood she may return to thehome she was torn from in her childhood, and that, in faithful work andnoble endeavor, she may wear in future years in the Freethought ranks aname not wholly unloved or unhonored therein, for the sake of the womanwho has borne it in the van through eleven years of strife.THE END.End of Project Gutenberg's Autobiographical Sketches, by Annie Besant*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES ******** This file should be named 11376.txt or 11376.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/1/3/7/11376/Produced by Jonathan Ingram, Richard Prairie and PG DistributedProofreadersUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.

Flying SquirrelINTRODUCTIONAMONG the numerous works on Canada that have been published within thelast ten years, with emigration for their leading theme, there are few,if any, that give information regarding the domestic economy of asettler's life, sufficiently minute to prove a faithful guide to theperson on whose responsibility the whole comfort of a family depends--the mistress, whose department it is "to haud the house in order."Dr. Dunlop, it is true, has published a witty and spirited pamphlet,"The Backwoodsman," but it does not enter into the routine of feminineduties and employment, in a state of emigration. Indeed, a woman's penalone can describe half that is requisite to be told of the internalmanagement of a domicile in the backwoods, in order to enable theoutcoming female emigrant to form a proper judgment of the trials andarduous duties she has to encounter."Forewarned, forearmed," is a maxim of our forefathers, containing muchmatter in its pithy brevity; and, following its spirit, the writer ofthe following pages has endeavoured to afford every possible informationto the wives and daughters of emigrants of the higher class whocontemplate seeking a home amid our Canadian wilds. [Illustration:Peter, the Chief] Truth has been conscientiously her object in the work,for it were cruel to write in flattering terms calculated to deceiveemigrants into the belief that the land to which they are transferringtheir families, their capital, and their hopes, a land flowing with milkand honey, where comforts and affluence may be obtained with littleexertion. She prefers honestly representing facts in their real and truelight, that the female part of the emigrant's family may be enabled tolook them firmly in the face; to find a remedy in female ingenuity andexpediency for some difficulties; and, by being properly prepared,encounter the rest with that high-spirited cheerfulness of which well-educated females often give extraordinary proofs. She likewise wishes toteach them to discard every thing exclusively pertaining to theartificial refinement of fashionable life in England; and to point outthat, by devoting the money consumed in these incumbrances to articlesof real use, which cannot be readily obtained in Canada, they may enjoythe pleasure of superintending a pleasant, well-ordered home. She isdesirous of giving them the advantage of her three years' experience,that they may properly apply every part of their time, and learn toconsider that every pound or pound's worth belonging to any member of anout-coming emigrant's family, ought to be sacredly considered as_capital_, which must make proper returns either as the means ofbringing increase in the shape of income, or, what is still better, inhealthful domestic comfort.These exhalations in behalf of utility in preference to artificialpersonal refinement, are not so needless as the English public mayconsider. The emigrants to British America are no longer of the rank oflife that formerly left the shores of the British Isles. It is not onlythe poor husbandmen and artisans, that move in vast bodies to the west,but it is the enterprising English capitalist, and the once affluentlandholder, alarmed at the difficulties of establishing numerousfamilies in independence, in a country where every profession isoverstocked, that join the bands that Great Britain is pouring forthinto these colonies! Of what vital importance is it that the femalemembers of these most valuable colonists should obtain properinformation regarding the important duties they are undertaking; thatthey should learn beforehand to brace their minds to the task, and thusavoid the repinings and discontent that is apt to follow unfoundedexpectations and fallacious hopes!It is a fact not universally known to the public, that British officersand their families are usually denizens of the backwoods; and as greatnumbers of unattached officers of every rank have accepted grants ofland in Canada, they are the pioneers of civilization in the wilderness,and their families, often of delicate nurture and honourable descent,are at once plunged into all the hardships attendant on the rough lifeof a bush-settler. The laws that regulate the grants of lands, whichenforce a certain time of residence, and certain settlement duties to beperformed, allow no claims to absentees when once the land is drawn.These laws wisely force a superiorly-educated man with resources of bothproperty and intellect, to devote all his energies to a certain spot ofuncleared land. It may easily be supposed that no persons wouldencounter these hardships who have not a young family to establish inthe healthful ways of independence. This family renders the residence ofsuch a head still more valuable to the colony; and the half-pay officer,by thus leading the advanced guard of civilization, and bringing intothese rough districts gentle and well-educated females, who soften andimprove all around them by _mental_ refinements, is serving his countryas much by founding peaceful villages and pleasant homesteads in thetrackless wilds, as ever he did by personal courage, or militarystratagem, in times of war.It will be seen, in the course of this work, that the writer is asearnest in recommending ladies who belong to the higher class ofsettlers to cultivate all the mental resources of a superior education,as she is to induce them to discard all irrational and artificial wantsand mere useless pursuits. She would willingly direct their attention tothe natural history and botany of this new country, in which they willfind a never-failing source of amusement and instruction, at onceenlightening and elevating the mind, and serving to fill up the voidleft by the absence of those lighter feminine accomplishments, thepractice of which are necessarily superseded by imperative domesticduties. To the person who is capable of looking abroad into the beautiesof nature, and adoring the Creator through his glorious works, areopened stores of unmixed pleasure, which will not permit her to be dullor unhappy in the loneliest part of our Western Wilderness. The writerof these pages speaks from experience, and would be pleased to find thatthe simple sources from which she has herself drawn pleasure, havecheered the solitude of future female sojourners in the backwoods ofCanada.As a general remark to all sorts and conditions of settlers, she wouldobserve, that the struggle up the hill of Independence is often a severeone, and it ought not to be made alone. It must be aided and encouragedby the example and assistance of an active and cheerful partner.Children should be taught to appreciate the devoted love that hasinduced their parents to overcome the natural reluctance felt by allpersons to quit for ever the land of their forefathers, the scenes oftheir earliest and happiest days, and to become aliens and wanderers ina distant country,--to form new ties and new friends, and begin, as itwere, life's toilsome march anew, that their children may be placed in asituation in which, by industry and activity, the substantial comfortsof life may be permanently obtained, and a landed property handed downto them, and their children after them.Young men soon become reconciled to this country, which offers to themthat chief attraction to youth,--great personal liberty. Theiremployments are of a cheerful and healthy nature; and their amusements,such as hunting, shooting, fishing, and boating, are peculiarlyfascinating. But in none of these can their sisters share. The hardshipsand difficulties of the settler's life, therefore, are felt peculiarlyby the female part of the family. It is with a view of amelioratingthese privations that the following pages have been written, to show howsome difficulties may be best borne and others avoided. The simpletruth, founded entirely on personal knowledge of the facts related, isthe basis of the work; to have had recourse to fiction might haverendered it more acceptable to many readers, but would have made it lessuseful to that class for whom it is especially intended. For those who,without intending to share in the privations and dangers of anemigrant's life, have a rational curiosity to become acquainted withscenes and manners so different from those of a long-civilized county,it is hoped that this little work will afford some amusement, andinculcate some lessons not devoid of moral instruction.LETTER I.Departure from Greenock in the Brig. _Laurel_.--Fitting-up of theVessel.--Boy Passenger.--Sea Prospect.--Want of Occupation andAmusement.--Captain's Goldfinch.Brig. _Laurel_, July 18, 1832I RECEIVED your last kind letter, my dearest mother, only a few hoursbefore we set sail from Greenock. As you express a wish that I shouldgive you a minute detail of our voyage, I shall take up my subject fromthe time of our embarkation, and write as inclination prompts me.Instead of having reason to complain of short letters, you will, I fear,find mine only too prolix.After many delays and disappointments, we succeeded at last in obtaininga passage in a fast-sailing brig, the _Laurel_, of Greenock; andfavourable winds are now rapidly carrying us across the Atlantic.The _Laurel_ is not a regular passenger-ship, which I consider anadvantage, for what we lose in amusement and variety we assuredly gainin comfort. The cabin is neatly fitted up, and I enjoy the luxury (forsuch it is, compared with the narrow berths of the state cabin) of ahandsome sofa, with crimson draperies, in the great cabin. The statecabin is also ours. We paid fifteen pounds each for our passage toMontreal. This was high, but it includes every expense; and, in fact, wehad no choice. The only vessel in the river bound for Canada, was apassenger-ship, literally swarming with emigrants, chiefly of the lowerclass of Highlanders.The only passengers besides ourselves in the _Laurel_ are the captain'snephew, a pretty yellow-haired lad, about fifteen years of age, whoworks his passage out, and a young gentleman who is going out as clerkin a merchant's house in Quebec. He seems too much wrapped up in his ownaffairs to be very communicative to others; he walks much, talks little,and reads less, but often amuses himself by singing as he paces thedeck, "Home, sweet home," and that delightful song by Camoens, "Isle ofbeauty." It is a sweet song, and I can easily imagine the charm it hasfor a home-sick heart.I was much pleased with the scenery of the Clyde; the day we set sailwas a lovely one, and I remained on deck till nightfall. The morninglight found our vessel dashing gallantly along, with a favourablebreeze, through the north channel; that day we saw the last of theHebrides, and before night lost sight of the north coast of Ireland. Awide expanse of water and sky is now our only prospect, unvaried by anyobject save the distant and scarcely to be traced outline of some vesseljust seen at the verge of the horizon, a speck in the immensity ofspace, or sometimes a few sea-fowl. I love to watch these wanderers ofthe ocean, as they rise and fall with the rocking billows, or flit aboutour vessel; and often I wonder whence they came, to what distant shorethey are bound, and if they make the rude wave their home and resting-place during the long day and dark night; and then I recall to mind thewords of the American poet, Bryant,--   "He who from zone to zone  Guides through the boundless air their certain flight,    In the long way that I must tread alone  Wilt guide my steps aright."Though we have been little more than a week on board, I am getting wearyof the voyage. I can only compare the monotony of it to being weather-bound in some country inn. I have already made myself acquainted withall the books worth reading in the ship's library; unfortunately, it ischiefly made up with old novels and musty romances.When the weather is fine I sit on a bench on the deck, wrapped in mycloak, and sew, or pace the deck with my husband, and talk over plansfor the future, which in all probability will never be realized. Ireally do pity men who are not actively employed: women have alwaystheir needle as a resource against the overwhelming weariness of an idlelife; but where a man is confined to a small space, such as the deck andcabin of a trading vessel, with nothing to see, nothing to hear, nothingto do, and nothing to read, he is really a very pitiable creature.There is one passenger on board that seems perfectly happy, if one mayjudge from the liveliness of the songs with which he greets us wheneverwe approach his cage. It is "Harry," the captain's goldfinch--"the_captain's mate_," as the sailors term him. This pretty creature hasmade no fewer than twelve voyages in the _Laurel_. "It is all one to himwhether his cage is at sea or on land, he is still at home," said thecaptain, regarding his little favourite with an air of great affection,and evidently gratified by the attention I bestowed on his bird.I have already formed a friendship with the little captive. He neverfails to greet my approach with one of his sweetest songs, and will takefrom my fingers a bit of biscuit, which he holds in his claws till hehas thanked me with a few of his clearest notes. This mark ofacknowledgment is termed by the steward, "saying-grace."If the wind still continues to favour us, the captain tells us we shallbe on the banks of Newfoundland in another week. Farewell for thepresent.LETTER IIArrival off Newfoundland.--Singing of the Captain's Goldfinch previousto the discovery of Land.--Gulf of St. Laurence.--Scenery of the RiverSt. Laurence.--Difficult navigation of the River.--French Fishermanengaged as a Pilot.--Isle of Bic.--Green Island.--Gros Isle.--QuarantineRegulations.--Emigrants on Gros Isle.--Arrival off Quebec.--Prospect ofthe City and Environs.Brig _Laurel_, River St. Laurence.August 6, 1832.I LEFT off writing, my dear mother, from this simple cause;--I hadnothing to say. One day was but the echo, as it were, of the one thatpreceded it; so that a page copied from the mate's log would have provedas amusing, and to the full as instructive, as my journal provided I hadkept one during the last fortnight.So barren of events has that time been that the sight of a party ofbottle-nosed whales, two or three seals, and a porpoise, possibly ontheir way to a dinner or tea party at the North Pole, was considered anoccurrence of great importance. Every glass was in requisition as soonas they made their appearance, and the marine monsters were well nighstared out of countenance.We came within sight of the shores of Newfoundland on the 5th of August,just one month from the day we took our last look of the British isles.Yet though the coast was brown, and rugged, and desolate, I hailed itsappearance with rapture. Never did any thing seem so refreshing anddelicious to me as the land breeze that came to us, as I thought,bearing health and gladness on its wings.I had noticed with some curiosity the restless activity of the captain'sbird some hours previous to "land" being proclaimed from the look-outstation. He sang continually, and his note was longer, clearer, and morethrilling than heretofore; the little creature, the captain assured me,was conscious of the difference in the air as we approached the land. "Itrust almost as much to my bird as to my glass," he said, "and havenever yet been deceived."Our progress was somewhat tedious after we entered the gulf. Ninetymiles across is the entrance of this majestic river; it seems an oceanin itself. Half our time is spent poring over the great chart in thecabin, which is constantly being rolled and unrolled by my husband togratify my desire of learning the names of the distant shores andislands which we pass.We are without a pilot as yet, and the captain being a cautious seamanis unwilling to risk the vessel on this dangerous navigation; so that weproceed but slowly on our voyage.August 7.--We were visited this morning by a beautiful little bird, notmuch larger than our gold-crested wren. I hailed it as a bird of goodomen--a little messenger sent to bid us welcome to the New World, and Ifelt almost a childish joy at the sight of our little visitor. There arehappy moments in our lives when we draw the greatest pleasure from themost trifling sources, as children are pleased with the most simple toy.From the hour we entered the gulf a perceptible change had taken placein all on board. The captain, a man of grave, quiet manners, grew quitetalkative. My husband was more than usually animated, and even thethoughtful young Scotchman became positively an entertaining person. Thecrew displayed the most lively zeal in the performance of their duty,and the goldfinch sung cheerily from dawn till sunset. As for me Hopewas busy in my heart, chasing from it all feelings of doubt or regretthat might sadden the present or cloud the future.I am now able to trace distinctly the outline of the coast on thesouthern side of the river. Sometimes the high lands are suddenlyenveloped in dense clouds of mist, which are in constant motion, rollingalong in shadowy billows, now tinted with rosy light, now white andfleecy, or bright as silver, as they catch the sunbeams. So rapid arethe changes that take place in the fog-bank, that perhaps the next timeI raise my eyes I behold the scene changed as if by magic. The mistycurtain is slowly drawn up, as if by invisible hands, and the wild,wooded mountains partially revealed, with their bold rocky shores andsweeping bays. At other times the vapoury volume dividing, moves alongthe valleys and deep ravines, like lofty pillars of smoke, or hangs insnowy draperies among the dark forest pines.I am never weary of watching these fantastic clouds; they recall to methe pleasant time I spent in the Highlands, among the cloud-capped hillsof the north.As yet, the air is cold, and we experience frequent squalls of wind andhail, with occasional peals of thunder; then again all is serene andbright, and the air is filled with fragrance, and flies, and bees, andbirds come flitting past us from the shore.August 8.--Though I cannot but dwell with feelings of wonder andadmiration on the majesty and power of this mighty river, I begin togrow weary of its immensity, and long for a nearer view of the shore;but at present we see nothing more than long lines of pine-clad hills,with here and there a white speck, which they tell me are settlementsand villages to the south; while huge mountains divested of verdurebound our view on the north side the river. My admiration of mountainousscenery makes me dwell with more interest on this side the river, and Iwatch the progress of cultivation along these rugged and inhospitableregions with positive pleasure.During the last two days we have been anxiously looking out for a pilotto take us up to Quebec. Various signals have been fired, but hithertowithout success; no pilot has condescended to visit us, so we aresomewhat in the condition of a stage without a coachman, with only someinexperienced hand to hold the reins. I already perceive somemanifestations of impatience appearing among us, but no one blames thecaptain, who is very anxious about the matter; as the river is full ofrocks and shoals, and presents many difficulties to a person notintimately acquainted with the navigation. Besides, he is answerable forthe safety of the ship to the underwriters, in case he neglects to takea pilot on board.* * * * * * *While writing above I was roused by a bustle on deck, and going up tolearn the cause was informed that a boat with the long looked-for pilothad put off from the shore; but, after all the fuss and bustle, itproved only a French fisherman, with a poor ragged lad, his assistant.The captain with very little difficulty persuaded Monsieur Paul Bretonto pilot us as far as Green Island, a distance of some hundred mileshigher up the river, where he assured us we should meet with a regularpilot, if not before.I have some little difficulty in understanding Monsieur Paul, as hespeaks a peculiar dialect; but he seems good-natured and obligingenough. He tells us the corn is yet green, hardly in ear, and the summerfruits not yet ripe, but he says, that at Quebec we shall find applesand fruit in plenty.As we advance higher up the river the country on both sides begins toassume a more genial aspect. Patches of verdure, with white cottages,are seen on the shores and scattered along the sides of the mountains;while here and there a village church rears its simple spire,distinguished above the surroundings buildings by its glittering vaneand bright roof of tin. The southern shores are more populous but lesspicturesque than those of the north, but there is enough on either sideto delight the eye.This morning we anchored off the Isle of Bic, a pretty low island,covered with trees and looking very pleasant. I felt a longing desire toset my foot on Canadian ground, and must own I was a little disappointedwhen the captain advised me to remain on board, and not attempt to makeone of the party that were preparing to go on shore: my husband secondedthe captain's wish, so I contented myself with leaning over the ship'sside and feasting my eyes on the rich masses of foliage as they waved toand fro with the slight breeze that agitated them. I had soon reason tobe thankful that I had not followed my own wayward will, for theafternoon proved foggy, and on the return of the boat I learned that theground was swampy just where the party landed, and they sunk over theirankles in water. They reported the island to be covered knee-deep with amost luxuriant growth of red clover, tall trees, low shrubs, and anabundance of wild flowers.That I might not regret not accompanying him, my husband brought me adelightful bouquet, which he had selected for me. Among the flowers werefragrant red roses, resembling those we call Scotch burnet-leaved, withsmooth shining leaves and few if any thorns; the blue flower calledPulmonaria or Lungwort, which I gathered in the Highlands, a sweet pea,with red blossoms and wreaths of lovely pale green foliage; a whiteorchis, the smell of which was quite delicious. Besides these wereseveral small white and yellow flowers, with which I was totallyunacquainted. The steward furnished me with a china jar and fresh water,so that I shall have the pleasure of a nosegay during the rest of thevoyage. The sailors had not forgotten a green bough or two to adorn theship, and the bird-cage was soon as bowery as leaves could make it.Though the weather is now very fine, we make but slow progress; theprovoking wind seems determined to blow from every quarter but theright. We float up with the flood tide, and when the tide fails castanchor, and wait with the best grace we can till it is time to weighanchor again. I amuse myself with examining the villages and settlementsthrough the captain's glass, or watching for the appearance of the whiteporpoises tumbling among the waves. These creatures are of a milkywhiteness, and have nothing of the disgusting look of the black ones.Sometimes a seal pops its droll head up close beside our vessel, lookingvery much like Sinbad's little old man of the sea.It is fortunate for me that my love of natural history enables me todraw amusement from objects that are deemed by many unworthy ofattention. To me they present an inexhaustible fund of interest. Thesimplest weed that grows in my path, or the fly that flutters about me,are subjects for reflection, admiration and delight.We are now within sight of Green Island. It is the largest, and Ibelieve one of the most populous we have passed. Every minute now seemsto increase the beauty of the passage. Far as the eye can reach you seethe shore thronged with villages and farms in one continuous line. Onthe southern side all are gay and glittering with the tin roofs on themost important buildings; the rest are shingles, whitewashed. This I donot like so well as the plain shingled roofs; the whiteness of the roofsof the cottages and homesteads have a glaring effect, and we look invain for that relief to the eye that is produced by the thatched orslated roofs. The shingles in their natural state soon acquire theappearance of slates, and can hardly be distinguished from them. Whatwould you say to a rose-coloured house, with a roof of the same gaudyhue, the front of the gay edifice being garnished with grass greenshutters, doors, and verandah. No doubt the interior is furnished withcorresponding taste. There is generally one or more of these _smart_buildings in a Canadian village, standing forth with ostentatioussplendour above its more modest brethren.August 11.--Just below Green Island we took on board a real pilot, who,by the way, I do not like half so well as Monsieur Paul. He is a littlebit pragmatical, and seems evidently proud of his superior knowledge ofthe river. The good-natured fisherman relinquished his post with a verygood grace, and seems already excellent friends with his more ablerival. For my part I was very sorry when the new pilot came on board;the first thing he did was to hand us over a pamphlet, containingregulations from the Board of Health at Quebec respecting the cholera,which is raging, he tells us, like a fearful plague both at that placeand Montreal.These regulations positively forbid the captain and the pilot to allowany person, whether of the crew or passengers, to quit the vessel untilthey shall have passed examination at the quarantine ground, under therisk of incurring a severe penalty.This was very annoying; as the captain, that very morning, had proposedtaking us on shore at a lovely spot called Crane Island, to spend theafternoon, while we waited for the return of the tide, at the house of aScotch gentleman, the owner of the prettiest settlement I had yet seen,the buildings and grounds being laid out with great taste.The situation of this island is of itself very beautiful. Around it arethe waters of the St. Laurence, bearing on its mighty current thecommerce of several nations: in the foreground are the populous andlively settlements of the southern shores, while behind and far, farabove it rise the lofty range of mountains to the north, now studdedwith rural villages, pleasant farms, and cultivated fields. The islanditself showed us smooth lawns and meadows of emerald verdure, withorchards and corn-fields sloping down to the water's edge. After aconfinement of nearly five weeks on board, you may easily suppose withwhat satisfaction we contemplated the prospect of spending a few hourson this inviting spot.We expect to reach the quarantine ground (Gros Isle) this evening, wherethe pilot says we shall be detained three days. Though we are all ingood health, yet, having sailed from an infected port, we shall bedetained on the quarantine ground, but not allowed to land.August 12.--We reached Gros Isle yesterday evening. It is a beautifulrocky island, covered with groves of beech, birch, ash, and fir-trees.There are several vessels lying at anchor close to the shore; one bearsthe melancholy symbol of disease, the yellow flag; she is a passenger-ship, and has the smallpox and measles among her crew. When anyinfectious complaint appears on board, the yellow flag is hoisted, andthe invalids conveyed to the cholera-hospital or wooden building, thathas been erected on a rising bank above the shore. It is surrounded withpalisadoes and a guard of soldiers.There is also a temporary fort at some distance from the hospital,containing a garrison of soldiers, who are there to enforce thequarantine rules. These rules are considered as very defective, and insome respects quite absurd, and are productive of many severe evils tothe unfortunate emigrants.When the passengers and crew of a vessel do not exceed a certain number,they are not allowed to land under a penalty, both to the captain andthe offender; but if, on the contrary, they should exceed the statednumber, ill or well, passengers and crew must all turn out and go onshore, taking with them their bedding and clothes, which are all spreadout on the shore, to be washed, aired, and fumigated, giving the healthyevery chance of taking the infection from the invalids. The sheds andbuildings put up for the accommodation of those who are obliged tosubmit to the quarantine laws, are in the same area as the hospital.[* It is to be hoped that some steps will be taken by Government toremedy these obnoxious laws which have repeatedly entailed those veryevils on the unhappy emigrants that the Board of Health wish to avertfrom the colony at large.Many valuable lives have been wantonly sacrificed by placing the healthyin the immediate vicinity of infection, besides subjecting them to manyother sufferings, expenses, and inconvenience, which the poor exilemight well be spared.If there must be quarantine laws--and I suppose the evil is a necessaryone--surely every care ought to be taken to render them as littlehurtful to the emigrant as possible.]Nothing can exceed the longing desire I feel to be allowed to land andexplore this picturesque island; the weather is so fine, and the wavinggroves of green, the little rocky bays and inlets of the island, appearso tempting; but to all my entreaties the visiting surgeon who came onboard returned a decided negative.A few hours after his visit, however, an Indian basket, containingstrawberries and raspberries, with a large bunch of wild flowers, wassent on board for me, with the surgeon's compliments.I amuse myself with making little sketches of the fort and thesurrounding scenery, or watching the groups of emigrants on shore. Wehave already seen the landing of the passengers of three emigrant ships.You may imagine yourself looking on a fair or crowded market, clotheswaving in the wind or spread out on the earth, chests, bundles, baskets,men, women, and children, asleep or basking in the sun, some in motionbusied with their goods, the women employed in washing or cooking in theopen air, beside the wood fires on the beach; while parties of childrenare pursuing each other in wanton glee rejoicing in their newly-acquiredliberty. Mixed with these you see the stately form and gay trappings ofthe sentinels, while the thin blue smoke of the wood fires, rising abovethe trees, heightens the picture and gives it an additional effect. Onmy husband remarking the picturesque appearance of scene before us toone of the officers from the fort who had come on board, he smiledsadly, and replied, "Believe me, in this instance, as in many others,'tis distance lends enchantment to the view." Could you take a nearersurvey of some of those very picturesque groups which you admire, Ithink you would turn away from them with heart sickness; you would therebehold every variety of disease, vice, poverty, filth, and famine--humanmisery in its most disgusting and saddening form. Such pictures asHogarth's pencil only could have pourtrayed, or Crabbe's pen described.August 14.--We are once more under weigh, and floating up the river withthe tide. Gros Isle is just five and twenty miles below Quebec, afavourable breeze would carry us up in a few hours; as it is we can onlymake a little way by tacking from side to side when we lose the tide. Irather enjoy this way of proceeding, as it gives one a close view ofboth sides the river, which narrows considerably as we approach nearertowards Quebec. To-morrow, if no accident happens, we shall be anchoredin front of a place rendered interesting both by its historicalassociations and its own native beauty of situation. Till to-morrow,then, adieu.I was reckoning much on seeing the falls of Montmorenci, which arewithin sight of the river; but the sun set, and the stars rosebrilliantly before we approached within sound of the cataract; andthough I strained my eyes till they were weary of gazing on the dimshadowy scene around me, I could distinguish nothing beyond the darkmasses of rock that forms the channel through which the waters of theMontmorenci rush into the St. Laurence.At ten last night, August the 15th, the lights of the city of Quebecwere seen gleaming through the distance like a coronet of stars abovethe waters. At half-past ten we dropped anchor opposite the fort, and Ifell asleep dreaming of the various scenes through which I had passed.Again I was destined to be disappointed in my expectations of going onshore. The visiting surgeon advised my husband and me by no means toland, as the mortality that still raged in the town made it veryhazardous. He gave a melancholy description of the place. "Desolationand woe and great mourning--Rachel weeping for her children because theyare not," are words that may well be applied to this city of thepestilence.[Illustration - Falls of Montmorenci]Nothing can be more imposing than the situation of Quebec, built on thesides and summit of a magnificent rock, on the highest point of which(Cape Diamond) stands the fortress overlooking the river, and commandinga most superb view of the surrounding scenes. I did, indeed, regret theloss of this noble prospect, the equal of which I suppose I shall neversee. It would have been something to have thought on and recalled inafter years, when buried in the solitude of the Canadian woods.The opposite heights, being the Point Levi side, are highly picturesque,though less imposing than the rock on which the town stands. The bank isrocky, precipitous, and clothed with trees that sweep down to thewater's edge, excepting where they are cleared away to give place towhite cottages, gardens, and hanging orchards. But, in my opinion, muchless is done with this romantic situation than might be effected if goodtaste were exercised in the buildings, and on the disposal of theground. How lovely would such a spot be rendered in England or Scotland.Nature here has done all, and man but little, excepting sticking up someugly wooden cottages, as mean as they are tasteless. It is, however,very possible there may be pretty villas and houses higher up, that areconcealed from the eye by the intervening groves.The river is considered to be just a mile across from Point Levi to thelanding-stairs below the custom-house in Quebec; and it was a source ofamusement to me to watch the horse ferry-boats that ply between the twoshores. The captain told me there were not less than twelve of thesecomical-looking machines. They each have their regular hours, so thatyou see a constant succession going or returning. They carry a strangeassortment of passengers; well and ill-dressed; old and young; rich andpoor; cows, sheep, horses, pigs, dogs, fowls, market-baskets,vegetables, fruit, hay, corn, anything and everything you will see byturns.The boat is flat, railed round, with a wicker at each end to admit thelive and dead stock that go or are taken on board; the centre of theboat (if such it can be called) is occupied by four lean, ill-favouredhacks, who walk round and round, as if in a threshing machine, and workthe paddles at each side. There is a sort of pen for the cattle.I am told there is a monument erecting in honour of Wolfe, in thegovernor's garden, looking towards the St. Laurence, and to be seen fromPoint Levi: the inscription has not yet been decided upon*.--------------------[* Since the period in which the author visited Quebec, Wolfe's monumenthas been completed. Lord Dalhousie, with equal good feeling and goodtaste, has united the names of the rival heroes Wolfe and Montcalm inthe dedication of the pillar--a liberality of feeling that cannot butprove gratifying to the Canadian French, while it robs the Britishwarrior of none of his glory.The monument was designed by Major Young of the 97th Regiment. To thetop of the surbase is fourteen feet from the ground; on this rests asarcophagus, seven feet three inches high, from which rises an obeliskforty-two feet eight inches in height, and the apex is two feet oneinch. The dimensions of the obelisk at the base are six feet by fourfeet eight inches. A prize medal was adjudged to J.C. Fisher, LL.D. forthe following inscription on the sarcophagus:--Mortem virtus communemFamam HistoriaMonumentum PosteritasDedit.On the surbase is an inscription from the pen of Dr. Mills, stating thefact of the erection of the monument at the expense of Lord Dalhousie,Governor of Lower Canada, to commemorate the death of Wolfe andMontcalm, Sept. 13 and 14, 1759. Wolfe fell on the field; and Montcalm,who was wounded by the single gun in the possession of the English, diedon the next day after the battle.]--------------------The captain has just returned from the town. He very kindly brought onboard a basket of ripe apples for me, besides fresh meat, vegetables,bread, butter, and milk. The deck is all bustle with custom-houseofficers, and men unloading a part of the ship's freight, which consistschiefly of rum, brandy, sugar, and coals, for ballast. We are to leaveQuebec by five o'clock this evening. The _British America_, a superbsteam-vessel of three decks, takes us in tow as far as Montreal. I mustnow say farewell.LETTER III.Departure from Quebec.--Towed by a Steam-vessel.--Fertility of theCountry.--Different Objects seen in sailing up the River.--Arrival offMontreal.--The Rapids.Brig _Laurel_, St. Laurence, below Montreal,August 17, 1832IT was after sunset, and a glorious evening, when we left Quebec, whichwe did in company with a fine steam-vessel, whose decks and gallery werecrowded with passengers of all descriptions. A brave sight she was tolook upon; ploughing the bright waters which foamed and sung beneath herpaddles; while our brig, with her white sails, followed like a butterflyin her wake. The heavens were glowing with the richest tints of rose andsaffron, which were reflected below on the bosom of the river; and thencame forth the stars, in the soft blue ether, more brilliant than ever Isaw them at home, and this, I suppose, I may attribute to the superiorpurity of the atmosphere. My husband said this evening resembled thesunsets of Italy.Our voyage has proved a very pleasant one; the weather moderately warm,and the air quite clear. We have within the last few days emerged from acold, damp atmosphere, such as we often experience in Britain in thespring, to a delightful summer, moderated by light breezes from theriver.The further we advance up the country the more fertile it appears. Theharvest is ripening under a more genial climate than that below Quebec.We see fields of Indian corn in full flower: it is a stately-lookingcrop, with its beautiful feathery top tinted with a rich purple hue,below which tufts of pale green silk are waving in the breeze. Whenfully ripe they tell me it is beautiful to see the golden grain burstingfrom its silvery sheath; but that it is a crop liable to injury fromfrost, and has many enemies, such as bears, racoons, squirrels, mice,fowls, &c.We saw several fields of tobacco along the banks of the river, whichlooked healthy and flourishing. I believe tobacco is cultivated to someextent in both provinces; but the Canadian tobacco is not held in suchhigh esteem as that of Virginia.There is a flourishing and very pretty town situated at the junction ofthe Richelieu river with the St. Laurence, formerly called Sorel, nowcalled Fort William Henry. The situation is excellent. There are severalchurches, a military fort, with mills, and other public buildings, withsome fine stone houses. The land, however, in the immediate vicinity ofthe town seems very light and sandy.I was anxious to obtain a near view of a log-house or a shanty, and wassomewhat disappointed in the few buildings of this kind that I saw alongthe banks of the river. It was not the rudeness of the material so muchas the barn-like form of the buildings of this kind, and the littleattention that was paid to the picturesque, that displeased me. In Britaineven the peasant has taste enough to plant a few roses or honeysucklesabout his door or his casement, and there is the little bit of gardenenclosed and neatly kept; but here no such attempt is made to ornamentthe cottages. We saw no smiling orchard or grove to conceal the bare logwalls; and as to the little farm-houses, they are uglier still, and lookso pert and ungraceful stuck upon the bank close to the water's edge.Further back a different style of building and cultivation appears. Thefarms and frame-houses are really handsome places, and in good taste,with clumps of trees here and there to break the monotony of theclearing. The land is nearly one unbroken level plain, apparentlyfertile and well farmed, but too flat for fine scenery. The countrybetween Quebec and Montreal has all the appearance of having been undera long state of cultivation, especially on the right bank of the river.Still there is a great portion of forest standing which it will takeyears of labour to remove.We passed some little grassy islands on which there were many herds ofcattle feeding. I was puzzling myself to know how they got there, whenthe captain told me it was usual for farmers to convey their stock tothese island pastures in flat-bottomed boats, or to swim them, if theplace was fordable, and leave them to graze as long as the foodcontinued good. If cows are put on an island within a reasonabledistance of the farm, some person goes daily in a canoe to milk them.While he was telling me this, a log-canoe with a boy and a stout lasswith tin pails, paddled across from the bank of the river, and proceededto call together their herd.We noticed some very pleasant rural villages to the right as weadvanced, but our pilot was stupid, and could not, or would not telltheir names. It was Sunday morning, and we could just hear the quicktinkling of the church bells, and distinguish long lines of caleches,light waggons, with equestrians and pedestrians hastening along theavenue of trees that led to the churchyard; besides these, were boatsand canoes crossing the river, bound to the same peaceful haven.In a part of the St. Laurence, where the channel is rendered difficultby shoals and sand-banks, there occur little lighthouses, lookingsomewhat like miniature watermills, on wooden posts, raised above theflat banks on which they are built. These droll little huts wereinhabited, and we noticed a merry party, in their holiday clothes,enjoying a gossip with a party in a canoe below them. They looked cleanand smart, and cheerful enough, but I did not envy them their situation,which I should think far from healthy.Some miles below Montreal the appearance of the country became richer,more civilized, and populous; while the distant line of blue mountains,at the verge of the horizon, added an interest to the landscape. Therich tint of ripened harvest formed a beautiful contrast with the azuresky and waters of the St. Laurence. The scenery of the river nearMontreal is of a very different character to that below Quebec; thelatter possesses a wild and rugged aspect, and its productions areevidently those of a colder and less happy climate. What the formerloses in grandeur and picturesque effect, it gains in fertility of soiland warmth of temperature. In the lower division of the province youfeel that the industry of the inhabitants is forcing a churlish soil forbread; while in the upper, the land seems willing to yield her increaseto a moderate exertion. Remember, these are merely the cursory remarksof a passing traveller, and founded on no personal experience.There was a feeling of anxiety and dread upon our minds that we wouldhardly acknowledge to each other as we drew near to the city of thepestilence, as if ashamed of confessing a weakness that was felt; but noone spoke on the subject. With what unmixed delight and admiration atany other time should we have gazed on the scene that opened upon us.The river here expands into a fine extensive basin, diversified withislands, on the largest of which Montreal is situated.The lofty hill from which the town takes its name rises like a crownabove it, and forms a singular and magnificent feature in the landscape,reminding me of some of the detached hills in the vicinity of Inverness.Opposite to the Quebec suburbs, just in front of the rapids, is situatedthe island of St. Helens, a spot of infinite loveliness. The centre ofit is occupied by a grove of lofty trees, while the banks, sloping downto the water, seem of the most verdant turf. The scene was heightened bythe appearance of the troops which garrison the island.The shores of the river, studded with richly cultivated farms; thevillage of La Prairie, with the little island of St. Anne's in thedistance; the glittering steeples and roofs of the city, with itsgardens and villas,--looked lovely by the softened glow of a Canadiansummer sunset.The church bells ringing for evening prayer, with the hum of voices fromthe shore, mingled not inharmoniously with the rush of the rapids.These rapids are caused by a descent in the bed of the river. In someplaces this declination is gradual, in others sudden and abrupt. Wherethe current is broken by masses of limestone or granite rock, as at theCascades, the Cedars, and the Long Sault, it creates whirlpools andcataracts. But the rapids below Montreal are not of this magnificentcharacter, being made perceptible only by the unusual swiftness of thewater, and its surface being disturbed by foam, and waving lines anddimples. In short, I was disappointed in my expectation of seeingsomething very grand; and was half angry at these pretty behaved quietrapids, to the foot of which we were towed in good style by our faithfulconsort the _British America_.As the captain is uncertain how long he may be detained at Montreal, Ishall send this letter without further delay, and write again as soon aspossible.LETTER IV.Landing at Montreal.--Appearance of the Town.--Ravages of the Cholera.--Charitable Institutions in Montreal.--Catholic Cathedral.--Lower andUpper Town.--Company and Conversation at the Hotel.--Writer attackedwith the Cholera.--Departure from Montreal in a Stage coach.--Embark atLachine on board a Steam-vessel.--Mode of travelling alternately inSteam-vessels and Stages.--Appearance of the Country.--Manufactures.--Ovens at a distance from the Cottages.--Draw-wells.--Arrival atCornwall.--Accommodation at the Inn.--Departure from Cornwall, andArrival at Prescott.--Arrival at Brockville.--Ship-launch there.--Voyagethrough Lake Ontario.--Arrival at CobourgNelson Hotel, Montreal, August 21.Once more on terra ferma, dearest mother: what a strange sensation it isto tread the land once again, free from the motion of the heavingwaters, to which I was now, in truth, glad to bid farewell.By daybreak every creature on board was up and busily preparing forgoing on shore. The captain himself obligingly escorted us, and walkedas far with us as the hotel, where we are at present lodged.We found some difficulty in getting on shore, owing to the badness ofthe landing. The river was full of floating timbers, between which itrequired some skill to guide the boat. A wharf is now being built--notbefore it was needed*. [* Some excellent wharfs have since beencompleted.]We were struck by the dirty, narrow, ill-paved or unpaved streets of thesuburbs, and overpowered by the noisome vapour arising from a deep openfosse that ran along the street behind the wharf. This ditch seemed thereceptacle for every abomination, and sufficient in itself to infect awhole town with malignant fevers*.[* This has since been arched over. A market has been erected above it.]I was greatly disappointed in my first acquaintance with the interior ofMontreal; a place of which travellers had said so much. I could compareit only to the fruits of the Dead sea, which are said to be fair andtempting to look upon, but yield only ashes and bitterness when tastedby the thirsty traveller**...........[** The following description of Montreal is given by M'Gregor in hisBritish America, vol. ii. p. 504:--"Betwixt the royal mountain and theriver, on a ridge of gentle elevation, stands the town. Including thesuburbs, it is more extensive than Quebec. Both cities differ verygreatly in appearance; the low banks of the St. Laurence at Montrealwant the tremendous precipices frowning over them, and all that grandsublimity which characterizes Quebec."There are no wharfs at Montreal, and the ships and steamers lie quietlyin pretty deep water, close to the clayey and generally filthy bank ofthe city. The whole of the lower town is covered with gloomy-lookinghouses, having dark iron shutters; and although it may be a littlecleaner than Quebec, it is still very dirty; and the streets are notonly narrow and ill-paved, but the footpaths are interrupted by slantingcellar doors and other projections.""It is impossible (says Mr. Talbot, in his Five Years' Residence) towalk the streets of Montreal on a Sunday or holiday, when the shops areclosed, without receiving the most gloomy impressions; the whole cityseems one vast prison;"--alluding to the window-shutters and outer doorsof iron, that have been adopted to counteract the effects of fire.]..........I noticed one peculiar feature in the buildings along the suburb facingthe river--that they were mostly furnished with broad wooden balconiesfrom the lower to the upper story; in some instances they surrounded thehouses on three sides, and seemed to form a sort of outer chamber. Someof these balconies were ascended by flights of broad stairs from theoutside.I remember when a child dreaming of houses so constructed, and fancyingthem very delightful; and so I think they might be rendered, if shadedby climbing shrubs, and adorned with flowers, to represent a hanging-garden or sweet-scented bowery walk. But nothing of this kind gladdenedour eyes as we toiled along the hot streets. Every house of publicresort was crowded from the top to the bottom with emigrants of allages, English, Irish, and Scotch. The sounds of riotous merriment thatburst from them seemed but ill-assorted with the haggard, careworn facesof many of the thoughtless revellers.The contrast was only too apparent and too painful a subject to thosethat looked upon this show of outward gaiety and inward misery.The cholera had made awful ravages, and its devastating effects were tobe seen in the darkened dwellings and the mourning habiliments of allclasses. An expression of dejection and anxiety appeared in the faces ofthe few persons we encountered in our walk to the hotel, which plainlyindicated the state of their minds.In some situations whole streets had been nearly depopulated; those thatwere able fled panic-stricken to the country villages, while othersremained to die in the bosom of their families.To no class, I am told, has the disease proved so fatal as to the poorersort of emigrants. Many of these, debilitated by the privations andfatigue of a long voyage, on reaching Quebec or Montreal indulged inevery sort of excess, especially the dangerous one of intoxication; and,as if purposely paving the way to certain destruction, they fellimmediate victims to the complaint.In one house eleven persons died, in another seventeen; a little childof seven years old was the only creature left to tell the woful tale.This poor desolate orphan was taken by the nuns to their benevolentinstitution, where every attention was paid that humanity could suggest.The number both of Catholic and Protestant benevolent societies is verygreat, and these are maintained with a liberality of principle that doeshonour to both parties, who seem indeed actuated by a fervent spirit ofChristian charity.I know of no place, not even excepting London itself, where the exerciseof benevolent feelings is more called for than in these two cities,Quebec and Montreal. Here meet together the unfortunate, theimprovident, the helpless orphan, the sick, the aged, the poor virtuousman, driven by the stern hand of necessity from his country and hishome, perhaps to be overtaken by sickness or want in a land ofstrangers.It is melancholy to reflect that a great number of the poorest class ofemigrants that perished in the reign of the cholera have left no traceby which their sorrowing anxious friends in the old country may learntheir fate. The disease is so sudden and so violent that it leaves notime for arranging worldly matters; the sentinel comes, not as it did toHezekiah, "Set thine house in order, for thou shalt die, and not live."The weather is sultry hot, accompanied by frequent thunder-showers,which have not the effect one would expect, that of cooling the heatedatmosphere. I experience a degree of languor and oppression that is verydistressing, and worse than actual pain.Instead of leaving this place by the first conveyance for the upperprovince, as we fully purposed doing, we find ourselves obliged toremain two days longer, owing to the dilatoriness of the custom-houseofficers in overlooking our packages. The fact is that everything andeverybody are out of sorts.The heat has been too oppressive to allow of my walking much abroad. Ihave seen but little of the town beyond the streets adjacent to thehotel: with the exception of the Catholic Cathedral, I have seen few ofthe public buildings. With the former I was much pleased: it is a finebuilding, though still in an unfinished state, the towers not havingbeen carried to the height originally intended. The eastern window,behind the altar, is seventy feet in height by thirty-three in width.The effect of this magnificent window from the entrance, the altar withits adornments and paintings, the several smaller altars and shrines,all decorated with scriptural designs, the light tiers of galleries thatsurround the central part of the church, the double range of columnssupporting the vaulted ceiling, and the arched windows, all combine toform one beautiful whole. What most pleased me was the extreme lightnessof the architecture though I thought the imitation of marble, with whichthe pillars were painted, coarse and glaring. We missed the time-hallowing mellowness that age has bestowed on our ancient churches andcathedrals. The grim corbels and winged angels that are carved on thegrey stone, whose very uncouthness tells of time gone by when ourancestors worshipped within their walls, give an additional interest tothe temples of our forefathers. But, though the new church at Montrealcannot compare with our York Minster, Westminster Abbey, and others ofour sacred buildings, it is well worthy the attention of travellers, whowill meet with nothing equal to it in the Canadas.There are several colleges and nunneries, a hospital for the sick,several Catholic and Protestant churches, meeting-houses, a guard-house,with many other public edifices.The river-side portion of the town is entirely mercantile. Its narrow,dirty streets and dark houses, with heavy iron shutters, have adisagreeable appearance, which cannot but make an unfavourableimpression on the mind of a British traveller. The other portion of thetown, however, is of a different character, and the houses areinterspersed with gardens and pleasant walks, which looked veryagreeable from the windows of the ball-room of the Nelson Hotel. Thisroom, which is painted from top to bottom, the walls and ceiling, with acoarse imitation of groves and Canadian scenery, commands a superb viewof the city, the river, and all surrounding country, taking in thedistant mountains of Chamblay, the shores of St. Laurence, towards LaPrairie, and the rapids above and below the island of St. Anne's. Theroyal mountain (Mont Real), with its wooded sides, its rich scenery, andits city with its streets and public buildings, lie at your feet: withsuch objects before you the eye may well be charmed with the scenery ofMontreal.We receive the greatest attention from the master of the hotel, who isan Italian. The servants of the house are very civil, and the companythat we meet at the ordinary very respectable, chiefly emigrants likeourselves, with some lively French men and women. The table is wellsupplied, and the charges for board and lodging one dollar per dayeach*.[* This hotel is not of the highest class, in which the charge is adollar and a half per day. Ed.]I am amused with the variety of characters of which our table iscomposed. Some of the emigrants appear to entertain the most sanguinehopes of success, appearing to foresee no difficulties in carrying theirschemes into effect. As a contrast to these there is one of mycountrymen, just returned from the western district on his way back toEngland, who entreats us by no means to go further up this horridcountry, as he emphatically styles the Upper Province, assuring us hewould not live in it for all the land it contained.He had been induced, by reading Cattermole's pamphlet on the subject ofEmigration, to quit a good farm, and gathering together what property hepossessed, to embark for Canada. Encouraged by the advice of a friend inthis country, he purchased a lot of wild land in the western district;"but sir," said he, addressing my husband with much vehemence, "I foundI had been vilely deceived. Such land, such a country--I would not livein it for all I could see. Why, there is not a drop of wholesome waterto be got, or a potato that is fit to eat. I lived for two months in amiserable shed they call a shanty, eaten up alive with mosquitoes. Icould get nothing to eat but salted pork, and, in short, the discomfortsare unbearable. And then all my farming knowledge was quite useless--people know nothing about farming in this country. Why, it would havebroken my heart to work among the stumps, and never see such a thing asa well-ploughed field. And then," he added, in a softer tone, "I thoughtof my poor wife and the little one. I might, for the sake of betteringmy condition, have roughed out a year or so myself, but, poor thing, Icould not have had the heart to have brought her out from the comfortsof England to such a place, not so good as one of our cow-houses orstables, and so I shall just go home; and if I don't tell all myneighbours what sort of a country this is they are all crazing to throwup their farms and come to, never trust a word of mine again."It was to no purpose that some persons present argued with him on thefolly of returning until he had tried what could be done: he only toldthem they were fools if they staid an hour in a country like this; andended by execrating those persons who deceived the people at home bytheir false statements, who sum up in a few pages all the advantages,without filling a volume with the disadvantages, as they might well do."Persons are apt to deceive themselves as well as to be deceived," saidmy husband; "and having once fixed their minds on any one subject, willonly read and believe those things that accord with their wishes."This young man was evidently disappointed in not finding all things asfair and pleasant as at home. He had never reflected on the subject, orhe could not have been so foolish as to suppose he would encounter nodifficulties in his first outset, in a settlement in the woods. We areprepared to meet with many obstacles, and endure considerableprivations, although I dare say we may meet with many unforeseen ones,forewarned as we have been by our Canadian friend's letters.Our places are taken in the stage for Lachine, and if all is well, weleave Montreal to-morrow morning. Our trunks, boxes, &c. are to be senton by the forwarders to Cobourg.--August 22.Cobourg, August 29.--When I closed my last letter I told you, my dearmother, that we should leave Montreal by sunrise the following day; butin this we were doomed to be disappointed, and to experience the truthof these words: "Boast not thyself of to-morrow, for thou knowest notwhat an hour may bring forth." Early that very morning, just an hourbefore sunrise, I was seized with the symptoms of the fatal malady thathad made so many homes desolate. I was too ill to commence my journey,and, with a heavy heart, heard the lumbering wheels rattle over thestones from the door of the hotel.I hourly grew worse, till the sister of the landlady, an excellent youngwoman, who had previously shown me great attention, persuaded me to sendfor a physician; and my husband, distracted at seeing me in such agony,ran off to seek for the best medical aid. After some little delay aphysician was found. I was then in extreme torture; but was relieved bybleeding, and by the violent fits of sickness that ensued. I will notdwell minutely on my sufferings, suffice to say, they were intense; butGod, in his mercy, though he chastened and afflicted me, yet gave me notover unto death. From the females of the house I received the greatestkindness. Instead of fleeing affrighted from the chamber of sickness,the two Irish girls almost quarrelled which should be my attendant;while Jane Taylor, the good young woman I before mentioned, never leftme from the time I grew so alarmingly ill till a change for the betterhad come over me, but, at the peril of her own life, supported me in herarms, and held me on her bosom, when I was struggling with mortal agony,alternately speaking peace to me, and striving to soothe the anguish ofmy poor afflicted partner.The remedies applied were bleeding, a portion of opium, blue pill, andsome sort of salts--not the common Epsom. The remedies proved effectual,though I suffered much from sickness and headache for many hours. Thedebility and low fever that took place of the cholera obliged me to keepmy bed some days. During the two first my doctor visited me four times aday; he was very kind, and, on hearing that I was the wife of a Britishofficer emigrating to the Upper Province, he seemed more than everinterested in my recovery, evincing a sympathy for us that was verygrateful to our feelings. After a weary confinement of several days, Iwas at last pronounced in a sufficiently convalescent state to begin myjourney, though still so weak that I was scarcely able to supportmyself.The sun had not yet risen when the stage that was to take us to Lachine,the first nine miles of our route, drove up to the door, and we gladlybade farewell to a place in which our hours of anxiety had been many,and those of pleasure few. We had, however, experienced a great deal ofkindness from those around us, and, though perfect strangers, had tastedsome of the hospitality for which this city has often been celebrated. Iomitted, in my former letter, telling you how we formed an acquaintancewith a highly respectable merchant in this place, who afforded us agreat deal of useful information, and introduced us to his wife, a veryelegant and accomplished young woman. During our short acquaintance, wepassed some pleasant hours at their house, much to our satisfaction.I enjoyed the fresh breeze from the river along the banks of which ourroad lay. It was a fine sight to see the unclouded sun rising frombehind the distant chain of mountains. Below us lay the rapids in theirperturbed state, and there was the island of St. Anne's, bringing to ourminds Moore's Canadian boat song: "We'll sing at Saint Anne's ourparting hymn."The bank of the St. Laurence, along which our road lay, is higher herethan at Montreal, and clothed with brushwood on the summit, occasionallybroken with narrow gulleys. The soil, as near as I could see, was sandyor light loam. I noticed the wild vine for the first time twining amongthe saplings. There were raspberry bushes, too, and a profusion of thattall yellow flower we call Aaron's golden rod, a _solidago_, and thewhite love-everlasting, the same that the chaplets are made of by theFrench and Swiss girls to adorn the tombs of their friends, and whichthey call _immortelle_; the Americans call it life-everlasting; also atall purple-spiked valerian, that I observed growing in the fields amongthe corn, as plentiful as the bugloss is in our light sandy fields inEngland.At Lachine we quitted the stage and went on board a steamer, a finevessel elegantly fitted up with every accommodation. I enjoyed thepassage up the river exceedingly, and should have been delighted withthe journey by land had not my recent illness weakened me so much that Ifound the rough roads very unpleasant. As to the vehicle, a Canadianstage, it deserves a much higher character than travellers have had thecandour to give it, and is so well adapted for the roads over which itpasses that I doubt if it could be changed for a more suitable one. Thisvehicle is calculated to hold nine persons, three back, front, andmiddle; the middle seat, which swings on broad straps of leather; is byfar the easiest, only you are liable to be disturbed when any of thepassengers choose to get out.Certainly the travelling is arranged with as little trouble to thetraveller as possible. Having paid your fare to Prescott you have nothought or care. When you quit the steam-boat you find a stage ready toreceive you and your luggage, which is limited to a certain proportion.When the portage is passed (the land carriage), you find a steam-vesselready, where you have every accommodation. The charges are notimmoderate, considering the comforts you enjoy.In addition to their own freight, the steamers generally tow up severalother vessels. We had three Durham boats at one time, beside some othersmall craft attached to us, which certainly afforded some variety, ifnot amusement.With the exception of Quebec and Montreal, I must give the preference tothe Upper Province. If not on so grand a scale, the scenery is morecalculated to please, from the appearance of industry and fertility itdisplays. I am delighted, in travelling along the road, with theneatness, cleanliness, and comfort of the cottages and farms. The log-house and shanty rarely occur, having been supplanted by pretty framehouses, built in a superior style, and often painted white-lead colouror a pale pea-green. Around these habitations were orchards, bendingdown with a rich harvest of apples, plums, and the American crab, thosebeautiful little scarlet apples so often met with as a wet preserveamong our sweetmeats at home.You see none of the signs of poverty or its attendant miseries. Noragged, dirty, squalid children, dabbling in mud or dust; but many atidy, smart-looking lass was spinning at the cottage-doors, with brighteyes and braided locks, while the younger girls were seated on the greenturf or on the threshold, knitting and singing as blithe as birds.There is something very picturesque in the great spinning-wheels thatare used in this country for spinning the wool, and if attitude were tobe studied among our Canadian lasses, there cannot be one more becoming,or calculated to show off the natural advantages of a fine figure, thanspinning at the big wheel. The spinster does not sit, but walks to andfro, guiding the yarn with one hand while with the other she turns thewheel.I often noticed, as we passed by the cottage farms, hanks of yarn ofdifferent colours hanging on the garden or orchard fence to dry; therewere all manner of colours, green, blue, purple, brown, red, and white.A civil landlady, at whose tavern we stopped to change horses, told methese hanks of yarn were first spun and then dyed by the good wives,preparatory to being sent to the loom. She showed me some of this home-spun cloth, which really looked very well. It was a dullish dark brown,the wool being the produce of a breed of black sheep. This cloth is madeup in different ways for family use."Every little dwelling you see," said she, "has its lot of land, and,consequently, its flock of sheep; and, as the children are early taughtto spin, and knit, and help dye the yarn, their parents can afford tosee them well and comfortably clothed."Many of these very farms you now see in so thriving a condition werewild land thirty years ago, nothing but Indian hunting-grounds. Theindustry of men, and many of them poor men, that had not a rood of landof their own in their own country, has effected this change."I was much gratified by the reflection to which this good woman'sinformation gave rise. "We also are going to purchase wild land, and whymay not we see our farm, in process of time," thought I, "equal thesefertile spots. Surely this is a blessed country to which we haveemigrated," said I, pursuing the pleasing idea, "where every cottageabounds with the comforts and necessaries of life."I perhaps overlooked at that time the labour, the difficulties, theprivations to which these settlers had been exposed when they first cameto this country. I saw it only at a distance of many years, under a highstate of cultivation, perhaps in the hands of their children or theirchildren's children, while the toil-worn parent's head was low in thedust.Among other objects my attention was attracted by the appearance of openburying-grounds by the roadside. Pretty green mounds, surrounded bygroups of walnut and other handsome timber trees, contained the gravesof a family, or may be, some favoured friends slept quietly below theturf beside them. If the ground was not consecrated, it was hallowed bythe tears and prayers of parents and children.These household graves became the more interesting to me on learningthat when a farm is disposed of to a stranger, the right of buryingtheir dead is generally stipulated for by the former possessor.You must bear with me if I occasionally weary you with dwelling ontrifles. To me nothing that bears the stamp of novelty is devoid ofinterest. Even the clay-built ovens stuck upon four legs at a littledistance from the houses were not unnoticed in passing. When there isnot the convenience of one of these ovens outside the dwellings, thebread is baked in large iron pots--"_bake-kettles_" they are termed. Ihave already seen a loaf as big as a peck measure baking on the hearthin one of these kettles, and tasted of it, too; but I think the confinedsteam rather imparts a peculiar taste to the bread, which you do notperceive in the loaves baked in brick or clay ovens. At first I couldnot make out what these funny little round buildings, perched upon fourposts, could be; and I took them for bee-hives till I spied a good womandrawing some nice hot loaves out of one that stood on a bit of wasteland on the roadside, some fifty yards from the cottage.Besides the ovens every house had a draw-well near it, which differed inthe contrivance for raising the water from those I had seen in the oldcountry. The plan is very simple:--a long pole, supported by a post,acts as a lever to raise the bucket, and the water can be raised by achild with very trifling exertion. This method is by many personspreferred to either rope or chain, and from its simplicity can beconstructed by any person at the mere trouble of fixing the poles. Imention this merely to show the ingenuity of people in this country, andhow well adapted all their ways are to their means*. [* The plan ispursued in England and elsewhere, and may be seen in the market-gardenson the western suburb of London. It can only be done when the water isnear the surface.]We were exceedingly gratified by the magnificent appearance of therapids of the St. Laurence, at the cascades of which the road commandeda fine view from the elevation of the banks. I should fail in my attemptto describe this grand sheet of turbulent water to you. Howison haspictured them very minutely in his work on Upper Canada, which I knowyou are well acquainted with. I regretted that we could not linger tofeast our eyes with a scene so wild and grand as the river here appears;but a Canadian stage waits for no one, so we were obliged to contentourselves with a passing sight of these celebrated rapids.We embarked at Couteau du Lac and reached Cornwall late the sameevening. Some of the stages travel all night, but I was too muchfatigued to commence a journey of forty-nine miles over Canadian roadsthat night. Our example was followed by a widow lady and her littlefamily.We had some difficulty obtaining a lodging, the inns being full oftravellers; here, for the first time we experienced something of thatodious manner ascribed, though doubtless too generally, to the American.Our host seemed perfectly indifferent to the comfort of his guests,leaving them to wait on themselves or go without what they wanted. Theabsence of females in these establishments is a great drawback whereladies are travelling. The women keep entirely out of sight, or treatyou with that offensive coldness and indifference that you derive littlesatisfaction from their attendance.After some difficulty in obtaining sight of the landlady of the inn atCornwall, and asking her to show me a chamber where we might pass thenight, with a most ungracious air she pointed to a door which openedinto a mere closet, in which was a bed divested of curtains, one chair,and an apology for a wash-stand. Seeing me in some dismay at the sightof this uninviting domicile, she laconically observed there was that ornone, unless I chose to sleep in a four-bedded room, which had threetenants in it,--and those gentlemen. This alternative I somewhatindignantly declined, and in no very good humour retired to my cabin,where vile familiars to the dormitory kept us from closing our wearyeye-lids till the break of day.We took an early and hasty breakfast, and again commenced our journey.Here our party consisted of myself, my husband, a lady and gentlemanwith three small children, besides an infant of a month old, all ofwhom, from the eldest to the youngest, were suffering from hooping-cough; two great Cumberland miners, and a French pilot and hiscompanion--this was a huge amphibious-looking monster, who bounced inand squeezed himself into a corner seat, giving a knowing nod andcomical grin to the driver, who was in the secret, and in utter defianceof all remonstrance at this unlooked-for intrusion, cracked his whipwith a flourish, that appeared to be reckoned pretty considerably smartby two American travellers that stood on either side of the door at theinn, with their hats not in their hands nor yet on their heads, butslung by a black ribbon to one of their waistcoat buttons, so as to fallnearly under one arm. This practice I have seen adopted since, and thinkif Johnny Gilpin had but taken this wise precaution he might have savedboth hat and wig.I was dreadfully fatigued with this day's travelling, being literallybruised black and blue. We suffered much inconvenience from theexcessive heat of the day, and could well have dispensed with thecompany of two out of the four of our bulky companions.We reached Prescott about five the same afternoon, where we met withgood treatment at the inn; the female servants were all English, andseemed to vie with each other in attention to us.We saw little in the town of Prescott to interest or please. After anexcellent breakfast we embarked on board the _Great Britain_, the fineststeamer we had yet seen, and here we were joined by our new friends, toour great satisfaction.At Brockville we arrived just in time to enjoy what was to me quite anovel sight,--a ship-launch. A gay and exciting scene it was. The sunshone brilliantly on a concourse of people that thronged the shore intheir holiday attire; the church bells rang merrily out, mingling withthe music from the deck of the gaily painted vessel that, with flags andstreamers, and a well-dressed company on board, was preparing for thelaunch.To give additional effect, a salute was fired from a temporary forterected for the occasion on a little rocky island in front of the town.The schooner took the water in fine style, as if eager to embrace theelement which was henceforth to be subject to her. It was a moment ofintense interest. The newly launched was greeted with three cheers fromthe company on board the _Great Britain_, with a salute from the littlefort, and a merry peal from the bells, which were also rung in honour ofa pretty bride that came on board with her bridegroom on their way tovisit the falls of Niagara.Brockville is situated just at the entrance of the lake of the ThousandIslands, and presents a pretty appearance from the water. The town hasimproved rapidly, I am told, within the last few years, and is becominga place of some importance.The shores of the St. Laurence assume a more rocky and picturesqueaspect as you advance among its thousand islands, which present everyvariety of wood and rock. The steamer put in for a supply of fire-woodat a little village on the American side the river, where also we tookon board five-and-twenty beautiful horses, which are to be exhibited atCobourg and York for sale.There was nothing at all worthy of observation in the American village,unless I except a novelty that rather amused me. Almost every house hada tiny wooden model of itself, about the bigness of a doll's house, (orbaby-house, I think they are called,) stuck up in front of the roof orat the gable end. I was informed by a gentleman on board, these baby-houses, as I was pleased to call them, were for the swallows to buildin.It was midnight when we passed Kingston, so of course I saw nothing ofthat "key to the lakes," as I have heard it styled. When I awoke in themorning the steamer was dashing gallantly along through the waters ofthe Ontario, and I experienced a slight sensation of sickness.When the waters of the lake are at all agitated, as they sometimes are,by high winds, you might imagine yourself upon a tempest-tossed sea.The shores of the Ontario are very fine, rising in waving lines of hilland dale, clothed with magnificent woods, or enlivened by patches ofcultivated land and pretty dwellings. At ten o'clock we reached Cobourg.Cobourg, at which place we are at present, is a neatly built andflourishing village, containing many good stores, mills, a banking-house, and printing-office, where a newspaper is published once a week.There is a very pretty church and a select society, many families ofrespectability having fixed their residences in or near the town.To-morrow we leave Cobourg, and shall proceed to Peterborough, fromwhich place I shall again write and inform you of our futuredestination, which will probably be on one of the small lakes of theOtanabee.LETTER V.Journey from Cobourg to Amherst.--Difficulties to be encountered onfirst settling in the Backwoods.--Appearance of the Country.--RiceLake.--Indian Habits.--Voyage up the Otanabee.--Log-house, and itsInmates.--Passage boat.--Journey on foot to Peterborough.Peterborough, Newcastle District.September 8, 1832.We left Cobourg on the afternoon of the 1st of September in a lightwaggon, comfortably lined with buffalo robes. Our fellow travellersconsisted of three gentlemen and a young lady, all of whom proved veryagreeable, and willing to afford us every information respecting thecountry through which we were travelling. The afternoon was fine--one ofthose rich mellow days we often experience in the early part ofSeptember. The warm hues of autumn were already visible on the foresttrees, but rather spoke of ripeness than decay. The country roundCobourg is well cultivated, a great portion of the woods having beensuperseded by open fields, pleasant farms, and fine flourishingorchards, with green pastures, where abundance of cattle were grazing.The county gaol and court-house at Amherst, about a mile and a half fromCobourg, is a fine stone edifice, situated on a rising ground, whichcommands an extensive view over the lake Ontario and surroundingscenery. As you advance farther up the country, in the direction of theHamilton or Rice Lake plains, the land rises into bold sweeping hillsand dales.The outline of the country reminded me of the hilly part ofGloucestershire; you want, however, the charm with which civilizationhas so eminently adorned that fine county, with all its romanticvillages, flourishing towns, cultivated farms, and extensive downs, sothickly covered with flocks and herds. Here the bold forests of oak,beech, maple, and bass-wood, with now and then a grove of dark pine,cover the hills, only enlivened by an occasional settlement, with itslog-house and zig-zag fences of split timber: these fences are veryoffensive to my eye. I look in vain for the rich hedge rows of my nativecountry. Even the stone fences in the north and west of England, coldand bare as they are, are less unsightly. The settlers, however,invariably adopt whatever plan saves time, labour, and money. The greatlaw of expediency is strictly observed;--it is borne of necessity.Matters of taste appear to be little regarded, or are, at all events,after-considerations.I could see a smile hover on the lips of my fellow travellers on hearingof our projected plans for the adornment of our future dwelling."If you go into the backwoods your house must necessarily be a log-house," said an elderly gentleman, who had been a settler many years inthe country. "For you will most probably be out of the way of a saw-mill, and you will find so much to do, and so many obstacles toencounter, for the first two or three years, that you will hardly haveopportunity for carrying these improvements into effect."There is an old saying," he added, with a mixture of gravity and goodhumour in his looks, "that I used to hear when I was a boy, 'firstcreep* and then go.' [* Derived from infants crawling on all-foursbefore they have strength to walk.] Matters are not carried on quite soeasily here as at home; and the truth of this a very few weeks'acquaintance with the _bush_, as we term all unbroken forest land, willprove. At the end of five years you may begin to talk of these prettyimprovements and elegancies, and you will then be able to see a littlewhat you are about.""I thought," said I, "every thing in this country was done with so muchexpedition. I am sure I have heard and read of houses being built in aday." The old gentleman laughed."Yes, yes," he replied, "travellers find no difficulty in putting up ahouse in twelve or twenty-four hours, and so the log-walls can be raisedin that time or even less; but the house is not completed when the outerwalls are up, as your husband will find to his cost.""But all the works on emigration that I leave read," replied I, "give afair and flattering picture of a settler's life; for, according to theirstatements, the difficulties are easily removed.""Never mind books," said my companion, "use your own reason. Look onthose interminable forests, through which the eye can only penetrate afew yards, and tell me how those vast timbers are to be removed, utterlyextirpated, I may say, from the face of the earth, the ground clearedand burnt, a crop sown and fenced, and a house to shelter you raised,without difficulty, without expense, and without great labour. Nevertell me of what is said in books, written very frequently by tarry-at-home travellers. Give me facts. One honest, candid emigrant's experienceis worth all that has been written on the subject. Besides, that whichmay be a true picture of one part of the country will hardly suitanother. The advantages and disadvantages arising from soil, situation,and progress of civilization, are very different in different districts:even the prices of goods and of produce, stock and labour, varyexceedingly, according as you are near to, or distant from, towns andmarkets."I began to think my fellow-traveller spoke sensibly on the subject, withwhich the experience of thirteen years had made him perfectlyconversant. I began to apprehend that we also had taken too flattering aview of a settler's life as it must be in the backwoods. Time and ourown personal knowledge will be the surest test, and to that we must bow.We are ever prone to believe that which we wish.About halfway between Cobourg and the Rice Lake there is a pretty valleybetween two steep hills. Here there is a good deal of cleared land and atavern: the place is called "Cold Springs." Who knows but some centuryor two hence this spot may become a fashionable place of resort to drinkthe waters. A Canadian Bath or Cheltenham may spring up where now Naturerevels in her wilderness of forest trees.We now ascended the plains--a fine elevation of land--for many milesscantily clothed with oaks, and here and there bushy pines, with othertrees and shrubs. The soil is in some places sandy, but varies, I amtold, considerably in different parts, and is covered in large trackswith rich herbage, affording abundance of the finest pasture for cattle.A number of exquisite flowers and shrubs adorn these plains, which rivalany garden in beauty during the spring and summer months. Many of theseplants are peculiar to the plains, and are rarely met with in any othersituation. The trees, too, though inferior in size to those in theforests, are more picturesque, growing in groups or singly, atconsiderable intervals, giving a sort of park-like appearance to thisportion of the country. The prevailing opinion seems to be, that theplains laid out in grazing or dairy farms would answer the purpose ofsettlers well; as there is plenty of land that will grow wheat and othercorn-crops, and can be improved at a small expense, besides abundance ofnatural pasture for cattle. One great advantage seems to be, that theplough can be introduced directly, and the labour of preparing theground is necessarily much less than where it is wholly covered withwood.[Illustration: Rice Grounds]There are several settlers on these plains possessing considerablefarms. The situation, I should think, must be healthy and agreeable,from the elevation and dryness of the land, and the pleasant prospectthey command of the country below them, especially where the Rice Lake,with its various islands and picturesque shores, is visible. The grounditself is pleasingly broken into hill and valley, sometimes gentlysloping, at other times abrupt and almost precipitous.An American farmer, who formed one of our party at breakfast thefollowing morning, told me that these plains were formerly famoushunting grounds of the Indians, who, to prevent the growth of thetimbers, burned them year after year; this, in process of time,destroyed the young trees, so as to prevent them again from accumulatingto the extent they formerly did. Sufficient only was left to formcoverts; for the deer resort hither in great herds for the sake of apeculiar tall sort of grass with which these plains abound, called deer-grass, on which they become exceedingly fat at certain seasons of theyear.Evening closed in before we reached the tavern on the shores of the RiceLake, where we were to pass the night; so that I lost something of thebeautiful scenery which this fine expanse of water presents as youdescend the plains towards its shores. The glimpses I caught of it wereby the faint but frequent flashes of lightning that illumined thehorizon to the north, which just revealed enough to make me regret Icould see no more that night. The Rice Lake is prettily diversified withsmall wooded islets: the north bank rises gently from the water's edge.Within sight of Sully, the tavern from which the steam-boat starts thatgoes up the Otanabee, you see several well-cultivated settlements; andbeyond the Indian village the missionaries have a school for theeducation and instruction of the Indian children. Many of them can bothread and write fluently, and are greatly improved in their moral andreligious conduct. They are well and comfortably clothed, and havehouses to live in. But they are still too much attached to theirwandering habits to become good and industrious settlers. During certainseasons they leave the village, and encamp themselves in the woods alongthe borders of those lakes and rivers that present the most advantageoushunting and fishing grounds.The Rice Lake and Mud Lake Indians belong, I am told, to the Chippewas;but the traits of cunning and warlike ferocity that formerly marked thissingular people seem to have disappeared beneath the milder influence ofChristianity.Certain it is that the introduction of the Christian religion is thefirst greatest step towards civilization and improvement; its verytendency being to break down the strong-holds of prejudice andignorance, and unite mankind in one bond of social brotherhood. I havebeen told that for some time drunkenness was unknown, and even themoderate use of spirits was religiously abstained from by all theconverts. This abstinence is still practised by some families; but oflate the love of ardent spirits has again crept in among them, bringingdiscredit upon their faith. It is indeed hardly to be wondered at, whenthe Indian sees those around him that call themselves Christians, andwho are better educated, and enjoy the advantages of civilized society,indulging to excess in this degrading vice, that he should suffer hisnatural inclination to overcome his Christian duty, which might in somehave taken no deep root. I have been surprised and disgusted by thecensures passed on the erring Indian by persons who were foremost inindulgence at the table and the tavern; as if the crime of drunkennesswere more excusable in the man of education than in the half-reclaimedsavage.There are some fine settlements on the Rice Lake, but I am told theshores are not considered healthy, the inhabitants being subject tolake-fevers and ague, especially where the ground is low and swampy.These fevers and agues are supposed by some people to originate in theextensive rice-beds which cause a stagnation in the water; the constantevaporation from the surface acting on a mass of decaying vegetationmust tend to have a bad effect on the constitution of those that areimmediately exposed to its pernicious influence.Besides numerous small streams, here called _creeks_, two considerablerivers, the Otanabee and the Trent, find an outlet for their waters inthe Rice Lake. These rivers are connected by a chain of small lakes,which you may trace on any good map of the province. I send you adiagram, which has been published at Cobourg, which will give you thegeography of this portion of the country. It is on one of these smalllakes we purpose purchasing land, which, should the navigation of thesewaters be carried into effect, as is generally supposed to be incontemplation, will render the lands on their shores very advantageousto the settlers; at present they are interrupted by large blocks ofgranite and limestone, rapids, and falls, which prevent any but canoesor flat-bottomed boats from passing on them, and even these are limitedto certain parts, on account of the above-named obstacles. By deepeningthe bed of the river and lakes, and forming locks in some parts andcanals, the whole sweep of these waters might be thrown open to the Bayof Quinte. The expense, however, would necessarily be great; and tillthe townships of this portion of the district be fully settled, it ishardly to be expected that so vast an undertaking should be effected,however desirable it may be.[Illustration: Sleigh driving]We left the tavern at Rice Lake, after an unusual delay, at nineo'clock. The morning was damp, and a cold wind blew over the lake, whichappeared to little advantage through the drizzling rain, from which Iwas glad to shroud my face in my warm plaid cloak, for there was nocabin or other shelter in the little steamer than an inefficient awning.This apology for a steam-boat formed a considerable contrast with thesuperbly-appointed vessels we had lately been passengers in on theOntario and the St. Laurence. But the circumstance of a steamer at allon the Otanabee was a matter of surprise to us, and of exultation to thefirst settlers along its shores, who for many years had been contentedwith no better mode of transport than a scow or a canoe for themselvesand their marketable produce, or through the worst possible roads with awaggon or sleigh.The Otanabee is a fine broad, clear stream, divided into two mouths atits entrance to the Rice Lake by a low tongue of land, too swampy to beput under cultivation. This beautiful river (for such I consider it tobe) winds its way between thickly-wooded banks, which rise gradually asyou advance higher up the country.Towards noon the mists cleared off, and the sun came forth in all thebrilliant beauty of a September day. So completely were we shelteredfrom the wind by the thick wall of pines on either side, that I nolonger felt the least inconvenience from the cold that had chilled me oncrossing the lake in the morning.To the mere passing traveller, who cares little for the minute beautiesof scenery, there is certainly a monotony in the long and unbroken lineof woods, which insensibly inspires a feeling of gloom almost touchingon sadness. Still there are objects to charm and delight the closeobserver of nature. His eye will be attracted by fantastic bowers, whichare formed by the scarlet creeper (or Canadian ivy) and the wild vine,flinging their closely-entwined wreaths of richly tinted foliage frombough to bough of the forest trees, mingling their hues with thesplendid rose-tipped branches of the soft maple, the autumnal tints ofwhich are unrivalled in beauty by any of our forest trees at home.The purple clusters of the grape, by no means so contemptible in size asI had been led to imagine, looked tempting to my longing eyes, as theyappeared just ripening among these forest bowers. I am told the juiceforms a delicious and highly-flavoured jelly, boiled with sufficientquantity of sugar; the seeds are too large to make any other preparationof them practicable. I shall endeavour, at some time or other, to trythe improvement that can be effected by cultivation. One is apt toimagine where Nature has so abundantly bestowed fruits, that is the mostfavourable climate for their attaining perfection with the assistance ofculture and soil.[Illustration: Silver Pine]The waters of the Otanabee are so clear and free from impurity that youdistinctly see every stone-pebble or shell at the bottom. Here and therean opening in the forest reveals some tributary stream, working its waybeneath the gigantic trees that meet above it. The silence of the sceneis unbroken but by the sudden rush of the wild duck, disturbed from itsretreat among the shrubby willows, that in some parts fringe the leftbank, or the shrill cry of the kingfisher, as it darts across the water.The steam-boat put in for a supply of fire-wood at a clearing abouthalf-way from Peterborough, and I gladly availed myself of theopportunity of indulging my inclination for gathering some of thesplendid cardinal flowers that grew among the stones by the river'sbrink. Here, too, I plucked as sweet a rose as ever graced an Englishgarden. I also found, among the grass of the meadow-land, spearmint,and, nearer to the bank, peppermint. There was a bush resembling ourhawthorn, which, on examination, proved to be the cockspur hawthorn,with fruit as large as cherries, pulpy, and of a pleasant tartness notmuch unlike to tamarinds. The thorns of this tree were of formidablelength and strength. I should think it might be introduced with greatadvantage to form live fences; the fruit, too, would prove by no meanscontemptible as a preserve.As I felt a great curiosity to see the interior of a log-house, Ientered the open door-way of the tavern, as the people termed it, underthe pretext of buying a draught of milk. The interior of this rudedwelling presented no very inviting aspect. The walls were of roughunhewn logs, filled between the chinks with moss and irregular wedges ofwood to keep out the wind and rain. The unplastered roof displayed therafters, covered with moss and lichens, green, yellow, and grey; abovewhich might be seen the shingles, dyed to a fine mahogany-red by thesmoke which refused to ascend the wide clay and stone chimney, to curlgracefully about the roof, and seek its exit in the various crannies andapertures with which the roof and sides of the building abounded.The floor was of earth, which had become pretty hard and smooth throughuse. This hut reminded me of the one described by the four Russiansailors that were left to winter on the island of Spitzbergen. Itsfurniture was of corresponding rudeness; a few stools, rough andunplaned; a deal table, which, from being manufactured from unseasonedwood, was divided by three wide open seams, and was only held togetherby its ill-shaped legs; two or three blocks of grey granite placedbeside the hearth served for seats for the children, with the additionof two beds raised a little above the ground by a frame of split cedars.On these lowly couches lay extended two poor men, suffering under thewasting effects of lake-fever. Their yellow bilious faces strangelycontrasted with the gay patchwork-quilts that covered them. I felt muchconcerned for the poor emigrants, who told me they had not been manyweeks in the country when they were seized with the fever and ague. Theyboth had wives and small children, who seemed very miserable. The wivesalso had been sick with ague, and had not a house or even shanty oftheir own up; the husbands having fallen ill were unable to do anything;and much of the little money they had brought out with them had beenexpended in board and lodging in this miserable place, which theydignified by the name of tavern. I cannot say I was greatly prepossessedin favour of their hostess, a harsh, covetous woman. Besides the variousemigrants, men, women, and children, that lodged within the walls, thelog-house had tenants of another description. A fine calf occupied a penin a corner; some pigs roamed grunting about in company with some half-dozen fowls. The most attractive objects were three snow-white pigeons,that were meekly picking up crumbs, and looking as if they were too pureand innocent to be inhabitants of such a place.Owing to the shallowness of the river at this season, and to the rapids,the steam-boat is unable to go up the whole way to Peterborough, and ascow or rowboat, as it is sometimes termed--a huge, unwieldy, flat-bottomed machine--meets the passengers at a certain part of the river,within sight of a singular pine tree on the right bank; this is termedthe "Yankee bonnet," from the fancied resemblance of the topmost boughsto a sort of cap worn by the Yankees, not much unlike the blue bonnet ofScotland.Unfortunately, the steamer ran aground some four miles below the usualplace of rendezvous, and we waited till near four o'clock for the scow.When it made its appearance, we found, to our discomfort, the rowers(eight in number, and all Irishmen) were under the exciting influence ofa cag of whiskey, which they had drunk dry on the voyage. They weremoreover exasperated by the delay on the part of the steamer, which gavethem four miles additional heavy rowing. Beside a number of passengersthere was an enormous load of furniture, trunks, boxes, chests, sacks ofwheat, barrels of flour, salt, and pork, with many miscellaneouspackages and articles, small and great, which were piled to a heightthat I thought very unsafe both to goods and passengers.With a marvellous ill grace the men took up their oars when their loadwas completed, but declared they would go on shore and make a fire andcook their dinners, they not having eaten any food, though they hadtaken large potations of the whiskey. This measure was opposed by someof the gentlemen, and a fierce and angry scene ensued, which ended inthe mutineers flinging down their oars, and positively refusing to rowanother stroke till they had satisfied their hunger.Perhaps I had a fellow-feeling for them, as I began to be exceedinglyhungry, almost ravenous, myself, having fasted since six that morning;indeed, so faint was I, that I was fain to get my husband to procure mea morsel of the coarse uninviting bread that was produced by the rowers,and which they ate with huge slices of raw pickled pork, seasoning thisunseemly meal with curses "not loud but deep," and bitter taunts againstthose who prevented them from cooking their food like _Christians_.While I was eagerly eating the bit of bread, an old farmer, who had eyedme for some time with a mixture of curiosity and compassion, said, "Poorthing: well, you do seem hungry indeed, and I dare say are just out fromthe _ould_ country, and so little used to such hard fare. Here are somecakes that my woman (i.e. wife) put in my pocket when I left home; Icare nothing for them, but they are better than that bad bread; take'em, and welcome." With these words he tossed some very respectablehome-made seed-cakes into my lap, and truly never was anything morewelcome than this seasonable refreshment.A sullen and gloomy spirit seemed to prevail among our boatmen, which byno means diminished as the evening drew on, and "the rapids were near."The sun had set, and the moon and stars rose brilliantly over the stillwaters, which gave back the reflections of their glorious multitude ofheavenly bodies. A sight so passing fair might have stilled the mostturbulent spirits into peace; at least so I thought, as, wrapped in mycloak, I leant back against the supporting arm of my husband, andlooking from the waters to the sky, and from the sky to the waters, withdelight and admiration. My pleasant reverie was, however, soon ended,when I suddenly felt the boat touch the rocky bank, and heard theboatmen protesting they would go no further that night. We were nearlythree miles below Peterborough, and how I was to walk this distance,weakened as I was by recent illness and fatigue of our long travelling,I knew not. To spend the night in an open boat, exposed to the heavydews arising from the river, would be almost death. While we weredeliberating on what to do, the rest of the passengers had made up theirminds, and taken the way through the woods by a road they were wellacquainted with. They were soon out of sight, all but one gentleman, whowas bargaining with one of the rowers to take him and his dog across theriver at the head of the rapids in a skiff.Imagine our situation, at ten o'clock at night, without knowing a singlestep of our road, put on shore to find the way to the distant town as webest could, or pass the night in the dark forest.Almost in despair, we entreated the gentleman to be our guide as far ashe went. But so many obstacles beset our path in the form of newly-chopped trees and blocks of stone, scattered along the shore, that itwas with the utmost difficulty we could keep him in sight. At last wecame up with him at the place appointed to meet the skiff, and, with apertinacity that at another time and in other circumstances we nevershould have adopted, we all but insisted on being admitted into theboat. An angry growling consent was extorted from the surly Charon, andwe hastily entered the frail bark, which seemed hardly calculated toconvey us in safety to the opposite shore.I could not help indulging in a feeling of indescribable fear, as Ilistened to the torrent of profane invective that burst forthcontinually from the lips of the boatman. Once or twice we were indanger of being overset by the boughs of the pines and cedars which hadfallen into the water near the banks. Right glad was I when we reachedthe opposite shores; but here a new trouble arose: there was yet moreuntracked wood to cross before we again met the skiff which had to passup a small rapid, and meet us at the head of the small lake, anexpansion of the Otanabee a little below Peterborough. At the distanceof every few yards our path was obstructed by fallen trees, mostlyhemlock, spruce, or cedar, the branches of which are so thicklyinterwoven that it is scarcely possible to separate them, or force apassage through the tangled thicket which they form.Had it not been for the humane assistance of our conductor, I know nothow I should have surmounted these difficulties. Sometimes I was readyto sink down from very weariness. At length I hailed, with a joy I couldhardly have supposed possible, the gruff voice of the Irish rower, and,after considerable grumbling on his part, we were again seated.Glad enough we were to see, by the blazing light of an enormous log-heap, the house of our friend. Here we received the offer of a guide toshow us the way to the town by a road cut through the wood. We partookof the welcome refreshment of tea, and, having gained a little strengthby a short rest, we once more commenced our journey, guided by a ragged,but polite, Irish boy, whose frankness and good humour quite won ourregards. He informed us he was one of seven orphans, who had lost fatherand mother in the cholera. It was a sad thing, he said, to be leftfatherless and motherless, in a strange land; and he swept away thetears that gathered in his eyes as he told the simple, but sad tale ofhis early bereavement; but added, cheerfully, he had met with a kindmaster, who had taken some of his brothers and sisters into his serviceas well as himself.Just as we were emerging from the gloom of the wood we found ourprogress impeded by a _creek_, as the boy called it, over which he toldus we must pass by a log-bridge before we could get to the town. Now,the log-bridge was composed of one log, or rather a fallen tree, thrownacross the stream, rendered very slippery by the heavy dew that hadrisen from the swamp. As the log admitted of only one person at a time,I could receive no assistance from my companions; and, though our littleguide, with a natural politeness arising from the benevolence of hisdisposition, did me all the service in his power by holding the lanternclose to the surface to throw all the light he could on the subject, Ihad the ill luck to fall in up to my knees in the water, my head turningquite giddy just as I came to the last step or two; thus was I wet aswell as weary. To add to our misfortune we saw the lights disappear, oneby one, in the village, till a solitary candle, glimmering from theupper chambers of one or two houses, were our only beacons. We had yet alodging to seek, and it was near midnight before we reached the door ofthe principal inn; there, at least, thought I, our troubles for to-nightwill end; but great was our mortification on being told there was not aspare bed to be had in the house, every one being occupied by emigrantsgoing up to one of the back townships.I could go no further, and we petitioned for a place by the kitchenfire, where we might rest, at least, if not sleep, and I might dry mywet garments. On seeing my condition the landlady took compassion on me,led me to a blazing fire, which her damsels quickly roused up; onebrought a warm bath for my feet, while another provided a warm potation,which, I really believe, strange and unusual to my lips as it was, didme good: in short, we received every kindness and attention that werequired from mine host and hostess, who relinquished their own bed forour accommodation, contenting themselves with a shakedown before thekitchen fire.I can now smile at the disasters of _that_ day, but at the time theyappeared no trifles, as you may well suppose.Farewell, my dearest Mother.LETTER VI.Peterborough.--Manners and Language of the Americans.--ScotchEngineman.--Description of Peterborough and its Environs.--CanadianFlowers.--Shanties.--Hardships suffered by first Settlers.--Process ofestablishing a Farm.Peterborough, Sept. 11, 1832.IT is now settled that we abide here till after the government sale hastaken place. We are, then, to remain with S------ and his family till wehave got a few acres chopped, and a log-house put up on our own land.Having determined to go at once into the bush, on account of ourmilitary grant, which we have been so fortunate as to draw in theneighbourhood of S------, we have fully made up our minds to enter atonce, and cheerfully, on the privations and inconveniences attendingsuch a situation; as there is no choice between relinquishing that greatadvantage and doing our settlement duties. We shall not be worse offthan others who have gone before us to the unsettled townships, many ofwhom, naval and military officers, with their families, have had tostruggle with considerable difficulties, but who are now beginning tofeel the advantages arising from their exertions.In addition to the land he is entitled to as an officer in the Britishservice, my husband is in treaty for the purchase of an eligible lot bysmall lakes. This will give us a water frontage, and a furtherinducement to bring us within a little distance of S------; so that weshall not be quite so lonely as if we had gone on to our government lotat once.We have experienced some attention and hospitality from several of theresidents of Peterborough. There is a very genteel society, chieflycomposed of officers and their families, besides the professional menand storekeepers. Many of the latter are persons of respectable familyand good education. Though a store is, in fact, nothing better than whatwe should call in the country towns at home a "_general shop_," yet thestorekeeper in Canada holds a very different rank from the shopkeeper ofthe English village. The storekeepers are the merchants and bankers ofthe places in which they reside. Almost all money matters are transactedby them, and they are often men of landed property and consequence, notunfrequently filling the situations of magistrates, commissioners, andeven members of the provincial parliament.As they maintain a rank in society which entitles them to equality withthe aristocracy of the country, you must not be surprised when I tellyou that it is no uncommon circumstance to see the sons of naval andmilitary officers and clergymen standing behind a counter, or wieldingan axe in the woods with their fathers' choppers; nor do they lose theirgrade in society by such employment. After all, it is education andmanners that must distinguish the gentleman in this country, seeing thatthe labouring man, if he is diligent and industrious, may soon becomehis equal in point of worldly possessions. The ignorant man, let him beever so wealthy, can never be equal to the man of education. It is themind that forms the distinction between the classes in this country--"Knowledge is power!"We had heard so much of the odious manners of the Yankees in thiscountry that I was rather agreeably surprised by the few specimens ofnative Americans that I have seen. They were for the most part, polite,well-behaved people. The only peculiarities I observed in them were acertain nasal twang in speaking, and some few odd phrases; but thesewere only used by the lower class, who "_guess_" and "_calculate_" alittle more than we do. One of their most remarkable terms is to"_Fix_." Whatever work requires to be done it must be _fixed_. "Fix theroom" is, set it in order. "Fix the table"--"Fix the fire," says themistress to her servants, and the things are fixed accordingly.I was amused one day by hearing a woman tell her husband the chimneywanted fixing. I thought it seemed secure enough, and was a littlesurprised when the man got a rope and a few cedar boughs, with which hedislodged an accumulation of soot that caused the fire to smoke. Thechimney being _fixed_, all went right again. This odd term is notconfined to the lower orders alone, and, from hearing it so often, itbecomes a standard word even among the later emigrants from our owncountry.With the exception of some few remarkable expressions, and an attempt atintroducing fine words in their every-day conversation, the lower orderof Yankees have a decided advantage over our English peasantry in theuse of grammatical language: they speak better English than you willhear from persons of the same class in any part of England, Ireland, orScotland; a fact that we should be unwilling, I suppose, to allow athome.If I were asked what appeared to me the most striking feature in themanners of the Americans that I had met with, I should say it wascoldness approaching to apathy. I do not at all imagine them to bedeficient in feeling or real sensibility, but they do not suffer theiremotion to be seen. They are less profuse in their expressions ofwelcome and kindness than we are, though probably quite as sincere. Noone doubts their hospitality; but, after all, one likes to see thehearty shake of the hand, and hear the cordial word that makes one feeloneself welcome.Persons who come to this country are very apt to confound the oldsettlers from Britain with the native Americans; and when they meet withpeople of rude, offensive manners, using certain Yankee words in theirconversation, and making a display of independence not exactly suitableto their own aristocratical notions, they immediately suppose they mustbe genuine Yankees, while they are, in fact, only imitators; and youwell know the fact that a bad imitation is always worse than theoriginal.You would be surprised to see how soon the new comers fall into thisdisagreeable manner and affectation of equality, especially the inferiorclass of Irish and Scotch; the English less so. We were ratherentertained by the behaviour of a young Scotchman, the engineer of thesteamer, on my husband addressing him with reference to the managementof the engine. His manners were surly, and almost insolent. Hescrupulously avoided the least approach to courtesy or outward respect;nay, he even went so far as to seat himself on the bench close besideme, and observed that "among the many advantages this country offered tosettlers like him, he did not reckon it the least of them that he wasnot obliged to take off his hat when he spoke to people (meaning personsof our degree), or address them by any other title than their name;besides, he could go and take his seat beside any gentleman or ladyeither, and think himself to the full as good as them."Very likely," I replied, hardly able to refrain from laughing at thissally; "but I doubt you greatly overrate the advantage of suchprivileges, for you cannot oblige the lady or gentleman to entertain thesame opinion of your qualifications, or to remain seated beside youunless it pleases them to do so." With these words I rose up and leftthe independent gentleman evidently a little confounded at themanoeuvre: however, he soon recovered his self-possession, and continuedswinging the axe he held in his hand, and said, "It is no crime, Iguess, being born a poor man.""None in the world," replied my husband; "a man's birth is not of hisown choosing. A man can no more help being born poor than rich; neitheris it the fault of a gentleman being born of parents who occupy a higherstation in society than his neighbour. I hope you will allow this?"The Scotchman was obliged to yield a reluctant affirmative to the latterposition; but concluded with again repeating his satisfaction at notbeing obliged in this country to take off his hat, or speak with respectto gentlemen, as they styled themselves."No one, my friend, could have obliged you to be well mannered at homeany more than in Canada. Surely you could have kept your hat on yourhead if you had been so disposed; no gentleman would have knocked itoff, I am sure."As to the boasted advantage of rude manners in Canada, I should thinksomething of it if it benefited you the least, or put one extra dollarin your pocket; but I have my doubts if it has that profitable effect.""There is a comfort, I guess, in considering oneself equal to agentleman.""Particularly if you could induce the gentleman to think the same." Thiswas a point that seemed rather to disconcert our candidate for equality,who commenced whistling and kicking his heels with redoubled energy."Now," said his tormentor, "you have explained your notions of Canadianindependence; be so good as to explain the machinery of your engine,with which you seem very well acquainted."The man eyed my husband for a minute, half sulking, half pleased at theimplied compliment on his skill, and, walking off to the engine,discussed the management of it with considerable fluency, and from thattime treated us with perfect respect. He was evidently struck with myhusband's reply to his question, put in a most discourteous tone, "Pray,what makes a gentleman: I'll thank you to answer me that?" "Good mannersand good education," was the reply. "A rich man or a high-born man, ifhe is rude, ill-mannered, and ignorant, is no more a gentleman thanyourself."This put the matter on a different footing, and the engineer had thegood sense to perceive that rude familiarity did not constitute agentleman.But it is now time I should give you some account of Peterborough,which, in point of situation, is superior to any place I have yet seenin the Upper Province. It occupies a central point between the townshipsof Monaghan, Smith, Cavan, Otanabee, and Douro, and may with proprietybe considered as the capital of the Newcastle district.It is situated on a fine elevated plain, just above the small lake,where the river is divided by two low wooded islets. The original orgovernment part of the town is laid out in half-acre lots; the streets,which are now fast filling up, are nearly at right angles with theriver, and extend towards the plains to the northeast. These plains forma beautiful natural park, finely diversified with hill and dale, coveredwith a lovely green sward, enamelled with a variety of the mostexquisite flowers, and planted, as if by Nature's own hand, with groupsof feathery pines, oaks, balsam, poplar, and silver birch. The viewsfrom these plains are delightful; whichever way you turn your eyes theyare gratified by a diversity of hill and dale, wood and water, with thetown spreading over a considerable tract of ground.The plains descend with a steep declivity towards the river, whichrushes with considerable impetuosity between its banks. Fancy a long,narrow valley, and separating the east and west portions of the towninto two distinct villages.[Illustration: Spruce]The Otanabee bank rises to a loftier elevation than the Monaghan side,and commands an extensive view over the intervening valley, the oppositetown, and the boundary forest and hills behind it: this is calledPeterborough East, and is in the hands of two or three individuals oflarge capital, from whom the town lots are purchased.Peterborough thus divided covers a great extent of ground, more thansufficient for the formation of a large city. The number of inhabitantsare now reckoned at seven hundred and upwards, and if it continues toincrease as rapidly in the next few years as it has done lately, it willsoon be a very populous town*.[*Since this account of Peterborough was written, the town has increasedat least a third in buildings and population.]There is great water-power, both as regards the river and the fine broadcreek which winds its way through the town and falls into the small lakebelow. There are several saw and grist-mills, a distillery, fulling-mill, two principal inns, beside smaller ones, a number of good stores,a government school-house, which also serves for a church, till one moresuitable should be built. The plains are sold off in park lots, and somepretty little dwellings are being built, but I much fear the naturalbeauties of this lovely spot will be soon spoiled.I am never weary with strolling about, climbing the hills in everydirection, to catch some new prospect, or gather some new flowers,which, though getting late in the summer, are still abundant.Among the plants with whose names I am acquainted are a variety ofshrubby asters, of every tint of blue, purple, and pearly white; a lilac_monarda_, most delightfully aromatic, even to the dry stalks and seed-vessels; the white _gnaphalium_ or everlasting flower; roses of severalkinds, a few late buds of which I found in a valley, near the church. Ialso noticed among the shrubs a very pretty little plant, resembling ourbox; it trails along the ground, sending up branches and shoots; theleaves turn of a deep copper red*; yet, in spite of this contradiction,it is an evergreen. I also noticed some beautiful lichens, with coralcaps surmounting the grey hollow footstalks, which grow in irregulartufts among the dry mosses, or more frequently I found them covering theroots of the trees or half-decayed timbers. Among a variety of fungi Igathered a hollow cup of the most splendid scarlet within, and a palefawn colour without; another very beautiful fungi consisted of smallbranches like clusters of white coral, but of so delicate a texture thatthe slightest touch caused them to break.[* Probably a _Gaultkeria_.--Ed.]The ground in many places was covered with a thick carpet ofstrawberries of many varieties, which afford a constant dessert duringthe season to those who choose to pick them, a privilege of which I amsure I should gladly avail myself were I near them in the summer. Besidethe plants I have myself observed in blossom, I am told the spring andsummer produce many others;--the orange lily; the phlox, or purple_lichnidea_; the mocassin flower, or ladies' slipper; lilies of thevalley in abundance; and, towards the banks of the creek and theOtanabee, the splendid cardinal flower (_lobelia cardinalis_) waves itsscarlet spikes of blossoms.I am half inclined to be angry when I admire the beauty of the Canadianflowers, to be constantly reminded that they are scentless, andtherefore scarcely worthy of attention; as if the eye could not becharmed by beauty of form and harmony of colours, independent of thesense of smelling being gratified.To redeem this country from the censure cast on it by a very clevergentleman I once met in London, who said, "the flowers were withoutperfume, and the birds without song," I have already discovered severalhighly aromatic plants and flowers. The milkweed must not be omittedamong these; a beautiful shrubby plant with purple flowers, which arealike remarkable for beauty of colour and richness of scent.I shall very soon begin to collect a hortus siccus for Eliza, with adescription of the plants, growth, and qualities. Any strikingparticulars respecting them I shall make notes of; and tell her she maydepend on my sending my specimens, with seeds of such as I can collect,at some fitting opportunity.I consider this country opens a wide and fruitful field to the inquiriesof the botanist. I now deeply regret I did not benefit by the frequentoffers Eliza made me of prosecuting a study which I once thought dry,but now regard as highly interesting, and the fertile source of mentalenjoyment, especially to those who, living in the bush, must necessarilybe shut out from the pleasures of a large circle of friends, and thevarieties that a town or village offer.On Sunday I went to church; the first opportunity I had had of attendingpublic worship since I was in the Highlands of Scotland; and surely Ihad reason to bow my knees in thankfulness to that merciful God who hadbrought us through the perils of the great deep and the horrors of thepestilence.Never did our beautiful Liturgy seem so touching and impressive as itdid that day,--offered up in our lowly log-built church in thewilderness.This simple edifice is situated at the foot of a gentle slope on theplains, surrounded by groups of oak and feathery pines, which, thoughinferior in point of size to the huge pines and oaks of the forest, arefar more agreeable to the eye, branching out in a variety of fantasticforms. The turf here is of an emerald greenness: in short, it is a sweetspot, retired from the noise and bustle of the town, a fitting place inwhich to worship God in spirit and in truth.There are many beautiful walks towards the Smith town hills, and alongthe banks that overlook the river. The summit of this ridge is sterile,and is thickly set with loose blocks of red and grey granite,interspersed with large masses of limestone scattered in everydirection; they are mostly smooth and rounded, as if by the action ofwater. As they are detached, and merely occupy the surface of theground, it seemed strange to me how they came at that elevation. Ageologist would doubtless be able to solve the mystery in a few minutes.The oaks that grow on this high bank are rather larger and moreflourishing than those in the valleys and more fertile portions of thesoil.Behind the town, in the direction of the Cavan and Emily roads, is awide space which I call the "squatter's ground," it being entirelycovered with shanties, in which the poor emigrants, commuted pensioners,and the like, have located themselves and families. Some remain hereunder the ostensible reason of providing a shelter for their wives andchildren till they have prepared a home for their reception on theirrespective grants; but not unfrequently it happens that they are tooindolent, or really unable to work on their lots, often situated manymiles in the backwoods, and in distant and unsettled townships,presenting great obstacles to the poor emigrant, which it requires moreenergy and courage to encounter than is possessed by a vast number ofthem. Others, of idle and profligate habits, spend the money theyreceived, and sell the land, for which they gave away their pensions,after which they remain miserable squatters on the shanty ground.The shanty is a sort of primitive hut in Canadian architecture, and isnothing more than a shed built of logs, the chinks between the roundedges of the timbers being filled with mud, moss, and bits of wood; theroof is frequently composed of logs split and hollowed with the axe, andplaced side by side, so that the edges rest on each other; the concaveand convex surfaces being alternately uppermost, every other log forms achannel to carry off the rain and melting snow. The eaves of thisbuilding resemble the scolloped edges of a clam shell; but rude as thiscovering is, it effectually answers the purpose of keeping the interiordry; far more so than the roofs formed of bark or boards, through whichthe rain will find entrance. Sometimes the shanty has a window,sometimes only an open doorway, which admits the light and lets out thesmoke*. A rude chimney, which is often nothing better than an openingcut in one of the top logs above the hearth, a few boards fastened in asquare form, serves as the vent for the smoke; the only precautionagainst the fire catching the log walls behind the hearth being a fewlarge stones placed in a half circular form, or more commonly a bank ofdry earth raised against the wall.[* I was greatly amused by the remark made by a little Irish boy, thatwe hired to be our hewer of wood and drawer of water, who had been aninhabitant of one of these shanties. "Ma'am" said he, "when the weatherwas stinging cold, we did not know how to keep ourselves warm; for whilewe roasted our eyes out before the fire our backs were just freezing; sofirst we turned one side and then the other, just as you would roast a_guse_ on a spit. Mother spent half the money father earned at his strawwork (he was a straw chair maker,) in whiskey to keep us warm; but I dothink a larger mess of good hot _praters_ (potatoes,) would have kept uswarmer than the whiskey did."]Nothing can be more comfortless than some of these shanties, reekingwith smoke and dirt, the common receptacle for children, pigs, andfowls. But I have given you the dark side of the picture; I am happy tosay all the shanties on the squatters' ground were not like these: onthe contrary, by far the larger proportion were inhabited by tidy folks,and had one, or even two small windows, and a clay chimney regularlybuilt up through the roof; some were even roughly floored, and possessedsimilar comforts with the small log-houses.[Illustration: Log house]You will, perhaps, think it strange when I assure you that manyrespectable settlers, with their wives and families, persons delicatelynurtured, and accustomed to every comfort before they came hither, havebeen contented to inhabit a hut of this kind during the first or secondyear of their settlement in the woods.I have listened with feelings of great interest to the history of thehardships endured by some of the first settlers in the neighbourhood,when Peterborough contained but two dwelling houses. Then there wereneither roads cut nor boats built for communicating with the distant andsettled parts of the district; consequently the difficulties ofprocuring supplies of provisions was very great, beyond what any onethat has lately come hither can form any notion of.When I heard of a whole family having had no better supply of flour thanwhat could be daily ground by a small hand-mill, and for weeks beingdestitute of every necessary, not even excepting bread, I could not helpexpressing some surprise, never having met with any account in the worksI had read concerning emigration that at all prepared one for suchevils."These particular trials," observed my intelligent friend, "are confinedprincipally to the first breakers of the soil in the unsettled parts ofthe country, as was our case. If you diligently question some of thefamilies of the lower class that are located far from the towns, and whohad little or no means to support them during the first twelve months,till they could take a crop off the land, you will hear many sad talesof distress."Writers on emigration do not take the trouble of searching out thesethings, nor does it answer their purpose to state disagreeable facts.Few have written exclusively on the "Bush." Travellers generally make ahasty journey through the long settled and prosperous portions of thecountry; they see a tract of fertile, well-cultivated land, the resultof many years of labour; they see comfortable dwellings, abounding withall the substantial necessaries of life; the farmer's wife makes her ownsoap, candles, and sugar; the family are clothed in cloth of their ownspinning, and hose of their own knitting. The bread, the beer, butter,cheese, meat, poultry, &c. are all the produce of the farm. Heconcludes, therefore, that Canada is a land of Canaan, and writes a booksetting forth these advantages, with the addition of obtaining land fora mere song; and advises all persons who would be independent and securefrom want to emigrate.He forgets that these advantages are the result of long years ofunremitting and patient labour; that these things are the _crown_, notthe _first-fruits_ of the settler's toil; and that during the intervalmany and great privations must be submitted to by almost every class ofemigrants.Many persons, on first coming out, especially if they go back into anyof the unsettled townships, are dispirited by the unpromising appearanceof things about them. They find none of the advantages and comforts ofwhich they had heard and read, and they are unprepared for the presentdifficulties; some give way to despondency, and others quit the place indisgust.[Illustration: Log-Village--Arrival of a Stage-coach]A little reflection would have shown them that every rood of land mustbe cleared of the thick forest of timber that encumbers it before an earof wheat can be grown; that, after the trees have been chopped, cut intolengths, drawn together, or _logged_, as we call it, and burned, thefield must be fenced, the seed sown, harvested, and thrashed before anyreturns can be obtained; that this requires time and much labour, and,if hired labour, considerable outlay of ready money; and in the meantime a family must eat. If at a distance from a store, every articlemust be brought through bad roads either by hand or with a team, thehire of which is generally costly in proportion to the distance anddifficulty to be encountered in the conveyance. Now these things arebetter known beforehand, and then people are aware what they have toencounter.Even a labouring man, though he have land of his own, is often, I maysay generally, obliged to _hire out_ to work for the first year or two,to earn sufficient for the maintenance of his family; and even so manyof them suffer much privation before they reap the benefit of theirindependence. Were it not for the hope and the certain prospect ofbettering their condition ultimately, they would sink under what theyhave to endure; but this thought buoys them up. They do not fear an oldage of want and pauperism; the present evils must yield to industry andperseverance; they think also for their children; and the trials of thepresent time are lost in pleasing anticipations for the future."Surely," said I, "cows and pigs and poultry might be kept; and you knowwhere there is plenty of milk, butter, cheese, and eggs, with pork andfowls, persons cannot be very badly off for food.""Very true," replied my friend; "but I must tell you it is easier totalk of these things at first than to keep them, unless on cleared orpartially cleared farms; but we are speaking of a _first_ settlement inthe backwoods. Cows, pigs, and fowls must eat, and if you have nothingto give them unless you purchase it, and perhaps have to bring it fromsome distance, you had better not be troubled with them, as the troubleis certain and the profit doubtful. A cow, it is true, will get herliving during the open months of the year in the bush, but sometimes shewill ramble away for days together, and then you lose the use of her,and possibly much time in seeking her; then in the winter she requiressome additional food to the _browse_* that she gets during the choppingseason, or ten to one but she dies before spring; and as cows generallylose their milk during the cold weather, if not very well kept, it isbest to part with them in the fall and buy again in the spring, unlessyou have plenty of food for them, which is not often the case the firstwinter. As to pigs they are great plagues on a newly cleared farm if youcannot fat them off-hand; and that you cannot do without you buy foodfor them, which does not answer to do at first. If they run loose theyare a terrible annoyance both to your own crops and your neighbours ifyou happen to be within half a mile of one; for though you may fence outcattle you cannot pigs: even poultry require something more than theypick up about the dwelling to be of any service to you, and are oftentaken off by hawks, eagles, foxes, and pole-cats, till you have propersecurities for them."[* The cattle are supported in a great measure during the fall andwinter by eating the tender shoots of the maple, beech and bass, whichthey seek in the newly-chopped fallow; but they should likewise beallowed straw or other food, or they will die in the very hard weather.]"Then how are we to spin our own wool and make our own soap andcandles?" said I. "When you are able to kill your own sheep, and hogs,and oxen, unless you buy wool and tallow"--then, seeing me begin to looksomewhat disappointed, he said, "Be not cast down, you will have allthese things in time, and more than these, never fear, if you havepatience, and use the means of obtaining them. In the mean while prepareyour mind for many privations to which at present you are a stranger;and if you would desire to see your husband happy and prosperous, becontent to use economy, and above all, be cheerful. In a few years thefarm will supply you with all the necessaries of life, and by and by youmay even enjoy many of the luxuries. Then it is that a settler begins totaste the real and solid advantages of his emigration; then he feels theblessings of a country where there are no taxes, tithes, nor poor-rates;then he truly feels the benefit of independence. It is looking forwardto this happy fulfillment of his desires that makes the rough pathssmooth, and lightens the burden of present ills. He looks round upon anumerous family without those anxious fears that beset a father inmoderate circumstances at home; for he knows he does not leave themdestitute of an honest means of support."In spite of all the trials he had encountered, I found this gentlemanwas so much attached to a settler's life, that he declared he would notgo back to his own country to reside for a permanence on any account;nor is he the only one that I have heard express the same opinion; andit likewise seems a universal one among the lower class of emigrants.They are encouraged by the example of others whom they see enjoyingcomforts that they could never have obtained had they laboured ever sohard at home; and they wisely reflect they must have had hardships toendure had they remained in their native land (many indeed had beendriven out by want), without the most remote chance of betteringthemselves or becoming the possessors of land free from allrestrictions. "What to us are the sufferings of one, two, three, or evenfour years, compared with a whole life of labour and poverty," was theremark of a poor labourer, who was recounting to us the other day someof the hardships he had met with in this country. He said he "knew theywere only for a short time, and that by industry he should soon get overthem."I have already seen two of our poor neighbours that left the parish atwelvemonth ago; they are settled in Canada Company lots, and aregetting on well. They have some few acres cleared and cropped, but areobliged to "_hire out_", to enable their families to live, working ontheir own land when they can. The men are in good spirits, and say "theyshall in a few years have many comforts about them that they never couldhave got at home, had they worked late and early; but they complain thattheir wives are always pining for home, and lamenting that ever theycrossed the seas." This seems to be the general complaint with allclasses; the women are discontented and unhappy. Few enter with theirwhole heart into a settler's life. They miss the little domesticcomforts they had been used to enjoy; they regret the friends andrelations they left in the old country; and they cannot endure theloneliness of the backwoods.This prospect does not discourage me: I know I shall find plenty ofoccupation within-doors, and I have sources of enjoyment when I walkabroad that will keep me from being dull. Besides, have I not a right tobe cheerful and contented for the sake of my beloved partner? The changeis not greater for me than him; and if for his sake I have voluntarilyleft home, and friends, and country, shall I therefore sadden him byuseless regrets? I am always inclined to subscribe to that sentiment ofmy favourite poet, Goldsmith,--"Still to ourselves in every place consign'd,Our own felicity we make or find."But I shall very soon be put to the test, as we leave this town to-morrow by ten o'clock. The purchase of the Lake lot is concluded. Thereare three acres chopped and a shanty up; but the shanty is not ahabitable dwelling, being merely an open shed that was put up by thechoppers as a temporary shelter; so we shall have to build a house. Lateenough we are; too late to get in a full crop, as the land is merelychopped, not cleared, and it is too late now to log and burn the fallow,and get the seed-wheat in: but it will be ready for spring crops. Wepaid five dollars and a half per acre for the lot; this was rather highfor wild land, so far from a town, and in a scantily-settled part of thetownship; but the situation is good, and has a water frontage, for whichmy husband was willing to pay something more than if the lot had beenfurther inland.In all probability it will be some time before I find leisure again totake up my pen. We shall remain guests with ------ till our house is ina habitable condition, which I suppose will be about Christmas.LETTER VII.Journey from Peterborough.--Canadian Woods.--Waggon and Team.--Arrivalat a Log-house on the Banks of a Lake.--Settlement and firstOccupations.October 25, 1832.I SHALL begin my letter with a description of our journey through thebush, and so go on, giving an account of our proceedings both within-doors and with-out. I know my little domestic details will not provewholly uninteresting to you; for well I am assured that a mother's eyeis never weary with reading lines traced by the hand of an absent andbeloved child.After some difficulty we succeeded in hiring a waggon and span (i.e.pair abreast) of stout horses to convey us and our luggage through thewoods to the banks of one of the lakes, where S------ had appointed toferry us across. There was no palpable road, only a blaze on the otherside, encumbered by fallen trees, and interrupted by a great cedarswamp, into which one might sink up to one's knees, unless we took theprecaution to step along the trunks of the mossy, decaying timbers, ormake our footing sure on some friendly block of granite or limestone.What is termed in bush language a _blaze_, is nothing more than notchesor slices cut off the bark of the trees, to mark out the line of road.The boundaries of the different lots are often marked by a blazed tree,also the concession-lines*. These blazes are of as much use as finger-posts of a dark night.[* These concession-lines are certain divisions of the townships; theseare again divided into so many lots of 200 acres. The concession-linesused to be marked by a wide avenue being chopped, so as to form a roadof communication between them; but this plan was found too troublesome;and in a few years the young growth of timber so choked the opening,that it was of little use. The lately-surveyed townships, I believe, areonly divided by blazed lines.]The road we were compelled to take lay over the Peterborough plains, inthe direction of the river; the scenery of which pleased me much, thoughit presents little appearance of fertility, with the exception of two orthree extensive clearings.About three miles above Peterborough the road winds along the brow of asteep ridge, the bottom of which has every appearance of having beenformerly the bed of a lateral branch of the present river, or perhapssome small lake, which has been diverted from its channel, and merged inthe Otanabee.On either side of this ridge there is a steep descent; on the right theOtanabee breaks upon you, rushing with great velocity over its rockybed, forming rapids in miniature resembling those of the St. Laurence;its dark, frowning woods of sombre pine give a grandeur to the scenerythat is very impressive. On the left lies below you a sweet secludeddell of evergreens, cedar, hemlock, and pine, enlivened by a fewdeciduous trees. Through this dell there is a road-track leading to afine cleared farm, the green pastures of which were rendered morepleasing by the absence of the odious stumps that disfigure theclearings in this part of the country. A pretty bright stream flowsthrough the low meadow that lies at the foot of the hill, which youdescend suddenly close by a small grist-mill that is worked by thewaters, just where they meet the rapids of the river.[Illustration: Road through a Pine Forest]I called this place "Glen Morrison," partly from the remembrance of thelovely Glen Morrison of the Highlands, and partly because it was thename of the settler that owned the spot.Our progress was but slow on account of the roughness of the road, whichis beset with innumerable obstacles in the shape of loose blocks ofgranite and limestone, with which the lands on the banks of the riverand lakes abound; to say nothing of fallen trees, big roots, mud-holes,and corduroy bridges, over which you go jolt, jolt, jolt, till everybone in your body feels as if it were going to be dislocated. Anexperienced bush-traveller avoids many hard thumps by rising up orclinging to the sides of his rough vehicle.As the day was particularly fine, I often quitted the waggon and walkedon with my husband for a mile or so.We soon lost sight entirely of the river, and struck into the deepsolitude of the forest, where not a sound disturbed the almost awfulstillness that reigned around us. Scarcely a leaf or bough was inmotion, excepting at intervals we caught the sound of the breezestirring the lofty heads of the pine-trees, and wakening a hoarse andmournful cadence. This, with the tapping of the red-headed and greywoodpeckers on the trunk of the decaying trees, or the shrill whistlingcry of the little striped squirrel, called by the natives "chitmunk,"was every sound that broke the stillness of the wild. Nor was I lesssurprised at the absence of animal life. With the exception of theaforesaid chitmunk, no living thing crossed our path during our longday's journey in the woods.In these vast solitudes one would naturally be led to imagine that theabsence of man would have allowed Nature's wild denizens to haveabounded free and unmolested; but the contrary seems to be the case.Almost all wild animals are more abundant in the cleared districts thanin the bush. Man's industry supplies their wants at an easier rate thanseeking a scanty subsistence in the forest.You hear continually of depredations committed by wolves, bears,racoons, lynxes, and foxes, in the long-settled parts of the province.In the backwoods the appearance of wild beasts is a matter of much rareroccurrence.I was disappointed in the forest trees, having pictured to myself hoarygiants almost primeval with the country itself, as greatly exceeding inmajesty of form the trees of my native isles, as the vast lakes andmighty rivers of Canada exceed the locks and streams of Britain.There is a want of picturesque beauty in the woods. The young growth oftimber alone has any pretension of elegance of form, unless I except thehemlocks, which are extremely light and graceful, and of a lovelyrefreshing tint of green. Even when winter has stripped the forest it isstill beautiful and verdant. The young beeches too are pretty enough,but you miss that fantastic bowery shade that is so delightful in ourparks and woodlands at home.There is no appearance of venerable antiquity in the Canadian woods.There are no ancient spreading oaks that might be called the patriarchsof the forest. A premature decay seems to be their doom. They areuprooted by the storm, and sink in their first maturity, to give placeto a new generation that is ready to fill their places.The pines are certainly the finest trees. In point of size there arenone to surpass them. They tower above all the others, forming a darkline that may be distinguished for many miles. The pines being so muchloftier than the other trees, are sooner uprooted, as they receive thefull and unbroken force of the wind in their tops; thus it is that theground is continually strewn with the decaying trunks of huge pines.They also seem more liable to inward decay, and blasting from lightning,and fire. Dead pines are more frequently met with than any other tree.Much as I had seen and heard of the badness of the roads in Canada, Iwas not prepared for such a one as we travelled along this day: indeed,it hardly deserved the name of a road, being little more than an openinghewed out through the woods, the trees being felled and drawn aside, soas to admit a wheeled carriage passing along.The swamps and little forest streams, that occasionally gush across thepath, are rendered passable by logs placed side by side. From the ridgyand striped appearance of these bridges they are aptly enough termedcorduroy.Over these abominable corduroys the vehicle jolts, jumping from log tolog, with a shock that must be endured with as good a grace as possible.If you could bear these knocks, and pitiless thumpings and bumpings,without wry faces, your patience and philosophy would far exceed mine;--sometimes I laughed because I would not cry.Imagine you see me perched up on a seat composed of carpet-bags, trunks,and sundry packages, in a vehicle little better than a great rough dealbox set on wheels, the sides being merely pegged in so that more thanonce I found myself in rather an awkward predicament, owing to the saidsides jumping out. In the very midst of a deep mud-hole out went thefront board, and with the shock went the teamster (driver), who lookedrather confounded at finding himself lodged just in the middle of aslough as bad as the "Slough of Despond." For my part, as I could do nogood, I kept my seat, and patiently awaited the restoration to order.This was soon effected, and all went on well again till a jolt against ahuge pine-tree gave such a jar to the ill-set vehicle, that one of theboards danced out that composed the bottom, and a sack of flour and bagof salted pork, which was on its way to a settler's, whose clearing wehad to pass in the way, were ejected. A good teamster is seldom takenaback by such trifles as these.He is, or should be, provided with an axe. No waggon, team, or any othertravelling equipage should be unprovided with an instrument of thiskind; as no one can answer for the obstacles that may impede hisprogress in the bush. The disasters we met fortunately required butlittle skill in remedying. The sides need only a stout peg, and theloosened planks that form the bottom being quickly replaced, away you goagain over root, stump, and stone, mud-hole, and corduroy; now againstthe trunk of some standing tree, now mounting over some fallen one, withan impulse that would annihilate any lighter equipage than a Canadianwaggon, which is admirably fitted by its very roughness for such roadsas we have in the bush.The sagacity of the horses of this country is truly admirable. Theirpatience in surmounting the difficulties they have to encounter, theirskill in avoiding the holes and stones, and in making their footing sureover the round and slippery timbers of the log-bridges, renders themvery valuable. If they want the spirit and fleetness of some of ourhigh-bred blood-horses, they make up in gentleness, strength, andpatience. This renders them most truly valuable, as they will travel insuch places that no British horse would, with equal safety to theirdrivers. Nor are the Canadian horses, when well fed and groomed, at alldeficient in beauty of colour, size, or form. They are not very oftenused in logging; the ox is preferred in all rough and heavy labour ofthis kind.Just as the increasing gloom of the forest began to warn us of theapproach of evening, and I was getting weary and hungry, our driver, insome confusion, avowed his belief that, somehow or other, he had missedthe track, though how, he could not tell, seeing there was but one road.We were nearly two miles from the last settlement, and he said we oughtto be within sight of the lake if we were on the right road. The onlyplan, we agreed, was for him to go forward and leave the team, andendeavour to ascertain if he were near the water, and if otherwise, toreturn to the house we had passed and inquire the way.After running full half a mile ahead he returned with a dejectedcountenance, saying we must be wrong, for he saw no appearance of water,and the road we were on appeared to end in a cedar swamp, as the fartherhe went the thicker the hemlocks and cedars became; so, as we had nodesire to commence our settlement by a night's lodging in a swamp--where, to use the expression of our driver, the cedars grew as thick ashairs on a cat's back,--we agreed to retrace our steps.After some difficulty the lumbering machine was turned, and slowly webegan our backward march. We had not gone more than a mile when a boycame along, who told us we might just go back again, as there was noother road to the lake; and added, with a knowing nod of his head,"Master, I guess if you had known the bush as well as I, you would neverhave been _fule_ enough to turn when you were going just right. Why, anybody knows that _them_ cedars and himlocks grow thickest near the water;so you may just go back for your pains."It was dark, save that the stars came forth with more than usualbrilliancy, when we suddenly emerged from the depth of the gloomy forestto the shores of a beautiful little lake, that gleamed the more brightlyfrom the contrast of the dark masses of foliage that hung over it, andthe towering pine-woods that girt its banks.Here, seated on a huge block of limestone, which was covered with a softcushion of moss, beneath the shade of the cedars that skirt the lake,surrounded with trunks, boxes, and packages of various descriptions,which the driver had hastily thrown from the waggon, sat your child, inanxious expectation of some answering voice to my husband's long andrepeated halloo.But when the echo of his voice had died away we heard only the gurglingof the waters at the head of the rapids, and the distant and hoarsemurmur of a waterfall some half mile below them.We could see no sign of any habitation, no gleam of light from the shoreto cheer us. In vain we strained our ears for the plash of the oar, orwelcome sound of the human voice, or bark of some household dog, thatmight assure us we were not doomed to pass the night in the lone wood.We began now to apprehend we had really lost the way. To attemptreturning through the deepening darkness of the forest in search of anyone to guide us was quite out of the question, the road being so illdefined that we should soon have been lost in the mazes of the woods.The last sound of the waggon wheels had died away in the distance; tohave overtaken it would have been impossible. Bidding me remain quietlywhere I was, my husband forced his way through the tangled underwoodalong the bank, in hope of discovering some sign of the house we sought,which we had every reason to suppose must be near, though probablyhidden by the dense mass of trees from our sight.As I sat in the wood in silence and in darkness, my thoughts graduallywandered back across the Atlantic to my dear mother and to my old home;and I thought what would have been your feelings could you at thatmoment have beheld me as I sat on the cold mossy stone in the profoundstillness of that vast leafy wilderness, thousands of miles from allthose holy ties of kindred and early associations that make home in allcountries a hallowed spot. It was a moment to press upon my mind theimportance of the step I had taken, in voluntarily sharing the lot ofthe emigrant--in leaving the land of my birth, to which, in allprobability, I might never again return. Great as was the sacrifice,even at that moment, strange as was my situation, I felt no painfulregret or fearful misgiving depress my mind. A holy and tranquil peacecame down upon me, soothing and softening my spirits into a calmnessthat seemed as unruffled as was the bosom of the water that laystretched out before my feet.My reverie was broken by the light plash of a paddle, and a bright lineof light showed a canoe dancing over the lake: in a few minutes a well-known and friendly voice greeted me as the little bark was moored amongthe cedars at my feet. My husband having gained a projecting angle ofthe shore, had discovered the welcome blaze of the wood fire in the log-house, and, after some difficulty, had succeeded in rousing theattention of its inhabitants. Our coming that day had long been givenup, and our first call had been mistaken for the sound of the ox-bellsin the wood: this had caused the delay that had so embarrassed us.We soon forgot our weary wanderings beside the bright fire that blazedon the hearth of the log-house, in which we found S------ comfortablydomiciled with his wife. To the lady I was duly introduced; and, inspite of all remonstrances from the affectionate and careful mother,three fair sleeping children were successively handed out of their cribsto be shown me by the proud and delighted father.Our welcome was given with that unaffected cordiality that is sograteful to the heart: it was as sincere as it was kind. All means wereadopted to soften the roughness of our accommodation, which, if theylacked that elegance and convenience to which we had been accustomed inEngland, were not devoid of rustic comfort; at all events they were suchas many settlers of the first respectability have been glad to contentthemselves with, and many have not been half so well lodged as we noware.We may indeed consider ourselves fortunate in not being obliged to go atonce into the rude shanty that I described to you as the only habitationon our land. This test of our fortitude was kindly spared us by S------,who insisted on our remaining beneath his hospitable roof till such timeas we should have put up a house on our own lot. Here then we are forthe present _fixed_, as the Canadians say; and if I miss many of thelittle comforts and luxuries of life, I enjoy excellent health andspirits, and am very happy in the society of those around me.The children are already very fond of me. They have discovered mypassion for flowers, which they diligently search for among the stumpsand along the lake shore. I have begun collecting, and though the seasonis far advanced, my hortus siccus boasts of several elegant specimens offern; the yellow Canadian violet, which blooms twice in the year, in thespring and fall, as the autumnal season is expressively termed; twosorts of Michaelmas daisies, as we call the shrubby asters, of which thevarieties here are truly elegant; and a wreath of the festoon pine, apretty evergreen with creeping stalks, that run along the ground threeor four yards in length, sending up, at the distance of five or sixinches, erect, stiff, green stems, resembling some of our heaths in thedark, shining, green, chaffy leaves. The Americans ornament theirchimney-glasses with garlands of this plant, mixed with the driedblossoms of the life-everlasting (the pretty white and yellow flowers wecall love-everlasting): this plant is also called festoon-pine. In myrambles in the wood near the house I have discovered a trailing plantbearing a near resemblance to the cedar, which I consider has, withequal propriety, a claim to the name of ground or creeping cedar.As much of the botany of these unsettled portions of the country areunknown to the naturalist, and the plants are quite nameless, I take theliberty of bestowing names upon them according to inclination or fancy.But while I am writing about flowers I am forgetting that you will bemore interested in hearing what steps we are taking on our land.My husband has hired people to log up (that is, to draw the choppedtimbers into heaps for burning) and clear a space for building our houseupon. He has also entered into an agreement with a young settler in ourvicinity to complete it for a certain sum within and without, accordingto a given plan. We are, however, to call the "bee," and provide everything necessary for the entertainment of our worthy _hive_. Now you knowthat a "bee," in American language, or rather phraseology, signifiesthose friendly meetings of neighbours who assemble at your summons toraise the walls of your house, shanty, barn, or any other building: thisis termed a "raising bee." Then there are logging-bees, husking-bees,chopping-bees, and quilting-bees. The nature of the work to be donegives the name to the bee. In the more populous and long-settleddistricts this practice is much discontinued, but it is highly useful,and almost indispensable to the new settlers in the remote townships,where the price of labour is proportionably high, and workmen difficultto be procured.Imagine the situation of an emigrant with a wife and young family, thelatter possibly too young and helpless to render him the leastassistance in the important business of chopping, logging, and building,on their first coming out to take possession of a lot of wild land; howdeplorable would their situation be, unless they could receive quick andready help from those around them.This laudable practice has grown out of necessity, and if it has itsdisadvantages, such for instance as being called upon at an inconvenientseason for a return of help, by those who have formerly assisted you,yet it is so indispensable to you that the debt of gratitude ought to becheerfully repaid. It is, in fact, regarded in the light of a debt ofhonour; you cannot be forced to attend a bee in return, but no one thatcan does refuse, unless from urgent reasons; and if you do not find itpossible to attend in person you may send a substitute in a servant orin cattle, if you have a yoke.In no situation, and under no other circumstance, does the equalizingsystem of America appear to such advantage as in meetings of this sort.All distinctions of rank, education, and wealth are for the timevoluntarily laid aside. You will see the son of the educated gentlemanand that of the poor artisan, the officer and the private soldier, theindependent settler and the labourer who works out for hire, cheerfullyuniting in one common cause. Each individual is actuated by thebenevolent desire of affording help to the helpless, and exertinghimself to raise a home for the homeless.At present so small a portion of the forest is cleared on our lot, thatI can give you little or no description of the spot on which we arelocated, otherwise than that it borders on a fine expanse of water,which forms one of the Otanabee chain of Small Lake. I hope, however, togive you a more minute description of our situation in my next letter.For the present, then, I bid you adieu.LETTER VIII.Inconveniences of first Settlement.--Difficulty of obtaining Provisionsand other necessaries.--Snow-storm and Hurricane.--Indian Summer, andsetting-in of Winter.--Process of clearing the Land.November the 20th, 1832.OUR log-house is not yet finished, though it is in a state offorwardness. We are still indebted to the hospitable kindness of S------and his wife for a home. This being their first settlement on their landthey have as yet many difficulties, in common with all residents in thebackwoods, to put up with this year. They have a fine block of land,well situated; and S------ laughs at the present privations, to which heopposes a spirit of cheerfulness and energy that is admirably calculatedto effect their conquest. They are now about to remove to a larger andmore commodious house that has been put up this fall, leaving us the useof the old one till our own is ready.We begin to get reconciled to our Robinson Crusoe sort of life, and theconsideration that the present evils are but temporary, goes a great waytowards reconciling us to them.One of our greatest inconveniences arises from the badness of our roads,and the distance at which we are placed from any village or town whereprovisions are to be procured.Till we raise our own grain and fatten our own hogs, sheep, and poultry,we must be dependent upon the stores for food of every kind. Thesesupplies have to be brought up at considerable expense and loss of time,through our beautiful bush roads; which, to use the words of a poorIrish woman, "can't be no worser." "Och, darlint," she said, "but theyare just bad enough, and can't be no worser. Och, but they aren't liketo our iligant roads in Ireland."You may send down a list of groceries to be forwarded when a team comesup, and when we examine our stores, behold rice, sugar, currants,pepper, and mustard all jumbled into one mess. What think you of a rice-pudding seasoned plentifully with pepper, mustard, and, may be, a littlerappee or prince's mixture added by way of sauce. I think the recipewould cut quite a figure in the Cook's Oracle or Mrs. Dalgairn'sPractice of Cookery, under the original title of a "bush pudding."And then woe and destruction to the brittle ware that may chance totravel through our roads. Lucky, indeed, are we if, through the superiorcarefulness of the person who packs them, more than one-half happens toarrive in safety. For such mishaps we have no redress. The storekeeperlays the accident upon the teamster, and the teamster upon the badroads, wondering that he himself escapes with whole bones after ajourney through the bush.This is now the worst season of the year;--this, and just after thebreaking up of the snow. Nothing hardly but an ox-cart can travel alongthe roads, and even that with difficulty, occupying two days to performthe journey; and the worst of the matters is, that there are times whenthe most necessary articles of provisions are not to be procured at anyprice. You see, then, that a settler in the bush requires to holdhimself pretty independent, not only of the luxuries and delicacies ofthe table, but not unfrequently even of the very necessaries.One time no pork is to be procured; another time there is a scarcity offlour, owing to some accident that has happened to the mill, or for thewant of proper supplies of wheat for grinding; or perhaps the weatherand bad roads at the same time prevent a team coming up, or people fromgoing down. Then you must have recourse to a neighbour, if you have thegood fortune to be near one, or fare the best you can on potatoes. Thepotatoe is indeed a great blessing here; new settlers would otherwise beoften greatly distressed, and the poor man and his family who arewithout resources, without the potatoe must starve.Once our stock of tea was exhausted, and we were unable to procure more.In this dilemma milk would have been an excellent substitute, or coffee,if we had possessed it; but we had neither the one nor the other, so weagreed to try the Yankee tea--hemlock sprigs boiled. This proved, to mytaste, a vile decoction; though I recognized some herb in the tea thatwas sold in London at five shillings a pound, which I am certain wasnothing better than dried hemlock leaves reduced to a coarse powder.S------ laughed at our wry faces, declaring the potation was excellent;and he set us all an example by drinking six cups of this truly sylvanbeverage. His eloquence failed in gaining a single convert; we could notbelieve it was only second to young hyson. To his assurance that to itsother good qualities it united medicinal virtues, we replied that, likeall other physic, it was very unpalatable."After all," said S------, with a thoughtful air, "the blessings and theevils of this life owe their chief effect to the force of contrast, andare to be estimated by that principally. We should not appreciate thecomforts we enjoy half so much did we not occasionally feel the want ofthem. How we shall value the conveniences of a cleared farm after a fewyears, when we can realize all the necessaries and many of the luxuriesof life.""And how we shall enjoy green tea after this odious decoction ofhemlock," said I."Very true; and a comfortable frame-house, and nice garden, and pleasantpastures, after these dark forests, log-houses, and no garden at all.""And the absence of horrid black stumps," rejoined I. "Yes, and theabsence of horrid stumps. Depend upon it, my dear, your Canadian farmwill seem to you a perfect paradise by the time it is all undercultivation; and you will look upon it with the more pleasure and pridefrom the consciousness that it was once a forest wild, which, by theeffects of industry and well applied means, has changed to fruitfulfields. Every fresh comfort you realize around you will add to yourhappiness; every improvement within-doors or without will raise asensation of gratitude and delight in your mind, to which those thatrevel in the habitual enjoyment of luxury, and even of the commonestadvantages of civilization, must in a great degree be strangers. Mypass-words are, 'Hope! Resolution! and Perseverance!'""This," said my husband, "is true philosophy; and the more forcible,because you not only recommend the maxim but practise it also."I had reckoned much on the Indian summer, of which I had read suchdelightful descriptions, but I must say it has fallen far below myexpectations. Just at the commencement of this month (November) weexperienced three or four warm hazy days, that proved rather close andoppressive. The sun looked red through the misty atmosphere, tinging thefantastic clouds that hung in smoky volumes, with saffron and palecrimson light, much as I have seen the clouds above London look on awarm, sultry spring morning.Not a breeze ruffled the waters, not a leaf (for the leaves had notentirely fallen) moved. This perfect stagnation of the air was suddenlychanged by a hurricane of wind and snow that came on without anyprevious warning. I was standing near a group of tall pines that hadbeen left in the middle of the clearing, collecting some beautifulcrimson lichens, S------ not being many paces distant, with his oxendrawing fire-wood. Suddenly we heard a distant hollow rushing sound thatmomentarily increased, the air around us being yet perfectly calm. Ilooked up, and beheld the clouds, hitherto so motionless, moving withamazing rapidity in several different directions. A dense gloomoverspread the heavens. S------, who had been busily engaged with thecattle, had not noticed my being so near, and now called to me to useall the speed I could to gain the house, or an open part of theclearing, distant from the pine-trees. Instinctively I turned towardsthe house, while the thundering shock of trees falling in all directionsat the edge of the forest, the rending of the branches from the pines Ihad just quitted, and the rush of the whirlwind sweeping down the lake,made me sensible of the danger with which I had been threatened.The scattered boughs of the pines darkened the air as they whirled aboveme; then came the blinding snow-storm: but I could behold the progressof the tempest in safety, having gained the threshold of our house. Thedriver of the oxen had thrown himself on the ground, while the poorbeasts held down their meek heads, patiently abiding "the pelting of thepitiless storm." S------, my husband, and the rest of the household,collected in a group, watched with anxiety the wild havoc of the warringelements. Not a leaf remained on the trees when the hurricane was over;they were bare and desolate. Thus ended the short reign of the Indiansummer.[Illustration: Newly-cleared Land]I think the notion entertained by some travellers, that the Indiansummer is caused by the annual conflagration of forests by those Indiansinhabiting the unexplored regions beyond the larger lakes is absurd.Imagine for an instant what immense tracts of woods must be yearlyconsumed to affect nearly the whole of the continent of North America:besides, it takes place at that season of the year when the fire isleast likely to run freely, owing to the humidity of the ground from theautumnal rains. I should rather attribute the peculiar warmth and hazyappearance of the air that marks this season, to the fermentation goingon of so great a mass of vegetable matter that is undergoing a state ofdecomposition during the latter part of October and beginning ofNovember. It has been supposed by some persons that a great alterationwill be effected in this season, as the process of clearing the landcontinues to decrease the quantity of decaying vegetation. Nay, I haveheard the difference is already observable by those long acquainted withthe American continent.Hitherto my experience of the climate is favourable. The autumn has beenvery fine, though the frosts are felt early in the month of September;at first slightly, of a morning, but towards October more severely.Still, though the first part of the day is cold, the middle of it iswarm and cheerful.We already see the stern advances of winter. It commenced very decidedlyfrom the breaking up of the Indian summer. November is not at all likethe same month at home. The early part was soft and warm, the lattercold, with keen frosts and occasional falls of snow; but it does notseem to possess the dark, gloomy, damp character of our BritishNovembers. However, it is not one season's acquaintance with the climatethat enables a person to form any correct judgment of its generalcharacter, but a close observance of its peculiarities and vicissitudesduring many years' residence in the country.I must now tell you what my husband is doing on our land. He has let outten acres to some Irish choppers who have established themselves in theshanty for the winter. They are to receive fourteen dollars per acre forchopping, burning, and fencing in that quantity. The ground is to beperfectly cleared of every thing but the stumps: these will take fromseven to nine or ten years to decay; the pine, hemlock, and fir remainmuch longer. The process of clearing away the stumps is too expensivefor new beginners to venture upon, labour being so high that it cannotbe appropriated to any but indispensable work. The working season isvery short on account of the length of time the frost remains on theground. With the exception of chopping trees, very little can be done.Those that understand the proper management of uncleared land, usuallyunderbrush (that is, cut down all the small timbers and brushwood),while the leaf is yet on them; this is piled in heaps, and thewindfallen trees are chopped through in lengths, to be logged up in thespring with the winter's chopping. The latter end of the summer and theautumn are the best seasons for this work. The leaves then become quitedry and sear, and greatly assist in the important business of burningoff the heavy timbers. Another reason is, that when the snow has fallento some depth, the light timbers cannot be cut close to the ground, orthe dead branches and other incumbrances collected and thrown in heaps.We shall have about three acres ready for spring-crops, provided we geta good burning of that which is already chopped near the site of thehouse,--this will be sown with oats, pumpkins, Indian corn, andpotatoes: the other ten acres will be ready for putting in a crop ofwheat. So you see it will be a long time before we reap a harvest. Wecould not even get in spring-wheat early enough to come to perfectionthis year.We shall try to get two cows in the spring, as they are little expenseduring the spring, summer, and autumn; and by the winter we shall havepumpkins and oat-straw for them.LETTER IX.Loss of a yoke of Oxen.--Construction of a Log-house.--Glaziers' andCarpenters' work.--Description of new Log-house.--Wild Fruits of theCountry.--Walks on the Ice.--Situation of the House.--Lake, andsurrounding Scenery.Lake HouseApril 18, 1833BUT it is time that I should give you some account of our log-house,into which we moved a few days before Christmas. Many unlooked-fordelays having hindered its completion before that time, I began to thinkit would never be habitable.The first misfortune that happened was the loss of a fine yoke of oxenthat were purchased to draw in the house-logs, that is, the logs forraising the walls of the house. Not regarding the bush as pleasant astheir former master's cleared pastures, or perhaps foreseeing some hardwork to come, early one morning they took into their heads to ford thelake at the head of the rapids, and march off, leaving no trace of theirroute excepting their footing at the water's edge. After many days spentin vain search for them, the work was at a stand, and for one month theywere gone, and we began to give up all expectation of hearing any newsof them. At last we learned they were some twenty miles off, in adistant township, having made their way through bush and swamp, creekand lake, back to their former owner, with an instinct that supplied tothem the want of roads and compass.Oxen have been known to traverse a tract of wild country to a distanceof thirty or forty miles going in a direct line for their former hauntsby unknown paths, where memory could not avail them. In the dog weconsider it is scent as well as memory that guides him to his far-offhome;--but how is this conduct of the oxen to be accounted for? Theyreturned home through the mazes of interminable forests, where man, withall his reason and knowledge, would have been bewildered and lost.It was the latter end of October before even the walls of our house wereup. To effect this we called "a bee." Sixteen of our neighbourscheerfully obeyed our summons; and though the day was far fromfavourable, so faithfully did our hive perform their tasks, that bynight the outer walls were raised.The work went merrily on with the help of plenty of Canadian nectar(whiskey), the honey that our _bees_ are solaced with. Some huge jointsof salt pork, a peck of potatoes, with a rice-pudding, and a loaf as bigas an enormous Cheshire cheese, formed the feast that was to regale themduring the raising. This was spread out in the shanty, in a _very ruralstyle_. In short, we laughed, and called it a _pic-nic in thebackwoods_; and rude as was the fare, I can assure you, great was thesatisfaction expressed by all the guests of every degree, our "_bee_"being considered as very well conducted. In spite of the difference ofrank among those that assisted at the bee, the greatest possible harmonyprevailed, and the party separated well pleased with the day's work andentertainment.The following day I went to survey the newly-raised edifice, but wassorely puzzled, as it presented very little appearance of a house. Itwas merely an oblong square of logs raised one above the other, withopen spaces between every row of logs. The spaces for the doors andwindows were not then chopped out, and the rafters were not up. Inshort, it looked a very queer sort of a place, and I returned home alittle disappointed, and wondering that my husband should be so wellpleased with the progress that had been made. A day or two after this Iagain visited it. The _sleepers_ were laid to support the floors, andthe places for the doors and windows cut out of the solid timbers, sothat it had not quite so much the look of a bird-cage as before.After the roof was shingled, we were again at a stand, as no boardscould be procured nearer than Peterborough, a long day's journey throughhorrible roads. At that time no saw-mill was in progress; now there is afine one building within a little distance of us. Our flooring-boardswere all to be sawn by hand, and it was some time before any one couldbe found to perform this necessary work, and that at high wages--six-and-sixpence per day. Well, the boards were at length down, but ofcourse of unseasoned timber: this was unavoidable; so as they could notbe planed we were obliged to put up with their rough unsightlyappearance, for no better were to be had. I began to recall to mind theobservation of the old gentleman with whom we travelled from Cobourg toRice Lake. We console ourselves with the prospect that by next summerthe boards will all be seasoned, and then the house is to be turnedtopsy-turvy, by having the floors all relaid, jointed, and smoothed.The next misfortune that happened, was, that the mixture of clay andlime that was to plaster the inside and outside of the house between thechinks of the logs was one night frozen to stone. Just as the work wasabout half completed, the frost suddenly setting in, put a stop to ourproceeding for some time, as the frozen plaster yielded neither to firenor to hot water, the latter freezing before it had any effect on themass, and rather making bad worse. Then the workman that was hewing theinside walls to make them smooth, wounded himself with the broad axe,and was unable to resume his work for some time.I state these things merely to show the difficulties that attend us inthe fulfilment of our plans, and this accounts in a great measure forthe humble dwellings that settlers of the most respectable descriptionare obliged to content themselves with at first coming to this country,--not, you may be assured, from inclination, but necessity: I could giveyou such narratives of this kind as would astonish you. After all, itserves to make us more satisfied than we should be on casting our eyesaround to see few better off than we are, and many not half socomfortable, yet of equal, and, in some instances, superior pretensionsas to station and fortune.Every man in this country is his own glazier; this you will laugh at:but if he does not wish to see and feel the discomfort of broken panes,he must learn to put them in his windows with his own hands. Workmen arenot easily to be had in the backwoods when you want them, and it wouldbe preposterous to hire a man at high wages to make two days' journey toand from the nearest town to mend your windows. Boxes of glass ofseveral different sizes are to be bought at a very cheap rate in thestores. My husband amused himself by glazing the windows of the housepreparatory to their being fixed in.To understand the use of carpenter's tools, I assure you, is nodespicable or useless kind of knowledge here. I would strongly recommendall young men coming to Canada to acquire a little acquaintance withthis valuable art, as they will often be put to great inconvenience forthe want of it.I was once much amused with hearing the remarks made by a very finelady, the reluctant sharer of her husband's emigration, on seeing theson of a naval officer of some rank in the service busily employed inmaking an axe-handle out of a piece of rock-elm."I wonder that you allow George to degrade himself so," she said,addressing his father.The captain looked up with surprise. "Degrade himself! In what manner,madam? My boy neither swears, drinks whiskey, steals, nor tells lies.""But you allow him to perform tasks of the most menial kind. What is henow better than a hedge carpenter; and I suppose you allow him to chop,too?""Most assuredly I do. That pile of logs in the cart there was all cut byhim after he had left study yesterday," was the reply,"I would see my boys dead before they should use an axe like commonlabourers.""Idleness is the root of all evil," said the captain. "How much worsemight my son be employed if he were running wild about streets with badcompanions.""You will allow this is not a country for gentlemen or ladies to livein," said the lady."It is the country for gentlemen that will not work and cannot livewithout, to starve in," replied the captain bluntly; "and for thatreason I make my boys early accustom themselves to be usefully andactively employed.""My boys shall never work like common mechanics," said the lady,indignantly."Then, madam, they will be good for nothing as settlers; and it is apity you dragged them across the Atlantic.""We were forced to come. We could not live as we had been used to do athome, or I never would have come to this horrid country.""Having come hither you would be wise to conform to circumstances.Canada is not the place for idle folks to retrench a lost fortune in. Insome parts of the country you will find most articles of provision asdear as in London, clothing much dearer, and not so good, and a badmarket to choose in.""I should like to know, then, who Canada is good for?" said she,angrily."It is a good country for the honest, industrious artisan. It is a finecountry for the poor labourer, who, after a few years of hard toil, cansit down in his own log-house, and look abroad on his own land, and seehis children well settled in life as independent freeholders. It is agrand country for the rich speculator, who can afford to lay out a largesum in purchasing land in eligible situations; for if he have anyjudgment, he will make a hundred per cent as interest for his moneyafter waiting a few years. But it is a hard country for the poorgentleman, whose habits have rendered him unfit for manual labour. Hebrings with him a mind unfitted to his situation; and even if necessitycompels him to exertion, his labour is of little value. He has a hardstruggle to live. The certain expenses of wages and living are great,and he is obliged to endure many privations if he would keep withincompass, and be free of debt. If he have a large family, and brings themup wisely, so as to adapt themselves early to a settler's life, why hedoes well for them, and soon feels the benefit on his own land; but ifhe is idle himself, his wife extravagant and discontented, and thechildren taught to despise labour, why, madam, they will soon be broughtdown to ruin. In short, the country is a good country for those to whomit is adapted; but if people will not conform to the doctrine ofnecessity and expediency, they have no business in it. It is plainCanada is not adapted to every class of people.""It was never adapted for me or my family," said the lady, disdainfully."Very true," was the laconic reply; and so ended the dialogue.But while I have been recounting these remarks, I have wandered far frommy original subject, and left my poor log-house quite in an unfinishedstate. At last I was told it was in a habitable condition, and I wassoon engaged in all the bustle and fatigue attendant on removing ourhousehold goods. We received all the assistance we required from ------,who is ever ready and willing to help us. He laughed, and called it a"_moving_ bee;" I said it was a "fixing bee;" and my husband said it wasa "settling bee;" I know we were unsettled enough till it was over. Whata din of desolation is a small house, or any house under suchcircumstances. The idea of chaos must have been taken from a removal ora setting to rights, for I suppose the ancients had their _flitting_, asthe Scotch call it, as well as the moderns.Various were the valuable articles of crockery-ware that perished intheir short but rough journey through the woods. Peace to their manes. Ihad a good helper in my Irish maid, who soon roused up famous fires, andset the house in order.We have now got quite comfortably settled, and I shall give you adescription of our little dwelling. What is finished is only a part ofthe original plan; the rest must be added next spring, or fall, ascircumstances may suit.A nice small sitting-room with a store closet, a kitchen, pantry, andbed-chamber form the ground floor; there is a good upper floor that willmake three sleeping rooms."What a nut-shell!" I think I hear you exclaim. So it is at present; butwe purpose adding a handsome frame front as soon as we can get boardsfrom the mill, which will give us another parlour, long hall, and goodspare bed-room. The windows and glass door of our present sitting-roomcommand pleasant lake-views to the west and south. When the house iscompleted, we shall have a verandah in front; and at the south side,which forms an agreeable addition in the summer, being used as a sort ofouter room, in which we can dine, and have the advantage of cool air,protected from the glare of the sunbeams. The Canadians call theseverandahs "stoups." Few houses, either log or frame, are without them.The pillars look extremely pretty, wreathed with the luxuriant hop-vine,mixed with the scarlet creeper and "morning glory," the American namefor the most splendid of major convolvuluses. These stoups are really aconsiderable ornament, as they conceal in a great measure the roughlogs, and break the barn-like form of the building.Our parlour is warmed by a handsome Franklin stove with brass gallery,and fender. Our furniture consists of a brass-railed sofa, which servesupon occasion for a bed, Canadian painted chairs, a stained pine table,green and white curtains, and a handsome Indian mat that covers thefloor. One side of the room is filled up with our books. Some large mapsand a few good prints nearly conceal the rough walls, and form thedecoration of our little dwelling. Our bed-chamber is furnished withequal simplicity. We do not, however, lack comfort in our humble home;and though it is not exactly such as we could wish, it is as good as,under existing circumstances, we could have.I am anxiously looking forward to the spring, that I may get a gardenlaid out in front of the house; as I mean to cultivate some of thenative fruits and flowers, which, I am sure, will improve greatly byculture. The strawberries that grow wild in our pastures, woods, andclearings, are several varieties, and bear abundantly. They makeexcellent preserves, and I mean to introduce beds of them into mygarden. There is a pretty little wooded islet on our lake, that iscalled Strawberry island, another Raspberry island; they abound in avariety of fruits--wild grapes, raspberries, strawberries, black and redcurrants, a wild gooseberry, and a beautiful little trailing plant thatbears white flowers like the raspberry, and a darkish purple fruitconsisting of a few grains of a pleasant brisk acid, somewhat like inflavour to our dewberry, only not quite so sweet. The leaves of thisplant are of a bright light green, in shape like the raspberry, to whichit bears in some respects so great a resemblance (though it is notshrubby or thorny) that I have called it the "trailing raspberry."I suppose our scientific botanists in Britain would consider me veryimpertinent in bestowing names on the flowers and plants I meet with inthese wild woods: I can only say, I am glad to discover the Canadian oreven the Indian names if I can, and where they fail I consider myselffree to become their floral godmother, and give them names of my ownchoosing.Among our wild fruits we have plums, which, in some townships, are veryfine and abundant; these make admirable preserves, especially whenboiled in maple molasses, as is done by the American housewives. Wildcherries, also a sort called choke cherries, from their peculiarastringent qualities, high and low-bush cranberries, blackberries, whichare brought by the Squaws in birch baskets,--all these are found on theplains and beaver meadows. The low-bush cranberries are brought in greatquantities by the Indians to the towns and villages. They form astanding preserve on the tea-tables in most of the settlers' houses; butfor richness of flavour, and for beauty of appearance, I admire thehigh-bush cranberries; these are little sought after, on account of thelarge flat seeds, which prevent them from being used as a jam: thejelly, however, is delightful, both in colour and flavour.The bush on which this cranberry grows resembles the guelder rose. Theblossoms are pure white, and grow in loose umbels; they are veryornamental, when in bloom, to the woods and swamps, skirting the lakes.The berries are rather of a long oval, and of a brilliant scarlet, andwhen just touched by the frosts are semi-transparent, and look likependent bunches of scarlet grapes.I was tempted one fine frosty afternoon to take a walk with my husbandon the ice, which I was assured was perfectly safe. I must confess forthe first half-mile I felt very timid, especially when the ice is sotransparent that you may see every little pebble or weed at the bottomof the water. Sometimes the ice was thick and white, and quite opaque.As we kept within a little distance of the shore, I was struck by theappearance of some splendid red berries on the leafless bushes that hungover the margin of the lake, and soon recognized them to be theaforesaid high-bush cranberries. My husband soon stripped the boughs oftheir tempting treasure, and I, delighted with my prize, hastened home,and boiled the fruit with some sugar, to eat at tea with our cakes. Inever ate any thing more delicious than they proved; the more so perhapsfrom having been so long without tasting fruit of any kind, with theexception of preserves, during our journey, and at Peterborough.Soon after this I made another excursion on the ice, but it was not inquite so sound a state. We nevertheless walked on for about three-quarters of a mile. We were overtaken on our return by S------ with ahandsleigh, which is a sort of wheelbarrow, such as porters use, withoutsides, and instead of a wheel, is fixed on wooden runners, which you candrag over the snow and ice with the greatest ease, if ever so heavilyladen. S------ insisted that he would draw me home over the ice like aLapland lady on a sledge. I was soon seated in state, and in anotherminute felt myself impelled forward with a velocity that nearly tookaway my breath. By the time we reached the shore I was in a glow fromhead to foot.You would be pleased with the situation of our house. The spot chosen isthe summit of a fine sloping bank above the lake, distant from thewater's edge some hundred or two yards: the lake is not quite a milefrom shore to shore. To the south again we command a different view,which will be extremely pretty when fully opened--a fine smooth basin ofwater, diversified with beautiful islands, that rise like verdant grovesfrom its bosom. Below these there is a fall of some feet, where thewaters of the lakes, confined within a narrow channel between beds oflimestone, rush along with great impetuosity, foaming and dashing up thespray in mimic clouds.During the summer the waters are much lower, and we can walk for someway along the flat shores, which are composed of different strata oflimestone, full of fossil remains, evidently of very recent formation.Those shells and river-insects that are scattered loose over the surfaceof the limestone, left by the recession of the waters, are similar tothe shells and insects incrusted in the body of the limestone. I am toldthat the bed of one of the lakes above us (I forget which) is oflimestone; that it abounds in a variety of beautiful river-shells, whichare deposited in vast quantities in the different strata, and also inthe blocks of limestone scattered along the shores. These shells arealso found in great profusion in the soil of the Beaver meadows.When I see these things, and hear of them, I regret I know nothing ofgeology or conchology; as I might then be able to account for manycircumstances that at present only excite my curiosity.[Maps: Charts shewing the Interior Navigation of the District ofNewcastle and Upper Canada.]Just below the waterfall I was mentioning there is a curious naturalarch in the limestone rock, which at this place rises to a height of tenor fifteen feet like a wall; it is composed of large plates of greylimestone, lying one upon the other; the arch seems like a rent in thewall, but worn away, and hollowed, possibly, by the action of waterrushing through it at some high flood. Trees grow on the top of thisrock. Hemlock firs and cedars are waving on this elevated spot, abovethe turbulent waters, and clothing the stone barrier with a sad butnever-fading verdure. Here, too, the wild vine, red creeper, and poison-elder, luxuriate, and wreathe fantastic bowers above the moss-coveredmasses of the stone. A sudden turn in this bank brought us to a broad,perfectly flat and smooth bed of the same stone, occupying a space offull fifty feet along the shore. Between the fissures of this bed Ifound some rosebushes, and a variety of flowers that had sprung upduring the spring and summer, when it was left dry, and free from theaction of the water.This place will shortly be appropriated for the building of a saw andgrist-mill, which, I fear, will interfere with its natural beauty. Idare say, I shall be the only person in the neighbourhood who willregret the erection of so useful and valuable an acquisition to thisportion of the township.The first time you send a parcel or box, do not forget to encloseflower-seeds, and the stones of plums, damsons, bullace, pips of thebest kinds of apples, in the orchard and garden, as apples may be raisedhere from seed, which will bear very good fruit without being grafted;the latter, however, are finer in size and flavour. I should be gratefulfor a few nuts from our beautiful old stock-nut trees. Dear old trees!how many gambols have we had in their branches when I was as light ofspirit and as free from care as the squirrels that perched among thetopmost boughs above us.--"Well," you will say, "the less that sagematrons talk of such wild tricks as climbing nut-trees, the better."Fortunately, young ladies are in no temptation here, seeing that nothingbut a squirrel or a bear could climb our lofty forest-trees. Even asailor must give it up in despair.I am very desirous of having the seeds of our wild primrose and sweetviolet preserved for me; I long to introduce them in our meadows andgardens. Pray let the cottage-children collect some.My husband requests a small quantity of lucerne-seed, which he seemsinclined to think may be cultivated to advantage.LETTER X.Variations in the Temperature of the Weather.--Electrical Phenomenon.--Canadian Winter.--Country deficient in Poetical Associations.--Sugar-making. Fishing Season.--Mode of Fishing.--Duck-shooting.--Family ofIndians.--_Papouses_ and their Cradle-cases.--Indian Manufactures.--_Frogs_.Lake House, May the 9th. 1833.WHAT a different winter this has been to what I had anticipated. Thesnows of December were continually thawing; on the 1st of January not aflake was to be seen on our clearing, though it lingered in the bush.The warmth of the sun was so great on the first and second days of thenew year that it was hardly possible to endure a cloak, or even shawl,out of doors; and within, the fire was quite too much for us. Theweather remained pretty open till the latter part of the month, when thecold set in severely enough, and continued so during February. The 1stof March was the coldest day and night I ever experienced in my life;the mercury was down to twenty five degrees in the house; abroad it wasmuch lower. The sensation of cold early in the morning was very painful,producing an involuntary shuddering, and an almost convulsive feeling inthe chest and stomach. Our breaths were congealed in hoar-frost on thesheets and blankets. Every thing we touched of metal seemed to freezeour fingers. This excessive degree of cold only lasted three days, andthen a gradual amelioration of temperature was felt.During this very cold weather I was surprised by the frequent recurrenceof a phenomenon that I suppose was of an electrical nature. When thefrosts were most intense I noticed that when I undressed, my clothes,which are at this cold season chiefly of woollen cloth, or lined withflannel, gave out when moved a succession of sounds, like the cracklingand snapping of fire, and in the absence of a candle emitted sparks of apale whitish blue light, similar to the flashes produced by cuttingloaf-sugar in the dark, or stroking the back of a black cat: the sameeffect was also produced when I combed and brushed my hair*.[* This phenomenon is common enough everywhere when the air is verydry.--Ed.]The snow lay very deep on the ground during February, and until the l9thof March, when a rapid thaw commenced, which continued withoutintermission till the ground was thoroughly freed from its hoary livery,which was effected in less than a fortnight's time. The air during theprogress of the thaw was much warmer and more balmy than it usually isin England, when a disagreeable damp cold is felt during that process.Though the Canadian winter has its disadvantages, it also has itscharms. After a day or two of heavy snow the sky brightens, and the airbecomes exquisitely clear and free from vapour; the smoke ascends intall spiral columns till it is lost: seen against the saffron-tinted skyof an evening, or early of a clear morning, when the hoar-frost sparkleson the trees, the effect is singularly beautiful.I enjoy a walk in the woods of a bright winter-day, when not a cloud, orthe faint shadow of a cloud, obscures the soft azure of the heavensabove; when but for the silver covering of the earth I might lookupwards to the cloudless sky and say, "It is June, sweet June."  Theevergreens, as the pines, cedars, hemlock, and balsam firs, are bendingtheir pendent branches, loaded with snow, which the least motionscatters in a mimic shower around, but so light and dry is it that it isshaken off without the slightest inconvenience.The tops of the stumps look quite pretty, with their turbans of snow; ablackened pine-stump, with its white cap and mantle, will often startleyou into the belief that some one is approaching you thus fancifullyattired.  As to ghosts or spirits they appear totally banished fromCanada. This is too matter-of-fact country for such supernaturals tovisit.  Here there are no historical associations, no legendary tales ofthose that came before us.  Fancy would starve for lack of marvellousfood to keep her alive in the backwoods.  We have neither fay nor fairy,ghost nor bogle, satyr nor wood-nymph; our very forests disdain toshelter dryad or hamadryad. No naiad haunts the rushy margin of ourlakes, or hallows with her presence our forest-rills.  No Druid claimsour oaks; and instead of poring with mysterious awe among our curiouslimestone rocks, that are often singularly grouped together, we referthem to the geologist to exercise his skill in accounting for theirappearance: instead of investing them with the solemn characters ofancient temples or heathen altars, we look upon them with the curiouseye of natural philosophy alone.Even the Irish and Highlanders of the humblest class seem to lay asidetheir ancient superstitions on becoming denizens of the woods of Canada.I heard a friend exclaim, when speaking of the want of interest thiscountry possessed, "It is the most unpoetical of all lands; there is noscope for imagination; here all is new--the very soil seems newlyformed; there is no hoary ancient grandeur in these woods; norecollections of former deeds connected with the country. The onlybeings in which I take any interest are the Indians, and they want thewarlike character and intelligence that I had pictured to myself theywould posses."This was the lamentation of a poet. Now, the class of people to whomthis country is so admirably adapted are formed of the unlettered andindustrious labourers and artisans. They feel no regret that the landthey labour on has not been celebrated by the pen of the historian orthe lay of the poet. The earth yields her increase to them as freely asif it had been enriched by the blood of heroes. They would not spare theancient oak from feelings of veneration, nor look upon it with regardfor any thing but its use as timber. They have no time, even if theypossessed the taste, to gaze abroad on the beauties of Nature, but theirignorance is bliss.After all, these are imaginary evils, and can hardly be considered justcauses for dislike to the country. They would excite little sympathyamong every-day men and women, though doubtless they would have theirweight with the more refined and intellectual members of society, whonaturally would regret that taste, learning, and genius should be thrownout of its proper sphere.For myself, though I can easily enter into the feelings of the poet andthe enthusiastic lover of the wild and the wonderful of historic lore, Ican yet make myself very happy and contented in this country. If itsvolume of history is yet a blank, that of Nature is open, and eloquentlymarked by the finger of God; and from its pages I can extract a thousandsources of amusement and interest whenever I take my walks in the forestor by the borders of the lakes.But I must now tell you of our sugar-making, in which I take rather anactive part. Our experiment was on a very limited scale, having but onekettle, besides two iron tripods; but it was sufficient to initiate usin the art and mystery of boiling the sap into molasses, and finally themolasses down to sugar.The first thing to be done in tapping the maples, is to provide littlerough troughs to catch the sap as it flows: these are merely pieces ofpine-tree, hollowed with the axe. The tapping the tree is done bycutting a gash in the bark, or boring a hole with an auger. The formerplan, as being most readily performed, is that most usually practised. Aslightly-hollowed piece of cedar or elder is then inserted, so as toslant downwards and direct the sap into the trough; I have even seen aflat chip made the conductor. Ours were managed according to rule, youmay be sure. The sap runs most freely after a frosty night, followed bya bright warm day; it should be collected during the day in a barrel orlarge trough, capable of holding all that can be boiled down the sameevening; it should not stand more than twenty-four hours, as it is aptto ferment, and will not grain well unless fresh.My husband, with an Irish lad, began collecting the sap the last week inMarch. A pole was fixed across two forked stakes, strong enough to bearthe weight of the big kettle. Their employment during the day wasemptying the troughs and chopping wood to supply the fires. In theevening they lit the fires and began boiling down the sap.It was a pretty and picturesque sight to see the sugar-boilers, withtheir bright log-fire among the trees, now stirring up the blazing pile,now throwing in the liquid and stirring it down with a big ladle. Whenthe fire grew fierce, it boiled and foamed up in the kettle, and theyhad to throw in fresh sap to keep it from running over.When the sap begins to thicken into molasses, it is then brought to thesugar-boiler to be finished. The process is simple; it only requiresattention in skimming and keeping the mass from boiling over, till ithas arrived at the sugaring point, which is ascertained by dropping alittle into cold water. When it is near the proper consistency, thekettle or pot becomes full of yellow froth, that dimples and rises inlarge bubbles from beneath. These throw out puffs of steam, and when themolasses is in this stage, it is nearly converted into sugar. Those whopay great attention to keeping the liquid free from scum, and understandthe precise sugaring point, will produce an article little if at allinferior to muscovado*.[* Good well-made maple-sugar bears a strong resemblance to that calledpowdered sugar-candy, sold by all grocers as a delicate article tosweeten coffee; it is more like maple-sugar in its regularcrystallizations.]In general you see the maple-sugar in large cakes, like bees' wax, closeand compact, without showing the crystallization; but it looks morebeautiful when the grain is coarse and sparkling, and the sugar isbroken in rough masses like sugar-candy.The sugar is rolled or scraped down with a knife for use, as it takeslong to dissolve in the tea without this preparation. I superintendedthe last part of the process, that of boiling the molasses down tosugar; and, considering it was a first attempt, and without anyexperienced person to direct me, otherwise than the information Iobtained from ------, I succeeded tolerably well, and produced somesugar of a fine sparkling grain and good colour. Besides the sugar, Imade about three gallons of molasses, which proved a great comfort tous, forming a nice ingredient in cakes and an excellent sauce forpuddings.The Yankees, I am told, make excellent preserves with molasses insteadof sugar. The molasses boiled from maple-sap is very different from themolasses of the West Indies, both in flavour, colour, and consistency.Beside the sugar and molasses, we manufactured a small cask of vinegar,which promises to be good. This was done by boiling five pails-full ofsap down to two, and fermenting it after it was in the vessel with barm;it was then placed near the fire, and suffered to continue there inpreference to being exposed to the sun's heat.With regard to the expediency of making maple-sugar, it depends oncircumstances whether it be profitable or not to the farmer. If he haveto hire hands for the work, and pay high wages, it certainly does notanswer to make it, unless on a large scale. One thing in its favour is,that the sugar season commences at a time when little else can be doneon the farm, with the exception of chopping, the frost not beingsufficiently out of the ground to admit of crops being sown; time is,therefore, less valuable than it is later in the spring.Where there is a large family of children and a convenient sugar-bush onthe lot, the making of sugar and molasses is decidedly a saving; asyoung children can be employed in emptying the troughs and collectingfire-wood, the bigger ones can tend the kettles and keep up the firewhile the sap is boiling, and the wife and daughters can finish off thesugar within-doors.Maple-sugar sells for four-pence and six-pence per pound, and sometimesfor more. At first I did not particularly relish the flavour it gave totea, but after awhile I liked it far better than muscovado, and as asweetmeat it is to my taste delicious. I shall send you a specimen bythe first opportunity, that you may judge for yourself of itsexcellence.The weather is now very warm--oppressively so. We can scarcely endurethe heat of the cooking-stove in the kitchen. As to a fire in theparlour there is not much need of it, as I am glad to sit at the opendoor and enjoy the lake-breeze. The insects are already beginning to betroublesome, particularly the black flies--a wicked-looking fly, withblack body and white legs and wings; you do not feel their bite for afew minutes, but are made aware of it by a stream of blood flowing fromthe wound; after a few hours the part swells and becomes extremelypainful.These "_beasties_" chiefly delight in biting the sides of the throat,ears, and sides of the cheek, and with me the swelling continues formany days. The mosquitoes are also very annoying. I care more for thenoise they make even than their sting. To keep them out of the house welight little heaps of damp chips, the smoke of which drives them away;but this remedy is not entirely effectual, and is of itself rather anannoyance.This is the fishing season. Our lakes are famous for masquinonge,salmon-trout, white fish, black bass, and many others. We often see thelighted canoes of the fishermen pass and repass of a dark night beforeour door. S------ is considered very skilful as a spearsman, and enjoysthe sport so much that he seldom misses a night favourable for it. Thedarker the night and the calmer the water the better it is for thefishing.It is a very pretty sight to see these little barks slowly stealing fromsome cove of the dark pine-clad shores, and manoeuvring among theislands on the lakes, rendered visible in the darkness by the blaze oflight cast on the water from the jack--a sort of open grated ironbasket, fixed to a long pole at the bows of the skiff or canoe. This isfilled with a very combustible substance called fat-pine, which burnswith a fierce and rapid flame, or else with rolls of birch-bark, whichis also very easily ignited.The light from above renders objects distinctly visible below thesurface of the water. One person stands up in the middle of the boatwith his fish-spear--a sort of iron trident, ready to strike at the fishthat he may chance to see gliding in the still waters, while anotherwith his paddle steers the canoe cautiously along. This sport requires aquick eye, a steady hand, and great caution in those that pursue it.I delight in watching these torch-lighted canoes so quietly gliding overthe calm waters, which are illuminated for yards with a bright track oflight, by which we may distinctly perceive the figure of the spearsmanstanding in the centre of the boat, first glancing to one side, then theother, or poising his weapon ready for a blow. When four or five ofthese lighted vessels are seen at once on the fishing-ground, the effectis striking and splendid.The Indians are very expert in this kind of fishing; the squaws paddlingthe canoes with admirable skill and dexterity. There is another mode offishing in which these people also excel: this is fishing on the icewhen the lakes are frozen over--a sport that requires the exercise ofgreat patience. The Indian, provided with his tomahawk, with which hemakes an opening in the ice, a spear, his blanket, and a decoy-fish ofwood, proceeds to the place he has fixed upon. Having cut a hole in theice he places himself on hands and knees, and casts his blanket overhim, so as to darken the water and conceal himself from observation; inthis position he will remain for hours, patiently watching the approachof his prey, which he strikes with admirable precision as soon as itappears within the reach of his spear.The masquinonge thus caught are superior in flavour to those taken laterin the season, and may be bought very reasonably from the Indians. Igave a small loaf of bread for a fish weighing from eighteen to twentypounds. The masquinonge is to all appearance a large species of thepike, and possesses the ravenous propensities of that fish.One of the small lakes of the Otanabee is called Trout Lake, from theabundance of salmon-trout that occupy its waters. The white fish is alsofound in these lakes and is very delicious. The large sorts of fish aremostly taken with the spear, few persons having time for angling in thisbusy country.As soon as the ice breaks up, our lakes are visited by innumerableflights of wild fowl: some of the ducks are extremely beautiful in theirplumage, and are very fine-flavoured. I love to watch these prettycreatures, floating so tranquilly on the water, or suddenly rising andskimming along the edge of the pine-fringed shores, to drop again on thesurface, and then remain stationary, like a little fleet at anchor.Sometimes we see an old duck lead out a brood of little ones from amongthe rushes; the innocent, soft things look very pretty, sailing roundtheir mother, but at the least appearance of danger they disappearinstantly by diving. The frogs are great enemies to the young broods;they are also the prey of the masquinonge, and, I believe, of otherlarge fish that abound in these waters.The ducks are in the finest order during the early part of the summer,when they resort to the rice-beds in vast numbers, getting very fat onthe green rice, which they eagerly devour.The Indians are very successful in their duck-shooting: they fill acanoe with green boughs, so that it resembles a sort of floating island;beneath the cover of these boughs they remain concealed, and are enabledby this device to approach much nearer than they otherwise could do tothe wary birds. The same plan is often adopted by our own sportsmen withgreat success.A family of Indians have pitched their tents very near us. On one of theislands in our lake we can distinguish the thin blue smoke of their woodfires, rising among the trees, from our front window, or curling overthe bosom of the waters.The squaws have been several times to see me; sometimes from curiosity,sometimes with the view of bartering their baskets, mats, ducks, orvenison, for pork, flour, potatoes, or articles of wearing-apparel.Sometimes their object is to borrow "kettle to cook," which they arevery punctual in returning.Once a squaw came to borrow a washing-tub, but not understanding herlanguage, I could not for some time discover the object of hersolicitude; at last she took up a corner of her blanket, and, pointingto some soap, began rubbing it between her hands, imitated the action ofwashing, then laughed, and pointed to a tub; she then held up twofingers, to intimate it was for two days she needed the loan.These people appear of gentle and amiable dispositions; and, as far asour experience goes, they are very honest. Once, indeed, the old hunter,Peter, obtained from me some bread, for which he promised to give a pairof ducks, but when the time came for payment, and I demanded my ducks,he looked gloomy, and replied with characteristic brevity, "No duck--Chippewa (meaning S------, this being the name they have affectionatelygiven him) gone up lake with canoe--no canoe--duck by-and-by." By-and-byis a favourite expression of the Indians, signifying an indefinite pointof time; may be it means to-morrow, or a week, or month, or it may be ayear, or even more. They rarely give you a direct promise.As it is not wise to let any one cheat you if you can prevent it, Icoldly declined any further overtures to bartering with the Indiansuntil my ducks made their appearance.Some time afterwards I received one duck by the hands of Maquin, a sortof Indian Flibberty-gibbet: this lad is a hunchbacked dwarf, veryshrewd, but a perfect imp; his delight seems to be tormenting the brownbabies in the wigwam, or teazing the meek deer-hounds. He speaks Englishvery fluently, and writes tolerably for an Indian boy; he usuallyaccompanies the women in their visits, and acts as their interpreter,grinning with mischievous glee at his mother's bad English and myperplexity at not being able to understand her signs. In spite of hisextreme deformity, he seemed to possess no inconsiderable share ofvanity, gazing with great satisfaction at his face in the looking glass.When I asked his name, he replied, "Indian name Maquin, but English name'Mister Walker,' very good man;" this was the person he was calledafter.These Indians are scrupulous in their observance of the Sabbath, andshow great reluctance to having any dealings in the way of trading orpursuing their usual avocations of hunting or fishing on that day.The young Indians are very expert in the use of a long bow, with woodenarrows, rather heavy and blunt at the end. Maquin said he could shootducks and small birds with his arrows; but I should think they were notcalculated to reach objects at any great distance, as they appeared veryheavy.'Tis sweet to hear the Indians singing their hymns of a Sunday night;their rich soft voices rising in the still evening air. I have oftenlistened to this little choir praising the Lord's name in the simplicityand fervour of their hearts, and have felt it was a reproach that thesepoor half-civilized wanderers should alone be found to gather togetherto give glory to God in the wilderness.I was much pleased with the simple piety of our friend the hunterPeter's squaw, a stout, swarthy matron, of most amiable expression. Wewere taking our tea when she softly opened the door and looked in; anencouraging smile induced her to enter, and depositing a brown papouse(Indian for baby or little child) on the ground, she gazed round withcuriosity and delight in her eyes. We offered her some tea and bread,motioning to her to take a vacant seat beside the table. She seemedpleased by the invitation, and drawing her little one to her knee,poured some tea into the saucer, and gave it to the child to drink. Sheate very moderately, and when she had finished, rose, and, wrapping herface in the folds of her blanket, bent down her head on her breast inthe attitude of prayer. This little act of devotion was performedwithout the slightest appearance of pharisaical display, but insingleness and simplicity of heart. She then thanked us with a facebeaming with smiles and good humour; and, taking little Rachel by thehands, threw her over her shoulder with a peculiar sleight that I fearedwould dislocate the tender thing's arms, but the papouse seemed wellsatisfied with this mode of treatment.In long journeys the children are placed in upright baskets of apeculiar form, which are fastened round the necks of the mothers bystraps of deer-skin; but the _young_ infant is swathed to a sort of flatcradle, secured with flexible hoops, to prevent it from falling out. Tothese machines they are strapped, so as to be unable to move a limb.Much finery is often displayed in the outer covering and the bandagesthat confine the papouse.There is a sling attached to this cradle that passes over the squaw'sneck, the back of the babe being placed to the back of the mother, andits face outward. The first thing a squaw does on entering a house is torelease herself from her burden, and stick it up against the wall orchair, chest, or any thing that will support it, where the passiveprisoner stands, looking not unlike a mummy in its case. I have seen thepicture of the Virgin and Child in some of the old illuminated missals,not unlike the figure of a papouse in its swaddling-clothes.The squaws are most affectionate to their little ones. Gentleness andgood humour appear distinguishing traits in the tempers of the femaleIndians; whether this be natural to their characters, the savage state,or the softening effects of Christianity, I cannot determine. Certainlyin no instance does the Christian religion appear more lovely than when,untainted by the doubts and infidelity of modern sceptics, it isdisplayed in the conduct of the reclaimed Indian breaking down thestrong-holds of idolatry and natural evil, and bringing forth the fruitsof holiness and morality. They may be said to receive the truths of theGospel as little children, with simplicity of heart and unclouded faith.The squaws are very ingenious in many of their handiworks. We find theirbirch-bark baskets very convenient for a number of purposes. My bread-basket, knife-tray, sugar-basket, are all of this humble material. Whenornamented and wrought in patterns with dyed quills, I can assure you,they are by no means inelegant. They manufacture vessels of birch-barkso well, that they will serve for many useful household purposes, suchas holding water, milk, broth, or any other liquid; they are sewn orrather stitched together with the tough roots of the tamarack or larch,or else with strips of cedar-bark. They also weave very useful sorts ofbaskets from the inner rind of the bass-wood and white ash.Some of these baskets, of a coarse kind, are made use of for gatheringup potatoes, Indian corn, or turnips; the settlers finding them verygood substitutes for the osier baskets used for such purposes in the oldcountry.The Indians are acquainted with a variety of dyes, with which they stainthe more elegant fancy-baskets and porcupine-quills. Our parlour isornamented with several very pretty specimens of their ingenuity in thisway, which answer the purpose of note and letter-cases, flower-stands,and work-baskets.They appear to value the useful rather more highly than the merelyornamental articles that you may exhibit to them. They are very shrewdand close in all their bargains, and exhibit a surprising degree ofcaution in their dealings. The men are much less difficult to trade withthan the women: they display a singular pertinacity in some instances.If they have fixed their mind on any one article, they will come to youday after day, refusing any other you may offer to their notice. One ofthe squaws fell in love with a gay chintz dressing-gown belonging to myhusband, and though I resolutely refused to part with it, all the squawsin the wigwam by turns came to look at "gown," which they pronouncedwith their peculiarly plaintive tone of voice; and when I said "no gownto sell," they uttered a melancholy exclamation of regret, and wentaway.They will seldom make any article you want on purpose for you. If youexpress a desire to have baskets of a particular pattern that they donot happen to have ready made by them, they give you the usual vaguereply of "by-and-by." If the goods you offer them in exchange for theirsdo not answer their expectations, they give a sullen and dogged look orreply, "_Car-car_" (no, no), or "_Carwinni_," which is a still moreforcible negative. But when the bargain pleases them, they signify theirapprobation by several affirmative nods of the head, and a note not muchunlike a grunt; the ducks, fish, venison, or baskets, are placed besideyou, and the articles of exchange transferred to the folds of theircapacious blankets, or deposited in a sort of rushen wallets, not unlikethose straw baskets in which English carpenters carry their tools.The women imitate the dresses of the whites, and are rather skilful inconverting their purchases. Many of the young girls can sew very neatly.I often give them bits of silk and velvet, and braid, for which theyappear very thankful.I am just now very busy with my garden. Some of our vegetable seeds arein the ground, though I am told we have been premature; there being tenchances to one but the young plants will be cut off by the late frosts,which are often felt through May, and even the beginning of June.Our garden at present has nothing to boast of, being merely a spot ofground enclosed with a rough unsightly fence of split rails to keep thecattle from destroying the vegetables. Another spring, I hope to have anice fence, and a portion of the ground devoted to flowers. This springthere is so much pressing work to be done on the land in clearing forthe crops, that I do not like to urge my claims on behalf of a prettygarden.The forest-trees are nearly all in leaf. Never did spring burst forthwith greater rapidity than it has done this year. The verdure of theleaves is most vivid. A thousand lovely flowers are expanding in thewoods and clearings. Nor are our Canadian songsters mute: the cheerfulmelody of the robin, the bugle-song of the blackbird and thrush, withthe weak but not unpleasing call of the little bird called _Thitabecec_,and a wren, whose note is sweet and thrilling, fill our woods.For my part, I see no reason or wisdom in carping at the good we dopossess, because it lacks something of that which we formerly enjoyed. Iam aware it is the fashion for travellers to assert that our featheredtribes are either mute or give utterance to discordant cries that piercethe ear, and disgust rather than please. It would be untrue were I toassert that our singing birds were as numerous or as melodious on thewhole as those of Europe; but I must not suffer prejudice to rob myadopted country of her rights without one word being spoken in behalf ofher feathered vocalists. Nay, I consider her very frogs have beenbelied: if it were not for the monotony of their notes, I reallyconsider they are not quite unmusical. The green frogs are veryhandsome, being marked over with brown oval shields on the most vividgreen coat: they are larger in size than the biggest of our Englishfrogs, and certainly much handsomer in every respect. Their noteresembles that of a bird, and has nothing of the creek in it.The bull-frogs are very different from the green frogs. Instead ofbeing angry with their comical notes, I can hardly refrain from laughingwhen a great fellow pops up his broad brown head from the margin of thewater, and says, "_Williroo, williroo, williroo_," to which anotherbull-frog, from a distant part of the swamp, replies, in hoarseraccents, "_Get out, get out, get out_;" and presently a sudden chorus isheard of old and young, as if each party was desirous of out-croakingthe other.In my next I shall give you an account of our logging-bee, which willtake place the latter end of this month. I feel some anxiety respectingthe burning of the log-heaps on the fallow round the house, as itappears to me rather a hazardous matter.I shall write again very shortly. Farewell, dearest of friends.LETTER XIEmigrants suitable for Canada.--Qualities requisite to ensure success.--Investment of Capital.--Useful Articles to be brought out.--Qualifications and Occupations of a Settler's Family.--Deficiency ofPatience and Energy in some Females.--Management of the Dairy.--Cheese.--Indian Corn, and its Cultivation.--Potatoes.--Rates of Wages.August 9, 1833WITH respect to the various questions, my dear friend, to which yourequest my particular attention, I can only promise that I will do mybest to answer them as explicitly as possible, though at the same time Imust remind you, that brevity in epistolary correspondence is not one ofmy excellencies. If I become too diffuse in describing mere matters offact, you must bear with mine infirmity, and attribute it to my womanlypropensity of over-much talking; so, for your comfort, if your eyes bewearied, your ears will at least escape.I shall take your queries in due rotation; first, then, you ask, "Whoare the persons best adapted for bush-settlers?"To which I reply without hesitation--the poor hard-working, soberlabourers, who have industrious habits, a large family to provide for,and a laudable horror of the workhouse and parish-overseers: this willbear them through the hardships and privations of a first settlement inthe backwoods; and in due time they will realize an honest independence,and be above want, though not work. Artisans of all crafts are betterpaid in village-towns, or long-cleared districts, than as mere bush-settlers."Who are the next best suited for emigration?"Men of a moderate income or good capital may make money in Canada. Ifthey have judgment, and can afford to purchase on a large scale, theywill double or treble their capital by judicious purchases and sales.But it would be easier for me to point out who are not fit foremigration than who are.The poor gentleman of delicate and refined habits, who cannot afford toemploy all the labour requisite to carry on the business of clearing ona tolerable large scale, and is unwilling or incapable of workinghimself, is not fitted for Canada, especially if his habits areexpensive. Even the man of small income, unless he can condescend totake in hand the axe or the chopper, will find, even with prudent andeconomical habits, much difficulty in keeping free from debt for thefirst two or even three years. Many such have succeeded, but thestruggle has been severe.But there is another class of persons most unsuited to the woods: theseare the wives and families of those who have once been opulenttradesmen, accustomed to the daily enjoyment of every luxury that moneycould procure or fashion invent; whose ideas of happiness are connectedwith a round of amusements, company, and all the novelties of dress andpleasure that the gay world can offer. Young ladies who have beenbrought up at fashionable boarding schools, with a contempt of everything useful or economical, make very indifferent settlers' wives.Nothing can be more unfortunate than the situations in the woods ofCanada of persons so educated: disgusted with the unpleasant change intheir mode of life, wearied and discontented with all the objects aroundthem, they find every exertion a trouble, and every occupation adegradation.For persons of this description (and there are such to be met with inthe colonies), Canada is the worst country in the world. And I wouldurge any one, so unfitted by habit and inclination, under noconsideration to cross the Atlantic; for miserable, and poor, andwretched they will become.The emigrant, if he would succeed in this country, must possess thefollowing qualities: perseverance, patience, industry, ingenuity,moderation, self-denial; and if he be a gentleman, a small income isalmost indispensable; a good one is still more desirable.The outlay for buying and clearing land, building, buying stock, andmaintaining a family, paying servants' wages, with many otherunavoidable expenses, cannot be done without some pecuniary means; andas the return from the land is but little for the first two or threeyears, it would be advisable for a settler to bring out some hundreds toenable him to carry on the farm and clear the above-mentioned expenses,or he will soon find himself involved in great difficulties.Now, to your third query, "What will be the most profitable way ofemploying money, if a settler brought out capital more than was requiredfor his own expenditure?"On this head, I am not of course competent to give advice. My husbandand friends, conversant with the affairs of the colonies, say, lend iton mortgage, on good landed securities, and at a high rate of interest.The purchase of land is often a good speculation, but not always socertain as mortgage, as it pays no interest; and though it may at somefuture time make great returns, it is not always so easy to dispose ofit to an advantage when you happen to need it. A man possessing manythousand acres in different townships, may be distressed for twentypounds if suddenly called upon for it when he is unprepared, if heinvests all his capital in property of this kind.It would be difficult for me to enumerate the many opportunities ofturning ready money to account. There is so little money in circulationthat those persons who are fortunate enough to have it at command can doalmost any thing with it they please."What are the most useful articles for a settler to bring out?"Tools, a good stock of wearing-apparel, and shoes, good bedding,especially warm blankets; as you pay high for them here, and they arenot so good as you would supply yourself with at a much lower rate athome. A selection of good garden-seeds, as those you buy at the storesare sad trash; moreover, they are pasted up in packets not to be openedtill paid for, and you may, as we have done, pay for little better thanchaff, and empty husks, or old and worm-eaten seeds. This, I am sorry tosay, is a Yankee trick; though I doubt not but John Bull would do thesame if he had the opportunity, as there are rogues in all countriesunder the sun.With respect to furniture and heavy goods of any kind, I would recommendlittle to be brought. Articles of hardware are not much more expensivehere than at home, if at all, and often of a kind more suitable to thecountry than those you are at the trouble of bringing; besides, allland-carriage is dear.We lost a large package of tools that have never been recovered from theforwarders, though their carriage was paid beforehand to Prescott. It issafest and best to ensure your goods, when the forwarders areaccountable for them.You ask, "If groceries and articles of household consumption are dear orcheap?"They vary according to circumstances and situation. In towns situated inold cleared parts of the country, and near the rivers and navigablewaters, they are cheaper than at home; but in newly-settled townships,where the water-communication is distant, and where the roads are bad,and the transport of goods difficult, they are nearly double the price.Where the supply of produce is inadequate to the demand owing to theinflux of emigrants in thinly-settled places, or other causes, then allarticles of provisions are sold at a high price, and not to be procuredwithout difficulty; but these are merely temporary evils, which sooncease.Competition is lowering prices in Canadian towns, as it does in Britishones, and you may now buy goods of all kinds nearly as cheap as inEngland.Where prices depend on local circumstances, it is impossible to give anyjust standard; as what may do for one town would not for another, and acontinual change is going on in all the unsettled or half-settledtownships. In like manner the prices of cattle vary: they are cheaper inold settled townships, and still more so on the American side the riveror lakes, than in the Canadas*.[* The duties on goods imported to the Canadas are exceedingly small,which will explain the circumstance of many articles of consumptionbeing cheaper in places where there are facilities of transit than athome; while in the Backwoods, where roads are scarcely yet formed, theremust be taken into the account the cost of carriage, and increasednumber of agents; the greater value of capital, and consequent increasedrate of local profit, &c.--items which will diminish in amount as thecountry becomes settled and cleared.--Ed.]"What are necessary qualifications of a settler's wife; and the usualoccupations of the female part of a settler's family?" are your nextquestions.To the first clause, I reply, a settler's wife should be active,industrious, ingenious, cheerful, not above putting her hand to whateveris necessary to be done in her household, nor too proud to profit by theadvice and experience of older portions of the community, from whom shemay learn many excellent lessons of practical wisdom.Like that pattern of all good housewives described by the prudent motherof King Lemuel, it should be said of the emigrant's wife, "She layethher hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff." "She seekethwool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands." "She looketh wellto the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness."Nothing argues a greater degree of good sense and good feeling than acheerful conformity to circumstances, adverse though they be comparedwith a former lot; surely none that felt as they ought to feel, wouldever despise a woman, however delicately brought up, for doing her dutyin the state of life unto which it may have pleased God to call her.Since I came to this country, I have seen the accomplished daughters andwives of men holding no inconsiderable rank as officers, both naval andmilitary, milking their own cows, making their own butter, andperforming tasks of household work that few of our farmers' wives wouldnow condescend to take part in. Instead of despising these useful arts,an emigrant's family rather pride themselves on their skill in thesematters. The less silly pride and the more practical knowledge thefemale emigrant brings out with her, so much greater is the chance fordomestic happiness and prosperity.I am sorry to observe, that in many cases the women that come hithergive way to melancholy regrets, and destroy the harmony of their fire-side, and deaden the energies of their husbands and brothers by constantand useless repining. Having once made up their minds to follow theirhusbands or friends to this country, it would be wiser and better toconform with a good grace, and do their part to make the burden ofemigration more bearable.One poor woman that was lamenting the miseries of this country wasobliged to acknowledge that her prospects were far better than they everhad or could have been at home. What, then, was the cause of hercontinual regrets and discontent? I could hardly forbear smiling, whenshe replied, "She could not go to shop of a Saturday night to lay outher husband's earnings, and have a little chat with her _naibors_, whilethe shopman was serving the customers,--_for why?_ there were no shopsin the bush, and she was just dead-alive. If Mrs. Such-a-one (with whom,by the way, she was always quarrelling when they lived under the sameroof) was near her she might not feel quite so lonesome." And so for thesake of a dish of gossip, while lolling her elbows on the counter of avillage-shop, this foolish woman would have forgone the advantages, realsolid advantages, of having land and cattle, and poultry and food, andfiring and clothing, and all for a few years' hard work, which, herhusband wisely observed, must have been exerted at home, with no otherend in view than an old age of poverty or a refuge from starvation in aparish workhouse.The female of the middling or better class, in her turn, pines for thesociety of the circle of friends she has quitted, probably for ever. Shesighs for those little domestic comforts, that display of therefinements and elegancies of life, that she had been accustomed to seearound her. She has little time now for those pursuits that were everher business as well as amusement. The accomplishments she has now toacquire are of a different order: she must become skilled in the arts ofsugar-boiling, candle and soap making, the making and baking of hugeloaves, cooked in the bake-kettle, unless she be the fortunate mistressof a stone or clay oven. She must know how to manufacture _hop-rising_or _salt-rising_ for leavening her bread; salting meat and fish,knitting stockings and mittens and comforters, spinning yarn in the bigwheel (the French Canadian spinning-wheel), and dyeing the yarn whenspun to have manufactured into cloth and coloured flannels, to clotheher husband and children, making clothes for herself, her husband andchildren;--for there are no tailors nor mantua-makers in the bush.The management of poultry and the dairy must not be omitted; for in thiscountry most persons adopt the Irish and Scotch method, that of churningthe _milk_, a practice that in our part of England was not known. For myown part I am inclined to prefer the butter churned from cream, as beingmost economical, unless you chance to have Irish or Scotch servants whoprefer buttermilk to new or sweet skimmed milk.There is something to be said in favour of both plans, no doubt. Themanagement of the calves differs here very much. Some persons wean thecalf from the mother from its birth, never allowing it to suck at all:the little creature is kept fasting the first twenty-four hours; it isthen fed with the finger with new milk, which it soon learns to takereadily. I have seen fine cattle thus reared, and am disposed to adoptthe plan as the least troublesome one.The old settlers pursue an opposite mode of treatment, allowing the calfto suck till it is nearly half a year old, under the idea that itensures the daily return of the cow; as, under ordinary circumstances,she is apt to ramble sometimes for days together, when the herbage growsscarce in the woods near the homesteads, and you not only lose the useof the milk, but often, from distention of the udder, the cow ismaterially injured, at least for the remainder of the milking season. Iam disposed to think that were care taken to give the cattle regularsupplies of salt, and a small portion of food, if ever so little, nearthe milking-place, they would seldom stay long away. A few refusepotatoes, the leaves of the garden vegetables daily in use, set asidefor them, with the green shoots of the Indian corn that are stripped offto strengthen the plant, will ensure their attendance. In the fall andwinter, pumpkins, corn, straw, and any other fodder you may have, withthe browse they get during the chopping and underbrushing season, willkeep them well.The weanling calves should be given skimmed milk or buttermilk, with theleafy boughs of basswood and maple, of which they are extremely fond. Awarm shed or fenced yard is very necessary for the cattle during theintense winter frosts: this is too often disregarded, especially in newsettlements, which is the cause that many persons have the mortificationof losing their stock, either with disease or cold. Naturally theCanadian cattle are very hardy, and when taken moderate care of, endurethe severest winters well; but owing to the difficulties that attend afirst settlement in the bush, they suffer every privation of cold andhunger, which brings on a complaint generally fatal, called the "_hollowhorn_;" this originates in the spine, or extends to it, and is cured orpalliated by boring the horn and inserting turpentine, pepper, or otherheating substances.When a new comer has not winter food for his cattle, it is wise to sellthem in the fall and buy others in the spring: though at a seeming loss,it is perhaps less loss in reality than losing the cattle altogether.This was the plan my husband adopted, and we found it decidedly thebetter one, besides saving much care, trouble, and vexation.I have seen some good specimens of native cheese, that I thought veryrespectable, considering that the grass is by no means equal to ourBritish pastures. I purpose trying my skill next summer: who knows butthat I may inspire some Canadian bard to celebrate the produce of mydairy as Bloomfield did the Suffolk cheese, yclept "Bang." You rememberthe passage,--for Bloomfield is your countryman as well as mine,--itbegins:  "Unrivalled stands thy county cheese, O Giles," &c.I have dwelt on the dairy information; as I know you were desirous ofimparting all you could collect to your friends.You wish to know something of the culture of Indian corn, and if it be auseful and profitable crop.The cultivation of Indian corn on newly cleared lands is very easy, andattended with but little labour; on old farms it requires more. Theearth is just raised with a broad hoe, and three or four corns droppedin with a pumpkin-seed, in about every third or fourth hole, and inevery alternate row; the seed are set several feet apart. The pumpkinsand the corn grow very amicably together, the broad leaves of the formershading the young plants and preventing the too great evaporation of themoisture from the ground; the roots strike little way, so that they robthe corn of a very small portion of nourishment. The one crop trails toan amazing length along the ground, while the other shoots up to theheight of several feet above it. When the corn is beginning to branch,the ground should be hoed once over, to draw the earth a little to theroots, and cut down any weeds that might injure it. This is all that isdone till the cob is beginning to form, when the blind and weak shootsare broken off, leaving four or five of the finest bearing shoots. Thefeather, when it begins to turn brown and dead, should also be takenoff; that the plant may have all the nourishment to the corn.We had a remarkable instance of smut in our corn last summer. Thediseased cobs had large white bladders as big as a small puff-ball, orvery large nuts, and these on being broken were full of an inky blackliquid. On the same plants might be observed a sort of falsefructification, the cob being deficient in kernels, which by somestrange accident were transposed to the top feather or male blossoms. Ileave botanists to explain the cause of this singular anomaly; I onlystate facts. I could not learn that the smut was a disease common toIndian corn, but last year smut or dust bran, as it is called by some,was very prevalent in the oat, barley and wheat crops. In this countryespecially, new lands are very subject to the disease.The ripe corn is either shocked as beans are at home, or the cobs pulledand braided on ropes after the manner of onions, and hung over poles orbeams in the granaries or barns. The stripping of the corn gives riseamong some people, to what they call a husking-bee, which, like all theother bees, is one of Yankee origin, and is not now so frequentlyadopted among the more independent or better class of settlers.The Indian corn is a tender and somewhat precarious crop: it is liableto injury from the late frosts while young, for which reason it is neverput in before the 20th of May, or beginning of June, and even then itwill suffer; it has also many enemies; bears, racoons, squirrels, mice,and birds, and is a great temptation to _breachy_ cattle; who, to comeat it, will even toss down a fence with stakes and riders forprotection, i.e. a pole or cross-bar, supported between crossed stakes,that surmounts the zig-zag rail fences, for better securing them fromthe incursions of cattle.Even in Canada this crop requires a hot summer to ripen it perfectly;which makes me think Mr. Cobbett was deceiving the English farmer whenhe recommended it as a profitable crop in England. Profitable and highlyuseful it is under every disadvantage, as it makes the richest andsweetest food for all kinds of granivorous animals, even in its greenstate, and affords sound good food when ripe, or even partially ripe,for fattening beasts and working oxen.Last summer was very favourable, and the crops were abundant, but owingto the failure of the two preceding ones, fewer settlers grew it. Oursmall patch turned out very good. The flour makes a substantial sort ofporridge, called by the Americans "_Supporne;_" this is made with water,and eaten with milk, or else mixed with milk; it requires long boiling.Bread is seldom if ever made without a large portion of wheaten flour,mixed with the corn meal.With respect to the culture of other grain, I can tell you nothing butwhat every book that treats on emigration will give you. The potatoeinstead of being sown in drills is planted in hills, which are raisedover the sets; this crop requires hoeing.With respect to the usual rate of wages, this also differs according tothe populousness of the place: but the common wages now given to anactive able man are from eight to eleven dollars per month; ten isperhaps the general average; from four to six for lads, and three andfour for female servants. You may get a little girl, say from nine totwelve years, for her board and clothing; but this is far from a savingplan, as they soon wear out clothes and shoes thus bestowed. I have oncetried this way, but found myself badly served, and a greater loser thanif I had given wages. A big girl will go out to service for two and twoand a half dollars per month, and will work in the fields also ifrequired, binding after the reapers, planting and hoeing corn andpotatoes. I have a very good girl, the daughter of a Wiltshire emigrant,who is neat and clever, and respectful and industrious, to whom I givethree dollars only: she is a happy specimen of the lower order ofEnglish emigrants, and her family are quite acquisitions to the townshipin which they live.I think I have now answered all your queries to the best of my ability;but I would have you bear in mind that my knowledge is confined to asmall portion of the townships along the Otanabee lakes, therefore, myinformation after all, may be but local: things may differ, and dodiffer in other parts of the province, though possibly not verymaterially.I must now say farewell. Should you ever feel tempted to try yourfortune on this side the Atlantic, let me assure you of a warm welcometo our Canadian home, from your sincerely attached friend.LETTER XII."A Logging Bee."--Burning of the Log-heaps.--Crops for the Season.--Farming Stock.--Comparative Value of Wheat and Labour.--Choice of Land,and relative Advantages.--Clearing Land.--Hurricane in the Woods.--Variable Weather.--Insects.November the 2d, 1833.MANY thanks, dearest mother, for the contents of the box which arrivedin August. I was charmed with the pretty caps and worked frocks sent formy baby; the little fellow looks delightfully in his new robes, and Ican almost fancy is conscious of the accession to his wardrobe, so proudhe seems of his dress. He grows fat and lively, and, as you may easilysuppose, is at once the pride and delight of his foolish mother's heart.His father, who loves him as much as I do myself; often laughs at myfondness, and asks me if I do not think him the ninth wonder of theworld. He has fitted up a sort of rude carriage on the hand-sleigh forthe little fellow--nothing better than a tea-chest, lined with a blackbear-skin, and in this humble equipage he enjoys many a pleasant rideover the frozen ground.Nothing could have happened more opportunely for us than the acquisitionof my uncle's legacy, as it has enabled us to make some useful additionsto our farm, for which we must have waited a few years. We have laid outa part of the property in purchasing a fine lot of land adjoining ourhome lot. The quality of our new purchase is excellent, and, from itssituation, greatly enhances the value of the whole property.We had a glorious burning this summer after the ground was all loggedup; that is, all the large timbers chopped into lengths, and drawntogether in heaps with oxen. To effect this the more readily we called alogging-bee. We had a number of settlers attend, with yokes of oxen andmen to assist us. After that was over, my husband, with the menservants, set the heaps on fire; and a magnificent sight it was to seesuch a conflagration all round us. I was a little nervous at first onaccount of the nearness of some of the log-heaps to the house, but careis always taken to fire them with the wind blowing in a direction awayfrom the building. Accidents have sometimes happened, but they are ofrarer occurrence than might be expected, when we consider the subtletyand destructiveness of the element employed on the occasion.If the weather be very dry, and a brisk wind blowing, the work ofdestruction proceeds with astonishing rapidity; sometimes the fire willcommunicate with the forest and run over many hundreds of acres. This isnot considered favourable for clearing, as it destroys the underbush andlight timbers, which are almost indispensable for ensuring a goodburning. It is, however, a magnificent sight to see the blazing treesand watch the awful progress of the conflagration, as it hurries onward,consuming all before it, or leaving such scorching mementoes as haveblasted the forest growth for years.When the ground is very dry the fire will run all over the fallow,consuming the dried leaves, sticks, and roots. Of a night the effect ismore evident; sometimes the wind blows particles of the burning fuelinto the hollow pines and tall decaying stumps; these readily ignite,and after a time present an appearance that is exceedingly fine andfanciful. Fiery columns, the bases of which are hidden by the densesmoke wreaths, are to be seen in every direction, sending up showers ofsparks that are whirled about like rockets and fire-wheels in the wind.Some of these tall stumps, when the fire has reached the summit, looklike gas lamp-posts newly lit. The fire will sometimes continueunextinguished for days.After the burning is over the brands are collected and drawn togetheragain to be reburnt; and, strange as it may appear to you, there is nowork that is more interesting and exciting than that of tending the log-heaps, rousing up the dying flames and closing them in, and supplyingthe fires with fresh fuel.There are always two burnings: first, the brush heaps, which have lainduring the winter till the drying winds and hot suns of April and Mayhave rendered them sear, are set fire to; this is previous to formingthe log-heaps.If the season be dry, and a brisk wind abroad, much of the lightertimber is consumed, and the larger trees reduced during this firstburning. After this is over, the rest is chopped and logged up for thesecond burning: and lastly, the remnants are collected and consumed tillthe ground be perfectly free from all encumbrances, excepting thestanding stumps, which rarely burn out, and remain eye-sores for severalyears. The ashes are then scattered abroad, and the field fenced in withsplit timber; the great work of clearing is over.Our crops this year are oats, corn, and pumpkins, and potatoes, withsome turnips. We shall have wheat, rye, oats, potatoes, and corn nextharvest, which will enable us to increase our stock. At present we haveonly a yoke of oxen (Buck and Bright, the names of three-fourths of allthe working oxen in Canada), two cows, two calves, three small pigs, tenhens, and three ducks, and a pretty brown pony: but she is such askilful clearer of seven-railed fences that we shall be obliged to partwith her. _Breachy_ cattle of any kind are great disturbers of publictranquillity and private friendship; for which reason any settler whovalues the good-will of his neighbours would rather part with the bestworking yoke of oxen in the township, than keep them if they prove_breachy_.A small farmer at home would think very poorly of our Canadianpossessions, especially when I add that our whole stock of farmingimplements consists of two reaping-hooks, several axes, a spade, and acouple of hoes. Add to these a queer sort of harrow that is made in theshape of a triangle for the better passing between the stumps: this is arude machine compared with the nicely painted instruments of the sort Ihave been accustomed to see used in Britain. It is roughly hewn, and puttogether without regard to neatness; strength for use is all that islooked to here. The plough is seldom put into the land before the thirdor fourth year, nor is it required; the general plan of cropping thefirst fallow with wheat or oats, and sowing grass-seeds with the grainto make pastures, renders the plough unnecessary till such time as thegrass-lands require to be broken up. This method is pursued by mostsettlers while they are clearing bush-land; always chopping and burningenough to keep a regular succession of wheat and spring crops, while theformer clearings are allowed to remain in grass.The low price that is now given for grain of every kind, wheat havingfetched only from two shillings and nine-pence to four shillings thebushel, makes the growing of it a matter of less importance than rearingand fatting of stock. Wages bear no proportion to the price of produce;a labourer receives ten and even eleven dollars and board a month, whilewheat is selling at only three shillings, three shillings and six penceor four shillings, and sometimes even still less. The returns are littlecompared with the outlay on the land; nor does the land produce thatgreat abundance that men are apt to look for on newly cleared ground.The returns of produce, however, must vary with the situation andfertility of the soil, which is generally less productive in theimmediate vicinity of the lakes and rivers than a little further backfrom them, the land being either swampy or ridgy, covered with pines andbeset with blocks of limestone and granite, the sub-soil poor and sandy.This is the case on the small lakes and on the banks of the Otanabee;the back lots are generally much finer in quality, producing hard wood,such as bass-wood, maple, hickory, butter-nut, oak, beech, and iron-wood; which trees always indicate a more productive soil than the pinetribe.In spite of the indifference of the soil the advantage of a waterfrontage is considered a matter of great importance in the purchasing ofland; and, lots with water privileges usually fetch a much higher pricethan those further removed from it. These lands are in general in thepossession of the higher class of settlers, who can afford to paysomething extra for a pretty situation, and the prospect of futureimprovements when the country shall be under a higher state ofcultivation and more thickly settled.We cannot help regarding with infinite satisfaction the few acres thatare cleared round the house and covered with crops. A space of this kindin the midst of the dense forest imparts a cheerfulness to the mind, ofwhich those that live in an open country, or even a partially woodedone, can form no idea. The bright sunbeams and the blue and cloudlesssky breaking in upon you, rejoices the eye and cheers the heart as muchas the cool shade of a palm-grove would the weary traveller on the sandywastes of Africa.If we feel this so sensibly who enjoy the opening of a lake of fullthree-quarters of a mile in breadth directly in front of our windows,what must those do whose clearing is first opened in the depths of theforest, hemmed in on every side by a thick wall of trees, through theinterminable shades of which the eye vainly endeavours to penetrate insearch of other objects and other scenes; but so dense is the growth oftimber, that all beyond the immediate clearing is wrapped in profoundobscurity. A settler on first locating on his lot knows no more of itsboundaries and its natural features than he does of the northwestpassage.Under such disadvantages it is ten chances to one if he chooses the bestsituation on the land for the site of his house. This is a verysufficient reason for not putting up an expensive building till the landis sufficiently cleared to allow its advantages and disadvantages tobecome evident. Many eligible spots often present themselves to the eyeof the settler, in clearing his land, that cause him to regret havingbuilt before he could obtain a better choice of ground. Butcircumstances will seldom admit of delay in building in the bush; adwelling must be raised speedily, and that generally on the firstcleared acre. The emigrant, however, looks forward to some no verydistant period when he shall be able to gratify both his taste and loveof comfort in the erection of a handsomer and better habitation than hislog-house or his shanty, which he regards only in the light of atemporary accommodation.On first coming to this country nothing surprised me more than the totalabsence of trees about the dwelling-houses and cleared lands; the axe ofthe chopper relentlessly levels all before him. Man appears to contendwith the trees of the forest as though they were his most obnoxiousenemies; for he spares neither the young sapling in its greenness northe ancient trunk in its lofty pride; he wages war against the forestwith fire and steel.There are several sufficient reasons to be given for this seeming wantof taste. The forest-trees grow so thickly together that they have noroom for expanding and putting forth lateral branches; on the contrary,they run up to an amazing height of stem, resembling seedlings on a hot-bed that have not duly been thinned out. Trees of this growth whenunsupported by others are tall, weak, and entirely divested of thosegraces and charms of outline and foliage that would make them desirableas ornaments to our grounds; but this is not the most cogent reason fornot leaving them, supposing some more sightly than others were to befound.Instead of striking deep roots in the earth, the forest-trees, with theexception of the pines, have very superficial hold in the earth; theroots running along the surface have no power to resist the wind when itbends the tops, which thus act as a powerful lever in tearing them fromtheir places.The taller the tree the more liable it is to being uprooted by storms;and if those that are hemmed in, as in the thickly-planted forests,fall, you may suppose the certain fate of any isolated tree, deprived ofits former protectors, when left to brave and battle with the storm. Itis sure to fall, and may chance to injure any cattle that are within itsreach. This is the great reason why trees are not left in the clearing.Indeed, it is a less easy matter to spare them when chopping than I atfirst imagined, but the fall of one tree frequently brings down two,three, or even more smaller ones that stand near it. A good chopper willendeavour to promote this as much as possible by partly chopping throughsmaller ones in the direction they purpose the larger one to fall.I was so desirous of preserving a few pretty sapling beech-trees thatpleased me, that I desired the choppers to spare them; but the only onethat was saved from destruction in the chopping had to pass through afiery ordeal, which quickly scorched and withered up its gay greenleaves: it now stands a melancholy monument of the impossibility ofpreserving trees thus left. The only thing to be done if you desiretrees, is to plant them while young in favourable situations, when theytake deep root and spread forth branches the same as the trees in ourparks and hedge-rows.Another plan which we mean to adopt on our land is to leave severalacres of forest in a convenient situation, and chop and draw out the oldtimbers for fire-wood, leaving the younger growth for ornament. Thismethod of preserving a grove of trees is not liable to the objectionsformerly stated, and combines the useful with the ornamental.There is a strange excitement created in the mind whilst watching thefelling of one of the gigantic pines or oaks of the forest. Proudly andimmoveably it seems at first to resist the storm of blows that assailits massy trunk, from the united axes of three or even four choppers. Asthe work of destruction continues, a slight motion is perceived--analmost imperceptible quivering of the boughs. Slowly and slowly itinclines, while the loud rending of the trunk at length warns you thatits last hold on earth is gone. The axe of the chopper has performed itsduty; the motion of the falling tree becomes accelerated every instant,till it comes down in thunder on the plain, with a crash that makes theearth tremble and the neighbouring trees reel and bow before it.Though decidedly less windy than our British isles, Canada is subject attimes to sudden storms, nearly approaching to what might be termedwhirlwinds and hurricanes. A description of one of these tempests I gaveyou in an early letter. During the present summer I witnessed anotherhurricane, somewhat more violent and destructive in its effect.The sky became suddenly overcast with clouds of a highly electricnature. The storm came from the north-west, and its fury appeared to beconfined within the breadth of a few hundred yards. I was watching withsome degree of interest the rapid movements in the lurid, black, andcopper-coloured clouds that were careering above the lake, when I wassurprised by the report of trees falling on the opposite shore, and yetmore so by seeing the air filled with scattered remnants of the pineswithin less than a hundred yards of the house, while the wind wasscarcely felt on the level ground on which I was standing.In a few seconds the hurricane had swept over the water, and withirresistible power laid low not less than thirty or forty trees, bendingothers to the ground like reeds. It was an awful sight to see the tallforest rocking and bowing before the fury of the storm, and with thegreat trunks falling one after the other, as if they had been a pack ofcards thrown down by a breath. Fortunately for us the current of thewind merely passed over our open clearing, doing us no further damagethan uprooting three big pine-trees on the ridge above the lake. But inthe direction of our neighbour ------ it did great mischief, destroyingmany rods of fencing, and crushing his crops with the prostrate trunksand scattered boughs, occasioning great loss and much labour to repairthe mischief.The upturned roots of trees thrown down by the wind are great nuisancesand disfigurements in clearings, and cause much more trouble to removethan those that have been felled by the axe. Some of the stumps of thesewind-fallen trees will right again if chopped from the trunk soon afterthey have been blown down, the weight of the roots and upturned soilbeing sufficient to bring them back into their former places; we havepursued this plan very frequently.We have experienced one of the most changeable seasons this summer thatwas possible. The spring was warm and pleasant, but from the latter partof May till the middle of harvest we had heavy rains, cloudy skies, withmoist hot days, and frequent tempests of thunder and lightning, mostawfully grand, but seemingly less destructive than such storms are athome. Possibly the tall forest-trees divert the danger from the lowdwellings, which are sufficiently sheltered from the effect of thelightning. The autumn has also proved wet and cold. I must say atpresent I do not think very favourably of the climate; however, it isnot right to judge by so short an acquaintance with it, as every onesays this summer has been unlike any of its predecessors.The insects have been a sad annoyance to us, and I hailed the approachof the autumn as a respite from their attacks; for these pests arenumerous and various, and no respecters of persons, as I have learnedfrom sad experience.I am longing for home-letters; let me hear from you soon.Farewell, friends.LETTER XIII.Health enjoyed in the rigour of Winter.--Inconvenience suffered from thebrightness of the Snow.--Sleighing.--Indian Orthography.--Visit to anIndian Encampment.--Story of an Indian.--An Indian Hunchback.--CanadianOrnithology.Lake Cottage, March 14, 1834.I RECEIVED your affectionate and interesting letter only last night.Owing to an error in the direction, it had made the round of twotownships before it reached Peterborough; and though it bore as many newdirections as the sailor's knife did new blades and handles, it did atlast reach me, and was not less prized for its travelling dress, beingsomewhat the worse for wear.I rejoiced to hear of your returning health and increased happiness--maythey long continue. Your expressions of regret for my exile, as you termmy residence in this country, affected me greatly. Let the assurancethat I am not less happy than when I left my native land, console youfor my absence. If my situation be changed, my heart is not. My spiritsare as light as ever, and at times I feel a gaiety that bids defiance toall care.You say you fear the rigours of the Canadian winter will kill me. Inever enjoyed better health, nor so good, as since it commenced. Thereis a degree of spirit and vigour infused into one's blood by the purityof the air that is quite exhilarating. The very snow seems whiter andmore beautiful than it does in our damp, vapoury climate. During a keenbright winter's day you will often perceive the air filled with minutefrozen particles, which are quite dry, and slightly prick your face likeneedle-points, while the sky is blue and bright above you. There is adecided difference between the first snow-falls and those of mid-winter;the first are in large soft flakes, and seldom remain long withoutthawing, but those that fall after the cold has regularly set in aresmaller, drier, and of the most beautiful forms, sometimes pointed likea cluster of rays, or else feathered in the most exquisite manner.I find my eyes much inconvenienced by the dazzling glitter of the snowon bright sunny days, so as to render my sight extremely dull andindistinct for hours after exposure to its power. I would stronglyadvise any one coming out to this country to provide themselves withblue or green glasses; and by no means to omit green crape or greentissue veils. Poor Moses' gross of green spectacles would not haveproved so bad a spec. in Canada*.[* Oculists condemn coloured spectacles, as injuring weak eyes by theheat which they occasion. Coloured gauze or coloured shades arepreferable.--Ed.]Some few nights ago as I was returning from visiting a sick friend, Iwas delighted by the effect produced by the frost. The earth, the trees,every stick, dried leaf, and stone in my path was glittering with mimicdiamonds, as if touched by some magical power; objects the most rude anddevoid of beauty had suddenly assumed a brilliancy that was dazzlingbeyond the most vivid fancy to conceive; every frozen particle sentforth rays of bright light. You might have imagined yourself in Sinbad'svalley of gems; nor was the temperature of the air at all unpleasantlycold.I have often felt the sensation of cold on a windy day in Britain farmore severe than I have done in Canada, when the mercury indicated amuch lower degree of temperature. There is almost a trance-likestillness in the air during our frosty nights that lessens theunpleasantness of the sensation.There are certainly some days of intense cold during our winter, butthis low temperature seldom continues more than three days together. Thecoldest part of the day is from an hour or two before sunrise to aboutnine o'clock in the morning; by that time our blazing log-fires or metalstoves have warmed the house, so that you really do not care for thecold without. When out of doors you suffer less inconvenience than youwould imagine whilst you keep in motion, and are tolerably well clothed:the ears and nose are the most exposed to injury.Gentlemen sometimes make a singular appearance coming in from a longjourney, that if it were not for pity's sake would draw from you asmile;--hair, whiskers, eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, all incrusted withhoar-frost. I have seen young ladies going to evening parties withclustering ringlets, as jetty as your own, changed by the breath ofFather Frost to silvery whiteness; so that you could almost fancy thefair damsels had been suddenly metamorphosed to their ancient grannies;fortunately for youth and beauty such change is but transitory.In the towns and populous parts of the province the approach of winteris hailed with delight instead of dread; it is to all a season ofleisure and enjoyment. Travelling is then expeditiously and pleasantlyperformed; even our vile bush-roads become positively very respectable;and if you should happen to be overturned once or twice during a journeyof pleasure, very little danger attends such an event, and very littlecompassion is bestowed on you for your tumble in the snow; so it iswisest to shake off your light burden and enjoy the fun with a goodgrace if you can.Sleighing is certainly a very agreeable mode of travelling; the moresnow, the better the sleighing season is considered; and the harder itbecomes, the easier the motion of the vehicle. The horses are alladorned with strings of little brass bells about their necks or middles.The merry jingle of these bells is far from disagreeable, producing alight, lively sound.The following lines I copied from the New York Albion for you; I thinkyou will be pleased with them:--SLEIGH BELLS.'Tis merry to hear at evening timeBy the blazing hearth the sleigh-bells chime;To know each bound of the steed brings nearThe form of him to our bosoms dear;Lightly we spring the fire to raise,Till the rafters glow with the ruddy blaze.'Tis he--and blithely the gay bells sound,As his steed skims over the frozen ground.Hark! he has pass'd the gloomy wood;He crosses now the ice-bound flood,And sees the light from the open door,To hail his toilsome journey o'er.Our hut is small and rude our cheer,But love has spread the banquet here;And childhood springs to be caress'dBy our beloved and welcome guest;With smiling brow his tale he tells,They laughing ring the merry bells.From the cedar swamp the wolf may howl,From the blasted pine loud whoop the owl;The sudden crash of the falling treeAre sounds of terror no more to me;No longer I list with boding fear,The sleigh-bells' merry peal to hear*.[* This little poem by Mrs. Moodie has since been printed in a volume of"Friendship's Offering," with some alterations by the editor thatdeprive it a good deal of the simplicity of the original.]As soon as a sufficient quantity of snow has fallen all vehicles ofevery description, from the stage-coach to the wheelbarrow, are suppliedwith wooden runners, shod with iron, after the manner of skates. Theusual equipages for travelling are the double sleigh, light waggon, andcutter; the two former are drawn by two horses abreast, but the latter,which is by far the most elegant-looking, has but one, and answers moreto our gig or chaise.Wrapped up in buffalo robes you feel no inconvenience from the cold,excepting to your face, which requires to be defended by a warm beaveror fur bonnet; the latter, I am surprised to find, is seldom if everworn, from the nonsensical reason that it is not the fashion. The red,grey, and black squirrels are abundant in our woods; the musk-ratinhabits little houses that he builds in the rushy parts of the lakes:these dwellings are formed of the roots of sedges, sticks, and othermaterials of a similar nature, and plastered with mud, over which athick close thatch is raised to the height of a foot or more above thewater; they are of a round or dome-shape, and are distinctly visiblefrom the shore at some distance. The Indians set traps to ensnare thesecreatures in their houses, and sell their skins, which are very thickand glossy towards winter. The beaver, the bear, the black lynx, andfoxes are also killed, and brought to the stores by the hunters, wherethe skins are exchanged for goods or money.The Indians dress the deer-skins for making mocassins, which are greatlysought after by the settlers in these parts; they are very comfortablein snowy weather, and keep the feet very warm, but you require severalwrappings of cloth round the feet before you put them on. I wore abeautiful pair all last winter, worked with porcupine-quills and boundwith scarlet ribbon; these elegant mocassins were the handicraft of anold squaw, the wife of Peter the hunter: you have already heard of himin my former letters. I was delighted with a curious specimen of Indianorthography that accompanied the mocassins, in the form of a note, whichI shall transcribe for your edification:--SIR,Pleas if you would give something; you must git in ordir in store iswoyth (worth) them mocsin, porcupine quill on et. One dollers foureyard.[Illustration: The Prairie]This curious billet was the production of the hunter's eldest son, andis meant to intimate that if I would buy the mocassins the price was onedollar, or an order on one of the stores for four yards of calico; forso the squaw interpreted its meaning. The order for four yards ofprinted cotton was delivered over to Mrs. Peter, who carefully pinned itwithin the folds of her blanket, and departed well satisfied with thepayment. And this reminds me of our visit to the Indian's camp lastweek. Feeling some desire to see these singular people in their winterencampment, I expressed my wish to S------, who happens to be a grandfavourite with the old hunter and his family; as a mark of a distinctionthey have bestowed on him the title of Chippewa, the name of theirtribe. He was delighted with the opportunity of doing the honours of theIndian wigwam, and it was agreed that he, with some of his brothers andsisters-in-law, who happened to be on a visit at his house, should comeand drink tea with us and accompany us to the camp in the woods.A merry party we were that sallied forth that evening into the gloriousstarlight; the snow sparkled with a thousand diamonds on its frozensurface, over which we bounded with hearts as light as hearts could bein this careful world. And truly never did I look upon a lovelier sightthan the woods presented; there had been a heavy fall of snow thepreceding day; owing to the extreme stillness of the air not a particleof it had been shaken from the trees. The evergreens were bendingbeneath their brilliant burden; every twig, every leaf, and spray wascovered, and some of the weak saplings actually bowed down to the earthwith the weight of snow, forming the most lovely and fanciful bowers andarcades across our path. As you looked up towards the tops of the treesthe snowy branches seen against the deep blue sky formed a silvery veil,through which the bright stars were gleaming with a chastenedbrilliancy.I was always an admirer of a snowy landscape, but neither in thiscountry nor at home did I ever see any thing so surpassingly lovely asthe forest appeared that night.Leaving the broad road we struck into a bye-path, deep tracked by theIndians, and soon perceived the wigwam by the red smoke that issued fromthe open basket-work top of the little hut. This is first formed withlight poles, planted round so as to enclose a circle of ten or twelvefeet in diameter; between these poles are drawn large sheets of birchbark both within and without, leaving an opening of the bare poles atthe top so as to form an outlet for the smoke; the outer walls were alsobanked up with snow, so as to exclude the air entirely from beneath.Some of our party, who were younger and lighter of foot than we sobermarried folks, ran on before; so that when the blanket, that served thepurpose of a door, was unfastened, we found a motley group of the darkskins and the pale faces reposing on the blankets and skins that werespread round the walls of the wigwam.The swarthy complexions, shaggy black hair, and singular costume of theIndians formed a striking contrast with the fair-faced Europeans thatwere mingled with them, seen as they were by the red and fitful glare ofthe wood-fire that occupied the centre of the circle. The deer-houndslay stretched in indolent enjoyment, close to the embers, while three orfour dark-skinned little urchins were playing with each other, orangrily screaming out their indignation against the apish tricks of thehunchback, my old acquaintance Maquin, that Indian Flibberty-gibbet,whose delight appeared to be in teazing and tormenting the littlepapouses, casting as he did so sidelong glances of impish glee at theguests, while as quick as thought his features assumed an impenetrablegravity when the eyes of his father or the squaws seemed directedtowards his tricks.There was a slight bustle among the party when we entered one by onethrough the low blanket-doorway. The merry laugh rang round among ourfriends, which was echoed by more than one of the Indian men, and joinedby the peculiar half-laugh or chuckle of the squaws. "_Chippewa_" wasdirected to a post of honour beside the hunter Peter; and squaw Peter,with an air of great good humour, made room for me on a corner of herown blanket; to effect which two papouses and a hound were sentlamenting to the neighbourhood of the hunchback Maquin.The most attractive persons in the wigwam were two Indian girls, oneabout eighteen, Jane, the hunter's eldest daughter, and her cousinMargaret. I was greatly struck with the beauty of Jane; her featureswere positively fine, and though of gipsey darkness the tint ofvermilion on her cheek and lip rendered it, if not beautiful, veryattractive. Her hair, which was of jetty blackness, was soft andshining, and was neatly folded over her forehead, not hanging loose anddisorderly in shaggy masses, as is generally the case with the squaws.Jane was evidently aware of her superior charms, and may be consideredas an Indian belle, by the peculiar care she displayed in thearrangement of the black cloth mantle, bound with scarlet, that wasgracefully wrapped over one shoulder, and fastened at her left side witha gilt brooch. Margaret was younger, of lower stature, and though livelyand rather pretty, yet wanted the quiet dignity of her cousin; she hadmore of the squaw in face and figure. The two girls occupied a blanketby themselves, and were busily engaged in working some most elegantsheaths of deer-skin, richly wrought over with coloured quills andbeads: they kept the beads and quills in a small tin baking-pan on theirknees; but my old squaw (as I always call Mrs. Peter) held herporcupine-quills in her mouth, and the fine dried sinews of the deer,which they make use of instead of thread in work of this sort, in herbosom.On my expressing a desire to have some of the porcupine-quills, she gaveme a few of different colour that she was working a pair of mocassinswith, but signified that she wanted "'bead' to work mocsin," by which Iunderstood I was to give some in exchange for the quills. Indians nevergive since they have learned to trade with white men.She was greatly delighted with the praises I bestowed on Jane. She toldme Jane was soon to marry the young Indian who sat on one side of her inall the pride of a new blanket coat, red sash, embroidered powder-pouch,and great gilt clasps to the collar of his coat, which looked as warmand as white as a newly washed fleece. The old squaw evidently feltproud of the young couple as she gazed on them, and often repeated, witha good-tempered laugh, "Jane's husband--marry by and by."We had so often listened with pleasure to the Indians singing theirhymns of a Sunday night that I requested some of them to sing to us; theold hunter nodded assent; and, without removing his pipe, with thegravity and phlegm of a Dutchman, issued his commands, which were asinstantly obeyed by the younger part of the community, and a chorus ofrich voices filled the little hut with a melody that thrilled to ourvery hearts.The hymn was sung in the Indian tongue, a language that is peculiarlysweet and soft in its cadences, and seems to be composed with manyvowels. I could not but notice the modest air of the girls; as ifanxious to avoid observation that they felt was attracted by their sweetvoices, they turned away from the gaze of the strangers, facing eachother and bending their heads down over the work they still held intheir hands. The attitude, which is that of the Eastern nations; thedress, dark hair and eyes, the olive complexion, heightened colour, andmeek expression of face, would have formed a study for a painter. I wishyou could have witnessed the scene; I think you would not easily haveforgotten it. I was pleased with the air of deep reverence that sat onthe faces of the elders of the Indian family, as they listened to thevoices of their children singing praise and glory to the God and Saviourthey had learned to fear and love.The Indians seem most tender parents; it is pleasing to see theaffectionate manner in which they treat their young children, fondly andgently caressing them with eyes overflowing and looks of love. Duringthe singing each papouse crept to the feet of its respective father andmother, and those that were too young to join their voices to the littlechoir, remained quite silent till the hymn was at an end. One littlegirl, a fat brown roly-poly, of three years old, beat time on herfather's knee, and from time to time chimed in her infant voice; sheevidently possessed a fine ear and natural taste for music.I was at a loss to conceive where the Indians kept their stores,clothes, and other moveables, the wigwam being so small that thereseemed no room for any thing besides themselves and their hounds. Theiringenuity, however, supplied the want of room, and I soon discovered aplan that answered all the purposes of closets, bags, boxes, &c., theinner lining of birch-bark being drawn between the poles so as to formhollow pouches all round; in these pouches were stowed their goods; oneset held their stock of dried deer's flesh, another dried fish, a thirdcontained some flat cakes, which I have been told they bake in a waypeculiar to themselves, with hot ashes over and under; for my part Ithink they must be far from palatable so seasoned. Their dressed skins,clothes, materials for their various toys, such as beads, quills, bitsof cloth, silk, with a thousand other miscellaneous articles, occupiedthe rest of these reservoirs.Though open for a considerable space at the top, the interior of thewigwam was so hot, I could scarcely breathe, and was constrained tothrow off all my wrappings during the time we staid. Before we went awaythe hunter insisted on showing us a game, which was something after themanner of our cup and ball, only more complicated, and requires moresleight of hand: the Indians seemed evidently well pleased at our wantof adroitness. They also showed us another game, which was a little likenine-pins, only the number of sticks stuck in the ground was greater. Iwas unable to stay to see the little rows of sticks knocked out, as theheat of the wigwam oppressed me almost to suffocation, and I was glad tofeel myself once more breathing the pure air.In any other climate one would scarcely have undergone such suddenextremes of temperature without catching a severe cold; but fortunatelythat distressing complaint _catchee le cold_, as the Frenchman termedit, is not so prevalent in Canada as at home.Some twenty years ago, while a feeling of dread still existed in theminds of the British settlers towards the Indians, from the remembranceof atrocities committed during the war of independence, a poor woman,the widow of a settler who occupied a farm in one of the then butthinly-settled townships back of the Ontario, was alarmed by the suddenappearance of an Indian within the walls of her log-hut. He had enteredso silently that it was not till he planted himself before the blazingfire that he was perceived by the frightened widow and her little ones,who retreated, trembling with ill-concealed terror to the furthestcorner of the room.Without seeming to notice the dismay which his appearance had excited,the Indian proceeded to disencumber himself from his huntingaccoutrements; he then unfastened his wet mocassins, which he hung up todry, plainly intimating his design was to pass the night beneath theirroof, it being nearly dark, and snowing heavily.Scarcely daring to draw an audible breath, the little group watched themovements of their unwelcome guest. Imagine their horror when theybeheld him take from his girdle a hunting-knife, and deliberatelyproceed to try its edge. After this his tomahawk and rifle underwent asimilar examination.The despair of the horror-stricken mother was now approaching a climax.She already beheld in idea the frightful mangled corpses of her murderedchildren upon that hearth which had so often been the scene of theirinnocent gambols. Instinctively she clasped the two youngest to herbreast at a forward movement of the Indian. With streaming eyes she wasabout to throw herself at his feet, as he advanced towards her with thedreaded weapons in his hands, and implore his mercy for herself and herbabes. What then was her surprise and joy when he gently laid the rifle,knife, and tomahawk beside her, signifying by this action that she hadnothing to fear at his hands*.[* It is almost an invariable custom now for the Indians on entering adwelling-house to leave all their weapons, as rife, tomahawk, &c.,outside the door, even if the weather be ever so wet; as they considerit unpolite to enter a family dwelling armed.]A reprieve to a condemned criminal at the moment previous to hisexecution was not more welcome than this action of the Indian to thepoor widow. Eager to prove her confidence and her gratitude at the sametime, she hastened to prepare food for the refreshment of the now nolonger dreaded guest; and, assisted by the eldest of her children, putclean sheets and the best blankets on her own bed, which she joyfullydevoted to the accommodation of the stranger. An expressive "Hugh!hugh!" was the only reply to this act of hospitality; but when he wentto take possession of his luxurious couch he seemed sorely puzzled. Itwas evident the Indian had never seen, and certainly never reposed on,an European bed. After a mute examination of the bed-clothes for someminutes, with a satisfied laugh, he sprang upon the bed, and, curlinghimself up like a dog, in a few minutes was sound asleep.By dawn of day the Indian had departed; but whenever he came on thehunting-grounds in the neighbourhood of the widow, she was sure to seehim. The children, no longer terrified at his swarthy countenance andwarlike weapons, would gather round his knees, admire the featheredpouch that contained his shot, finger the beautiful embroidered sheaththat held the hunting-knife, or the finely-worked mocassins andleggings; whilst he would pat their heads, and bestow upon them an equalshare of caresses with his deer-hounds.Such was the story related to me by a young missionary. I thought itmight prove not uninteresting, as a trait of character of one of thesesingular people. _Chiboya_ (for that was the name of the Indian) was oneof the Chippewas of Rice Lake, most of whom are now converts toChristianity, and making considerable advancement in civilisation andknowledge of agriculture. Hunting and fishing, however, appear to betheir favourite pursuits: for these they leave the comfortable houses atthe Indian villages, and return at stated times to their forest haunts.I believe it is generally considered that their numbers are diminishing,and some tribes have become nearly if not totally extinct in theCanadas*. The race is slowly passing away from the face of the earth, ormingling by degrees with the colonists, till, a few centuries hence,even the names of their tribes will scarcely remain to tell that theyonce existed.[* It is stated that the North-West Company had a census of all thetribes, and that the whole Indian population of that immense continentdid not now exceed 100,000 souls. In a Parliamentary document of 1834,the Indians of Lower Canada are estimated at 3,437, and those of UpperCanada at 13,700, which latter number is stated to include those on theshores of Lake Huron, and to the westward.-Ed.]When next you send a box or parcel, let me have a few good tracts andhymn-books; as they prize a gift of this sort extremely. I send you ahymn, the one they sang to us in the wigwam; it is the Indiantranslation, and written by the hunter, Peter's eldest son: he wasdelighted when I told him I wanted him to copy it for me, that I mightsend it across the seas to my own country, that English people might seehow well Indians could write.[Illustration: Red-bird][Illustration: Blue-bird]The hunchback Maquin has made me a miniature canoe of birch-bark, whichI send; you will prize it as a curiosity, and token of remembrance. Thered and black squirrel-skins are for Jane; the feather fans, and papersof feathers, for Sarah. Tell the latter the next time I send a packethome, she shall have specimens fit for stuffing of our splendid red-bird, which, I am sure, is the Virginian nightingale; it comes in May orApril, and leaves us late in the summer: it exactly corresponds to astuffed Virginian nightingale that I saw in a fine collection ofAmerican birds. The blue-bird is equally lovely, and migrates much aboutthe same time; the plumage is of a celestial blue; but I have never seenone otherwise than upon the wing, so cannot describe it minutely. Thecross-bills are very pretty; the male and female quite opposite incolour, one having a lovely mixture of scarlet and orange on the breastand back, shading into greenish olive and brown; the other more like ouryellowhammer, only it is not quite so bright in colour, though muchsofter, and more innocent-looking: they come to our windows and doors inthe winter as familiarly as your robins. During the winter most of ourbirds depart; even the hollow tapping of the red-headed and the smallspeckled grey and white woodpecker ceases to be heard; the sharpchittering of the squirrel, too, is seldomer distinguished; and silence,awful and unbroken silence, reigns in the forest during the season ofmidwinter.I had well nigh forgotten my little favourites, a species of thetitmouse, that does not entirely forsake us. Of a bright warm, sunny daywe see flocks of these tiny birds swinging among the feathery sprigs ofthe hemlocks or shrubby pines on the plains or in the forest; and many atime have I stayed my steps to watch their playful frolics, and listento their gay warbling. I am not quite certain, but I think this is thesame little bird that is known among the natives by the name of Thit-a-be-bee; its note, though weak, and with few changes, is not unpleasing;and we prize it from its being almost the only bird that sings duringthe winter.I had heard much of the snow-bunting, but never had seen it till theother day, and then not near enough to mark its form or colours. The daywas one of uncommon brilliancy; the sky cloudless, and the air almostwarm; when, looking towards the lake, I was surprised by the appearanceof one of the pine-trees near the shore: it seemed as if covered withstars of silver that twinkled and sparkled against the blue sky. I wasso charmed by the novelty, that I ran out to observe them nearer; when,to my surprise, my stars all took flight to another tree, where, by theconstant waving and fluttering of their small white wings against thesunlight, they produced the beautiful effect that had at first attractedmy observation: soon all the pines within sight of the window wereilluminated by these lovely creatures. About mid-day they went away, andI have seen them but once since. They never lit on the ground, or anylow tree or bough, for me to examine them nearer.Of our singing-birds, the robin; the blackbird, and a tiny bird, likeour common wren, are those I am most intimate with. The Canadian robinis much larger than our dear robin at home; he is too coarse and large abird to realize the idea of our little favourite, "the household-birdwith the red stomacher," as he is called by Bishop-Carey, in a sonnetaddressed to Elizabeth, the daughter of James I., on her marriage withthe unfortunate Frederic Prince Palatine.The song of the Canadian robin is by no means despicable; its notes areclear, sweet, and various; it possesses the same cheerful livelycharacter that distinguishes the carol of its namesake; but the generalhabits of the bird are very dissimilar. The Canadian robin is lesssociable with man, but more so with his own species: they assemble inflocks soon after the breeding season is over, and appear very amicableone to another; but seldom, if ever, approach very near to our dwelling.The breast is of a pinkish, salmon colour; the head black; the back of asort of bluish steel, or slate colour; in size they are as big as athrush.[Illustration: Snow-Bunting]The blackbird is perhaps our best songster, according to my taste; fullas fine as our English blackbird, and much handsomer in its plumage,which is a glossy, changeable, greenish black. The upper part of thewing of the male bird of full growth is of a lively orange; this is notapparent in the younger birds, nor in the female, which is slightlyspeckled.Towards the middle of the summer, when the grain begins to ripen, thesebirds assemble in large flocks: the management of their maraudingparties appears to be superintended by the elders of the family. Whenthey are about to descend upon a field of oats or wheat, two or threemount guard as sentinels, and on the approach of danger, cry _Geck-geck-geck_; this precaution seems a work of supererogation, as they are sosaucy that they will hardly be frightened away; and if they rise it isonly to alight on the same field at a little distance, or fly up to thetrees, where their look-out posts are.They have a peculiarly melancholy call-note at times, which soundsexactly like the sudden twang of a harp-string, vibrating for a secondor two on the ear. This, I am inclined to think, they use to collecttheir distant comrades, as I have never observed it when they were allin full assembly, but when a few were sitting in some tree near thelake's edge. I have called them the "_harpers_" from this peculiar note.I shall tire you with my ornithological sketches, but must enumerate twoor three more birds.The bald eagle frequently flies over our clearing; it has a dark body,and snow-white head. It is sometimes troublesome to the poultry-yards:those we have seen have disdained such low game, and soared majesticallyaway across the lake.The fish-hawk we occasionally see skimming the surface of the water, andit is regarded as an enemy by those who take delight in spearing fishupon the lakes.Then we have the night or mosquito-hawk, which may be seen in the airpursuing the insect tribe in the higher regions, whilst hundreds ofgreat dragonflies pursue them below; notwithstanding their assistance,we are bitten mercilessly by those summer pests the mosquitoes and blackflies.The red-headed woodpecker is very splendid; the head and neck being of arich crimson; the back, wings, and breast are divided between the mostsnowy white and jetty black. The incessant tapping of the woodpeckers,and the discordant shriek of the blue jay, are heard from sunrise tosunset, as soon as the spring is fairly set in.I found a little family of woodpeckers last spring comfortably nested inan old pine, between the bark and the trunk of the tree, where theformer had started away, and left a hollow space, in which the old birdshad built a soft but careless sort of nest; the little creatures seemedvery happy, poking their funny bare heads out to greet the old ones, whowere knocking away at the old stumps in their neighbourhood to supplytheir cravings, as busy as so many carpenters at work.[Illustration: Baltimore Oriole defending her Nest against the BlackSnake.]A very curious bird's-nest was given me by one of our choppers; it waswoven over a forked spray, so that it had all the appearance of havingbeen sewn to the bough with grey thread. The nest was only secured atthe two sides that formed the angle, but so strong was it fastened thatit seemed to resist any weight or pressure of a moderate kind; it wascomposed of the fibres of the bass-wood bark; which are very thready,and may be drawn to great fineness: on the whole it was a curiousspecimen of the ingenuity of these admirable little architects. I couldnot discover the builder; but rather suspect the nest to have belongedto my protege, the little winter titmouse that I told you of.The nest of the Canadian robin, which I discovered while seeking for ahen's nest in a bush-heap, just at the further edge of the clearing, isvery much like our home-robin's, allowing something for difference ofsize in the bird, and in the material; the eggs, five in number, weredeep blue.Before I quit the subject of birds, I must recall to your remembrancethe little houses that the Americans build for the swallow; I have sincefound out one of their great reasons for cherishing this useful bird. Itappears that a most rooted antipathy exists between this species and thehawk tribe, and no hawk will abide their neighbourhood; as they pursuethem for miles, annoying them in every possible way, haunting the hawklike its evil genius: it is most singular that so small a creatureshould thus overcome one that is the formidable enemy of so many of thefeathered race. I should have been somewhat sceptical on the subject,had I not myself been an eyewitness to the fact. I was looking out of mywindow one bright summer-day, when I noticed a hawk of a largedescription flying heavily along the lake, uttering cries of distress;within a yard or two of it was a small--in the distance it appeared tome a very small--bird pursuing it closely, and also screaming. I watchedthis strange pair till the pine-wood hid them from my sight; and I oftenmarvelled at the circumstance, till a very intelligent French Canadiantraveller happened to name the fact, and said so great was the valueplaced on these birds, that they had been sold at high prices to be sentto different parts of the province. They never forsake their old hauntswhen once naturalized, the same pairs constantly returning year afteryear, to their old house.The singular fact of these swallows driving the hawk from his haunts isworthy of attention; as it is well authenticated, and adds one more tothe many interesting and surprising anecdotes recorded by naturalists ofthe sagacity and instinct of these birds.I have, however, scribbled so many sheets, that I fear my long lettermust weary you.Adieu.LETTER XIV.Utility of Botanical Knowledge.--The Fire-Weed.--Sarsaparilla Plants.--Magnificent Water-Lily.--Rice Beds.--Indian Strawberry.--ScarletColumbine.--Ferns.--Grasses.July 13, 1834OUR winter broke up unusually early this year: by the end of Februarythe ground was quite free from snow, and the weather continued allthrough March mild and pleasant, though not so warm as the precedingyear, and certainly more variable. By the last week in April and thebeginning of May, the forest-trees had all burst into leaf, with abrilliancy of green that was exquisitely lovely.On the 14th, 15th, and 16th of May, the air became suddenly cold, withsharp winds from the north-west, and heavy storms of snow that nippedthe young buds, and destroyed many of the early-sown vegetable seeds;fortunately for us we were behindhand with ours, which was very well, asit happened.Our woods and clearings are now full of beautiful flowers. You will beable to form some idea of them from the dried specimens that I send you.You will recognize among them many of the cherished pets of our gardensand green-houses, which are here flung carelessly from Nature's lavishhand among our woods and wilds.How often do I wish you were beside me in my rambles among the woods andclearings: you would be so delighted in searching out the floraltreasures of the place.Deeply do I now regret having so idly neglected your kind offers whileat home of instructing me in flower-painting; you often told me the timewould come when I should have cause to regret neglecting the goldenopportunity before me.You proved a true prophetess; for I daily lament that I cannot makefaithful representations of the flowers of my adopted country, orunderstand as you would do their botanical arrangement. With some few Ihave made myself acquainted, but have hardly confidence in my scantystock of knowledge to venture on scientific descriptions, when I feelconscious that a blunder would be easily detected, and expose me toridicule and contempt, for an assumption of knowledge that I did notpossess. The only botanical work I have at my command is Pursh's NorthAmerican Flora, from which I have obtained some information; but mustconfess it is tiresome blundering out Latin descriptions to one whoknows nothing of Latin beyond what she derives through a knowledge ofItalian.I have made out a list of the plants most worthy of attention near us;there are many others in the township that I am a stranger to; somethere are with whose names I am unacquainted. I subjoin a slight sketch,not with my pencil but my pen, of those flowers that pleased meparticularly, or that possessed any remarkable qualities.The same plants do not grow on cleared land that formerly occupied thesame spot when it was covered with forest-trees. A distinct class ofvegetation makes its appearance as soon as the fire has passed over theground.The same thing may be remarked with regard to the change that takesplace among our forests. As one generation falls and decays, new ones ofa different character spring up in their places. This is illustrated inthe circumstance of the resinous substance called fat-pine being usuallyfound in places where the living pine is least abundant, and where theground is occupied by oak, ash, buck, maple, and bass-wood.The fire-weed, a species of tall thistle of rank and unpleasant scent,is the first plant that appears when the ground has been freed fromtimbers by fire: if a piece of land lies untilled the first summer afterits being chopped, the following spring shows you a smothering crop ofthis vile weed. The next plant you notice is the sumach, with its downystalks, and head of deep crimson velvety flowers, forming an uprightobtuse bunch at the extremity of the branches: the leaves turn scarlettowards the latter end of the summer. This shrub, though really veryornamental, is regarded as a great pest in old clearings, where theroots run and send up suckers in abundance. The raspberry and wildgooseberry are next seen, and thousands of strawberry plants ofdifferent varieties carpet the ground, and mingle with the grasses ofthe pastures. I have been obliged this spring to root out withremorseless hand hundreds of sarsaparilla plants, and also thecelebrated gingseng, which grows abundantly in our woods: it usedformerly to be an article of export to China from the States, the rootbeing held in high estimation by the Chinese.Last week I noticed a succulent plant that made its appearance on a drysandy path in my garden; it seems to me a variety of the hour-blowingmesembryanthium. It has increased so rapidly that it already covers alarge space; the branches converging from the centre of the plant; andsending forth shoots from every joint. The leaves are rather small,three-sided and pointed, thick and juicy, yielding a green liquor whenbruised like the common sedums. The stalks are thick and round, of abright red, and trail along the ground; the leaves spring from eachjoint, and with them a constant succession of yellow starry flowers,that close in an hour or so from the time they first unfold. I shallsend you some of the seed of this plant, as I perceived a number oflittle green pods that looked like the buds, but which, on opening,proved to be the seed-vessels. This plant covers the earth like a thickmat, and, I am told, is rather troublesome where it likes the soil.I regret that among my dried plants I could not preserve some specimensof our superb water-lilies and irises; but they were too large and toojuicy to dry well. As I cannot send you my favourites, I must describethem to you.The first, then, is a magnificent water-lily, that I have called by wayof distinction the "queen of the lakes," for she sits a crown upon thewaters. This magnificent flower is about the size of a moderately largedahlia; it is double to the heart; every row of petals diminishing bydegrees in size, and gradually deepening in tint from the purest whiteto the brightest lemon colour. The buds are very lovely, and may be seenbelow the surface of the water, in different stages of forwardness fromthe closely-folded bud, wrapped in its olive-green calix, to the half-blown flower, ready to emerge from its watery prison, and in all itsvirgin beauty expand its snowy bosom to the sun and genial air. Nor isthe beauty of the flower its sole attraction: when unfolded it gives outa rich perfume not unlike the smell of fresh lemons. The leaves are alsoworthy of attention: at first they are of a fine dark green, but as theflower decays, the leaf changes its hue to a vivid crimson. Where alarge bed of these lilies grow closely together, they give quite asanguine appearance to the waters, that is distinguishable at somedistance.The yellow species of this plant is also very handsome, though it wantsthe silken texture and delicate colour of the former; I call this the"water-king." The flower presents a deep golden-coloured cup, theconcave petals of which are clouded in the centre with a dark reddish-brown, that forms a striking contrast to the gay anthers, which are verynumerous, and turn back from the centre of the flower, falling likefringes of gold one over the other, in successive rows, till they fillup the hollow flower-cup.The shallows of our lakes abound with a variety of elegant aquaticplants: I know not a more lovely sight than one of these floatinggardens. Here you shall behold near the shore a bed of azure fleur-de-lis, from the palest pearl colour varying to the darkest purple. Nearerin shore, in the shallowest water, the rose-coloured persecaria sends upits beautiful spikes trailing below the surface; you see the red stalksand smooth dark green leaves veined underneath with rosy red: it is avery charming variety of this beautiful species of plants. Then a bed ofmy favourite white lilies, all in full bloom, floating on the water,with their double flowers expanding to the sun; near these, and risingin stately pride, a tall plant, with dark green spear-shaped leaves, andthick spike of bright blue flowers, is seen. I cannot discover the nameof this very grand-looking flower, and I neglected to examine itsbotanical construction; so can give you no clue by which to discover itsname or species.Our rice-beds are far from being unworthy of admiration; seen from adistance they look like low green islands on the lakes: on passingthrough one of these rice-beds when the rice is in flower, it has abeautiful appearance with its broad grassy leaves and light wavingspikes, garnished with pale yellow green blossoms, delicately shadedwith reddish purple, from beneath which fall three elegant straw-coloured anthers, which move with every breath of air or slightestmotion of the waters. I gathered several spikes when only just opened,but the tiresome things fell to pieces directly they became dry. Nextsummer I will make another attempt at preserving them, and it may bewith better success.The low shore of the lake is a complete shrubbery. We have a very prettySt. John's-wort, with handsome yellow flowers. The white and pink spiralfrutex also abounds with some exquisite upright honeysuckles, shrubbyplants about three feet in height; the blossoms grow in pairs or byfours, and hang beneath the light green leaves; elegant trumpet-shapedflowers of a delicate greenish white, which are succeeded by ruby-coloured berries. On gathering a branch of this plant, you cannot but bestruck with the elegant arrangement of the flowers along the under partof the stalks. The two blossoms are connected at the nectary of each ina singular manner. The Americans call this honeysuckle "twinflower." Ihave seen some of the flowers of this plant pale pink: on the whole itis one of the most ornamental shrubs we have. I transplanted some youngtrees into my garden last spring; they promise to live and do well. I donot find any description of this shrub in Pursh's Flora, but know it tobe a species of honeysuckle, from the class and order, the shape andcolour of the leaves, the stalks, the trumpet-shaped blossom and thefruit; all bearing a resemblance to our honeysuckles in some degree.There is a tall upright bush, bearing large yellow trumpet-shapedflowers, springing from the extremities of the branches; the involucrumforms a boat-shaped cup that encircles the flowers from which they seemto spring, something after the manner of the scarlet trumpet-honeysuckle. The leaves and blossoms of this plant are coarse, and by nomeans to compare to the former.We have a great variety of curious orchises, some brown and yellow,others pale flesh-coloured, striped with crimson. There is one speciesgrows to the height of two feet, bearing long spikes of pale purpleflowers; a white one with most fragrant smell, and a delicate pink onewith round head of blossoms, finely fringed like the water-pinks thatgrow in our marshes; this is a very pretty flower, and grows in thebeaver meadows.Last autumn I observed in the pine-wood near us a very curious plant; itcame up with naked brown stems, branching off like some miniature tree;the stalks of this plant were brown, slightly freckled and beset withlittle knobs. I watched the progress of maturity in this strange plantwith some degree of interest, towards the latter end of October; thelittle knobs, which consisted of two angular hard cases, not unlike,when fully opened, to a boat in shape, burst asunder and displayed apale straw-coloured chaffy substance that resembled fine saw-dust: thesemust have been the anthers, but they bore more resemblance to seeds;this singular flower would have borne examination with a microscope. Onepeculiarity that I observed, was, that on pulling up a plant with itsroots, I found the blossoms open under ground, springing up from thelowest part of the flower-stems, and just as far advanced to maturity asthose that grew on the upper stalks, excepting that they were somewhatblanched, from being covered up from the air. I can find no descriptionof this plant, nor any person but myself seems to have taken notice ofit. The specimen I had on being dried became so brittle that it fell topieces.I have promised to collect some of the most singular of our nativeflowers for one of the Professors of Botany in the Edinburgh University.We have a very handsome plant that bears the closest affinity to ourpotatoe in its floral construction; it grows to the height of two orthree feet in favourable situations, and sends up many branches; theblossoms are large, purely white, freckled near the bottom of thecorolla with brownish yellow spots; the corolla is undivided: this isevidently the same plant as the cultivated potatoe, though it does notappear to form apples at the root. The fruit is very handsome,eggshaped, of a beautiful apricot colour when ripe, and of a shiningtempting appearance; the smell, however, betrays its poisonous nature:on opening one of the fruits you find it consists of a soft pulp filledwith shining black seeds. The plant continues in blossom from June tillthe first frosts wither the leaves; it is far less coarse than thepotatoe; the flower, when full blown, is about the size of a half crown,and quite flat; I think it is what you call salver-shaped: it delightsin light loamy soil, growing on the upturned roots of fallen trees,where the ground is inclined to be sandy. I have never seen this plantelsewhere than on our own fallow.The hepatica is the first flower of the Canadian spring: it gladdens uswith its tints of azure, pink, and white, early in April, soon after thesnows have melted from the earth. The Canadians can it snow-flower, fromits coming so soon after the snow disappears. We see its gay tufts offlowers in the open clearings and the deep recesses of the forests; itsleaves are also an enduring ornament through the open months of theyear; you see them on every grassy mound and mossy root: the shades ofblue are very various and delicate, the white anthers forming a lovelycontrast with the blue petals.The wood-cress, or as it is called by some, ginger-cress, is a prettywhite cruciform flower; it is highly aromatic in flavour; the root iswhite and fleshy, having the pungency of horseradish. The leaves are ofa sad green, sharply notched, and divided in three lobes; the leaves ofsome of them are slightly variegated; the plant delights in rich moistvegetable mould, especially on low and slightly swampy ground; theflower-stalk is sometimes naked, sometimes leafed, and is crowned with aloose spike of whitish cruciform flowers.There is a cress that grows in pretty green tufts at the bottom of thewaters in the creeks and small rivulets: it is more delicate andagreeable in flavour than any of the land-cresses; the leaves are of apale tender green, winged and slender; the plant looks like a greencushion at the bottom of the water. The flowers are yellow, cruciform,and insignificant; it makes a very acceptable salad in the early spring,and at the fall of the year. There are also several species of land-cress, and plants resembling some of the cabbage tribes, that might beused as spring vegetables. There are several species of spinach, oneknown here by the name of lamb's quarter, that grows in great profusionabout our garden, and in rich soil rises to two feet, and is veryluxuriant in its foliage; the leaves are covered with a white roughpowder. The top shoots and tender parts of this vegetable are boiledwith pork, and, in place of a more delicate pot-herb, is very useful.Then we have the Indian turnip; this is a very handsome arum, the rootof which resembles the cassava, I am told, when boiled: the leaves ofthis arum are handsome, slightly tinged with purple. The spathe is of alively green, striped with purple: the Indians use the root as amedicine, and also as an esculent; it is often eaten by the settlers asa vegetable, but I never tasted it myself. Pursh calls this species_Arum atropurpureum_.I must not pass over one of our greatest ornaments, the strawberryblite, strawberry-bearing spinach, or Indian strawberry, as it isvariously named. This singular plant throws out many branches from onestem, these are garnished with handsome leaves, resembling in appearanceour long-leaved garden spinach; the finest of this plant is of a brightcrimson, pulpy like the strawberry, and containing a number of purpleseeds, partially embedded in the surface, after the same manner as thestrawberry. The fruit grows close to the stalk, completely surroundingit, and forming a long spike of the richest crimson berries. I havegathered branches a foot in length, closely covered with the beautifullooking fruit, and have regretted that it was so insipid in its flavouras to make it uneatable. On the banks of creeks and in rich ground, itgrows most luxuriantly, one root sending up twenty or thirty branches,drooping with the weight of their magnificent burden. As the middle andsuperior stems ripen and decay, the lateral ones come on, presenting aconstant succession of fruit from July till the frosts nip them off inSeptember.The Indians use the juice of this plant as a dye, and are said to eatthe berries: it is often made use of as a substitute for red ink, but itis liable to fade unless mingled with alum. A friend of mine told me shehad been induced to cross a letter she was sending to a relative inEngland with this strawberry ink, but not having taken the precaution tofix the colour, when the anxiously expected epistle arrived, one-half ofit proved quite unintelligible, the colours having faded nearly towhite; so that instead of affording satisfaction, it proved only asource of vexation and embarrassment to the reader, and of mortificationto the writer.The blood-root, sanguinaria, or puccoon, as it is termed by some of thenative tribes, is worthy of attention from the root to the flower. Assoon as the sun of April has warmed the earth and loosened it from itsfrozen bonds, you may distinguish a number of purely white buds,elevated on a naked footstalk, and partially enfolded in a handsomevine-shaped leaf, of a pale bluish green, curiously veined on the underside with pale orange. The leaf springs singly from a thick juicyfibrous root, which, on being broken, emits a quantity of liquor fromits pores of a bright orange scarlet colour: this juice is used by theIndians as a dye, and also in the cure of rheumatic, and cutaneouscomplaints. The flowers of the sanguinaria resemble the white crocusvery closely: when it first comes up the bud is supported by the leaf,and is folded together with it; the flower, however, soon elevatesitself above its protector, while the leaf having performed its duty ofguardian to the tender bud, expands to its full size. A rich blackvegetable mould at the edges of the clearings seems the favourite soilfor this plant.The scarlet columbine is another of my favourite flowers; it is brightred, with yellow linings to the tubes. The nectaries are more elongatedthan the garden columbines, and form a sort of mural crown, surmountedwith little balls at the tips. A tall graceful plant, with its brilliantwaving blossoms, is this columbine; it grows both in the sunshine andthe shade, not perhaps in deep shady woods, but where the under brushhas been removed by the running of the fire or the axe of the chopper;it seems even to flourish in poor stony soils, and may be found nearevery dwelling. The feathered columbine delights in moist open swamps,and the banks of rivulets; it grows to the height of three, and evenfour and five feet, and is very ornamental.Of Violets, we have every variety of colour, size and shape, lackingonly the delightful _viola odorata_ of our home woodlands: yet I knownot why we should quarrel with these meek daughters of the spring,because they want the fragrance of their more favoured sisters. Many ofyour wood-violets, though very beautiful, are also devoid of scent; herevariety of colour ought to make some amends for want of perfume. We haveviolets of every shade of blue, some veined with purple, others shadedwith darker blue. We have the delicate white, pencilled with purple: thebright brimstone coloured with black veinings: the pale primrose withdark blue veins; the two latter are remarkable for the luxuriance andsize of the leaves: the flowers spring in bunches, several from eachjoint, and are succeeded by large capsules covered with thick whitecottony down. There is a species of violet that grows in the woods, theleaves of which are exceedingly large; so are the seed-vessels, but theflower is so small and insignificant, that it is only to be observed bya close examination of the plant; this has given rise to the vulgarbelief that it blooms under ground. The flowers are a pale greenishyellow. Bryant's beautiful poem of the Yellow Violet is descriptive ofthe first-mentioned violet.There is an elegant _viola tricolor_, that blooms in the autumn; it isthe size of a small heart's-ease, and is pure white, pale purple, andlilac; the upper petals are white, the lower lip purple, and the sidewings a reddish lilac. I was struck with the elegance of this rareflower on a journey to Peterborough, on my way to Cobourg; I was unableto preserve the specimens, and have not travelled that road since. Theflower grew among wild clover on the open side of the road; the leaveswere small, roundish, and of a dark sad green.Of the tall shrubby asters, we have several beautiful varieties, withlarge pale blue lilac, or white flowers; others with very small whiteflowers and crimson anthers, which look like tufts of red down, spangledwith gold-dust; these anthers have a pretty effect, contrasted with thewhite starry petals. There is one variety of the tall asters that I haveseen on the plains, it has flowers about the size of a sixpence, of asoft pearly tint of blue, with brown anthers; this plant grows verytall, and branches from the parent stem in many graceful flowery boughs;the leaves of this species are of a purple red on the under side, andinclining to heart-shape; the leaves and stalks are hairy.I am not afraid of wearying you with my floral sketches, I have yet manyto describe; among these are those elegant little evergreens, thatabound in this country, under the name of winter-greens, of which thereare three or four remarkable for beauty of foliage, flower, and fruit.One of these winter-greens that abounds in our pine-woods is extremelybeautiful; it seldom exceeds six inches in height; the leaves are abright shining green, of a long narrow oval, delicately notched like theedges of a rose-leaf; and the plant emerges from beneath the snow in theearly part of the year, as soon as the first thaw takes place, as freshand verdant as before they were covered up: it seems to be a shyblossomer. I have never seen specimens of the flowers in bloom buttwice; these I carefully preserved for you, but the dried plant willafford but an imperfect idea of the original. You always called, youknow, your dried specimens corpses of plants, and said, that when wellpainted, their representations were far more like themselves. Theflower-stalk rises two or three inches from the centre of the plant, andis crowned with round crimson buds and blossoms, consisting of fivepetals, deepening from the palest pink to the brightest blush colour;the stigma is of an emerald greenness, forming a slightly ribbed turbanin the centre, around which are disposed ten stamens of an amethystcolour: in short, this is one of the gems of the floral world, and mightaptly be compared to an emerald ring, set round with amethysts. Thecontrast of colours in this flower is exceedingly pleasing, and thecrimson buds and shining ever-green leaves are scarcely less to beadmired than the flower; itself it would be considered a greatacquisition to your collection of American shrubs, but I doubt if itwould flourish when removed from the shade of the pine-woods. This plantappears to be the _Chimaphila corymbosa_, or winter-green, described byPursh, with some trifling variation in the colour of the petals.Another of our winter-greens grows in abundance on the Rice-Lake plains;the plant does not exceed four inches; the flowers are in little loosebunches, pale greenish white, in shape like the blossom of the arbutus;the berries are bright scarlet, and are known by the name of winter-berry, and partridge-berry; this must be _Gaultheria procumbens_. But amore beautiful little evergreen of the same species is to be found inour cedar swamps, under the name of pigeon-berry; it resembles thearbutus in leaf and flower more closely than the former plant; thescarlet berry is inserted in a scarlet cup or receptacle, divided at theedge in five points; it is fleshy, seeming to partake of the same natureas the fruit. The blossoms of this elegant little shrub, like thearbutus, of which it looks like the miniature, appear in droopingbunches at the same time the ripened berry of the former year is inperfection; this circumstance adds not a little to the charm of theplant. If I mistake not, this is the _Gualtheria Shallon_, which Purshlikens to the arbutus: this is also one of our winter-greens.There is another pretty trailing plant, with delicate little funnel-shaped flowers, and a profusion of small dark green round buds, slightlyvariegated, and bright red berries, which are produced at theextremities of the branches. The blossoms of this plant grow in pairs,closely connected at the germen, so much so, that the scarlet fruit thatsupersedes the flowers appears like a double berry, each berrycontaining the seeds of both flowers and a double eye. The plant is alsocalled winter-green, or twin-berry; it resembles none of the otherwinter-greens; it grows in mossy woods, trailing along the ground,appearing to delight in covering little hillocks and inequalities of theground. In elegance of growth, delicacy of flower, and brightness ofberry, this winter-green is little inferior to any of the former.There is a plant in our woods, known by the names of man-drake, may-apple, and duck's-foot: the botanical name of the plant is Podophyllum;it belongs to the class and order _Polyandria monogynia_. The blossom isyellowish white, the corolla consisting of six petals; the fruit isoblong; when ripe, of a greenish yellow; in size that of an olive, orlarge damson; when fully ripe it has the flavour of preserved tamarind,a pleasant brisk acid; it appears to be a shy bearer, though itincreases rapidly in rich moist woodlands. The leaves come up singly,are palmated and shade the ground very much when a number of them grownear each other; the stalk supports the leaf from the centre: when theyfirst appear above the ground, they resemble a folded umbrella orparasol, all the edges of the leaves bending downward, by degreesexpanding into a slightly convex canopy. The fruit would make a delicatepreserve with sugar.The lily tribe offer an extensive variety from the most minute to thevery largest flowers. The red martagon grows abundantly on our plains;the dog's tooth violet, _Erythronium_, with its spotted leaves andbending yellow blossom, delicately dashed with crimson spots within, andmarked with fine purple lines on the outer part of the petal, proves agreat attraction in our woods, where these plants increase: they form abeautiful bed; the leaves come up singly, one from each separate tuber.There are two varieties of this flower, the pale yellow, with neitherspots nor lines, and the deep yellow with both; the anthers of this lastare reddish-orange, and thickly covered with a fine powdery substance.The daffodil of our woods is a delicate bending flower, of a paleyellow; the leaves grow up the flower-stalk at intervals; three or moreflowers usually succeed each other at the extremity of the stalk: itsheight is from six to eight inches; it delights in the deep shade ofmoist woods. This seems to unite the description of the jonquil anddaffodil.A very beautiful plant of the lily tribe abounds both in our woods andclearings; for want of a better name, I call it the douri-lily, thoughit is widely spread over a great portion of the continent. The Americansterm the white and red varieties of this species, the "white" and "reddeath." The flower is either deep red, or of a dazzling white, thoughthe latter is often found stained with a delicate blush-pink, or a deepgreen; the latter appears to be caused by the calix running into thepetal. Wherefore it bears so formidable a name has not yet transpired.The flower consists of three petals, the calix three; it belongs to theclass and order _Hexandria monogynia_; style, three-cleft; seed-vesselof three valves; soil, dry woods and cleared lands; leaves growing inthree, springing from the joints, large round, but a little pointed atthe extremities.We have lilies of the valley, and their cousins the Solomon's seals, asmall flowered turk's-cap, of pale primrose colour, with an endlessvariety of small flowers of the lily tribe, remarkable for beauty offoliage or delicacy of form.Our Ferns are very elegant and numerous; I have no less than eightdifferent specimens, gathered from our immediate neighbourhood, some ofwhich are extremely elegant, especially one that I call the "fairyfern," from its lightness. One elastic stem, of a purplish-red colour,supports several light branches, which are subdivided and furnished withinnumerable leaflets; each leaflet has a footstalk, that attaches it tothe branch, of so slight and hair-like a substance that the least breathof air sets the whole plant in motion.Could we but imagine Canada to have been the scene of fairy revels, weshould declare that these graceful ferns were well suited to shade theelfin court of Oberon and Titania.When this fern first appears above the ground, it is scarcely to bedistinguished from the decaying wood of the fallen pines; it is then ofa light reddish brown, curiously curled up. In May and June, the leavesunfold, and soon assume the most delicate tint of green; they are almosttransparent: the cattle are very fond of this fern.The mocassin flower or lady's-slipper (mark the odd coincidence betweenthe common name of the American and English species) is one of our mostremarkable flowers; both on account of its beauty and its singularity ofstructure. Our plains and dry sunny pastures produce several varieties;among these, the _Cypripedium pubescens_, or yellow mocassin, and the_C. Arietinum_ are the most beautiful of the species. The colour of thelip of the former is a lively canary yellow, dashed with deep crimsonspots. The upper petals consist of two short and two long; in textureand colour resembling the sheath of some of the narcissus tribe; theshort ones stand erect, like a pair of ears; the long or lateral pairare three times the length of the former, very narrow, and elegantlytwisted, like the spiral horns of the Walachian ram: on raising a thickyellow fleshy sort of lid, in the middle of the flower, you perceive theexact face of an Indian hound, perfect in all its parts, the eyes, nose,and mouth; below this depends an open sack, slightly gathered round atthe opening, which gives it a hollow and prominent appearance; theinside of this bag is delicately dashed with deep crimson, or blackspots: the stem of the flower is thick towards the upper part, and takesa direct bend; the leaves are large oval, a little pointed and ribbed;the plant scarcely exceeds six inches: the elegant colour and silkentexture of the lower lip or bag renders this flower very much morebeautiful to my taste than the purple and white variety, though thelatter is much more striking on account of the size of the flower andleaves, besides the contrast between the white and red, or white andpurple colours.The formation of this species resembles the other, only with thisdifference, the horns are not twisted, and the face is that of a monkey;even the comical expression of the animal is preserved with suchadmirable fidelity, as to draw a smile from every one that sees the oddrestless-looking visage, with its prominent round black eyes peeringforth from under its covering.These plants belong to class and order _Gynandria diandria_; aredescribed with some little variation by Pursh, who, however, likens theface of the latter to that of a sheep: if a sheep sat for the picture,methinks it must have been the most mischievous of the flock.There is a curious aquatic plant that grows in shallow, stagnant, orslow-flowing waters; it will contain a full wine-glass of water. A poorsoldier brought it to me, and told me it resembled a plant he used tosee in Egypt, that the soldiers called the "Soldier's drinking-cup" andmany a good draught of pure water, he said, I have drank from them.Another specimen was presented me by a gentleman who knew mypredilection for strange plants; he very aptly gave it the name of"Pitcher-plant;" it very probably belongs to the tribe that bear thatname.The flowers that afford the most decided perfumes are our wild roses,which possess a delicious scent: the milk-weed, which gives out a smellnot-unlike the night-blowing stock; the purple monarda, which isfragrance itself from the root to the flower, and even after months'exposure to the wintry atmosphere; its dried leaves and seed-vessels areso sweet as to impart perfume to your hands or clothes. All our Mintsare strong scented: the lily of the valley is remarkable for its finesmell; then there is my queen of the lakes, and her consort, the water-king, with many other flowers I cannot now enumerate. Certain it is thatamong such a vast assemblage of flowers, there are, comparatively, veryfew that are gifted with fragrant scents. Some of our forest-trees giveout a fine perfume. I have often paused in my walks to inhale thefragrance from a cedar swamp on some sunny day while the boughs werestill wet with the dew-drops or recently fallen shower.Nor is the balsam-poplar, or tacamahac, less delightfully fragrant,especially while the gummy buds are just beginning to unfold; this is anelegant growing tree, where it has room to expand into boughs. It growschiefly on the shores of the lakes and in open swamps, but it also formsone of the attractions of our plains, with its silver bark and wavingfoliage; it emits a resinous clear gum in transparent globules on thebark, and the buds are covered with a highly aromatic gummy fluid.Our Grasses are highly interesting; there are varieties that are whollynew to me, and when dried form the most elegant ornaments to ourchimney-pieces, and would look very graceful on a lady's head; onlyfashionists always prefer the artificial to the natural.One or two species of grass that I have gathered bear a close but ofcourse minute resemblance to the Indian corn, having a top feather andeight-sided spike of little grains disposed at the sidejoints. The_sisyrinchium_, or blue-eyed grass, is a pretty little flower of anazure blue, with golden spot at the base of each petal; the leaves areflat, stiff, and flag-like; this pretty flower grows in tufts on lightsandy soils.I have given you a description of the flowers most worthy of attention;and, though it is very probable some of my descriptions may not beexactly in the technical language of the correct botanist, I have atleast described them as they appear.My dear boy seems already to have a taste for flowers, which I shallencourage as much as possible. It is a study that tends to refine andpurify the mind, and can be made, by simple steps, a ladder to heaven,as it were, by teaching a child to look with love and admiration to thatbountiful God who created and made flowers so fair to adorn and fructifythis earth.Farewell, my dear sister.LETTER XV.Recapitulation of various Topics.--Progress of Settlement.--Canada, theLand of Hope.--Visit to the Family of a Naval Officer.--Squirrels.--Visit to, and Story of, an Emigrant Clergyman.--His early Difficulties.--The Temper, Disposition, and Habits of Emigrants essential Ingredientsin Failure or Success.September the 20th, 1834.I PROMISED when I parted from you before I left England to write as soonas I could give you any satisfactory account of our settlement in thiscountry. I shall do my best to redeem that promise, and forward you aslight sketch of our proceedings, with such remarks on the naturalfeatures of the place in which we have fixed our abode, as I thinklikely to afford you interest or amusement. Prepare your patience, then,my dear friend, for a long and rambling epistle, in which I may possiblyprove somewhat of a Will-o'-the-wisp, and having made you follow me inmy desultory wanderings,-- Over hill, over dale,  Through bush, through briar, Over park, over pale,  Through flood, through fire,--Possibly leave you in the midst of a big cedar swamp, or among thepathless mazes of our wild woods, without a clue to guide you, or even a_blaze_ to light you on your way.You will have heard, through my letters to my dear mother, of our safearrival at Quebec, of my illness at Montreal, of all our adventures andmisadventures during our journey up the country, till after much wearywandering we finally found a home and resting-place with a kindrelative, whom it was our happiness to meet after a separation of manyyears.As my husband was anxious to settle in the neighbourhood of one sonearly connected with me, thinking it would rob the woods of some of theloneliness that most women complain so bitterly of, he purchased a lotof land on the shores of a beautiful lake, one of a chain of small lakesbelonging to the Otanabee river.Here, then, we are established, having now some five-and-twenty acrescleared, and a nice house built. Our situation is very agreeable, andeach day increases its value. When we first came up to live in the bush,with the exception of S------, here were but two or three settlers nearus, and no roads cut out. The only road that was available for bringingup goods from the nearest town was on the opposite side of the water,which was obliged to be crossed on a log, or birch-bark canoe; theformer nothing better than a large pine-log hollowed with the axe, so asto contain three or four persons; it is flat-bottomed, and very narrow,on which account it is much used on these shallow waters. The birchcanoe is made of sheets of birch bark, ingeniously fashioned and sewntogether by the Indians with the tough roots of the cedar, young pine,or larch (tamarack, as it is termed by the Indians); it is exceedinglylight, so that it can be carried by two persons easily, or even by one.These, then, were our ferry-boats, and very frail they are, and requiregreat nicety in their management; they are worked in the water withpaddles, either kneeling or standing. The squaws are very expert in themanagement of the canoes, and preserve their balance with admirableskill, standing up while they impel the little bark with great velocitythrough the water.Very great is the change that a few years have effected in oursituation. A number of highly respectable settlers have purchased landalong the shores of these lakes, so that we no longer want society. Theroads are now cut several miles above us, and though far from good canbe travelled by waggons and sleighs, and are, at all events, better thannone.A village has started up where formerly a thick pine-wood covered theground; we have now within a short distance of us an excellent saw-mill,a grist-mill, and store, with a large tavern and many good dwellings. Afine timber bridge, on stone piers, was erected last year to connect theopposite townships and lessen the distance to and from Peterborough; andthough it was unfortunately swept away early last spring by the unusualrising of the Otanabee lakes, a new and more substantial one has risenupon the ruins of the former, through the activity of an enterprisingyoung Scotchman, the founder of the village.But the grand work that is, sooner or later, to raise this portion ofthe district from its present obscurity, is the opening a line ofnavigation from Lake Huron through Lake Simcoe, and so through our chainof small lakes to Rice Lake, and finally through the Trent to the Bay ofQuinte. This noble work would prove of incalculable advantage, byopening a direct communication between Lake Huron and the inlandtownships at the back of the Ontario with the St. Laurence. This projecthas already been under the consideration of the Governor, and is atpresent exciting great interest in the country: sooner or later there islittle doubt but that it will be carried into effect. It presents somedifficulties and expense, but it would be greatly to the advantage andprosperity of the country, and be the means of settling many of the backtownships bordering upon these lakes.I must leave it to abler persons than myself to discuss at large thepolicy and expediency of the measure; but as I suppose you have nointention of emigrating to our backwoods, you will be contented with mycursory view of the matter, and believe, as in friendship you are boundto do, that it is a desirable thing to open a market for inland produce.Canada is the land of hope; here every thing is new; every thing goingforward; it is scarcely possible for arts, sciences, agriculture,manufactures, to retrograde; they must keep advancing; though in somesituations the progress may seem slow, in others they are proportionablyrapid.There is a constant excitement on the minds of emigrants, particularlyin the partially settled townships, that greatly assists in keeping themfrom desponding. The arrival of some enterprising person gives astimulus to those about him: a profitable speculation is started, andlo, the value of the land in the vicinity rises to double and treblewhat it was thought worth before; so that, without any design ofbefriending his neighbours, the schemes of one settler being carriedinto effect shall benefit a great number. We have already felt thebeneficial effect of the access of respectable emigrants locatingthemselves in this township, as it has already increased the value ofour own land in a three-fold degree.All this, my dear friend, you will say is very well, and might affordsubject for a wise discussion between grave men, but will hardly amuseus women; so pray turn to some other theme, and just tell me how youcontrive to pass your time among the bears and wolves of Canada.One lovely day last June I went by water to visit the bride of a youngnaval officer, who had purchased a very pretty lot of land some twomiles higher up the lake; our party consisted of my husband, baby, andmyself; we met a few pleasant friends, and enjoyed our excursion much.Dinner was laid out in the _stoup_, which, as you may not know what ismeant by the word, I must tell you that it means a sort of wideverandah, supported on pillars, often of unbarked logs; the floor iseither of earth beaten hard, or plank; the roof covered with sheets ofbark or else shingled. These stoups are of Dutch origin, and wereintroduced, I have been told, by the first Dutch settlers in the states,since which they have found their way all over the colonies.Wreathed with the scarlet creeper, a native plant of our woods andwilds, the wild vine, and also with the hop, which here growsluxuriantly, with no labour or attention to its culture, these stoupshave a very rural appearance; in summer serving the purpose of an openante-room, in which you can take your meals and enjoy the fanning breezewithout being inconvenienced by the extreme heat of the noon-day sun.The situation of the house was remarkably well chosen, just on thesummit of a little elevated plain, the ground sloping with a steepdescent to a little valley, at the bottom of which a bright rill ofwater divided the garden from the opposite corn-fields, which clothed acorresponding bank. In front of the stoup, where we dined, the gardenwas laid out with a smooth plot of grass, surrounded with borders offlowers, and separated from a ripening field of wheat by a light railedfence, over which the luxuriant hop-vine flung its tendrils and gracefulblossoms. Now I must tell you the hop is cultivated for the purpose ofmaking a barm for raising bread. As you take great interest inhousewifery concerns, I shall send you a recipe for what we call hop-rising*. [* See Appendix.]The Yankees use a fermentation of salt, flour, and warm water or milk;but though the _salt-rising_ makes beautiful bread to look at, being farwhiter and firmer than the hop-yeast bread, there is a peculiar flavourimparted to the flour that does not please every one's taste, and it isvery difficult to get your salt-rising to work in very cold weather.And now, having digressed while I gave you my recipes, I shall step backto my party within the stoup, which, I can assure you, was verypleasant, and most cordially disposed to enjoy the meeting. We had booksand drawings, and good store of pretty Indian toys, the collection ofmany long voyages to distant shores, to look at and admire. Soon aftersun-set we walked down through the woods to the landing at the lakeshore, where we found our bark canoe ready to convey us home.During our voyage, just at the head of the rapids, our attention wasdrawn to some small object in the water, moving very swiftly along;there were various opinions as to the swimmer, some thinking it to be awater-snake, others a squirrel, or a musk-rat; a few swift strokes ofthe paddles brought us up so as to intercept the passage of the littlevoyager; it proved to be a fine red squirrel, bound on a voyage ofdiscovery from a neighbouring island. The little animal, with a courageand address that astonished his pursuers, instead of seeking safety in adifferent direction, sprung lightly on the point of the uplifted paddle,and from thence with a bound to the head of my astonished baby, andhaving gained my shoulder, leaped again into the water, and made directfor the shore, never having deviated a single point from the line he wasswimming in when he first came in sight of our canoe. I was surprisedand amused by the agility and courage displayed by this innocentcreature; I could hardly have given credence to the circumstance, had Inot been an eye-witness of its conduct, and moreover been wettedplentifully on my shoulder by the sprinkling of water from his coat.Perhaps you may think my squirrel anecdote incredible; but I can vouchfor the truth of it on my own personal experience, as I not only saw butalso felt it: the black squirrels are most lovely and elegant animals,considerably larger than the red, the grey, and the striped: the latterare called by the Indians "chit-munks."We were robbed greatly by these little depredators last summer; the redsquirrels used to carry off great quantities of our Indian corn not onlyfrom the stalks, while the crop was ripening, but they even came intothe house through some chinks in the log-walls, and carried off vastquantities of the grain, stripping it very adroitly from the cob, andconveying the grain away to their storehouses in some hollow 1og orsubterranean granary.These little animals are very fond of the seeds of the pumpkins, and youwill see the soft creatures whisking about among the cattle, carryingaway the seeds as they are scattered by the beasts in breaking thepumpkins: they also delight in the seeds of the sunflowers, which growto a gigantic height in our gardens and clearings. The fowls areremarkably fond of the sunflower-seeds, and I saved the plants with theintention of laying up a good store of winter food for my poor chicks.One day I went to cut the ripe heads, the largest of which was the sizeof a large dessert-plate, but found two wicked red squirrels busilyemployed gathering in the seeds, not for me, be sure, but themselves.Not contented with picking out the seeds, these little thievesdexterously sawed through the stalks, and conveyed away whole heads atonce: so bold were they that they would not desist when I approachedtill they had secured their object, and, encumbered with a load twicethe weight of their own agile bodies, ran with a swiftness along therails, and over root, stump, and log, till they eluded my pursuit.[Illustration: Red-squirrel]Great was the indignation expressed by this thrifty little pair onreturning again for another load to find the plant divested of theheads. I had cut what remained and put them in a basket in the sun, on asmall block in the garden, close to the open glass-door, on the steps ofwhich I was sitting shelling some seed-beans, when the squirrels drew myattention to them by their sharp scolding notes, elevating their finefeathery tails and expressing the most lively indignation at theinvasion: they were not long before they discovered the Indian basketwith the ravished treasure; a few rapid movements brought the littlepair to the rails within a few paces of me and the sunflower-heads;here, then, they paused, and sitting up looked in my face with the mostimploring gestures. I was too much amused by their perplexity to helpthem, but turning away my head to speak to the child, they dartedforward, and in another minute had taken possession of one of thelargest of the heads, which they conveyed away, first one carrying it afew yards, then the other, it being too bulky for one alone to carry itfar at a time. In short, I was so well amused by watching theirmanoeuvres that I suffered them to rob me of all my store. I saw alittle family of tiny squirrels at play in the spring on the top of ahollow log, and really I think they were, without exception, theliveliest, most graceful creatures I ever looked upon.The flying squirrel is a native of our woods, and exceeds in beauty, tomy mind, any of the tribe. Its colour is the softest, most delicate tintof grey; the fur thick and short, and as silken as velvet; the eyes likeall the squirrel kind, are large, full, and soft; the whiskers and longhair about the nose black; the membrane that assists this little animalin its flight is white and delicately soft in texture, like the fur ofthe chinchilla; it forms a ridge of fur between the fore and hind legs;the tail is like an elegant broad grey feather. I was agreeablysurprised by the appearance of this exquisite little creature; thepictures I had seen giving it a most inelegant and _batlike_ look,almost disgusting. The young ones are easily tamed, and are very playfuland affectionate when under confinement.[Illustration: Flying Squirrel]How my little friend Emily would delight in such a pet! Tell her if everI should return to dear old England, I will try to procure one for her;but at present she must be contented with the stuffed specimens of theblack, red, and striped squirrels which I enclose in my parcel. I wish Icould offer you any present more valuable, but our arts and manufacturesbeing entirely British, with the exception of the Indians' toys, Ishould find it a difficult matter to send you any thing worth yourattention; therefore I am obliged to have recourse to the naturalproductions of our woods as tokens of remembrance to our friends _athome_, for it is ever thus we speak of the land of our birth.You wish to know if I am happy and contented in my situation, or if myheart pines after my native land. I will answer you candidly, and saythat, as far as regards matters of taste, early association, and allthose holy ties of kindred, and old affections that make "home" in allcountries, and among all nations in the world, a hallowed spot, I mustever give the preference to Britain.On the other hand, a sense of the duties I have chosen, and a feeling ofconformity to one's situation, lessen the regret I might be inclined toindulge in. Besides, there are new and delightful ties that bind me toCanada: I have enjoyed much domestic happiness since I came hither;--andis it not the birthplace of my dear child? Have I not here first tastedthe rapturous delight arising from maternal feelings? When my eye restson my smiling darling, or I feel his warm breath upon my cheek, I wouldnot exchange the joy that fills my breast for any pleasure the worldcould offer me. "But this feeling is not confined to the solitude ofyour Canadian forests, my dear friend," you will say. I know it; buthere there is nothing to interfere with your little nursling. You arenot tempted by the pleasures of a gay world to forget your duties as amother; there is nothing to supplant him in your heart; his presenceendears every place; and you learn to love the spot that gave him birth,and to think with complacency upon the country, because it is _his_country; and in looking forward to his future welfare you naturallybecome doubly interested in the place that is one day to be his.Perhaps I rather estimate the country by my own feelings; and when Ifind, by impartial survey of my present life, that I am to the full ashappy, if not really happier, than I was in the old country, I cannotbut value it.Possibly, if I were to enter into a detail of the advantages I possess,they would appear of a very negative character in the eyes of personsrevelling in all the splendour and luxury that wealth could procure, ina country in which nature and art are so eminently favourable towardswhat is usually termed the pleasures of life; but I never was a votaryat the shrine of luxury or fashion. A round of company, a routine ofpleasure, were to me sources of weariness, if not of disgust. "There'snothing in all this to satisfy the heart," says Schiller; and I admitthe force of the sentiment.I was too much inclined to spurn with impatience the fetters thatetiquette and fashion are wont to impose on society, till they rob itsfollowers of all freedom and independence of will; and they soon areobliged to live for a world that in secret they despise and loathe, fora world, too, that usually regards them with contempt, because they darenot act with an independence, which would be crushed directly it wasdisplayed.And I must freely confess to you that I do prize and enjoy my presentliberty in this country exceedingly: in this we possess an advantageover you, and over those that inhabit the towns and villages in _this_country, where I see a ridiculous attempt to keep up an appearance thatis quite foreign to the situation of those that practise it. Few, veryfew, are the emigrants that come to the colonies, unless it is with theview of realising an independence for themselves or their children.Those that could afford to live in ease at home, believe me, would neverexpose themselves to the privations and disagreeable consequences of asettler's life in Canada: therefore, this is the natural inference wedraw, that the emigrant has come hither under the desire and naturalhope of bettering his condition, and benefiting a family that he has notthe means of settling in life in the home country. It is foolish, then,to launch out in a style of life that every one knows cannot bemaintained; rather ought such persons to rejoice in the consciousnessthat they can, if they please, live according to their circumstances,without being the less regarded for the practice of prudence, economy,and industry.Now, we _bush-settlers_ are more independent: we do what we like; wedress as we find most suitable and most convenient; we are totallywithout the fear of any Mr. or Mrs. Grundy; and having shaken off thetrammels of Grundyism, we laugh at the absurdity of those whovoluntarily forge afresh and hug their chains.If our friends come to visit us unexpectedly we make them welcome to ourhumble homes, and give them the best we have; but if our fare beindifferent, we offer it with good will, and no apologies are made orexpected: they would be out of place; as every one is aware of thedisadvantages of a new settlement; and any excuses for want of variety,or the delicacies of the table, would be considered rather in the lightof a tacit reproof to your guest for having unseasonably put yourhospitality to the test.Our society is mostly military or naval; so that we meet on equalgrounds, and are, of course, well acquainted with the rules of goodbreeding and polite life; too much so to allow any deviation from thoselaws that good taste, good sense, and good feeling have establishedamong persons of our class.Yet here it is considered by no means derogatory to the wife of anofficer or gentleman to assist in the work of the house, or to performits entire duties if occasion requires it; to understand the mystery ofsoap, candle, and sugar-making; to make bread, butter, and cheese, oreven to milk her own cows; to knit and spin, and prepare the wool forthe loom. In these matters we bush-ladies have a wholesome disregard ofwhat Mr. or Mrs. So-and-so thinks or says. We pride ourselves onconforming to circumstances; and as a British officer must needs be agentleman and his wife a lady, perhaps we repose quietly on thatincontestable proof of our gentility, and can afford to be usefulwithout injuring it.Our husbands adopt a similar line of conduct: the officer turns hissword into a ploughshare, and his lance into a sickle; and if he be seenploughing among the stumps in his own field, or chopping trees on hisown land, no one thinks less of his dignity, or considers him less of agentleman, than when he appeared upon parade in all the pride ofmilitary etiquette, with sash, sword and epaulette. Surely this is as itshould be in a country where independence is inseparable from industry;and for this I prize it.Among many advantages we in this township possess, it is certainly noinconsiderable one that the lower or working class of settlers are welldisposed, and quite free from the annoying Yankee manners thatdistinguish many of the earlier-settled townships. Our servants are asrespectful, or nearly so, as those at home; nor are they admitted to ourtables, or placed on an equality with us, excepting at "bees," and suchkinds of public meetings; when they usually conduct themselves with apropriety that would afford an example to some that call themselvesgentlemen, viz., young men who voluntarily throw aside those restraintsthat society expects from persons filling a respectable situation.Intemperance is too prevailing a vice among all ranks of people in thiscountry; but I blush to say it belongs most decidedly to those thatconsider themselves among the better class of emigrants. Let none suchcomplain of the airs of equality displayed towards them by the labouringclass, seeing that they degrade themselves below the honest, sobersettler, however poor. If the sons of gentlemen lower themselves, nowonder if the sons of poor men endeavour to exalt themselves about himin a country where they all meet on equal ground; and good conduct isthe distinguishing mark between the classes.Some months ago, when visiting a friend in a distant part of thecountry, I accompanied her to stay a few days in the house of a residentclergyman, curate of a flourishing village in the township of ------. Iwas struck by the primitive simplicity of the mansion and itsinhabitants. We were introduced into the little family sitting-room, thefloor of which was painted after the Yankee fashion; instead of beingcarpeted, the walls were of unornamented deal, and the furniture of theroom of corresponding plainness. A large spinning-wheel, as big as acart-wheel, nearly occupied the centre of the room, at which a neatly-dressed matron, of mild and lady-like appearance, was engaged spinningyarn; her little daughters were knitting beside the fire, while theirfather was engaged in the instruction of two of his sons; a third wasseated affectionately in a little straw chair between his feet, while afourth was plying his axe with nervous strokes in the court-yard,casting from time to time wistful glances through the parlour-window atthe party within.The dresses of the children were of a coarse sort of stuff, a mixture ofwoollen and thread, the produce of the farm and their mother'spraiseworthy industry. The stockings, socks, muffatees, and warmcomforters were all of home manufacture. Both girls and boys woremocassins, of their own making: good sense, industry, and order presidedamong the members of this little household.Both girls and boys seemed to act upon the principle, that nothing isdisgraceful but that which is immoral and improper.Hospitality without extravagance, kindness without insincerity ofspeech, marked the manners of our worthy friends. Every thing in thehouse was conducted with attention to prudence and comfort. The livingwas but small (the income arising from it, I should have said), butthere was glebe land, and a small dwelling attached to it, and, by dintof active exertion without-doors, and economy and good managementwithin, the family were maintained with respectability: in short, weenjoyed during our sojourn many of the comforts of a cleared farm;poultry of every kind, beef of their own killing, excellent mutton andpork: we had a variety of preserves at our tea-table, with honey in thecomb, delicious butter, and good cheese, with divers sorts of cakes; akind of little pancake, made from the flour of buck-wheat, which aremade in a batter, and raised with barm, afterwards dropped into boilinglard, and fried; also a preparation made of Indian corn-flour, calledsupporne-cake, which is fried in slices, and eaten with maple-syrup,were among the novelties of our breakfast-fare.I was admiring a breed of very fine fowls in the poultry-yard onemorning, when my friend smiled and said, "I do not know if you willthink I came honestly by them.""I am sure you did not acquire them by dishonest means," I replied,laughing; "I will vouch for your principles in that respect.""Well," replied my hostess, "they were neither given me, nor sold to me,and I did not steal them. I found the original stock in the followingmanner. An old black hen most unexpectedly made her appearance onespring morning at our door; we hailed the stranger with surprise anddelight; for we could not muster a single domestic fowl among our littlecolony at that time. We never rightly knew by what means the hen cameinto our possession, but suppose some emigrant's family going up thecountry must have lost or left her; she laid ten eggs, and hatchedchickens from them; from this little brood we raised a stock, and soonsupplied all our neighbours with fowls. We prize the breed, not only onaccount of its fine size, but from the singular, and, as we thought,providential, manner in which we obtained it."I was much interested in the slight sketch given by the pastor oneevening, as we all assembled round the blazing log-fire, that was piledhalf-way up the chimney, which reared its stone fabric so as to formdeep recesses at either side of its abutments.Alluding to his first settlement, he observed, "it was a desolatewilderness of gloomy and unbroken forest-trees when we first pitched ourtent here: at that time an axe had not been laid to the root of a tree,nor a fire, save by the wandering Indians, kindled in these woods."I can now point out the identical spot where my wife and little onesate their first meal, and raised their feeble voices in thankfulness tothat Almighty and merciful Being who had preserved them through theperils of the deep, and brought them in safety to this vast solitude."We were a little flock wandering in a great wilderness, under thespecial protection of our mighty Shepherd."I have heard you, my dear young lady," he said, addressing thecompanion of my visit, "talk of the hardships of the bush; but, let metell you, you know but little of its privations compared with those thatcame hither some years ago."Ask these, my elder children and my wife, what were the hardships of abush-settler's life ten years ago, and they will tell you it was toendure cold, hunger, and all its accompanying evils; to know at timesthe want of every necessary article of food. As to the luxuries anddelicacies of life, we saw them not;--how could we? we were far removedfrom the opportunity of obtaining these things: potatoes, pork, andflour were our only stores, and often we failed of the two latter beforea fresh supply could be procured. We had not mills nearer than thirteenmiles, through roads marked only by blazed lines; nor were there at thattime any settlers near us. Now you see us in a cleared country,surrounded with flourishing farms and rising villages; but at the time Ispeak of it was not so: there were no stores of groceries or goods, nobutchers' shops, no cleared farms, dairies, nor orchards; for thesethings we had to wait with patience till industry should raise them."Our fare knew no other variety than salt pork, potatoes, and sometimesbread, for breakfast; pork and potatoes for dinner; pork and potatoesfor supper; with a porridge of Indian corn-flour for the children.Sometimes we had the change of pork without potatoes, and potatoeswithout pork; this was the first year's fare: by degrees we got a supplyof flour of our own growing, but bruised into a coarse meal with a hand-mill; for we had no water or windmills within many miles of our colony,and good bread was indeed a luxury we did not often have."We brought a cow with us, who gave us milk during the spring andsummer; but owing to the wild garlic (a wild herb, common to our woods),on which she fed, her milk was scarcely palatable, and for want ofshelter and food, she died the following winter, greatly to our sorrow:we learned experience in this and in many other matters at a hard cost;but now we can profit by it.""Did not the difficulties of your first settlement incline you todespond, and regret that you had ever embarked on a life so different tothat you had been used to?" I asked."They might have had that effect had not a higher motive than mereworldly advancement actuated me in leaving my native country to comehither. Look you, it was thus: I had for many years been the pastor of asmall village in the mining districts of Cumberland. I was dear to thehearts of my people, and they were my joy and crown in the Lord. Anumber of my parishioners, pressed by poverty and the badness of thetimes, resolved on emigrating to Canada."Urged by a natural and not unlawful desire of bettering theircondition, they determined on crossing the Atlantic, encouraged by theoffer of considerable grants of wild land, which at that period werefreely awarded by Government to persons desirous of becoming colonists."But previous to this undertaking, several of the most respectable cameto me, and stated their views and reasons for the momentous step theywere about to take; and at the same time besought me in the most movingterms, in the name of the rest of their emigrant friends, to accompanythem into the Wilderness of the West, lest they should forget their Lordand Saviour when abandoned to their own spiritual guidance."At first I was startled at the proposition; it seemed a wild andvisionary scheme: but by degrees I began to dwell with pleasure on thesubject. I had few ties beyond my native village; the income arisingfrom my curacy was too small to make it any great obstacle: likeGoldsmith's curate, I was     'Passing rich with forty pounds a year.'My heart yearned after my people; ten years I had been their guide andadviser. I was the friend of the old, and the teacher of the young. MyMary was chosen from among them; she had no foreign ties to make herlook back with regret upon the dwellers of the land in distant places;her youth and maturity had been spent among these very people; so thatwhen I named to her the desire of my parishioners, and she alsoperceived that my own wishes went with them, she stifled any regretfulfeeling that might have arisen in her breast, and replied to me in thewords of Ruth:--"'Thy country shall be my country; thy people shall be my people; wherethou diest will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me,and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.'"A tender and affectionate partner hast thou been to me, Mary," headded, turning his eyes affectionately on the mild and dignified matron,whose expressive countenance bespoke with more eloquence than words thefeelings passing in her mind. She replied not by words, but I saw thebig bright tears fall on the work she held in her hand. They sprang fromemotions too sacred to be profaned by intrusive eyes, and I hastilyaverted my glance from her face; while the pastor proceeded to narratethe particulars of their leaving England, their voyage, and finally,their arrival in the land that had been granted to the little colony inthe then unbroken part of the township of ------."We had obtained a great deal of useful advice and assistance from theGovernment agents previous to our coming up hither, and also hired somechoppers at high wages to initiate us in the art of felling, logging,burning, and clearing the ground; as it was our main object to get incrops of some kind, we turned to without any delay further than what wasnecessary for providing a temporary shelter for our wives and children,and prepared the ground for spring crops, helping each other as we couldwith the loan of oxen and labour. And here I must observe, that Iexperienced every attention and consideration from my friends. My meanswere small, and my family all too young to render me any service;however, I lacked not help, and had the satisfaction of seeing a littlespot cleared for the growth of potatoes and corn, which I could not haveeffected by my single exertions."My biggest boy John was but nine years old, Willie seven, and theothers still more helpless; the two little ones you see there," pointingto two young children, "have been born since we came hither. Thatyellow-haired lassie knitting beside you was a babe at the breast;--ahelpless, wailing infant, so weak and sickly before we came here thatshe was scarcely ever out of her mother's arms; but she grew and throverapidly under the rough treatment of a bush-settler's family."We had no house built, or dwelling of any kind to receive us when wearrived at our destination; and the first two nights were passed on thebanks of the creek that flows at the foot of the hill, in a hut of cedarand hemlock boughs that I cut with my axe, and, with the help of some ofmy companions, raised to shelter my wife and the little ones."Though it was the middle of May the nights were chilly, and we wereglad to burn a pile of wood in front of our hut to secure us from theeffects of the cold and the stings of the mosquitoes, that came up inmyriads from the stream, and which finally drove us higher up the bank."As soon as possible we raised a shanty, which now serves as a shed formy young cattle; I would not pull it down, though often urged to do so,as it stands in the way of a pleasant prospect from the window; but Ilike to look on it, and recall to mind the first years I passed beneathits lowly roof. We need such mementos to remind us of our former state;but we grow proud, and cease to appreciate our present comforts."Our first Sabbath was celebrated in the open air: my pulpit was a pileof rude logs; my church the deep shade of the forest, beneath which weassembled ourselves; but sincerer or more fervent devotion I neverwitnessed than that day. I well remember the text I chose, for myaddress to them was from the viiith chapter of Deuteronomy, the 6th,7th, and 9th verses, which appeared to me applicable to ourcircumstances."The following year we raised a small blockhouse, which served as aschool-house and church. At first our progress in clearing the land wasslow, for we had to buy experience, and many and great were thedisappointments and privations that befel us during the first few years.One time we were all ill with ague, and not one able to help the other;this was a sad time; but better things were in store for us. The tide ofemigration increased, and the little settlement we had formed began tobe well spoken of. One man came and built a saw mill; a grist-millfollowed soon after; and then one store and then another, till we behelda flourishing village spring up around us. Then the land began toincrease in value, and many of the first settlers sold their lots toadvantage, and retreated further up the woods. As the village increased,so, of course, did my professional duties, which had for the first fewyears been paid for in acts of kindness and voluntary labour by mylittle flock; now I have the satisfaction of reaping a reward withoutproving burdensome to my parishioners. My farm is increasing, andbesides the salary arising from my curacy I have something additionalfor the school, which is paid by Government. We may now say it is goodfor us to be here, seeing that God has been pleased to send down ablessing upon us."I have forgotten many very interesting particulars relating to thetrials and shifts this family were put to in the first few years; butthe pastor told us enough to make me quite contented with my lot, and Ireturned home, after some days' pleasant sojourn with this delightfulfamily, with an additional stock of contentment, and some useful andpractical knowledge, that I trust I shall be the better for all my life.I am rather interested in a young lad that has come out from England tolearn Canadian farming.The poor boy had conceived the most romantic notions of a settler'slife, partly from the favourable accounts he had read, and partlythrough the medium of a lively imagination, which had aided in thedeception, and led him to suppose that his time would be chiefly spentin the fascinating amusements and adventures arising from hunting theforest in search of deer and other game, pigeon and duck-shooting,spearing fish by torchlight, and voyaging on the lakes in a birch-barkcanoe in summer, skating in winter, or gliding over the frozen snow likea Laplander in his sledge, wrapped up to the eyes in furs, andtravelling at the rate of twelve miles an hour to the sound of anharmonious peal of bells. What a felicitous life to captivate the mindof a boy of fourteen, just let loose from the irksome restraint ofboarding-school!How little did he dream of the drudgery inseparable from the duties of alad of his age, in a country where the old and young, the master and theservant, are alike obliged to labour for a livelihood, without respectto former situation or rank!Here the son of the gentleman becomes a hewer of wood and drawer ofwater; he learns to chop down trees, to pile brush-heaps, split railsfor fences, attend the fires during the burning season, dressed in acoarse over-garment of hempen cloth, called a logging-shirt, withtrousers to correspond, and a Yankee straw hat flapped over his eyes,and a handspike to assist him in rolling over the burning brands. Totend and drive oxen, plough, sow, plant Indian corn and pumpkins, andraise potatoe-hills, are among some of the young emigrant'saccomplishments. His relaxations are but comparatively few, but they areseized with a relish and avidity that give them the greater charm.You may imagine the disappointment felt by the poor lad on seeing hisfair visions of amusement fade before the dull realities and distastefuldetails of a young settler's occupation in the backwoods.Youth, however, is the best season for coming to this country; the mindsoon bends itself to its situation, and becomes not only reconciled, butin time pleased with the change of life. There is a consolation, too, inseeing that he does no more than others of equal pretensions as to rankand education are obliged to submit to, if they would prosper; andperhaps he lives to bless the country which has robbed him of a portionof that absurd pride that made him look with contempt on those whoseoccupations were of a humble nature. It were a thousand pities wilfullyto deceive persons desirous of emigrating with false and flatteringpictures of the advantages to be met with in this country. Let the _pro_and _con_ be fairly stated, and let the reader use his best judgment,unbiassed by prejudice or interest in a matter of such vital importancenot only as regards himself, but the happiness and welfare of those overwhose destinies Nature has made him the guardian. It is, however, farmore difficult to write on the subject of emigration than most personsthink: it embraces so wide a field that what would be perfectly correctas regards one part of the province would by no means prove so asregarded another. One district differs from another, and one townshipfrom another, according to its natural advantages; whether it be longsettled or unsettled, possessing water privileges or not; the soil andeven the climate will be different, according to situation andcircumstances.Much depends on the tempers, habits, and dispositions of the emigrantsthemselves. What suits one will not another; one family will flourish,and accumulate every comfort about their homesteads, while otherslanguish in poverty and discontent. It would take volumes to discussevery argument for and against, and to point out exactly who are and whoare not fit subjects for emigration.Have you read Dr. Dunlop's spirited and witty "Backwoodsman?" If youhave not, get it as soon as you can; it will amuse you. I think aBackwoods-woman might be written in the same spirit, setting forth a fewpages, in the history of bush-ladies, as examples for our sex. Indeed,we need some wholesome admonitions on our duties and the folly ofrepining at following and sharing the fortunes of our spouses, whom wehave vowed in happier hours to love "in riches and in poverty, insickness and in health." Too many pronounce these words without heedingtheir importance, and without calculating the chances that may put theirfaithfulness to the severe test of quitting home, kindred, and country,to share the hard lot of a settler's life; for even this sacrificerenders it hard to be borne; but the truly attached wife will do this,and more also, if required by the husband of her choice.But now it is time I say farewell: my dull letter, grown to a formidablepacket, will tire you, and make you wish it at the bottom of theAtlantic.LETTER XVI.Indian Hunters.--Sail in a Canoe.--Want of Libraries in the Backwoods.--New Village.--Progress of Improvement.--Fire-flies.HAVING in a former letter given you some account of a winter visit tothe Indians, I shall now give a short sketch of their summer encampment,which I went to see one beautiful afternoon in June, accompanied by myhusband and some friends that had come in to spend the day with us.The Indians were encamped on a little peninsula jutting out between twosmall lakes; our nearest path would have been through the bush, but theground was so encumbered by fallen trees that we agreed to go in acanoe. The day was warm, without being oppressively hot, as it too oftenis during the summer months: and for a wonder the mosquitoes and black-flies were so civil as not to molest us. Our light bark skimmed gailyover the calm waters, beneath the overhanging shade of cedars, hemlock,and balsams, that emitted a delicious fragrance as the passing breezeswept through the boughs. I was in raptures with a bed of blue irisesmixed with snow-white water-lilies that our canoe passed over. Turningthe stony bank that formed the point, we saw the thin blue smoke of thecamp curling above the trees, and soon our canoe was safely mooredalongside of those belonging to the Indians, and by help of thestraggling branches and underwood I contrived to scramble up a steeppath, and soon found myself in front of the tent. It was a Sundayafternoon; all the men were at home; some of the younger branches of thefamilies (for there were three that inhabited the wigwam) were amusingthemselves with throwing the tomahawk at a notch cut in the bark of adistant tree, or shooting at a mark with their bows and arrows, whilethe elders reposed on their blankets within the shade, some reading,others smoking, and gravely eyeing the young rival marksmen at theirfeats of skill.Only one of the squaws was at home; this was my old acquaintance thehunter's wife, who was sitting on a blanket; her youngest, little David,a papouse of three years, who was not yet weaned, was reposing betweenher feet; she often eyed him with looks of great affection, and pattedhis shaggy head from time to time. Peter, who is a sort of great man,though not a chief, sat beside his spouse, dressed in a handsome bluesurtout-coat, with a red worsted sash about his waist. He was smoking ashort pipe, and viewing the assembled party at the door of the tent withan expression of quiet interest; sometimes he lifted his pipe for aninstant to give a sort of inward exclamation at the success or failureof his sons' attempts to hit the mark on the tree. The old squaw, assoon as she saw me, motioned me forward, and pointing to a vacantportion of her blanket, with a good-natured smile, signed for me to sitbeside her, which I did, and amused myself with taking note of theinterior of the wigwam and its inhabitants. The building was of anoblong form, open at both ends, but at night I was told the openingswere closed by blankets; the upper part of the roof was also open; thesides were rudely fenced with large sheets of birch bark, drawn in andout between the sticks that made the frame-work of the tent; a longslender pole of iron-wood formed a low beam, from which depended sundryiron and brass pots and kettles, also some joints of fresh-killedvenison and dried fish; the fires occupied the centre of the hut, aroundthe embers of which reposed several meek deer-hounds; they evincedsomething of the quiet apathy of their masters, merely opening theireyes to look upon the intruders, and seeing all was well returned totheir former slumbers, perfectly unconcerned by our entrance.The hunter's family occupied one entire side of the building, whileJoseph Muskrat with his family, and Joseph Bolans and his squaw sharedthe opposite one, their several apartments being distinguished by theirblankets, fishing-spears, rifles, tomahawks, and other property; as tothe cooking utensils they seemed from their scarcity to be held incommon among them; perfect amity appeared among the three families; and,if one might judge from outward appearance, they seemed happy andcontented. On examining the books that were in the hands of the youngmen, they proved to be hymns and tracts, one side printed in English,the other the Indian translation. In compliance with our wishes the mensang one of the hymns, which sounded very well, but we missed the sweetvoices of the Indian girls, whom I had left in front of the house,sitting on a pine-log and amusing themselves with my baby, and seeminghighly delighted with him and his nurse.Outside the tent the squaw showed me a birch-bark canoe that wasbuilding; the shape of the canoe is marked out by sticks stuck in theground at regular distances; the sheets of bark being wetted, andsecured in their proper places by cedar laths, which are bent so as toserve the purpose of ribs or timbers; the sheets of bark are stitchedtogether with the tough roots of the tamarack, and the edges of thecanoe also sewed or laced over with the same material; the whole is thenvarnished over with a thick gum.I had the honour of being paddled home by Mrs. Peter in a new canoe,just launched, and really the motion was delightful; seated at thebottom of the little bark, on a few light hemlock boughs, I enjoyed myvoyage home exceedingly. The canoe, propelled by the Amazonian arm ofthe swarthy matron, flew swiftly over the waters, and I was soon landedin a little cove within a short distance from my own door. In return forthe squaw's civility I delighted her by a present of a few beads forworking mocassins and knife-sheaths, with which she seemed very wellpleased, carefully securing her treasure by tying them in a corner ofher blanket with a bit of thread.With a peculiar reserve and gravity of temper, there is at the same timea degree of childishness about the Indians in some things. I gave thehunter and his son one day some coloured prints, which they seemedmightily taken with, laughing immoderately at some of the fashionablydressed figures. When they left the house they seated themselves on afallen tree, and called their hounds round them, displaying to eachseverally the pictures.The poor animals, instead of taking a survey of the gaily dressed ladiesand gentlemen, held up their meek heads and licked their masters' handsand faces; but old Peter was resolved the dogs should share theamusement of looking at the pictures and turned their faces to them,holding them fast by their long ears when they endeavoured to escape. Icould hardly have supposed the grave Indian capable of such childishbehaviour.These Indians appear less addicted to gay and tinselly adornments thanformerly, and rather affect a European style in their dress; it is nounusual sight to see an Indian habited in a fine cloth coat andtrousers, though I must say the blanket-coats provided for them byGovernment, and which form part of their annual presents, are far moresuitable and becoming. The squaws, too, prefer cotton or stuff gowns,aprons and handkerchiefs, and such useful articles, to any sort offinery, though they like well enough to look at and admire them; theydelight nevertheless in decking out the little ones, embroidering theircradle wrappings with silks and beads, and tacking the wings of birds totheir shoulders. I was a little amused by the appearance of one of theseIndian Cupids, adorned with the wings of the American war-bird; a verybeautiful creature, something like our British bullfinch, only far morelively in plumage: the breast and under-feathers of the wings being atint of the most brilliant carmine, shaded with black and white. Thisbird has been called the "war-bird," from its having first made itsappearance in this province during the late American war; a fact that Ibelieve is well authenticated, or at any rate has obtained generalcredence.I could hardly help smiling at your notion that we in the backwoods canhave easy access to a circulation library. In one sense, indeed, you arenot so far from truth, for every settler's library may be called acirculating one, as their books are sure to pass from friend to friendin due rotation; and, fortunately for us, we happen to have severalexcellently furnished ones in our neighbourhood, which are always opento us. There is a public library at York, and a small circulatinglibrary at Cobourg, but they might just as well be on the other side ofthe Atlantic for any access we can have to them.I know how it is; at home you have the same idea of the facility oftravelling in this country as I once had: now I know what bush-roadsare, a few miles' journey seems an awful undertaking. Do you remember myaccount of a day's travelling through the woods? I am sorry to say theyare but little amended since that letter was written. I have only onceventured to perform a similar journey, which took several hours _hard_travelling, and, more by good luck than any other thing, arrived withwhole bones at my destination. I could not help laughing at the frequentexclamations of the teamster, a shrewd Yorkshire lad, "Oh, if I had butthe driving of his excellency the governor along this road, how I wouldmake the old horses trot over the stumps and stones, till he should cryout again; I warrant he'd do _summut_ to mend them before he came alongthem again."Unfortunately it is not a statute-road on this side the river, and hasbeen cut by the settlers for their own convenience, so that I fearnothing will be done to improve it, unless it is by the inhabitantsthemselves.We hope soon to have a market for our grain nearer at hand thanPeterborough; a grist-mill has just been raised at the new village thatis springing up. This will prove a great comfort to us; we have atpresent to fetch flour up at a great expense, through bad roads, and theloss of time to those that are obliged to send wheat to the town to beground, is a serious evil; this will soon be remedied, to the joy of thewhole neighbourhood.You do not know how important these improvements are, and what effectthey have in raising the spirits of the emigrant, besides enhancing thevalue of his property in no trifling degree. We have already experiencedthe benefit of being near the saw-mill, as it not only enables us tobuild at a smaller expense, but enables us to exchange logs for sawnlumber. The great pine-trees which, under other circumstances, would bean encumbrance and drawback to clearing the land, prove a mostprofitable crop when cleared off in the form of saw-logs, which iseasily done where they are near the water; the logs are sawn to acertain length, and dragged by oxen, during the winter, when the groundis hard, to the lake's edge; when the ice breaks up, the logs float downwith the current and enter the mill-race; I have seen the lake oppositeto our windows covered with these floating timbers, voyaging down to thesaw-mill.How valuable would the great oaks and gigantic pines be on an estate inEngland; while here they are as little thought of as saplings would beat home. Some years hence the timbers that are now burned up will beregretted. Yet it is impossible to preserve them; they would prove agreat encumbrance to the farmer. The oaks are desirable for splitting,as they make the most durable fences; pine, cedar, and white ash arealso used for rail-cuts; maple and dry beech are the best sorts of woodfor fires: white ash burns well. In making ley for soap, care is takento use none but the ashes of hard wood, as oak, ash, maple, beech; anyof the resinous trees are bad for the purpose, and the ley will notmingle with the fat. In boiling, to the great mortification of theuninitiated soap-boiler, who, by being made acquainted with this simplefact, might have been spared much useless trouble and waste of material,after months of careful saving.An American settler's wife told me this, and bade me be careful not tomake use of any of the pine-wood ashes in running the ley. And here Imust observe, that of all people the Yankees, as they are termed, arethe most industrious and ingenious; they are never at a loss for anexpedient: if one thing fails them they adopt another, with a quicknessof thought that surprises me, while to them it seems only a matter ofcourse. They seem to possess a sort of innate presence of mind, andinstead of wasting their energies in words, they _act_. The old settlersthat have been long among them seem to acquire the same sort of habits,insomuch that it is difficult to distinguish them. I have heard theAmericans called a loquacious boasting people; now, as far as my limitedacquaintance with them goes, I consider they are almost laconic, and ifI dislike them it is for a certain cold brevity of manner that seems toplace a barrier between you and them.I was somewhat struck with a remark made by a travelling clock-maker, anative of the state of Ohio. After speaking of the superior climate ofOhio, in answer to some questions of my husband, he said, he wassurprised that gentlemen should prefer the Canadas, especially the bush,where for many years they must want all the comforts and luxuries oflife, to the rich, highly cultivated, and fruitful state of Ohio, whereland was much cheaper, both cleared and wild.To this we replied that, in the first place, British subjects preferredthe British government; and, besides, they were averse to the manners ofhis countrymen. He candidly admitted the first objection; and in replyto the last observed, that the Americans at large ought not to be judgedby the specimens to be found in the British colonies, as they were, forthe most part, persons of no reputation, many of whom had fled to theCanadas to escape from debt, or other disgraceful conduct; and added,"It would be hard if the English were to be judged as a nation by theconvicts of Botany Bay."Now there was nothing unfair or rude in the manners of this stranger,and his defence of his nation was mild and reasonable, and such as anyunprejudiced person must have respected him for.I have just been interrupted by a friend, who has called to tell me hehas an opportunity of sending safe and free of expense to London orLiverpool, and that he will enclose a packet for me in the box he ispacking for England.I am delighted by the intelligence, but regret that I have nothing but afew flower-seeds, a specimen of Indian workmanship, and a fewbutterflies to send you--the latter are for Jane. I hope all will notshare the fate of the last I sent. Sarah wrote me word, when they cameto look for the green moth I had enclosed in a little box, nothing ofhis earthly remains was visible beyond a little dust and some pink feet.I have, with some difficulty, been able to procure another and finerspecimen; and, for fear it should meet with a similar annihilation, Iwill at least preserve the memory of its beauties, and give you adescription of it.It is just five inches from wing to wing; the body the thickness of mylittle finger, snow-white, covered with long silken hair; the legsbright red, so are the antennae, which are toothed like a comb on eitherside, shorter than those of butterflies and elegantly curled; the wings,both upper and under, are of the most exquisite pale tint of green,fringed at the edges with golden colour; each wing has a small shadedcrescent of pale blue, deep red, and orange; the blue forming thecentre, like a half-closed eye; the lower wings elongated in deepscollop, so as to form two long tails, like those of the swallow-tailbutterfly, only a full inch in length and deeply fringed; on the wholethis moth is the most exquisite creature I have ever seen.We have a variety of the peacock butterfly, that is very rich, withinnumerable eyes on the wings. The yellow swallow-tail is also verycommon, and the black and blue admiral, and the red, white, and blackadmiral, with many other beautiful varieties that I cannot describe. Thelargest butterfly I have yet seen is a gay vermilion, marked with jetblack lines that form an elegant black lace pattern over its wide wings.Then for dragon-flies, we have them of every size, shape, and colour. Iwas particularly charmed by a pair of superb blue ones that I used tosee this summer in my walk to visit my sister. They were as large asbutterflies, with black gauze wings; on each pair was marked a crescentof the brightest azure blue, shaded with scarlet; the bodies of thesebeautiful creatures were also blue. I have seen them scarlet and black,yellow and black, copper-coloured, green, and brown; the latter aregreat enemies to the mosquitoes and other small insects, and may be seenin vast numbers flitting around in all directions of an evening insearch of prey.The fire-flies must not be forgotten, for of all others they are themost remarkable; their appearance generally precedes rain; they areoften seen after dark, on mild damp evenings, sporting among the cedarsat the edge of the wood, and especially near swamps, when the air isilluminated with their brilliant dancing light. Sometimes they may beseen in groups, glancing like falling stars in mid-air, or descending solow as to enter your dwelling and flit about among the draperies of yourbed or window curtains; the light they emit is more brilliant than thatof the glowworm; but it is produced in the same manner from the underpart of the body. The glowworm is also frequently seen, even as late asSeptember, on mild, warm, dewy nights.We have abundance of large and small beetles, some most splendid: greenand gold, rose-colour, red and black, yellow and black; some quiteblack, formidably large, with wide branching horns. Wasps are not sotroublesome as in England, but I suppose it is because we cannot offersuch temptations as our home gardens hold out to these ravenous insects.One of our choppers brought me the other day what he called a hornet'snest; it was certainly too small and delicate a piece of workmanship forso large an insect; and I rather conjecture that it belonged to thebeautiful black and gold insect called the wasp-fly, but of this I amnot certain. The nest was about the size and shape of a turkey's egg,and was composed of six paper cups inserted one within the other, eachlessening till the innermost of all appeared not larger than a pigeon'segg. On looking carefully within the orifice of the last cup, a smallcomb, containing twelve cells, of the most exquisite neatness, might beperceived, if anything, superior in regularity to the cells in the combof the domestic bee, one of which was at least equal to three of these.The substance that composed the cups was of a fine silver grey silkentexture, as fine as the finest India silk paper, and extremely brittle;when slightly wetted it became glutinous, and adhered a little to thefinger; the whole was carefully fixed to a stick: I have seen one sincefastened to a rough rail. I could not but admire the instinctive caredisplayed in the formation of this exquisite piece of insectarchitecture to guard the embryo animal from injury, either from thevoracity of birds or the effect of rain, which could scarcely findentrance in the interior.I had carefully, as I thought, preserved my treasure, by putting it inone of my drawers, but a wicked little thief of a mouse found it out andtore it to pieces for the sake of the drops of honey contained in one ortwo of the cells. I was much vexed, as I purposed sending it by somefavourable opportunity to a dear friend living in Gloucester Place, whotook great delight in natural curiosities, and once showed me a nest ofsimilar form to this, that had been found in a bee-hive; the materialwas much coarser, and, if I remember right, had but two cases instead ofsix.I have always felt a great desire to see the nest of a humming-bird, buthitherto have been disappointed. This summer I had some beds ofmignionette and other flowers, with some most splendid majorconvolvuluses or "morning glories," as the Americans call them; theselovely flowers tempted the hummingbirds to visit my garden, and I hadthe pleasure of seeing a pair of those beautiful creatures, but theirflight is so peculiar that it hardly gives you a perfect sight of theircolours; their motion when on the wing resembles the whirl of aspinning-wheel, and the sound they make is like the hum of a wheel atwork; I shall plant flowers to entice them to build near us.I sometimes fear you will grow weary of my long dull letters; my onlyresources are domestic details and the natural history of the country,which I give whenever I think the subject has novelty to recommend it toyour attention. Possibly I may sometimes disappoint you by details thatappear to place the state of the emigrant in an unfavourable light; Imerely give facts as I have seen, or heard them stated. I could give youmany flourishing accounts of settlers in this country; I could alsoreverse the picture, and you would come to the conclusion that there aremany arguments to be used both for and against emigration. Now, thegreatest argument, and that which has the most weight, is NECESSITY, andthis will always turn the scale in the favour of emigration; and thatsame imperative dame Necessity tells me it is _necessary_ for me to drawmy letter to a conclusion.Farewell, ever faithfully and affectionately, your attached sister.LETTER XVII.Ague.--Illness of the Family.--Probable Cause.--Root-house.--Setting inof Winter.--Insect termed a "Sawyer."--Temporary Church.November the 28th, 1834.You will have been surprised, and possibly distressed, by my longsilence of several months, but when I tell you it has been occasioned bysickness, you will cease to wonder that I did not write.My dear husband, my servant, the poor babe, and myself, were all at onetime confined to our beds with ague. You know how severe my sufferingsalways were at home with intermittents, and need not marvel if they wereno less great in a country where lake-fevers and all kinds ofintermittent fevers abound.Few persons escape the second year without being afflicted with thisweakening complaint; the mode of treatment is repeated doses of calomel,with castor-oil or salts, and is followed up by quinine. Those personswho do not choose to employ medical advice on the subject, dosethemselves with ginger-tea, strong infusion of hyson, or any otherpowerful green tea, pepper, and whiskey, with many other remedies thathave the sanction of custom or quackery.I will not dwell on this uncomfortable period, further than to tell youthat we considered the complaint to have had its origin in a malaria,arising from a cellar below the kitchen. When the snow melted, thiscellar became half full of water, either from the moisture drainingthrough the spongy earth, or from the rising of a spring beneath thehouse; be it as it may, the heat of the cooking and Franklin stoves inthe kitchen and parlour, caused a fermentation to take place in thestagnant fluid before it could be emptied; the effluvia arising fromthis mass of putrifying water affected us all. The female servant, whowas the most exposed to its baneful influence, was the first of ourhousehold that fell sick, after which, we each in turn became unable toassist each other. I think I suffer an additional portion of the maladyfrom seeing the sufferings of my dear husband and my beloved child.I lost the ague in a fortnight's time,--thanks to calomel and quinine;so did my babe and his nurse: it has, however, hung on my husband duringthe whole of the summer, and thrown a damp upon his exertions and gloomupon his spirits. This is the certain effect of ague, it causes the samesort of depression on the spirits as a nervous fever. My dear child hasnot been well ever since he had the ague, and looks very pale andspiritless.We should have been in a most miserable condition, being unable toprocure a female servant, a nurse, or any one to attend upon us, andtotally unable to help ourselves; but for the prompt assistance of Maryon one side, and Susannah on the other, I know not what would havebecome of us in our sore trouble.This summer has been excessively hot and dry; the waters in the lakesand rivers being lower than they had been known for many years; scarcelya drop of rain fell for several weeks. This extreme drought rendered thepotatoe-crop a decided failure. Our Indian-corn was very fine; so werethe pumpkins. We had some fine vegetables in the garden, especially thepeas and melons; the latter were very large and fine. The cultivation ofthe melon is very simple: you first draw the surrounding earth togetherwith a broad hoe into a heap; the middle of this heap is then slightlyhollowed out, so as to form a basin, the mould being raised round theedges; into this hollow you insert several melon-seeds, and leave therest to the summer heat; if you water the plants from time to time, itis well for them; the soil should be fine black mould; and if your hillsare inclining to a hollow part of your ground, so as to retain themoisture, so much the finer will be your fruit. It is the opinion ofpractical persons who have bought wisdom by some years' experience ofthe country, that in laying out and planting a garden, the beds shouldnot be raised, as is the usual custom; and give us a reason, that thesun having such great power draws the moisture more readily from theearth where the beds are elevated above the level, and, in consequenceof the dryness of the ground, the plants wither away.As there appears some truth in the remark, I am inclined to adopt theplan.Vegetables are in general fine, and come quickly to maturity,considering the lateness of the season in which they are usually putinto the ground. Peas are always fine, especially the marrowfats, whichare sometimes grown in the fields, on cleared lands that are under theplough. We have a great variety of beans, all of the French or kidneykind; there is a very prolific white runner, of which I send you some ofthe seed: the method of planting them is to raise a small hillock ofmould by drawing the earth up with the hoe; flatten this, or ratherhollow it a little in the middle, and drop in four or five seeds roundthe edges; as soon as the bean puts forth its runners insert a pole offive or six feet in the centre of the hill; the plants will all meet andtwine up it, bearing a profusion of pods, which are cut and boiled asthe scarlet-runners, or else, in their dry or ripe state, stewed andeaten with salt meat; this, I believe, is the more usual way of cookingthem. The early bush-bean is a dwarf, with bright yellow seed.Lettuces are very fine, and may be cultivated easily, and very early, bytransplanting the seedlings that appear as soon as the ground is freefrom snow. Cabbages and savoys, and all sorts of roots, keep during thewinter in the cellars or root-houses; but to the vile custom of keepinggreen vegetables in the shallow, moist cellars below the kitchens, muchof the sickness that attacks settlers under the various forms of agues,intermittent, remittent, and lake-fevers, may be traced.Many, of the lower class especially, are not sufficiently careful inclearing these cellars from the decaying portions of vegetable matter,which are often suffered to accumulate from year to year to infect theair of the dwelling. Where the house is small, and the family numerous,and consequently exposed to its influence by night, the banefulconsequences may be readily imagined. "Do not tell me of lakes andswamps as the cause of fevers and agues; look to your cellars," was theobservation of a blunt but experienced Yankee doctor. I verily believeit was the cellar that was the cause of sickness in our house all thespring and summer.A root-house is indispensably necessary for the comfort of a settler'sfamily; if well constructed, with double log-walls, and the roof securedfrom the soaking in of the rain or melting snows, it preservesvegetables, meat, and milk excellently. You will ask if the use be sogreat, and the comfort so essential, why does not every settler buildone?Now, dear mamma, this is exactly what every new comer says; but he hasto learn the difficulty there is at first of getting these mattersaccomplished, unless, indeed, he have (which is not often the case) thecommand of plenty of ready money, and can afford to employ extraworkmen. Labour is so expensive, and the working seasons so short, thatmany useful and convenient buildings are left to a future time; and acellar, which one man can excavate in two days, if he work well, is madeto answer the purpose, till the season of leisure arrives, or necessityobliges the root-house to be made. We are ourselves proof of this verysort of unwilling procrastination; but the logs are now cut for theroot-house, and we shall have one early in the spring. I would, however,recommend any one that could possibly do so at first, to build a root-house without delay, and also to have a well dug; the springs lying veryfew feet below the surface renders this neither laborious or veryexpensive. The creeks will often fail in very dry weather, and the lakeand river-waters grow warm and distasteful during the spring and summer.The spring-waters are generally cold and pure, even in the hottestweather, and delightfully refreshing.Our winter seems now fairly setting in: the snow has twice fallen, andas often disappeared, since the middle of October; but now the ground isagain hardening into stone; the keen north-west wind is abroad; andevery outward object looks cold and wintry. The dark line of pines thatbound the opposite side of the lake is already hoary and heavy withsnow, while the half-frozen lake has a deep leaden tint, which is onlyvaried in shade by the masses of ice which shoot out in long points,forming mimic bays and peninsulas. The middle of the stream, where thecurrent is strongest, is not yet frozen over, but runs darkly along likea river between its frozen banks. In some parts where the banks aresteep and overhung with roots and shrubs, the fallen snow and water takethe most fantastic forms.I have stood of a bright winter day looking with infinite delight on thebeautiful mimic waterfalls congealed into solid ice along the bank ofthe river; and by the mill-dam, from contemplating these petty frolicsof Father Frost, I have been led to picture to myself the sublimescenery of the arctic regions.In spite of its length and extreme severity, I do like the Canadianwinter: it is decidedly the healthiest season of the year; and it is nosmall enjoyment to be exempted from the torments of the insect tribes,that are certainly great drawbacks to your comfort in the warmer months.We have just received your last packet;--a thousand thanks for thecontents. We are all delighted with your useful presents, especially thewarm shawls and merinos. My little James looks extremely well in his newfrock and cloak; they will keep him very warm this cold weather: hekissed the pretty fur-lined slippers you sent me, and said, "Pussy,pussy." By the way, we have a fine cat called Nora Crena, the partinggift of our friend ------, who left her as a keepsake for my boy. Jamiedotes upon her; and I do assure you I regard her almost as a secondWhittington's cat: neither mouse nor chitmunk has dared intrude withinour log-walls since she made her appearance; the very crickets, thatused to distract us with their chirping from morning till night, haveforsaken their old haunts. Besides the crickets, which often swarm so asto become intolerable nuisances, destroying your clothes and woollens,we are pestered by large black ants, that gallop about, eating up sugarpreserves, cakes, anything nice they can gain access to; these insectsare three times the size of the black ants of Britain, and have a mostvoracious appetite: when they find no better prey they kill each other,and that with the fierceness and subtilty of the spider. They appearless sociable in their habits than other ants; though, from the numbersthat invade your dwellings, I should think they formed a community likethe rest of their species.The first year's residence in a new log-house you are disturbed by acontinual creaking sound which grates upon the ears exceedingly, tillyou become accustomed to it: this is produced by an insect commonlycalled a "sawyer." This is the larvae of some fly that deposits its eggsin the bark of the pine-trees. The animal in its immature state is of awhitish colour, the body composed of eleven rings; the head armed with apair of short, hard pincers: the skin of this creature is so rough thaton passing your finger over it, it reminds you of a rasp, yet to the eyeit is perfectly smooth. You would be surprised at the heap of fine saw-dust that is to be seen below the hole they have been working in allnight. These sawyers form a fine feast for the woodpeckers, and jointlythey assist in promoting the rapid decomposition of the gigantic forest-trees, that would otherwise encumber the earth from age to age. Howinfinite is that Wisdom that rules the natural world! How often do wesee great events brought about by seemingly insignificant agents! Yetare they all servants of the Most High, working his will, and fulfillinghis behests. One great want which has been sensibly felt in this distantsettlement, I mean the want of public worship on the Sabbath-day,promises to be speedily remedied. A subscription is about to be openedamong the settlers of this and part of the adjacent township for theerection of a small building, which may answer the purpose of church andschool-house; also for the means of paying a minister for stated seasonsof attendance.------ has allowed his parlour to be used as a temporary church, andservice has been several times performed by a highly respectable youngScotch clergyman; and I can assure you we have a considerablecongregation, considering how scattered the inhabitants are, and thatthe emigrants consist of catholics and dissenters, as well asepiscopalians.These distinctions, however, are not carried to such lengths in thiscountry as at home; especially where the want of religious observanceshas been sensibly felt. The word of God appears to be listened to withgladness. May a blessing attend those that in spirit and in truth wouldrestore again to us the public duties of the Sabbath, which, left to ourown guidance, we are but too much inclined to neglect.Farewell.LETTER XVIII.Busy Spring.--Increase of Society and Comfort.--Recollections of Home.--Aurora BorealisTHIS has been a busy spring with us. First, sugar-making on a largerscale than our first attempt was, and since that we had workmen makingconsiderable addition to our house; we have built a large and convenientkitchen, taking the former one for a bedroom; the root-house and dairyare nearly completed. We have a well of excellent water close beside thedoor, and a fine frame-barn was finished this week, which includes agood granary and stable, with a place for my poultry, in which I takegreat delight.Besides a fine brood of fowls, the produce of two hens and a cock, or_rooster_, as the Yankees term that bird, I have some ducks, and am tohave turkeys and geese this summer. I lost several of my best fowls, notby the hawk but a horrid beast of the same nature as our polecat, calledhere a scunck; it is far more destructive in its nature than either foxor the hawk, for he comes like a thief in the night and invades theperch, leaving headless mementos of his barbarity and blood-thirstypropensities.We are having the garden, which hitherto has been nothing but a squareenclosure for vegetables, laid out in a prettier form; two half circularwings sweep off from the entrance to each side of the house; the fenceis a sort of rude basket or hurdle-work, such as you see at home, calledby the country folk wattled fence: this forms a much more picturesquefence than those usually put up of split timber.Along this little enclosure I have begun planting a sort of floweryhedge with some of the native shrubs that abound in our woods and lake-shores.Among those already introduced are two species of shrubby honeysuckle,white and rose-blossomed: these are called by the American botanists_quilostium_.Then I have the white _Spiroea frutex_, which grows profusely on thelake-shore; the Canadian wild rose; the red flowering raspberry (_rubusspectabilis_), leather-wood (_dircas_), called American mezereon, ormoose-wood; this is a very pretty, and at the same time useful shrub,the bark being used by farmers as a substitute for cord in tying sacks,&c.; the Indians sew their birch-bark baskets with it occasionally.Wild gooseberry, red and black currants, apple-trees, with here andthere a standard hawthorn, the native tree bearing nice red fruit Inamed before, are all I have as yet been able to introduce.The stoup is up, and I have just planted hops at the base of thepillars. I have got two bearing shoots of a purple wild grape from theisland near us, which I long to see in fruit.My husband is in good spirits; our darling boy is well, and runs abouteverywhere. We enjoy a pleasant and friendly society, which hasincreased so much within the last two years that we can hardly regretour absence from the more populous town.My dear sister and her husband are comfortably settled in their newabode, and have a fine spot cleared and cropped. We often see them, andenjoy a chat of home--sweet, never-to-be-forgotten home; and cheatourselves into the fond belief that, at no very distant time we mayagain retrace its fertile fields and flowery dales.With what delight we should introduce our young Canadians to theirgrandmother and aunts; my little bushman shall early be taught to lispthe names of those unknown but dear friends, and to love the lands thatgave birth to his parents, the bonny hills of the north and my ownbeloved England.Not to regret my absence from my native land, and one so fair and lovelywithal, would argue a heart of insensibility; yet I must say, for allits roughness, I love Canada, and am as happy in my humble log-house asif it were courtly hall or bower; habit reconciles us to many thingsthat at first were distasteful. It has ever been my way to extract thesweet rather than the bitter in the cup of life, and surely it is bestand wisest so to do. In a country where constant exertion is called forfrom all ages and degrees of settlers, it would be foolish to a degreeto damp our energies by complaints, and cast a gloom over our homes bysitting dejectedly down to lament for all that was so dear to us in theold country. Since we are here, let us make the best of it, and bearwith cheerfulness the lot we have chosen. I believe that one of thechief ingredients in human happiness is a capacity for enjoying theblessings we possess.Though at our first outset we experienced many disappointments, manyunlooked-for expenses, and many annoying delays, with some wants that tous seemed great privations, on the whole we have been fortunate,especially in the situation of our land, which has increased in valuevery considerably; our chief difficulties are now over, at least we hopeso, and we trust soon to enjoy the comforts of a cleared farm.My husband is becoming more reconciled to the country, and I daily feelmy attachment to it strengthening. The very stumps that appeared soodious, through long custom, seem to lose some of their hideousness; theeye becomes familiarized even with objects the most displeasing tillthey cease to be observed. Some century hence how different will thisspot appear! I can picture it to my imagination with fertile fields andgroves of trees planted by the hand of taste;--all will be different;our present rude dwellings will have given place to others of a moreelegant style of architecture, and comfort and grace will rule the scenewhich is now a forest wild.You ask me if I like the climate of Upper Canada; to be candid I do notthink it deserves all that travellers have said of it. The summer heatof last year was very oppressive; the drought was extreme, and in somerespects proved rather injurious, especially to the potatoe crop. Thefrosts set in early, and so did the snows; as to the far-famed Indiansummer it seems to have taken its farewell of the land, for little of ithave we seen during three years' residence. Last year there was not asemblance of it, and this year one horrible dark gloomy day, thatreminded me most forcibly of a London fog, and which was to the full asdismal and depressing, was declared by the old inhabitants to be thecommencement of the Indian summer; the sun looked dim and red, and ayellow lurid mist darkened the atmosphere, so that it became almostnecessary to light candles at noonday. If this be Indian summer, thenmight a succession of London fogs be termed the "London summer," thoughtI, as I groped about in a sort of bewildering dusky light all that day;and glad was I when, after a day or two's heavy rain, the frost and snowset in.Very variable, as far as our experience goes, this climate has been; notwo seasons have been at all alike, and it is supposed it will be stillmore variable as the work of clearing the forest goes on from year toyear. Near the rivers and great lakes the climate is much milder andmore equable; more inland, the snow seldom falls so as to allow ofsleighing for weeks after it has become general; this, considering thestate of our bush-roads, is rather a point in our favour, as travellingbecomes less laborious, though still somewhat rough.I have seen the aurora borealis several times; also a splendid meteoricphenomenon that surpassed every thing I had ever seen or even heard ofbefore. I was very much amused by overhearing a young lad giving agentleman a description of the appearance made by a cluster of theshooting-stars as they followed each other in quick succession athwartthe sky. "Sir," said the boy, "I never saw such a sight before, and Ican only liken the chain of stars to a logging-chain." Certainly a mostnatural and unique simile, quite in character with the occupation of thelad, whose business was often with the oxen and logging-chain, and afterall not more rustic than the familiar names given to many of our mostsuperb constellations,--Charles's wain, the plough, the sickle, &c.Coming home one night last Christmas from the house of a friend, I wasstruck by a splendid pillar of pale greenish light in the west: it roseto some height above the dark line of pines that crowned the oppositeshores of the Otanabee, and illumined the heavens on either side with achaste pure light, such as the moon gives in her rise and setting; itwas not quite pyramidical, though much broader at the base than at itshighest point; it gradually faded, till a faint white glimmering lightalone marked where its place had been, and even that disappeared aftersome half-hour's time. It was so fair and lovely a vision I was grievedwhen it vanished into thin air, and could have cheated fancy into thebelief that it was the robe of some bright visitor from another and abetter world;--imagination apart, could it be a phosphoric exhalationfrom some of our many swamps or inland lakes, or was it at all connectedwith the aurora that is so frequently seen in our skies?I must now close this epistle; I have many letters to prepare forfriends, to whom I can only write when I have the opportunity of freeconveyance, the inland postage being very high; and you must not onlypay for all you receive but all you send to and from New York.Adieu, my kindest and best of friends.Douro, May 1st, 1833.APPENDIX[The following Communications have been received from the Writer of thisWork during its progress through the Press.]MAPLE-SUGAR.THIS spring I have made maple-sugar of a much finer colour and grainthan any I have yet seen; and have been assured by many old settlers itwas the best, or nearly the best, they had ever met with: whichcommendation induces me to give the plan I pursued in manufacturing it.The sap having been boiled down in the sugar-bush from about sixteenpailsful to two, I first passed it through a thin flannel bag, after themanner of a jelly-bag, to strain it from the first impurities, which aregreat. I then passed the liquor through another thicker flannel into theiron pot, in which I purposed boiling down the sugar, and while yetcold, or at best but lukewarm, beat up the white of one egg to a froth,and spread it gently over the surface of the liquor, watching the potcarefully after the fire began to heat it, that I might not suffer thescum to boil into the sugar. A few minutes before it comes to a boil,the scum must be carefully removed with a skimmer, or ladle,--the formeris best. I consider that on the care taken to remove every particle ofscum depends, in a great measure, the brightness and clearness of thesugar. The best rule I can give as to the sugaring-off, as it is termed,is to let the liquid continue at a fast boil: only be careful to keep itfrom coming over by keeping a little of the liquid in your stirring-ladle, and when it boils up to the top, or you see it rising too fast,throw in a little from time to time to keep it down; or if you boil on acooking-stove, throwing open one or all the doors will prevent boilingover. Those that sugar-off outside the house have a wooden crane fixedagainst a stump, the fire being lighted against the stump, and thekettle suspended on the crane: by this simple contrivance, (for anybush-boy can fix a crane of the kind,) the sugar need never rise over ifcommon attention be paid to the boiling; but it does require constantwatching: one idle glance may waste much of the precious fluid. I hadonly a small cooking-stove to boil my sugar on, the pots of which werethought too small, and not well shaped, so that at first my fears werethat I must relinquish the trial; but I persevered, and experienceconvinces me a stove is an excellent furnace for the purpose; as you canregulate the heat as you like.One of the most anxious periods in the boiling I found to be when theliquor began first to assume a yellowish frothy appearance, and cast upso great a volume of steam from its surface as to obscure the contentsof the pot; as it may then rise over almost unperceived by the mostvigilant eye. As the liquor thickens into molasses, it becomes a fineyellow, and seems nothing but thick froth. When it is getting prettywell boiled down, the drops begin to fall clear and ropy from the ladle;and if you see little bright grainy-looking bubbles in it, drop some ona cold plate, and continue to stir or rub it till it is quite cold: ifit is ready to granulate, you will find it gritty, and turn whitish orpale straw colour; and stiff. The sugar may then safely be poured offinto a tin dish, pail, basin, or any other utensil. I tried twodifferent methods after taking the sugar from the fire, but could findlittle difference in the look of the sugar, except that in one thequantity was broken up more completely; in the other the sugar remainedin large lumps, but equally pure and sparkling. In the first I keptstirring the sugar till it began to cool and form a whitish thicksubstance, and the grains were well crystallised; in the other process,--which I think preferable, as being the least troublesome,--I waitedtill the mass was hardened into sugar, and then, piercing the crust inmany places, I turned the mass into a cullender, and placed thecullender over a vessel to receive the molasses that drained from thesugar. In the course of the day or two, I frequently stirred the sugar,which thus became perfectly free from moisture, and had acquired a finesparkling grain, tasting exactly like sugar-candy, free from any tasteof the maple-sap, and fit for any purpose.I observed that in general maple-sugar, as it is commonly made, is hardand compact, showing little grain, and weighing very heavy in proportionto its bulk. Exactly the reverse is the case with that I made, it beingextremely light for its bulk, all the heavy molasses having beenseparated, instead of dried into the sugar. Had the present season beenat all a favourable one, which it was not, we should have made a goodquantity of excellent sugar.VINEGAR.By boiling down five gallons of sap to one, and when just a little abovethe heat of new milk, putting in a cupful of barm (hop-rising will do ifit be good), and letting the vessel remain in your kitchen chimney-corner during the summer, and perhaps longer, you will obtain a fine,cheap, pleasant, and strong vinegar, fit for any purpose. This plan Ihave pursued successfully two years. Care must be taken that the cask orkeg be well seasoned and tight before the vinegar is put in; as thedryness of the summer heat is apt to shrink the vessel, and make itleak. If putty well wrought, tar, or even yellow soap, be rubbed overthe seams, and round the inner rim of the head of the cask, it willpreserve it from opening. The equal temperature of the kitchen ispreferred by experienced housewives to letting the vinegar stand abroad;they aver the coldness of the nights in this country is prejudicial tothe process, being as speedily perfected as if it underwent no suchcheck. By those well skilled in the manufacture of home-made wines andbeer, excellent maple-wine and beer might be produced at a very triflingexpense; i.e. that of the labour and skill exercised in the making it.Every settler grows, as an ornament in his garden, or should grow, hops,which form one of the principal components of maple-beer when added tothe sap.HOP-RISING.This excellent, and, I might add, indispensable, article in everysettler's house, is a valuable substitute for ale or beer-yeast, and ismade in the following simple manner:--Take two double handfuls of hops,boil in a gallon of soft water, if you can get it, till the hops sink tothe bottom of the vessel; make ready a batter formed by stirring adessert-platefull of flour and cold water till smooth and pretty thicktogether; strain the hop-liquor while scalding hot into the vessel whereyour batter is mixed ready; let one person pour the hop-liquor while theother keeps stirring the batter. When cooled down to a gentle warmth, sothat you can bear the finger well in it, add a cup or basinful of theformer barm, or a bit of leaven, to set it to work; let the barm standtill it has worked well, then bottle and cork it. Set it by in a cellaror cool place if in summer, and in winter it is also the best place tokeep it from freezing. Some persons add two or three mealy potatoesboiled and finely bruised, and it is a great improvement during the coolmonths of the year. Potatoes in bread may be introduced veryadvantageously; and to first settlers, who have all their flour to buy,I think it must be a saving.The following method I found made more palatable and lighter bread thanflour, mixed in the usual way:--Supposing I wanted to make up about astone and half of flour, I boiled (having first pared them carefully)--say three dozen good-sized potatoes in about three quarts or a gallon ofwater, till the liquor had the appearance of a thin gruel, and thepotatoes had become almost entirely incorporated with the water. Withthis potatoe-gruel the flour was mixed up, no water being required,unless by chance I had not enough of the mixture to moisten my floursufficiently. The same process of kneading, fermenting with barm, &c.,is pursued with the dough, as with other bread. In baking, it turns of abright light brown, and is lighter than bread made after the commonprocess, and therefore I consider the knowledge of it serviceable to theemigrant's family.SALT-RISING.This is a barm much used by the Yanky settlers; but though the bread isdecidedly whiter, and prettier to look at, than that raised in any otherway, the peculiar flavour it imparts to the bread renders it highlydisagreeable to some persons. Another disadvantage is, the difficulty offermenting this barm in the winter season, as it requires a temperaturewhich is very difficult to preserve in a Canadian winter day. Moreover,after the barm has once reached its height, unless immediately made useof, it sinks, and rises again no more: careful people, of course, whoknow this peculiarity, are on the watch, being aware of the illconsequences of heavy bread, or having no bread but bannocks in thehouse.As near as I can recollect, the salt-rising is made as follows:--For asmall baking of two or three loaves, or one large bake-kettle-loaf,(about the size of a London peck loaf,) take about a pint of moderatelywarm water, (a pleasant heat to the hand,) and stir into the jug or potcontaining it as much flour as will make a good batter, not too thick;add to this half a tea-spoon of salt, not more, and set the vessel in apan of moderately warm water, within a little distance of the fire, orin the sun: the water that surrounds the pot in which your rising is,must never be allowed to cool much below the original heat, more warmwater being added (in the pan, not to the barm) till the whole is in anactive state of fermentation, which will be from six to eight hours,when the dough must be mixed with it, and as much warm water or milk asyou require. Knead the mass till it is tough, and does not stick to theboard. Make up your loaf or loaves, and keep them warmly covered nearthe fire till they rise: they must be baked directly this second risingtakes place. Those that bake what I term a _shanty loaf_, in an ironbake-pot, or kettle, placed on the hot embers, set the dough to riseover a very few embers, or near the hot hearth, keeping the pot or panturned as the loaf rises; when equally risen all over they put hot ashesbeneath and upon the lid, taking care not to let the heat be too fierceat first. As this is the most common method of baking, and the firstthat a settler sees practised, it is as well they should be madefamiliar with it beforehand. At first I was inclined to grumble andrebel against the expediency of bake-pans or bake-kettles; but ascooking-stoves, iron ovens, and even brick and clay-built ovens, willnot start up at your bidding in the bush, these substitutes arevaluable, and perform a number of uses. I have eaten excellent lightbread, baked on the emigrant's hearth in one of these kettles. I haveeaten boiled potatoes, baked meats, excellent stews, and good soups, allcooked at different times in this universally useful utensil: so let itnot be despised. It is one of those things peculiarly adapted to thecircumstances of settlers in the bush before they have collected thosecomforts about their homesteads, within and without, that are the rewardand the slow gleaning-up of many years of toil.There are several other sorts of rising similar to the salt-rising."Milk-rising" which is mixed with milk, warm from the cow, and about athird warm water; and "bran-rising," which is made with bran instead offlour, and is preferred by many persons to either of the former kinds.SOFT SOAP.Of the making of soft soap I can give little or no correct information,never having been given any _certain_ rule myself, and my own experienceis too limited. I was, however, given a hint from a professionalgentleman, which I mean to act upon forthwith. Instead of boiling thesoap, which is some trouble, he assured me the best plan was to run offthe ley from a barrel of ashes: into this ley I might put four or fivepounds of any sort of grease, such as pot skimmings, rinds of bacon, orscraps from frying down suet; in short any refuse of the kind would do.The barrel with its contents may then be placed in a secure situation inthe garden or yard, exposed to the sun and air. In course of time theley and grease become incorporated: if the grease predominates it willbe seen floating on the surface; in such case add more ley; if themixture does not thicken, add more grease. Now, this is the simplest,easiest, and clearest account I have yet received on the subject ofsoap-making, which hitherto has seemed a mystery, even though a goodquantity was made last spring by one of my servants, and it turned outwell: but she could not tell why it succeeded, for want of being able toexplain the principle she worked from.CANDLES.Every one makes their own candles (i.e. if they have any materials tomake them from). The great difficulty of making candies--and, as far asI see the only one, is procuring the tallow, which a bush-settler, untilhe begins to kill his own beef, sheep, and hogs, is rarely able to do,unless he buys; and a settler buys nothing that he can help. A cow,however, that is unprofitable, old, or unlikely to survive the severityof the coming winter, is often suffered to go dry during the summer, andget her own living, till she is fit to kill in the fall. Such an animalis often slaughtered very advantageously, especially if the settler havelittle fodder for his cattle. The beef is often excellent, and goodstore of candles and soap may be made from the inside fat. Thesecandles, if made three parts beef- and one part hogs-lard, will burnbetter than any store-candles, and cost less than half price. The tallowis merely melted in a pot or pan convenient for the purpose, and havingrun the cotton wicks into the moulds (tin or pewter moulds for sixcandles cost three shillings at the stores, and last many, many years),a stick or skewer is passed through the loops of your wicks, at theupper part of the stand, which serve the purpose of drawing the candles.The melted fat, not too hot, but in a fluid state, is then poured intothe moulds till they are full; as the fat gets cold it shrinks, andleaves a hollow at the top of the mould: this requires filling up whenquite cold. If the candles do not draw readily, plunge the mould for aninstant into hot water and the candles will come out easily. Manypersons prefer making dip-candles for kitchen use; but for my own part Ithink the trouble quite as great, and give the preference, in point ofneatness of look, to the moulds. It may be, my maid and I did notsucceed so well in making the dips as the moulds.PICKLING.The great want of spring vegetables renders pickles a valuable additionto the table at the season when potatoes have become unfit anddistasteful. If you have been fortunate in your maple-vinegar, a storeof pickled cucumbers, beans, cabbage, &c. may be made during the latterpart of the summer; but if the vinegar should not be fit at that time,there are two expedients: one is to make a good brine of boiled salt andwater, into which throw your cucumbers, &c. (the cabbage, by the by, maybe preserved in the root-house or cellar quite good, or buried in pits,well covered, till you want to make your pickle). Those vegetables, keptin brine, must be covered close, and when you wish to pickle them,remove the top layer, which are not so good; and having boiled thevinegar with spices let it stand till it is cold. The cucumbers shouldpreviously have been well washed, and soaked in two or three freshwaters, and drained; then put in a jar, and the cold vinegar poured overthem. The advantage of this is obvious; you can pickle at any season.Another plan, and I have heard it much commended, is putting thecucumbers into a mixture of whiskey* and water, which in time turns to afine vinegar, and preserves the colour and crispness of the vegetable;while the vinegar is apt to make them soft, especially if poured onboiling hot, as is the usual practice.[* In the "Backwoodsman," this whiskey-receipt is mentioned as anabominable compound: perhaps the witty author had tasted the pickles inan improper state of progression. He gives a lamentable picture ofAmerican cookery, but declares the badness arises from want of properreceipts. These yeast-receipts will be extremely useful in England; asthe want of fresh yeast is often severely felt in country districts.]APPENDIX B.[In the wish to render this Work of more practical value to personsdesiring to emigrate, some official information is subjoined, under thefollowing heads:--]STATISTICS OF EMIGRATION.I.

These road duties to be consideredas part of the five acres per 100. The whole to be completed within twoyears from date of the location, and upon proof of their fulfilmentpatents to issue."On the 14th of May, 1830, an additional stipulation was made inlocations to discharged soldiers, which required an actual residence ontheir lots, in person, for five years before the issue of their patents."On the 14th of November, 1830, the then existing Orders in Council,respecting settlement duties, were cancelled, and it was ordered that inlieu thereof each locatee should clear half the road in front of hislot, and from 10 feet in the centre of the road cut the stumps so lowthat waggon wheels might pass over them. Upon proof of this, and that asettler had been resident on the lot two years, a patent might issue.Locatees, however, were at liberty, instead of placing settlers on theirlands, to clear, in addition to half the road on each lot, a chain indepth across the front, and to sow it and the road with grass seed."Upon discharged soldiers and seamen alone, under this order, it becameimperative to reside on and improve their lands three years before theissue of the patent."On the 24th of May, 1832, an Order in Council was made, abolishing, inall cases except that of discharged soldiers and seamen, the regulationspreviously existing; and which directed that, upon proof of an actualsettler being established on a lot, a patent should issue without thecondition of settlement duty."The following extract is taken from "official information" circulated byMr. Buchanan, and other Government emigration agents in Canada:--"Emigrants, wishing to obtain fertile lands in the Canadas in a wildstate by purchase from the Crown, may rely on every facility beingafforded them by the public authorities. Extensive tracts are surveyedand offered for sale in Upper Canada monthly, and frequently every 10 or14 days, by the Commissioner of Crown lands, at upset prices, varyingaccording to situation from 10 shillings to 15 shillings per acre,excepting in the townships of Sunnidale and Nottawasaga, where the upsetprice of Crown lands is 5 shillings only. In Lower Canada, theCommissioner of Crown lands at Quebec puts up land for sale, at fixedperiods, in various townships, at from 2 shillings 6 pence to 12shillings 6 pence Halifax currency, per acre, payable by instalments.Wild lands may also be purchased from the Upper Canada Company on veryeasy terms, and those persons wanting improved farms will find littledifficulty in obtaining such from private proprietors. On no accountenter into any final engagement for your lands or farms _withoutpersonal examination_, and be certain of the following qualifications:--"1. A healthy situation."2. Good land."3. A pure spring, or running stream of water."4. In the neighbourhood of a good, moral, and religious state ofsociety, and schools for the education of your children."5. As near good roads and water transport as possible, saw and gristmills."6.

INFORMATION FOR EMIGRANTSIn the year 1832 a little pamphlet of advice to emigrants was issued byhis Majesty's Commissioners for Emigration*, which contained some usefulinformation in a small compass. The Commission no longer exists. In lieuof it, J. Denham Pinnock, Esq., has been appointed by Government HisMajesty's agent for the furtherance of emigration from England to theBritish Colonies. Letters on the subject of emigration should beaddressed to this gentleman at the Colonial Office, under cover to theColonial Secretary of State. One chief object of his appointment is toafford facilities and information to parish authorities and landedproprietors desirous of furthering the emigration of labourers andothers from their respective districts, especially with reference to theemigration clause of the Poor Laws Amendment Act. The followingGovernment emigration agents have also been appointed at the respectiveports named:--Liverpool ...Lieut. Low, R.N.Bristol ... Lieut. Henry, R.N.Leith ... Lieut. Forrest, R.N.Greenock ... Lieut. Hemmans, R.N.Dublin ... Lieut. Hodder, R.N.Cork ... Lieut. Friend, R.N.Limerick ... Lieut. Lynch, R.N.Belfast ... Lieut. Millar, R.N.Sligo ... Lieut. Shuttleworth, R.N.And at Quebec, A. C. Buchanan, Esq., the chief Government emigrationagent, will afford every information to all emigrants who seek hisadvice.[* "Information published by His Majesty's Commissioners for Emigration,respecting the British Colonies in North America." London, C. Knight,1832. Price _twopence_.]The following is an extract from the pamphlet published in 1832:--"Passages to Quebec or New Brunswick may either be engaged _inclusive_of provisions, or _exclusive_ of provisions, in which case the ship-owner finds nothing but water, fuel, and bed places, without bedding.Children under 14 years of age are charged one-half, and under 7 yearsof age one-third of the full price, and for children under 12 months ofage no charge is made. Upon these conditions the price of passage fromLondon, or from places on the east coast of Great Britain, has generallybeen 6 pounds with provisions, or 3 pounds without. From Liverpool,Greenock, and the principal ports of Ireland, as the chances of delayare fewer, the charge is somewhat lower; this year [1832] it willprobably be from 2 pounds to 2 pounds, 10 shillings without provisions,or from 4 pounds to 5 pounds, including provisions. It is possible thatin March and April passages may be obtained from Dublin for 1 pound, 15shillings or even 1 pound, 10 shillings; but the prices always growhigher as the season advances. In ships sailing from Scotland orIreland, it has mostly been the custom for passengers to find their ownprovisions; but this practice has not been so general in London, andsome shipowners, sensible of the dangerous mistakes which may be made inthis matter through ignorance, are very averse to receive passengers whowill not agree to be victualled by the ship. Those who do resolve tosupply their own provisions, should at least be careful not to lay in aninsufficient stock; fifty days is the shortest period for which it issafe to provide, and from London the passage is sometimes prolonged toseventy-five days. The best months for leaving England are certainlyMarch and April; the later emigrants do not find employment so abundant,and have less time in the colony before the commencement of winter."From a printed paper, issued by Mr. Buchanan at Quebec, the followingstatements are taken: (the paper is dated July, 1835)."There is nothing of more importance to emigrants, on arrival at Quebec,than correct information on the leading points connected with theirfuture pursuits. Many have suffered much by a want of caution, and bylistening to the opinions of interested, designing characters, whofrequently offer their advice unsolicited, and who are met generallyabout wharfs and landing-places frequented by strangers: to guardemigrants from falling into such errors, they should, immediately onarrival at Quebec, proceed to the office of the chief agent foremigrants, Sault-au-Matelot Street, Lower Town, where every informationrequisite for their future guidance in either getting settlements onlands, or obtaining employment in Upper or Lower Canada, will beobtained _gratis_. On your route from Quebec to your destination youwill find many plans and schemes offered to your consideration, but turnaway from them unless you are well satisfied of the purity of thestatements: on all occasions when you stand in need of advice, applyonly to the Government agents, who will give every information required,_gratis_."Emigrants are informed that they may remain on board ship 48 hoursafter arrival, nor can they be deprived of any of their usualaccommodations for cooking or berthing during that period, and themaster of the ship is bound to disembark the emigrants and their baggage_free of expense_, at the usual landing places, and at seasonable hours._They should avoid drinking the water of the river St. Lawrence, whichhas a strong tendency to produce bowel complaints in strangers_."Should you require to change your English money, go to some respectablemerchant or dealer, or the banks: the currency in the Canadas is at therate of 5 shillings the dollar, and is called Halifax currency; atpresent the gold sovereign is worth, in Quebec and Montreal, about 1pound, 4 shillings, 1 pence currency. In New York 8 shillings iscalculated for the dollar, hence many are deceived when hearing of therates of labour, &c.--5 shillings in Canada is equal to 8 shillings inNew York; thus 8 shillings New York currency is equivalent to 5shillings Halifax currency."Emigrants who wish to settle in Lower Canada or to obtain employment,are informed that many desirable situations are to be met with. Wildlands may be obtained by purchase from the Commissioner of Crown Landsin various townships in the province, and the British American LandCompany are making extensive preparations for selling lands and farms inthe Eastern Townships to emigrants."Farm labourers are much wanted in all the districts of Upper Canada,and, if industrious, they may be sure of obtaining very high wages;mechanics of almost every description, and good servants, male and_female_, are much in request."Emigrants proceeding to Upper Canada, either by the Ottawa or St.Lawrence route, are advised to supply themselves with provisions atMontreal, such as bread, tea, sugar, and butter, which they willpurchase cheaper and of _better quality_, until they reach Kingston,than along the route. They are also particularly cautioned against theuse of _ardent spirits or drinking cold river water_, or lying on thebanks of the river exposed to the night dews; they should proceed atonce from the steam-boat at Montreal to _the entrance of the Canal_ orLachine, from whence the Durham and steam-boats start for Prescott andBytown daily. The total expense for the transport of an adult emigrantfrom Quebec to Toronto and the head of Lake Ontario, by steam andDurham-boats, will not exceed 1 pound, 4 shillings currency, or 1 pound,1 shilling sterling. Kingston, Belleville, up the Bay of Quinte,Cobourgh, and Port Hope, in the Newcastle district, Hamilton and Niagaraat the head of Lake Ontario, will be convenient stopping-places forfamilies intending to purchase lands in Upper Canada."There is considerable competition among the Forwarding Companies atMontreal; emigrants therefore had better exercise a little cautionbefore agreeing for their transport to Prescott or Kingston, and theyshould avoid those persons that crowd on board the steam-boats onarrival at Montreal, offering their services to get passages, &c.Caution is also necessary at Prescott or Kingston, in selecting regularconveyances up Lake Ontario. I would particularly advise emigrantsdestined for Upper Canada, not to incur the expense of lodging or delayat Montreal, but to proceed on arrival of the steam-boat to the bargesfor Bytown or Prescott."Labourers or mechanics dependent on immediate employment, are requestedto proceed immediately on arrival into the country.

Formerly this gentleman could procure foremigrants who were positively determined to settle in the Canadas,permission to land their baggage and effects free of custom-house duty;but in a letter dated 16th March, 1835, he says:--"In consequence of a change in the truly liberal course heretoforeadopted at this port, in permitting, without unpacking or payment ofduty, of the personal baggage, household, and farming utensils ofemigrants landing here to pass in transit through this state to hisMajesty's provinces, upon evidence being furnished of the fact, and thatsuch packages alone contained articles of the foregoing description, Ideem it my duty to make known that all articles arriving at this portaccompanying emigrants in transit to Canada, will be subject to the sameinspection as if to remain in the United States, and pay the duties towhich the same are subjected. I think it proper to mention that allarticles suited to new settlers are to be had in Canada on better termsthan they can be brought out--and such as are adapted to the country."The difference between proceeding to Upper Canada by way of Quebec andNew York, consists chiefly in the circumstance that the port of New Yorkis open all the year round, while the navigation of the St. Lawrence upto Quebec and Montreal is tedious, and the river is only open betweenseven and eight months of the year. The latter is, however, the cheapestroute. But to those who can afford it, New York is the most comfortableas well as the most expeditious way of proceeding to Upper Canada.The route, as given in a printed paper, distributed by the Britishconsul at New York, is as follows:--"Route from New York and Albany by the Erie Canal to all parts of UpperCanada, west of Kingston, by the way of Oswego and Buffalo:--New York to Albany, 160 miles by steam-boat.Albany to Utica, 110 do. by canal or stage.Utica to Syracuse, 55 do. by canal or stage.Syracuse to Oswego, 40 do. by canal or stage.Syracuse to Rochester, 99 do. by canal or stage.Rochester to Buffalo, 93 do. by canal or stage.Total expense from Albany to Buffalo, by canal, exclusive of victualsfor an adult steerage passenger--time going about 7 or 8 days--3 dollars63 cents; ditto by packet-boats, and found, 12-1/4 dollars, 6 daysgoing."Ditto do. by stage, in 3-1/2 and 4 days--13 to 15 dollars."Ditto do. from Albany to Oswego by canal, 5 days going, 2-1/2 dollars."Ditto do. by stage, 2 days--6-1/2 to 7 dollars."No extra charge for a moderate quantity of baggage."Route from New York to Montreal, Quebec, and all parts of LowerCanada:--"New York to Albany, 160 miles by steam-boat, 1 to 3 dollars, exclusiveof food."Albany to Whitehall, by canal, 73 miles, 1 dollar; stage 3 dollars."Whitehall to St. John's, by steam-boat, board included, cabin 5dollars; deck passage 2 dollars without board."St. John's to Laprairie, 16 miles per stage, 5 shillings to 7 shillings6 pence."Laprairie to Montreal, per ferry steam-boat, 8 miles. 6 pence."Montreal to Quebec, by steam-boat, 180 miles, cabin, found, 1 pound, 5shillings; deck passage, not found, 7 shillings 6 pence."Those proceeding to the eastern townships of Lower Canada, in thevicinity of Sherbrooke, Stanstead, &c., &c., will proceed to St. John's,from whence good roads lead to all the settled townships eastward.

AMERICAN PASSENGERS' ACT.The 9th Geo. IV., c. 21, commonly called the "American Passengers' Act,"was repealed during the Session of 1835, by an Act then passed, the 5and 6 Will. IV., c. 53. The intention of the new Act is, of course, tosecure, as effectually as possible, and more effectually than theprevious Act did, the health and comfort of emigrants on board ofpassenger ships. By a clause of the Act, copies or abstracts are to bekept on board ships for the perusal of passengers, who may thus have anopportunity of judging whether the law has been complied with; but thediscovery of any infractions of the Statute may be made at a time when,in the particular instance, it may be too late to remedy it, so far asthe comfort and even the health of the passengers are concerned. It isto be hoped, therefore, that the humane intentions of the legislaturewill not be frustrated by any negligence on the part of those(especially of the officers of customs) whose business it is to see thatthe regulations of the Act have been complied with before each emigrantship leaves port.No passenger ship is to sail with more than three persons on board forevery five tons of registered burthen. Nor, whatever may be the tonnage,is there to be a greater number of passengers on board than after therate of one person for every ten superficial feet of the lower deck orplatform unoccupied by goods or stores, not being the personal luggageof the passengers.Ships with more than one deck to have five feet and a half, at theleast, between decks; and where a ship has only one deck, a platform isto be laid beneath the deck in such a manner as to afford a space of theheight of at least five feet and a half, and no such ship to have morethan two tiers of berths. Ships having two tiers of berths to have aninterval of at least six inches between the deck or platform, and thefloor of the lower tier throughout the whole extent.Passenger ships are to be provisioned in the following proportion:--purewater, to the amount of five gallons, to every week of the computedvoyage, for each passenger--the water to be carried in tanks or sweetcasks; seven pounds' weight of bread, biscuit, oatmeal, or bread stuffs,to every week for each passenger; potatoes may be included to one-thirdof the extent of supply, but seven pounds' weight of potatoes are to bereckoned equal to one pound of bread or bread stuffs. The voyage toNorth America is to be computed at ten weeks, by which each passengerwill be secured fifty gallons of water, and seventy pounds weight ofbread or bread stuffs for the voyage.Where there are 100 passengers, a medical practitioner is to be carried;if under 100, medicines of sufficient amount and kind are to be takenout as part of the necessary supplies.Passenger ships are not to be allowed to carry out ardent spirits asmerchandise beyond one-tenth of the quantity as would, but for thisrestriction, be allowed by the officers of the customs upon thevictualling bill of such ship for the outward voyage only, according tothe number of passengers.[An important restriction, which ought to be enforced to the letter ofthe law. The strong temptation which the tedium of a voyage presents tonumbers pinned up in a small space to resort to drinking, has frequentlymade sad havoc of the money, comfort, and health of emigrants, when,especially, the ship steward has contrived to lay in a good stock ofstrong waters.]In the enumeration of passengers, _two_ children above seven, but underfourteen, or _three_ under seven years of age, are to be reckoned as onepassenger. Infants under 12 months are not to be included in theenumeration.Passengers are entitled to be maintained on board for 48 hours after theship has arrived at her destination. [Emigrants whose means are limitedmay thus avoid much inconvenience and expense, by planning and executingwith promptitude the route which they mean to take, instead of landing,and loitering in the expensive houses of entertainment of a sea-port.]Masters of ships are to enter into bonds of 1,000 pounds for the dueperformance of the provisions of the Act. The penalty on any infractionof the law is to be not less than 5 pounds, nor more than 20 pounds foreach offence.[The government emigration agents at the various ports, or the officersof customs, will doubtless give every facility to passengers who seektheir advice relative to any violation of the provisions of the Act, andpoint out the proper course to be taken.]If there be any doubt that a ship about to sail is not sea-worthy, thecollector and comptroller of the customs may cause the vessel to besurveyed. Passengers detained beyond the time contracted for to sail,are to be maintained at the expense of the master of the ship; or, ifthey have contracted to victual themselves, they are to be paid 1shilling each for each day of detention not caused by stress of weatheror other unavoidable cause.=======================================IV. TRANSFER OF CAPITAL.It is, of course, of the greatest importance to emigrants that whatevercapital they may possess, over the necessary expenses of the voyage,&c., should be remitted to Canada in the _safest_ and most _profitable_manner. Both the British American Land Company and the Canada Companyafford facilities to emigrants, by receiving deposits and grantingletters of credit on their agents in Canada, by which the emigrantsobtain the benefit of the current premium of exchange. It is unsafe andinjudicious to carry out a larger amount of specie than what will defraythe necessary expenses of the voyage, because a double risk isincurred,--the danger of losing, and the temptation of squandering. Theemigrant, therefore, who does not choose to remit his money througheither of the before-mentioned companies, should procure a letter ofcredit from some respectable bank in the United Kingdom on the Montrealbank.=======================================V. CANADIAN CURRENCY.In all the British North American colonies accounts are kept and pricesare quoted in pounds, shillings, and pence, as in England. The accountsare contra-distinguished by calling the former currency, or Halifaxcurrency, and the latter sterling or British sterling.The one pound Halifax currency, or currency, as it is more commonlycalled, consists of four Spanish dollars. The dollar is divided intofive parts--called in Spanish pistoreens--each of which is termed ashilling. Each of these shillings or pistoreens is again subdivided intotwelve parts, called pence, but improperly, for there is no coinanswering to any such subdivision. To meet the want a great variety ofcopper coins are used, comprising the old English halfpenny, thehalfpenny of later coinage, the penny, the farthing, the American cent.;all and each pass as the twenty-fourth part of the pistoreen or colonialshilling. Pence in fact are not known, though almost anything of thecopper kind will be taken as the twenty-fourth part of the pistoreen.*[* The Americans also have their 1 shilling, which is the eighth part ofa dollar, or 12-1/2 cents. It is no uncommon thing to hear the emigrantboast that he can get 10 shillings per day in New York. He knows notthat a dollar, which is equal to eight of these shillings, is in Englandequivalent but to 4 shillings 2 pence, and that the American shillingis, therefore, when compared with the English shilling in value, only6-1/4 pence, and consequently, that 10 shillings a day is, in fact, butten 6-1/4 pence or 5 shillings 2-1/2 pence. This rate of payment it maybe said is still great; so it is, but it is not often obtained by thelabourer; when it is, it is for excessive labour, under a burning sun insea-port towns, during the busy shipping season.]At a time when the Spanish dollar, the piece of eight, as it was thencalled, was both finer and heavier than the coin now in circulation, itsvalue at the mint price of silver** was found to be 4 shilling 6 pencesterling. Accordingly, the pound currency was fixed at 18 shillingssterling, and 90 pounds sterling was equal to 100 pounds currency, therules of conversion being, _add one-ninth to sterling to obtaincurrency, and deduct one tenth from currency to find the sterling_. Thiswas called the par of exchange, and was so then. So long as it continuedcorrect, fluctuations were from a trifle above, to a trifle below par,and this fluctuation was a real _premium_ or _discount_, governed by thecost of the transportation of bullion from the one to the other side ofthe Atlantic, an expense which now does not exceed, and rarely equals, 2per cent. 4 shilling 6 pence has long ceased to be the value of thedollar. Both the weight and purity of the coin have been reduced, untilits value in the London market*** is not more than 4 shillings 2 pence,the pound currency being consequently reduced to 16 shillings 8 pencesterling and 100 pounds sterling become equivalent to 120 poundscurrency, or 480 dollars, the common average rate now given for the 100pounds sterling bill of exchange in England.[** The mint price then coincided more nearly with the market price thanat present.][*** It is necessary to use the market price, as the difference betweenthe mint and the market price is 4 per cent., and as the Spanish dollarpossesses no conventional value, it is only worth what it will bring asan article of traffic.]The Government, however, still sanction, nay, will not change, the oldlanguage, so that the difference is made up by adding what is commonlytermed a _premium_. The difference between the _real_ par, 4 shillings2 pence, and the nominal par, 4 shillings 6 pence, is 4 pence or eight percent. Thus the fluctuations, instead of being from 1 to 2 per cent.below, to 1 or 2 per cent. above the _real_ par, are from 1 to 2 percent. below, to 1 to 2 per cent. above 8 per cent. _premium_ as it iscalled on the _nominal_ par, or from 6 or 7 to 9 or 10 per cent._premium_ on the par. This leads to gross deception, and the emigrant inconsequence is not unfrequently outrageously cheated by partiesaccounting to him for money obtained by sale of bills, minus this orsome portion of this nominal premium. Nothing is more common than tohear the new comer boast that he has sold his bill on England for 8 percent. premium, while in fact he has not received _par_ value. As by theabove changes 100 pounds sterling is shewn to be equal to 120 currency,or 480 dollars, the rule of conversion, in the absence of a law, whereno understanding to the contrary existed, should be, _add one-fifth tosterling money, and currency is obtained, or deduct one-sixth fromcurrency, and sterling is found._ An examination of the exchanges forten years has proved this to be correct.=======================================VI. THE CANADA COMPANY.The Canada Company was incorporated by royal charter and Act ofParliament in 1826. The following are extracts from the prospectus ofthe Company:--"The Canada Company have lands for sale in almost every part of theprovince of Upper Canada, on terms which cannot fail to be highlyadvantageous to the emigrant, as from the Company requiring only one-fifth of the purchase-money to be paid in cash, and allowing theremainder to be divided into five annual payments, bearing interest, thesettler, if industrious, is enabled to pay the balance from the produceof the land."The lands of the Canada Company are of three descriptions, viz.--Scattered reserves:Blocks or tracts of land, of from 1,000 to 40,000 acres each;The Huron tract, containing upwards of 1,000,000 acres."_Scattered reserves_. The scattered crown reserves are lots of land offrom 100 to 200 acres each, distributed through nearly every township inthe province, and partaking of the soil, climate, &c., of eachparticular township. These lands are especially desirable for personswho may have friends settled in their neighbourhood, and can be obtainedat prices varying from 8 shillings 9 pence to 25 shillings currency anacre."_Blocks of Land._ The blocks or tracts lie entirely in that part of theprovince situated to the westward of the head of Lake Ontario, andcontain lands which, for soil, climate, and powers of production, areequal, and perhaps superior, to any on the continent of America. Theseare worthy the attention of communities of emigrants, who from country,relationship, religion, or any other bond, wish to settle together."The largest block of this kind in the Company's possession is thetownship of Guelph, containing upwards of 40,000 acres, of which thegreater part has been already sold, and, in the space of a few yearsonly, a town has been established, containing churches, schools, stores,taverns, and mills, and where there are mechanics of every kind, and asociety of a highly respectable description."_The Huron Territory_. This is a tract of the finest land in America,through which the Canada Company have cut two roads of upwards of 100miles in extent, of the best description of which a new country admits.The population there is rapidly on the increase."The town of Goderich, at the mouth of the river Maitland, on LakeHuron, is very flourishing, and contains several excellent stores, ormerchants' shops, in which any article usually required by a settler isto be obtained on reasonable terms. There is a good school established,which is well attended; a Church of England and a Presbyterian clergymanare appointed there; and as the churches in Upper Canada are nowprincipally supported by the voluntary subscriptions of their respectivecongregations, an inference may be drawn of the respectable character ofthe inhabitants of this settlement and the neighbourhood. The town andtownship of Goderich contain about 1,000 inhabitants; and since thesteam-boat, built by the Company for the accommodation of theirsettlers, has commenced running between Goderich and Sandwich, a greatincrease has taken place in the trade and prosperity of the settlement.In this tract there are four good saw-mills, three grist-mills, and inthe neighbourhood of each will be found stores well supplied. And as thetract contains a million acres, the greater portion of which is open forsale, an emigrant or body of emigrants, however large, can have nodifficulty in selecting eligible situations, according to theircircumstances, however various they may be. The price of these lands isfrom 11 shillings 3 pence to 15 shillings provincial currency, or aboutfrom 11 shillings to 13 shillings 6 pence sterling per acre."Emigrants wishing to communicate with the Company should address thesecretary, John Perry Esq., St. Helen's-place, Bishopsgate-street,London, or the Company's agents at outports.=======================================VII. THE BRITISH AMERICAN LAND COMPANY.The British American Land Company state, in their prospectus, that theyhave purchased from the British Government "nearly 1,000,000 of acres inthe counties of Shefford, Stanstead, and Sherbrooke," in what are termed"the Eastern Townships of Lower Canada." These townships comprise "atract of country, lying inland, on the south side of the St. Lawrence,between 45 degrees and 46-1/2 degrees north latitude, and 71 degrees and73 degrees west longitude. This tract, containing between five and sixmillions of acres, is divided into eight counties, and these again aresubdivided into about one hundred townships. These townships enjoy animportant advantage in their geographical position. On the one side,they are of easy access from Montreal, Quebec, and Three Rivers, theshipping ports and great markets of the Canadas; on the other, from NewYork up the Hudson River and through Lake Champlain, as well as fromBoston and other parts on the seaboard of the Atlantic. By their compactand contiguous position, facility of intercourse and mutual support areensured throughout the whole, as well as a general participation in alllocal improvements."The terms on which the Company propose to dispose of these lands "varyaccording to the situation, quality, and advantages which the differentlots may possess; but in the first instance they will generally rangefrom 4 shillings to 10 shillings currency per acre, and in all cases adeposit of part of the purchase-money will be required, viz.:--On thehigher priced lots one-fifth; on the lower priced lots one-fourth."The terms of payment for the balance will be six annual instalments,bearing the legal interest of the province from the date of sale; butshould purchasers prefer anticipating the payments, they will have theoption at any time of doing so."The price of a building lot at Port St. Francis, for the present season(1835), is 12 pounds 10 shillings, payable 5 pounds cash down, and thebalance in one year, with interest."Deposits of purchase-money may be made with the Company in London forlands to be selected by emigrants on their arrival in the country."By the agreement between his Majesty's Government and the Company,upwards of 50,000 pounds of the purchase-money paid by the latter are tobe expended by them in public works and improvements, such as highroads, bridges, canals, school-houses, market-houses, churches, andparsonage-houses. This is an extremely important arrangement, and mustprove highly beneficial to settlers, as it assures to them theimprovement and advancement of this district. The formation of roads andother easy communications are the great wants of a new country; and theapplication of capital on works of this nature, which are beyond themeans of private individuals, is the best mode by which the successfulsettlement may be promoted and accomplished."The expenditure of the large sum above mentioned, will offer at thesame time an opportunity of employment to honest and industriouslabourers, immediately on arrival."The office of the British American Land Company is at 4, Barge-yard,Bucklersbury, London: they have also agents at the various outports.=======================================Transcription note: Except for the tables in the Appendix, which havebeen reformatted to accommodate the presentation of tables in plain text,this transcription attempts to faithfully reproduce the text andpunctuation found in the 1836 printed version of the book.

What mental shock, indeed, could prove immenser  To Mumbo Jumbo--or to HERBERT SPENCER?  Free Books? Reading provided from the Rates?  Oh, that means Freedom's ruin, and the State's!  Self-help's all right,--e'en if you rob a brother--  But human creatures must _not_ help each other!  The "Self-made Man," whom SAMUEL SMILES so praises,  Who on his fellows' necks his footing raises,  The systematic "Sweater," who sucks wealth  From toiling crowds by cunning and by stealth,--  _He_ is all right, _he_ has no maudlin twist,  _He_ does not shock the Individualist!  But rate yourselves to give the poor free reading?  The Pelican to warm her nestlings bleeding,  Was no such monument of feeble folly.  _Let folks alone_, and all will then be jolly.  Let the poor perish, let the ignorant sink,  The tempted tumble, and the drunkard drink!  Let--no, _don't_ let the low-born robber rob,  Because,--well, that would rather spoil the job.  If footpad-freedom brooked no interference,  Of Capital there might be a great clearance;  But, Wealth well-guarded, let all else alone.  'Tis thus our race hath to true manhood grown:  To make the general good the common care,  Breaks through the sacred law of _Laissez Faire_!       *       *       *       *       *A REMONSTRANCE._TO LUKE'S LITTLE SUMMER._[Illustration]  Ah, Summer! now thy wayward race is run,  With soft, appeasing smiles thou com'st, like one    Who keeps a pageant waiting all the day,  Till half the guests and all the joy is gone,    And hearts are heavy that awoke so gay.  What though the faithful trees, still gladly green,  Show fretted depths of blue their boughs between,    Though placid sunlight sleeps upon the lawn,  It only tells us of what might have been    Of fickle favours wantonly withdrawn.  Blown with rude winds, and beaten down with rain,  How can the roses dare to trust again    The tricksy mistress whom they once adored?  Even the glad heaven, chilled with stormy stain,    Grudges its skylark pilgrims of its hoard.  Poor is the vintage that the wild bee quiffs,  When the tall simple lilies--the giraffes    That browse on loftier air than other flowers--  When all the blooms, wherewith late Summer laughs,    Like chidden children droop among the bowers.  Oft like a moorhen scuttling to the reeds,  The cricket-ball sped o'er the plashy meads,    And rainbow-blended blazers shrank and ran  When showers, in mockery of his moist needs,    Half-drown'd the water-loving river man.  What woman's rights have crazed thee?      Would'st thou be  A Winter Amazon, more fierce than he?    Can Summer birds thy shrew-heroics sing?  Wilt tend no more the daisies on the lea,    Nor wake thy cowslips up on May morning?  What, shall we brew us possets by the fire  And let the wild rose shiver on the brier.    The cowslip tremble in the meadows chill,  While thy unlovely battle-call wails higher    And dusty squadrons charge adown the hill?  It is too late; thou art no love of mine;  I answer not this sigh, this kiss divine;    The sunlight penitently streaming down  Shines through the paling leaf like thinnest wine    Quaff'd in the clear air of a mountain town.  Farewell! For old love's sake I kiss thy hands;  Go on thy way; away to other lands    That love thee less, and need thee less than we;  Pour out thy passion on some desert sands,    Forget thy lover of the Northern Sea.  Away with fond pretence; let winter come  With snow that strikes the heaviest footfall dumb.    We know the worst, and face his rage with glee;  And, though the world without be ne'er so glum,    Sit by the hearth, and dream and talk--of thee.  Yes, come again with earliest April; stay,  Thyself once more, through the fair time when day    Clasps hand with day, through the brief hush of night--  A twilight bower of roses, where in play    Dance little maidens through from light to light.       *       *       *       *       *BIRDS OF A FEATHER.    [Lord HAWKE's team of Cricketers were beaten at Manheim by    the Philadelphians by eight wickets whereat the _Philadelphia    Ledger_ cockadoodles considerably. The Britishers, however,    won the return match somewhat easily.]  The Yankee Eagle well might squeal and squawk  At having licked the British bird (Lord) HAWKE.  But when that HAWKE his brood had "pulled together,"  That Eagle found it yet might "moult a feather."  Go it, ye friendly-fighting fowls! But know  'Tis only "Roosters" who o'er conquest _crow_!       *       *       *       *       *HOME SWEET HOME!(_BY ONE WHO BELIEVES THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE IT._)[Illustration]  Sweet to return (for home the Briton hankers,    After an exile of two months or so,  Swiss or Italian). Sweet--to find your Banker's      Balance getting low.  Sweet to return from Como or Sorrento.    Meshed in their shimmering net of drowsy sheen,  Into a climate that you know not when to      Really call serene.  Sweet to return from hostelries whose waiters    Rush to fulfil your slightest word or whim,  Back to a cook who passionately caters      Not for you, but _him_.  Sweet to return from _Table-d'Hotes_ disgusting    (Oh, how you grumbled at the _Sauce Romaine_!)  Fresh to the filmy succulence incrusting      Solid joints again.  Sweet to return from Innkeepers demurely    Pricing your candle at a franc unshamed,  Back to a land where perquisites are surely      Never, never claimed.  Sweet to return from bargaining, disputing,    _Pourboires_ and _Trinkgelds_ grudgingly bestowed--  Unto the simple charioteers of Tooting,      Or the Cromwell Road.  Sweet to return from "all those dreadful tourists,"    Such mixed society as chance allots,  E'en to the social splendour of the purists      Of those sparkling spots.  Sweet to return to bills and fogs and duty!    (Some of the latter at our Custom House)  Sweet, after smaller game, to hail the beauty        Of the British mouse!  Sweet too the sight of cockchafer; and sweet'll    Welcome the pilgrim, doomed too long to roam,  England's tried sentinel, the black, black beetle      With his "Home, sweet Home!"       *       *       *       *       *[Illustration: LONDON'S DILEMMA; OR, "FAIR ROSAMOND" UP TO DATE.(_Lately-discovered Fragments of a valuable and interesting "Variant"of the old Ballad Story._)]       *       *       *       *       *  When as VICTORIA rulde this land,    The firste of that greate name,  Faire Loundonne, of the cockneyes lovde,    Attaynd to power and fame.  Most peerlesse was her splendoure founde,    Her favour, and her face;  Yet was there one thing marred her weale,    And wroughte her dire disgrace.  Her dower was all that showered golde,    Like Danae's, could her lende,  Yet dwelt she in the ogreish holde    Of fell and fearsome fiende.  Yea Loundonne Towne, faire Loundonne Towne,    Her name was called so,  To whom the Witch Monopolie    Was known a deadlye foe.         *       *       *       *       *  Now when ye Countie Councile woke,    And FARRER rose to fame,  With envious heart Monopolie    To Loundonne straightway came.  "Cast off from thee those schemes," said she,    "That greate and costlye bee,  And drinke thou up this deadlye cup,    Which I have brought to thee!"  "Take pitty on my awkward plight!"    Faire Loundonne she dyd crye,  "And lett me not with poison stronge    Enforced be to dye!"  Then out and laught that wicked Witch:    "If that you will not drinke,  This dagger choose! Though you be riche,    You'll shrinke from _that_, I thinke."  The dagger was a magic blayde,    With figures graven o'er,  Which, as you gazed thereon, did seeme    To growe to more and more.  "Nay," quothe faire Loundonne, "'tis but choyce    'Twixt dyvill and deepe sea!  I praye thee take thyself awaye,    And leave the jobbe to me!"  But nothynge could this grasping Witch    Therewith appeased be.  The cup of deadlye poison stronge,    As she knelt on her knee,  She gave this comely dame to drinke,    Who tooke it in her hande,  Then from her bended knees arose,    And on her feet did stande.

DIED, OCT. 15, 1891.  "Wearing the white flower of a blameless life."TENNYSON.  GILBERT the Good! Title, though high, well earned  By him through whose rare nature brightly burned      The fire of purity,  Undimmed, unflickering, like some altar flame  Sky-pointing ever. Friend, what thought of blame      Hath coldest heart for thee?  A knightly-priest or priestly-knight wert thou,  Man of the radiant eye and reverent brow;      Chivalry closely knit  With fervent faith in thee indeed were blent;  Thought upon high ideals still intent,      And a most lambent wit.  Serene, though with a power of scathing scorn  For all things mean or base. Sorrow long borne,    Though bowing, soured not thee.  Bereaved, health-broken, still that patient smile  Wreathed the pale lips which never greed or guile      Shaped to hypocrisy.  A saintly-hearted wit, a satirist pure,  Mover of mirth spontaneous as sure,      And innocent as mad;  Incongruous freak and frolic phantasy  Were thy familiar spirits, quickening glee      And wakening laughter glad.  Dainty as _Ariel_, yet as _Puck_ profuse  Of the "preposterous," was that wit, whose use      Was ever held "within  The limits of becoming mirth." His whim  Never shy delicacy's glance could dim,      Or move the cynic grin.  But that fate's hampering hand lay on him long  He might have won in drama and in song      A more enduring name.  But he is gone, the gentle, loyal, just,  Whence all these things fall earthward with the dust      Of fleeting earthly fame.  Gone from our hoard, gone from the home he loved!  With what compassion are his comrades moved      For those who sit alone  With memories of him! Gracious memories all!  A thought to lighten, like that flower, his pall,      And hush love's troubled moan.  Farewell, fine spirit! To be owned thy friend  Was something to illume the unwelcome end      Of comradeship below.  A loving memory long our board will grace,  In fancy, with that sweet ascetic face.      That brow's benignant glow.       *       *       *       *       *RHYME AT RHYL.(_BY A LISTENING LAYMAN._)  If Cleric Congresses could only care    A little less for the mere Church and Steeple,  Parochial pomp and power in lion's share,    And have one aim--to purify the People,  They need not shrink from Disestablishment,    Or any other secular enormity;  Unselfish love of Man destroys Dissent,    True Charity provokes no Nonconformity.       *       *       *       *       *THE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.NO. XI.    SCENE--_A Balcony outside the Musik-Saal of the Insel Hotel,    Constance. Miss PRENDERGAST is seated; CULCHARD is leaning    against the railing close by. It is about nine; the moon has    risen, big and yellow, behind the mountains at the further    end of the lake; small black boats are shooting in and out of    her track upon the water; the beat of the steamers' paddles    is heard as they come into harbour. CULCHARD has just    proposed.__Miss Prendergast_ (_after a silence_). I have always felt verystrongly with RUSKIN, that no girl should have the cruelty to refuse aproposal--_Culchard_ (_with alacrity_). RUSKIN is always so right.And--er--where there is such complete sympathy in tastes and ideas, asI venture to think exists in our own case, the cruelty would--[Illustration: "It does seem rather rough on fellows, don't youknow."]_Miss P._ Pray allow me to finish! "Refuse a proposal _at once_" isRUSKIN's expression. He also says (if my memory does not betray me),that "no lover should have the insolence to think of being accepted atonce." You will find the passage somewhere in "_Fors_."_Culch._ (_whose jaw has visibly fallen_). I cannot say I recall itat this moment. Does he hold that a lover should expect to be acceptedby--er--instalments, because, if so--_Miss P._ I think I can quote his exact words. "If she simply doesn'tlike him, she may send him away for seven years--"_Culch._ (_stiffly_). No doubt that course is open to her. But whyseven, and where is he expected to go?_Miss P._ (_continuing calmly_). "He vowing to live on cresses andwear sackcloth meanwhile, or the like penance."_Culch._ I feel bound to state at once that, in my own case, myposition at Somerset House would render anything of that sort utterlyimpracticable._Miss P._ Wait, please,--you are so impetuous. "If she likes him alittle,"--(_CULCHARD's brow relaxes_)--"or thinks she might come tolike him in time, she may let him stay near her,"--(_CULCHARD makesa movement of relief and gratitude_)--"putting him always on sharptrial, and requiring, figuratively, as many lion-skins or giants'heads as she thinks herself worth."_Culch._ (_grimly_). "Figuratively" is a distinct concession onRUSKIN's part. Still, I should be glad to know--_Miss P._ If you will have a little more patience, I will make myselfclear. I have always determined that when the--ah--occasion presenteditself, I would deal with it on Ruskinian principles. I propose inyour case--presuming of course that you are willing to be under vowfor me--to adopt a middle course._Culch._ You are extremely good. And what precise form of--er--penancedid you think of?_Miss P._ The trial I impose is, that you leave Constanceto-morrow--with Mr. PODBURY._Culch._ (_firmly_). If you expect me to travel for seven years withhim, permit me to mention that I simply cannot do it. My leave expiresin three weeks._Miss P._ I mentioned no term, I believe. Long before three weeksare over we shall meet again, and I shall be able to see how youhave borne the test. I wish you to correct, if possible, a certainintolerance in your attitude towards Mr. PODBURY. Do you accept thisprobation, or not?_Culch._ I--ah--suppose I have no choice. But you really must allow meto say that it is _not_ precisely the reception I anticipated. Still,in your service, I am willing to endure even PODBURY--for a strictlylimited period; that I _do_ stipulate for._Miss P._ That, as I have already said, is quite understood. Now goand arrange with Mr. PODBURY._Culch._ (_to himself, as he retires_). It is _most_ unsatisfactory;but at least PODBURY is disposed of!    _The same Scene, a quarter of an hour later. PODBURY and    Miss PRENDERGAST.__Podbury_ (_with a very long face_). No, I _say_, though! RUSKINdoesn't say all that?_Miss P._ I am not in the habit of misquoting. If you wish to verifythe quotation, however, I daresay I could find you the reference in_Fors Clavigera_._Podb._ (_ruefully_). Thanks--I won't trouble you. Only it does seemrather rough on fellows, don't you know. If everyone went on hisplan--well, there wouldn't be many marriages! Still, I never thoughtyou'd say "Yes" right off. It's like my cheek, I know, to ask you atall; you're so awfully clever and that. And if there's a chance forme, I'm game for anything in the way of a trial. Don't make it stifferthan you can help, that's all!_Miss P._ All I ask of you is to leave me for a short time, and go andtravel with Mr. CULCHARD again._Podb._ Oh, I say, Miss PRENDERGAST, you know. Make it something else._Do!__Miss P._ That is the task I require, and I can accept no other. It isnothing, after all, but what you came out here to do._Podb._ I didn't know him _then_, you see.

PUNCH'S KIND PERMISSION._)[Illustration]  Yes, I read your effusion that lately got printed,    And at first never guessed there was anything meant.  But when someone suggested that something was hinted,    On your verses some time I reluctantly spent.  They are fair--and perhaps _you_ consider them clever,    You're a poet, no doubt, of a _minor_ degree,  But I never was startled so strangely--no, never!    As to learn that the lady you mentioned was me!  In the coolest of ways you sum up my attractions,    Pray allow me to turn my attention to _you_.  You are good, I believe, at the vulgarest fractions,    You have cheek and assurance sufficient for two.  You are what people reckon "a nice sort of fellow,"    Your sense of importance very strongly you feel.  You are bilious, you've got a complexion of yellow,    You are plainer than I am--which says a good deal.  "Am I free altogether from blame in the matter?"--    And as to my frowning, I don't know the way--  Do you really imagine that insolent chatter    Can affect me, or that _I_ care for what people say?  With fervent adorers around by the dozen,    For whom but my word is the law of their life.  Do you think I'd occasion to pitch on a cousin,    And announce that _you_ wanted myself as your wife?  Do not think I am angry, I am good at forgiving,    Have my constant refusals then made you so sour?  Even poets in _Punch_ have to write for their living,    And must wear their poor lives out at so much the hour.  I am weary and tired of being proposed to,    And at times I'm afraid it will injure my brain,  But my heart for the future yourself, mind, is closed to,    So don't, I implore, come proposing again.       *       *       *       *       *A REAL BURNING QUESTION.--What should be done with the mischievous andmalicious noodles who communicate false alarms (to the number of 518in one year) to the London Fire Brigade, by means of the fire-alarmposts fixed for public convenience and protection in the publicthoroughfares?

It is the favourite eye-language of the cynical cad, the coarsejester, the crapulous clown, and--above all--the chuckling cheat.[Illustration]It must be admitted, that the Muse of the Music Hall--in her Momusmood--has a strong leaning towards the glorification of cynical'cuteness of the _Autolycus_ sort. It is a weakness which she seemsto share with party scribes and Colonial politicians.

"Ha, ha!what a fool Honesty is! and Trust his sworn brother, a very simplegentleman" is, virtually, the burthen of dozens of the most favouriteof the Music-hall ditties.Sly-scheming Hermes "winked" knowingly at Jupiter when he was"pitching his yarn" about the stolen oxen, and Jupiter "according tohis wont,"  "Laughed heartily to hear the subtle witted  Infant give such a plausible account,  And every word a lie."So the Music-hall Muse "winks" knowingly, and knavishly, at heraudience, and her audience "laugh heartily," in Jovian guffaws, at herwinks. What wonder then that she should lyrically apostrophise "TheWink" in laudatory numbers?  "Say, boys, now is it quite the thing?"she cries in sham deprecation, but all the while she "winks the othereye" in a way her hearers quite understand. "Cabby knows his fare,"and the Music-hall Muse knows her clients. What, we wonder, wouldbe her reception did she really carry out her ironically pretendedprotest and sing to the chuckling cads who applaud her, the followingversion of her favourite lay?NO. II.--THE WINK OF ROGUERY'S EYE.AIR--"_WINK THE OTHER EYE_."  Say, boys, whatever do men mean  When they wink the other eye?  Why, when "sharps" say the world is "green,"  Do they wink the other eye?  The Radicals and Tories both tell stories, not a few,  About Measures falsely promised, and reforms long overdue;  And when the simple Mob believes that every word is true.  Then they--wink the other eye!    _Chorus_.--Say, boys, now is it quite the thing!        Say, should we let them have their fling?        Ah, when they get us "on a string"        Then they wink the other eye!  Say, boys are Leaders to be loved,  When they wink the other eye?  By artful speech the Mob is moved,  Till _it_ winks the other eye;  The optic Wink's the language of the sly and sordid soul,  The mute freemasonry of Fraud, sign-post to Roguery's goal.  When Circe sees her votaries swine ready in sludge to roll  Then _she_ winks the other eye!    _Chorus_.--Say, boys, _is_ it so fine a thing,        Low Cunning, which Cheat's laureates sing,        The Comus of the Mart and Ring,        Who--winks the other eye?  Say, boys, is Cunning's promise good,  When she winks the other eye?  Noodledom seeks her neighbourhood,  And winks _its_ other eye.  For no one winks so freely as a fool who _thinks_ he's sly;  The dupe of deeper knavery smirks in shallow mimicry  Of the smirking JERRY DIDDLER who is sucking him so dry,  And who winks the other eye.    _Chorus_.--Say, boys, now is the Wink a thing        Worthy of worship; will you fling        Your caps in air for the Knave-King        Who--winks the other eye?  The Politician plucks his geese,  Then he winks the other eye.  Brazen Fraud steals Trade's Golden Fleece,  Then he winks the other eye.  _Autolycus_ pipes ballads; public pockets are his aim;  _Rabagas_ raves of "liberty"; advancement is his game;  And when their dupes aren't looking all these rogues do just the same,  They--wink the other eye!    _Chorus_.--Say, boys, paeans will you sing        To winking harpies all a-wing        To prey on fools; who steal, and sting,        And--wink the other eye?  Wisdom may smile, but Cunning can't,  She winks the other eye.  Humour shall chortle, Mockery shan't,  She winks the other eye.  The stars above us twinkle and the dews beneath us blink,  All the eyes of Nature sparkle, and from merriment do not shrink,  The Language of the Eye of Cynic Knavery is--the Wink!  _Roguery_ "winks the other eye!"    _Chorus_.--Say, boys, is it quite the thing?        "Ducdame"[1] to fools the Diddlers sing;        Trust me 'tis Rascals in a Ring        Who wink the other eye![Footnote 1:  _Amiens_. What's that "ducdame"?  _Jaques_. 'Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a circle."_As You Like It_," _Act II., Sc. 5._]       *       *       *       *       *THE EVOLUTION OF TOMMY'S PRIVATE-SCHOOL REPORT.1. _A rough draught, written by the under-master, who certainly hashad rather a trying week with_ TOMMY."I am unable to speak highly of either his intelligence or hisindustry; but occasionally he works well, and has undoubtedly madesome progress this term. His conduct is not always good."2. _Second rough draught_; TOMMY _in the meantime has missed arepetition and accidentally knocked down the black-board._"Exceptionally stupid and idle. Cannot be said to have made anyprogress whatever this term, although he has had every effort madewith him. His conduct is abominable, noisy and unruly in the extreme."3. _Fair copy to be submitted to the principal; of course_, TOMMY _hadnot intended to be overheard when he spoke of the under-master as_"_Old Pig-face_," _but this is the result._"A more idle and utterly worthless boy it has never been my misfortuneto teach. Seems to have gone steadily backward all the term. Is mostobjectionable in his manners, and has no sense of honour."4. _Fair copy, as amended by the principal; how was_ TOMMY _toknow that stone would break the conservatory window, and drive theprincipal to alter the report to this?_"Would be better suited in a reformatory than in a school of thisstanding. Utterly depraved, vicious and idle, with marked criminalinstincts. In intellect verges on the imbecile. Unless there is amarked improvement next term, I cannot keep him."5. _Principal's final copy; it_ was _fortunate that_ TOMMY _happenedto remark that he had four cousins who were, perhaps, coming nextterm. One can't lose four pupils, even if it makes it necessary towrite like this._"A singularly bright and high-spirited boy; a little given tomischief, as all boys are, but quite amenable to discipline.

I have beenunder fire without fighting; known the comradeship of arms withoutbearing arms, and the hardships and the humors of the march with only anobserver's incentive. A singular career, begun by chance, was pursued tothe ends of the earth in the study of the greatest drama which the earthstages. Whether watching a small force of white regulars disciplining aprimitive people, or the complex tactics of huge army against huge army;whether watching war in the large or in the small, I have found the samebasic human qualities in the white heat of conflict working out the sameillusions, heroisms, tragedies, and comedies.The fellowship of campaigning made the cause of the force that Iaccompanied mine for the time being. Thus, one who settles in the townof A absorbs its local feeling of rivalry against the town of B inathletic games or character of citizenship. To A, B is never quitesportsmanlike; B is provincial and bigoted and generally inferior. Butsettle in B and your prejudices reverse their favor from A to B.Yet in the midst of battle, with the detachment of a non-combatantmarvelling at the irony of two lines of men engaged in an effort atmutual extermination, I have caught myself thinking with the other side.I knew why my side was busy at killing. Why was the other? For the samereasons as ours.I was seeing humanity against humanity. A man killed was a man killed,courage was courage, sacrifice was sacrifice, romance was romance, aheart-broken mother was a heart-broken mother, a village burned was avillage burned, regardless of race or nation. Every war became a storyin a certain set form: the rise of the war passion; the conflict;victory and defeat; and then peace, in joyous relief, which the nationsenjoyed before they took the trouble to fight for it.But such thoughts have been a familiar theme to the poet, the novelist,the dramatist, the satirist, the dreamer, and the peace propagandist,while the world goes on arming. In want of their talent, I offerexperience of the monstrous object of their gibes and imagination. Tome, the old war novels have the atmosphere of smoke powder andantiquated tactics which still survived when I went on my first campaignsixteen years ago. These classic masterpieces endure through theirgenius; the excuse of any plodder who chooses their theme to-day is thathe deals with the material of to-day.Methods of light and of motive power have not changed more rapidly inthe forty-odd years since the last great European war than the soldier'sweapons and his work. With all the symbols of economic improvement thepublic is familiar, while usually it thinks of war in the old symbolsfor want of familiarity with the new. My aim is to express not only waras fought to-day, soldiers of to-day under the fire of arms of to-day,but also the effects of war in the _n_th degree of modern organizationand methods on a group of men and women, free in its realism from thewild improbabilities of some latter-day novelists who have given uswars in the air or regaled us with the decimation of armies byexplosives dropped from dirigibles or their asphyxiation by noxiousgases compounded by the hero of the tale.The Russo-Japanese and the Balkan campaigns, particular in their nature,gave me useful impressions, but not the scene for my purpose. The worldmust think of those wars comparatively as second-rate and only partiallyillustrative, when its fearful curiosity and more fearful apprehensioncentre on the possibility of the clash of arms between the enormousforces of two first-class European land-powers, with their supremetraining and precision in arms. What would such a war mean in reality tothe soldiers engaged? What the play of human elements? What form the newsymbols? Therefore have I laid my scene in a small section of a Europeanfrontier, and the time the present.Identify your combatants, some friends insist. Make the Italians fightthe Austrians or the French fight the Germans. As a spectator of wars,under the spell of the growing cosmopolitanism that makes mankind moreand more akin, I could not see it in that way and be true to myexperience. My soldiers exist for my purpose only as human beings. Raceprejudices they have. Race prejudice is one of the factors of war. Butmake the prejudice English, Italian, German, Russian, or French andthere is the temptation for reader and author to forget the story of menas men and war as war. Even as in the long campaign in Manchuria I wouldsee a battle simply as an argument to the death between little fellowsin short khaki blouses and big fellows in long gray coats, so I see theBrowns and the Grays in "The Last Shot" take the field.But, though the scene is imaginary, the characters are from life. Theiractions and their sayings are those of men whom I have studied under thestress of danger and sudden emergency. The delightful, boyish confidenceof Eugene Aronson has been at my elbow in a charge; Feller I knew in thetropics as an outcast who shared my rations; Dellarme's last words Iheard from a dying captain; the philosophy of Hugo Mallin is no lessfamiliar than the bragging of Pilzer or the transformation of Stransky,who whistled a wedding-march as he pumped bullets at the enemy. InLanstron we have a type of the modern officer; in the elder Fragini atype of the soldier of another day. Each marches in his place and playshis part in the sort of spectacle that I have often watched. If there beno particular hero, then I can only say, in confidence behind thescenes, that I have found no one man, however heroic in the martialimagination of his country, to be a particular hero in fact. Take, forexample, our trembling little Peterkin, who won the bronze cross forcourage.As for Marta and Minna, they speak for another element--for a good halfof the world's population that does not bear arms. In a siege once I hadglimpses of women under fire and I learned that bravery is not anexclusively masculine trait. The game of solitaire? Well, it occurred ina house in the midst of bursting shells. But the part that Marta plays?Is it extravaganza? Not in war. The author sees it as something veryreal.FREDERICK PALMER.CONTENTS        I.  A SPECK IN THE SKY       II.  TEN YEARS LATER      III.

The newest and mostwonderful thing in the world at the time was this speck appearing abovethe irregular horizon of the Brown range, in view of a landscape thatcenturies of civilization had fertilized and cultivated and formed.At the base of the range ran a line of white stone posts, placed byinternational commissions of surveyors to the nicety of an inch'svariation. In the very direction of the speck's flight a spur offoot-hills extended into the plain that stretched away to the Grayrange, distinct at the distance of thirty miles in the bright afternoonlight. Faithful to their part in refusing to climb, the white postscircled around the spur, hugging the levels.In the lap of the spur was La Tir, the old town, and on the other sideof the boundary lay South La Tir, the new town. Through both ran thedusty ribbon of a road, drawn straight across the plain and over theglistening thread of a river. On its way to the pass of the Brown rangeit skirted the garden of the Gallands, which rose in terraces to aseventeenth-century house overlooking the old town from its outskirts.They were such a town, such a road, such a landscape as you may see onmany European frontiers. The Christian people who lived in the regionwere like the Christian people you know if you look for the realities ofhuman nature under the surface differences of language and habits.Beyond the house rose the ruins of a castle, its tower still intact.Marta always referred to the castle as the baron; for in her girlhoodshe had a way of personifying all inanimate things. If the castle wallswere covered with hoar frost, she said that the baron was shivering; ifthe wind tore around the tower, she said that the baron was groaningover the democratic tendencies of the time. On such a summer afternoonas this, the baron was growing old gracefully, at peace with hisenemies.Centuries older than the speck in the sky was the baron; but the passroad was many more, countless more, centuries older than he. It had beena trail for tribes long before Roman legions won a victory in the pass,which was acclaimed an imperial triumph. To hold the pass was to holdthe range. All the blood shed there would make a red river, inundatingthe plain. Marta, a maker of pictures, saw how the legions, brown,sinewy, lean aliens, looked in their close ranks. They were no less realto her imagination than the infantry of the last war thirty years ago,or the Crusaders who came that way, or the baron in person and hisshaggy-bearded, uncouth, ignorant ruffians who were their own moral law,leaving their stronghold to plunder the people of the fertile plain ofthe fruits of their toil.Stone axe, spear and bow, javelin and broadsword, blunderbuss andcreaking cannon--all the weapons of all stages in the art of war--hadgone trooping past. Now had come the speck in the sky, straight on, likesome projectile born of the ether."Beside the old baron, we are parvenus," Marta would say. "And what aparvenu the baron would have been to the Roman aristocrat!""Our family is old enough--none older in the province!" Mrs. Gallandwould reply. "Marta, how your mind does wander! I'd get a headache justcontemplating the things you are able to think of in five minutes."The first Galland had built a house on the land that his king had givenhim for one of the most brilliant feats of arms in the history of thepass. He had the advantage of the baron in that he could read and write,though with difficulty. Marta had an idea that he was not presentable ata tea-table; however, he must have been more so than the baron, who, sheguessed, would have grabbed all the cakes on the plate as a sheer matterof habit in taking what he wanted unless a stronger than he interfered.Even the tower, raised to the glory of an older family whosedescendants, if any survived, were unaware of their lineage, had becomeknown as the Galland tower. The Gallands were rooted in the soil of thefrontier; they were used to having war's hot breath blow past theirdoor; they were at home in the language and customs of two peoples;theirs was a peculiar tradition, which Marta had absorbed with her firstbreath. Every detail of her circumscribed existence reminded her thatshe was a Galland.Town and plain and range were the first vista of landscape that she hadseen; doubtless they would be the last. Meanwhile, there was thehorizon. She was particularly fond of looking at it. If you areseventeen, with a fanciful mind, you can find much information not inhistories or encyclopaedias or the curricula of schools in the horizon.There she had learned that the Roman aristocrat had turned his thumbdown to a lot of barbarian captives because he had a fit of indigestion,and the next day, when his digestion was better, he had scattered coinsamong barbarian children; that Napoleon, who had also gone over the passroad, was a pompous, fat little man, who did not always wipe his upperlip clean of snuff when he was on a campaign; that the baron's youngestdaughter had lost her eyesight from a bodkin thrust for telling hersister, who had her father's temper, that she was developing a doublechin.For the people of Maria's visions were humanly real to her, and as suchshe liked and understood them. If the first Galland were half a robber,to disguise the fact because he was her ancestor was not playing fair.It made him only a lay figure of romance.One or two afternoons a week Colonel Hedworth Westerling, commander ofthe regimental post of the Grays on the other side of the white posts,stretched his privilege of crossing the frontier and appeared for tea atthe Gallands'. It meant a pleasant half-hour breaking a long walk, arelief from garrison surroundings. Favored in mind and person, favoredin high places, he had become a colonel at thirty-two. People with fixedideas as to the appearance of a soldier said that he looked every inchthe commander. He was tall, strong-built, his deep, broad chestsuggesting powerful energy. Conscious of his abilities, it was notwithout reason that he thought well of himself, in view of the order,received that morning, which was to make this a farewell call.He had found Mrs. Galland an agreeable reflection of an aristocraticpast. The daughter had what he defined vaguely as girlish piquancy. Hefound it amusing to try to answer her unusual questions; he liked thevariety of her inventive mind, with its flashes of downrightmatter-of-factness.Ascending the steps with his firm, regular tread, he suggested poise andconfidence and, perhaps, vanity also in his fastidious dress. As Marta'sslight, immature figure came to the edge of the veranda, he wonderedwhat she would be like five years later, when she would be twenty-twoand a woman. It was unlikely that he would ever know, or that in a monthhe would care to know. He would pass on; his rank would keep him fromreturning to South La Tir, which was a colonel's billet except in timeof war.Not until tea was served did he mention his new assignment; he wasgoing to the general staff at the capital. Mrs. Galland murmured hercongratulations in conventional fashion."Into the very holy of holies of the great war machine, isn't it?" Martaasked."Yes--yes, exactly!" he replied.Her chair was drawn back from the table. She leaned forward in afavorite position of hers when she was intensely interested, with handsclasped over her knee, which her mother always found aggravatinglytomboyish. She had a mass of lustrous black hair and a mouth ratherlarge in repose, but capable of changing curves of emotion. Her large,dark eyes, luminously deep under long lashes, if not the rest of herface, had beauty. Her head was bent, the lashes forming a line with herbrow now, and her eyes had the still flame of wonder that they had whenshe was looking all around a thing and through it to find what it meant.Westerling knew by the signs that she was going to break out with one ofher visions, rather than one of her whimsical ideas. She was seeing theRoman general, the baron, the first Galland, and the fat, pompous littleman, no less in the life than Hedworth Westerling. She had fused theminto one."Some day you will be chief of staff, the head of the Gray army!" shesuddenly exclaimed.Westerling started as if he had been surprised in a secret. Then heflushed slightly."Why?" he asked with forced carelessness. "Your reasons? They're moreinteresting than your prophecy.""Because you have the will to be," she said without emphasis, in theimpersonal revelations of thought. "You want power. You have ambition."He looked the picture of it, with his square jaw, his well-moulded headset close to the shoulders on a sturdy neck, his even teeth showing ashis lips parted in an unconscious smile."Marta, Marta! She is--is so explosive," Mrs. Galland remarkedapologetically to the colonel."I asked for her reasons. I brought it on myself--and it is not a badcompliment," he replied. Indeed, he had never received one so thrilling.His smile, a smile well pleased with itself, remained as Mrs. Gallandbegan to talk of other things, and its lingering satisfactiondisappeared only with Marta's cry at sight of the speck in the sky overthe Brown range. She was out on the lawn before the others had risenfrom their seats."An aeroplane! Hurry!" she called.This was a summons that aroused even Mrs. Galland's serenity to haste.For the first time they were seeing the new wonder in all thefascination of novelty to us moderns, who soon make our new wonderscommonplace and clamor impatiently for others."He flies! A man flies!" Marta exclaimed. "Look at that--coming straightfor your tower, baron! You'd better pull up the drawbridge and go onyour knees in the chapel, for devils are abroad!"How fast the speck grew! How it spread to the entranced vision! Itbecame a thing of still, soaring wings with a human atom in its centre,Captain Arthur Lanstron, already called a fool for his rashness by agroup of Brown officers on the aviation grounds beyond the Brown range.Naturally, the business of war, watching for every invention that mightserve its ends, was the first patron of flight. Lanstron, pupil of apioneer aviator, had been warned by him and by the chief of staff of theBrowns, who was looking on, to keep in a circle close to the ground. Buthe was doing so well that he thought he would try rising a littlehigher. When the levers responded with the ease of a bird's wings,temptation became inspiration and inspiration urged on temptation. Hehad gone mad with the ecstasy of his sensation, there between heaven andearth. Five seconds of this was worth five thousand years of any otherform of life.The summits of the range shot under him, unfolding a variegated rug oflandscape. He dipped the planes slightly, intending to follow therange's descent and again they answered to his desire. He saw himselfthe eyes of an army, the scout of the empyrean. If a body of troops wereto march along the pass road they would be as visible as a cloud in thesky. Yes, here was revolution in detecting the enemy's plans! He hadbecome momentarily unconscious of the swiftness of his progress, thanksto its hypnotic facility. He was in the danger which too active a brainmay bring to a critical and delicate mechanical task. The tower loomedbefore him as suddenly as if it had been shot up out of the earth. Hemust turn, and quickly, to avoid disaster; he must turn, or he would beacross the white posts in the enemy's country."Oh, glorious magic!" cried Marta."A dozen good shots could readily bring it down," remarked Westerlingcritically. "It makes a steady target at that angle of approach. He'sgoing to turn--but take care, there!""Oh!" groaned Marta and Mrs. Galland together.In an agony of suspense they saw the fragile creation of cloth andbamboo and metal, which had seemed as secure as an albatross riding onthe lap of a steady wind, dip far over, careen back in the otherdirection, and then the whirring noise that had grown with its flightceased. It was no longer a thing of winged life, defying the law ofgravity, but a thing dead, falling under the burden of a living weight."The engine has stopped!" exclaimed Westerling, any trace of emotion inhis observant imperturbability that of satisfaction that the machine wasthe enemy's. He was thinking of the exhibition, not of the man in themachine.Marta was thinking of the man who was about to die, a silhouette againstthe soft blue holding its own balance resolutely in the face of peril.She could not watch any longer; she could not wait on the catastrophe.She was living the part of the aviator more vividly than he, with hishand and mind occupied. She rushed down the terrace steps wildly, as ifher going and her agonized prayer could avert the inevitable. The plane,descending, skimmed the garden wall and passed out of sight. She heard athud, a crackling of braces, a ripping of cloth, but no cry.Westerling had started after her, exclaiming, "This is a case for firstaid!" while Mrs. Galland, taking the steps as fast as she could, broughtup the rear. Through the gateway in the garden wall could be seen theshoulders of a young officer, a streak of red coursing down his cheek,rising from the wreck. An inarticulate sob of relief broke from Marta'sthroat, followed by quick gasps of breath. Captain Arthur Lanstron waslooking into the startled eyes of a young girl that seemed to reflecthis own emotions of the moment after having shared those he had in theair."I flew! I flew clear over the range, at any rate!" he said. "And I'malive. I managed to hold her so she missed the wall and made an easybump."Marta smiled in the reaction from terror at his idea of an easy bump,while he was examining the damage to his person. He got one foot free ofthe wreck and that leg was all right. She shared his elation. Then hefound that the other was uninjured, just as she cried in distress:"But your hand--oh, your hand!"His left hand hung limp from the wrist, cut, mashed, and bleeding. Itsnerves numbed, he had not as yet felt any pain from the injury. Now heregarded it in a kind of awakening stare of realization of a deformityto come."Wool-gathering again!" he muttered to himself crossly.Then, seeing that she had turned white, he thrust the disgusting thingbehind his back and twinged with the movement. The pain was arriving."It must be bandaged! I have a handkerchief!" she begged. "I'm notgoing to faint or anything like that!""Only bruised--and it's the left. I am glad it was not the right," hereplied. Westerling arrived and joined Marta in offers of assistancejust as they heard the prolonged honk of an automobile demanding theright of way at top speed in the direction of the pass."Thank you, but they're coming for me," said Lanstron to Westerling ashe glanced up the road.Westerling was looking at the wreck. Lanstron, who recognized him as anofficer, though in mufti, kicked a bit of the torn cloth over someapparatus to hide it. At this Westerling smiled faintly. Then Lanstronsaluted as officer to officer might salute across the white posts,giving his name and receiving in return Westeling's.They made a contrast, these two men, the colonel of the Grays, swart andsturdy, his physical vitality so evident, and the captain of the Browns,some seven or eight years the junior, bareheaded, in dishevelled fatigueuniform, his lips twitching, his slender body quivering with the painthat he could not control, while his rather bold forehead and delicate,sensitive features suggested a man of nerve and nerves who might haveleft experiments in a laboratory for an adventure in the air. There wasa kind of challenge in their glances; the challenge of an ancient feudof their peoples; of the professional rivalry of polite duellists.Lanstron's slight figure seemed to express the weaker number of thethree million soldiers of the Browns; Westerling's bulkier one, the fourmillion five hundred thousand of the Grays."You had a narrow squeak and you made a very snappy recovery at the lastsecond," said Westerling, passing a compliment across the white posts.Marta could literally see a white post there between the two."That's in the line of duty for you and me, isn't it?" Lanstronreplied, his voice thick with pain as he forced a smile.There was no pose in his fortitude. He was evidently disgusted withhimself over the whole business, and he turned to the group of threeofficers and a civilian who alighted from a big Brown army automobile asif he were prepared to have them say their worst. They seemed betweenthe impulse of reprimanding and embracing him."I hope that you are not surprised at the result," said the oldest ofthe officers, a man of late middle age, rather affectionately andteasingly. He wore a single order on his breast, a plain iron cross, andthe insignia of his rank was that of a field-marshal."Not now. I should be again, sir," said Lanstron, looking full at thefield-marshal in the appeal of one asking for another chance. "I waswool-gathering. My mind was off duty for a second and I got a lesson inself-control at the expense of the machine. I treated it worse than itdeserved, and it treated me better than I deserved. But I shall notwool-gather next time. I've got a reminder more urgent than a stringtied around my finger.""Yes, that hand needs immediate attention," said the doctor. He andanother officer began helping Lanstron into the automobile."The first flight ever made over a range--even a low one! Thirty milesstraightaway!" remarked the civilian, making a cursory examination ofthe wreck of the machine which was a pattern known by his name."Very educational for our young man," said the field-marshal, and atsight of Mrs. Galland paused while they exchanged the greetings of oldfriends."Your Excellency, may we send back for you, sir?" called the doctor. Hewas not one to let rank awe him when duty pressed. "This hand ought tobe at the hospital at once.""I'm coming along. I've a train to catch," replied His Excellency,springing into the car. "No more wool-gathering, eh?" he said, givingLanstron a pat on the shoulder. To Lanstron this pat meant anotherchance."Good-by!" he called to the young girl, who was still watching him withbig, sympathetic eyes. "I am coming back soon and land in the field,there, and when I do. I'll claim a bunch of flowers.""Do! What fun!" she cried, as the car started."The field-marshal was Partow, their chief of staff?" Westerling asked."Yes," said Mrs. Galland. "I remember when he was a young infantryofficer before the last war, before he had won the iron cross and becomeso great. He was not of an army family--a doctor's son, but very cleverand skilful.""Getting a little old for his work!" remarked Westerling. "Butapparently he is keen enough to take a personal interest in anythingnew.""Wasn't it thrilling and--and terrible!" Marta exclaimed."Yes, like war at our own door again," replied Mrs. Galland, who knewwar. She had seen war raging on the pass road. "Lanstron, the young mansaid his name was," she resumed after a pause. "No doubt the Lanstronsof Thorbourg. An old family and many of them in the army.""The way he refused to give in--that was fine!" said Marta.Westerling, who had been engrossed in his own thoughts, looked up."Courage is the cheapest thing an army has! You can get hundreds ofyoung officers who are glad to take a risk of that kind. The thing is,"and his fingers pressed in on the palm of his hand in a pounding gestureof the forearm, "to direct and command--head work--organization!""If war should come again--" Marta began. Mrs. Galland nudged her. ABrown never mentioned war to an officer of the Grays; it was not at allin the accepted proprieties. But Marta rushed on: "So many would beengaged that it would be more horrible than ever.""You cannot make omelets without breaking eggs," Westerling answeredwith suave finality."I wonder if the baron ever said that!" Marta recollected that it was afavorite expression of the fat, pompous little man. "It sounds like thebaron, at all events."Westerling did not mind being likened to the baron. It was acorroboration of her prophecy. The baron must have been a great leaderof men in his time."The aeroplane will take its place as an auxiliary," he went on, hismind still running on the theme of her prophecy, which the meeting withLanstron had quickened. "But war will, as ever, be won by the bayonetthat takes and holds a position. We shall have no miracle victories,no--"There he broke off. He did not accompany Mrs. Galland and Marta back tothe house, but made his adieus at the garden-gate."I'm sure that I shall never marry a soldier!" Marta burst out as sheand her mother were ascending the steps."No?" exclaimed Mrs. Galland with the rising inflection of a placidscepticism that would not be drawn into an argument. Another of Marta'sexplosions! It was not yet time to think of marriage for her. If it hadbeen Mrs. Galland would not have been so hospitable to ColonelWesterling. She would hardly have been, even if the colonel had beenyounger, say, of Captain Lanstron's age. Though an officer was anofficer, whether of the Browns or the Grays, and, perforce, a gentlemanto be received with the politeness of a common caste, every beat of herheart was loyal to her race. Her daughter's hand was not for any Gray.Young Lanstron certainly must be of the Thorbourg Lanstrons, she mused.A most excellent family! Of course, Marta would marry an officer. Itwas the natural destiny of a Galland woman. Yet she was sometimesworried about Marta's whimsies. She, too, could wonder what Marta wouldbe like in five years.IITEN YEARS LATERDoes any man of power know whither the tendencies of his time areleading him, or the people whom he leads whither they are being led? Hadany one of these four heroes of the Grays in their heavy gilt framesdivined what kind of a to-morrow his day was preparing? All knew thepass of La Tir well, and if all had not won decisive battles they wouldhave been hung in the outer office or even in the corridors, where aline of half-forgotten or forgotten generals crooked down the stairwaysinto the oblivion of the basement. That unfortunate one whom the firstGalland had driven through the pass was quite obscured in darkness. Hewould soon be crowded out to an antique shop for sale as an example ofthe portrait art of his period.The privileged quartet on that Valhalla of victories, the walls of thechief of staff's room, personified the military inheritance of a greatnation; their names shone in luminous letters out of the thickeningshadows of the past, where those of lesser men grew dimmer as theirgenerations receded into history. He in the steel corselet, with highcheek-bones, ferret, cold eyes, and high, thin nose, its nostrils drawnback in an aristocratic sniff--camps were evil-smelling in thosedays--his casquette resting on his arm, was the progenitor of him withthe Louis XIV. curls; he of the early nineteenth century, with a facelike Marshal Ney's, was the progenitor of him with the mustache andimperial of the sixties.It was whispered that the aristocratic sniff had taken to fierce,no-quarter campaigns in the bitterness of a broken heart. Did theGrays, then, really owe two of their fairest provinces to the lady whohad jilted him? Had they to thank the clever wife of him of the LouisXIV. curls, whose intrigues won for her husband command of the army, foranother province? It was whispered, too, that the military glory of himof the Marshal Ney physiognomy was due to the good fortune of a senilefield-marshal for an opponent. But no matter. These gentlemen had seenthe enemy fly. They had won. Therefore, they were the supermen of sagaswho incarnate a people's valor.The Browns gratified their own sense of superiority, in turn, byadmiration of the supermen who had vanquished the Gray generalsconsigned to the oblivion of the basement. In their staff building, thefirst Galland occupied a prominent position in the main hall; while inthe days of Marta's old baron heroes did not have their portraitspainted for want of painters, and the present nations had consisted onlyof warring baronies and principalities.They must have been rather lonely, these immortals in the Gray Valhalla,as His Excellency the chief of staff was seldom in his office. HisExcellency had years, rank, prestige. The breast of his uniform saggedwith the weight of his decorations. He appeared for the army at greatfunctions, his picture was in the shop-windows. Hedworth Westerling, thenew vice-chief of staff, was content with this arrangement. His yearswould not permit him the supreme honor. This was for a figurehead, whilehe had the power.His appointment to the staff ten years ago had given him the fields hewanted, the capital itself, for the play of his abilities. His vitalenergy, his impressive personality, his gift for courting the influencesthat counted, whether man's or woman's, his astute readiness in stoopingto some measures that were in keeping with the times but not with armyprecedent, had won for him the goal of his ambition. He had passed overthe heads of older men, whom many thought his betters, ratherruthlessly. Those who would serve loyally he drew around him; those whowere bitter he crowded out of his way.The immortals would have been still more lonely, or at least confused,in the adjoining room occupied by Westerling. There the walls were hungwith the silhouettes of infantrymen, such as you see at manoeuvres, indifferent positions of firing, crouching in shallow trenches, standingin deep trenches, or lying flat on the stomach on level earth. Anothersilhouette, that of an infantryman running, was peppered with whitepoints in arms and legs and parts of the body that were not vital, toshow in how many places a man may be hit with a small-calibre bullet andstill survive.The immortals had small armies. Even the mustache and imperial had onlythree hundred thousand in the great battle of the last war. In this dayof universal European conscription, if Westerling were to win it wouldbe with five millions--five hundred thousand more than when he faced ayoung Brown officer over the wreck of an aeroplane--including thereserves; each man running, firing, crouching, as was the figure on thewall, and trying to give more of the white points that peppered thesilhouette than he received.Now Turcas, the assistant vice-chief of staff, and Bouchard, chief ofthe division of intelligence, standing on either side of Westerling'sdesk, awaited his decisions on certain matters which they had brought tohis attention. Both were older than Westerling, Turcas by ten andBouchard by fifteen years.Turcas had been strongly urged in inner army circles for the place thatWesterling had won, but his manner and his inability to court influencewere against him A lath of a man and stiff as a lath, pale, with thin,tightly-drawn lips, quiet, steel-gray eyes, a tracery of blue veinsshowing on his full temples, he suggested the ascetic no less than thesoldier, while his incisive brevity of speech, flavored now and thenwith pungent humor, without any inflection in his dry voice, was inkeeping with his appearance. He arrived with the clerks in the morningand frequently remained after they were gone. His life was an affair ofcalculated units of time; his habits of diet and exercise all regulatedfor the end of service. His subordinates, whose respect he held by thepower of his intellect, said that his brain never tired and he had notenough body to tire. He was one of the wheels of the great army machineand loved the work for its own sake too well to be embittered at beingovershadowed by a younger man. As a master of detail Westerling regardedhim as an invaluable assistant, with certain limitations, which werethose of the pigeonhole and the treadmill.As for Bouchard, nature had meant him to be a wheel-horse. He had neverhad any hope of being chief of staff. Hawk-eyed, with a great beak noseand iron-gray hair, intensely and solemnly serious, lacking a sense ofhumor, he would have looked at home with his big, bony hands gripping abroadsword hilt and his lank body clothed in chain armor. He had amastiff's devotion to its master for his chief."Since Lanstron became chief of intelligence of the Browns informationseems to have stopped," said Westerling, but not complainingly. Heappreciated Bouchard's loyalty."Yes, they say he even burns his laundry bills, he is so careful,"Bouchard replied."But that we ought to know," Westerling proceeded, referring veryinsistently to a secret of the Browns which had baffled Bouchard. "Try awoman," he went on with that terse, hard directness which reflected oneof his sides. "There is nobody like a woman for that sort of thing.Spend enough to get the right woman."Turcas and Bouchard exchanged a glance, which rose suggestively from thetop of the head of the seated vice-chief of staff. Turcas smiledslightly, while Bouchard was graven as usual."You could hardly reach Lanstron though you spent a queen's ransom,"said Bouchard in his literal fashion."I should say not!" Westerling exclaimed. "No doubt about Lanstron'sbeing all there! I saw him ten years ago after his first aeroplaneflight under conditions that proved it. However, he must havesusceptible subordinates.""We'll set all the machinery we have to work to find one, sir," Bouchardreplied."Another thing, we may dismiss any idea that they are concealing eitherartillery or dirigibles or planes that we do not know of," continuedWesterling. "That is a figment of our apprehensions. The fact that wefind no truth in the rumors proves that there is none. Such things aretoo important to be concealed by one army from another.""Lanstron certainly cannot carry them in his pockets," remarked Turcas."Still, we must be sure," he added thoughtfully, more to himself than toWesterling, who had already turned his attention to a document whichTurcas had laid on the desk."A recommendation by the surgeon-in-chief," said Turcas, "for a newmethod of prompt segregation of ghastly cases among the wounded. I haveput it in the form of an order. If reserves coming into action see menbadly lacerated by shell fire it is bound to make them self-consciousand affect morale.""Yes," Westerling agreed. "If moving pictures of the horrors of PortArthur were to be shown in our barracks before a war, it would hardlyencourage martial enthusiasm. I shall look this over and then have itissued. It will not be necessary to wait on action of the staff incouncil."Turcas and Bouchard exchanged another glance. They had fresh evidence ofWesterling's tendency to concentrate authority in himself."The 128th Regiment has been ordered to South La Tir, but no order yetgiven for the 132d, whose place it takes," Turcas went on."Let it remain for the present!" Westerling replied.After they had withdrawn, the look that passed between Turcas andBouchard was a pointed question. The 132d to remain at South La Tir! Wasthere something more than "newspaper talk" in this latest diplomaticcrisis between the Grays and the Browns? Westerling alone was in theconfidence of the premier of late. Any exchange of ideas between the twosubordinates would be fruitless surmise and against the very instinct ofstaff secrecy, where every man knew only his work and asked about no oneelse's.Westerling ran through the papers that Turcas had prepared for him. IfTurcas had written the order for the wounded, Westerling knew that itwas properly done. Having cleared his desk into the hands of hisexecutive clerk, he looked at the clock. It had barely turned four. Hepicked up the final staff report of observations on the late Balkancampaign, just printed in book form, glanced at it and laid it aside.Already he knew the few lessons afforded by this war "done on thecheap," with limited equipment and over bad roads. No dirigibles hadbeen used and few planes. It was no criterion, except in the effect ofthe fire of the new pattern guns, for the conflict of vast masses ofhighly trained men against vast masses of highly trained men, with rapidtransportation over good roads, complete equipment, thoroughorganization, backed by generous resources, in the cataclysm of twogreat European powers.Rather idly, now, he drew a pad toward him and, taking up a pencil, madethe figures seventeen and twenty-seven. Then he made the figuresthirty-two and forty-two. He blackened them with repeated tracings as hemused. This done, he put seventeen under twenty-seven and thirty-twounder forty-two. He made the subtraction and studied the two tens.A swing door opened softly and his executive clerk reappeared with asoft tread, unheard by Westerling engaged in mechanically blackening thetens. The clerk, pausing as he waited for a signal of recognition,observed the process wonderingly. To be absently making figures on a padwas not characteristic of the vice-chief of staff. When he was absorbedhis habit was to tap the desk edge with the blunt end of his pencil."Some papers for your signature, sir," said the clerk as he slipped themon the blotter in front of Westerling. "And the 132d--no order aboutthat, sir?" he asked."None. It remains!" Westerling replied.The clerk went out impressed. His chief taking to sums of subtractionand totally preoccupied! The 132d to remain! He, too, had aquestion-mark in his secret mind.Westerling proceeded with his mathematics. Having heavily shaded thetens, he essayed a sum in division. He found that ten went into seventyjust seven times."One-seventh the allotted span of life!" he mused. "Take off fifteenyears for youth and fifteen after fifty-five--nobody counts after that,though I mean to--and you have ten into forty, which is one fourth. Thatis a good deal. But it's more to a woman than to a man--yes, a lot moreto a woman than to a man!"The clerk was right in thinking Westerling preoccupied; but it was notwith the international crisis. He had dismissed that for the presentfrom his thoughts by sending the 128th Regiment to South La Tir. Hemight move some other regiments in the morning if advices from thepremier warranted. At all events, the army was ready, always ready forany emergency. He was used to international crises. Probably a dozen hadoccurred in the ten years since he had spoken his adieu to a young girlat a garden-gate. Over his coffee the name of Miss Marta Galland, in alist of arrivals at a hotel, had caught his eye in the morning paper. Anote to her had brought an answer, saying that her time was limited,but she would be glad to have him call at five that afternoon.Rather impatiently he watched the slow minute-hand on the clock. He hadrisen from his desk at four-thirty, when his personal aide, a handsome,boyish, rosy-cheeked young officer, who seemed to be moulded into hisuniform, appeared."Your car is waiting, sir," he said. His military correctness could nothide the admiration and devotion in his eyes. He thought himself themost fortunate lieutenant in the army. To him Westerling was, indeed,great. Westerling realized this."This is a personal call," Westerling explained; "so you are at libertyto make one yourself, if you like," he added, with that magnetic smileof a genial power which he used to draw men to him and hold them.IIIOURS AND THEIRSOn the second terrace, Feller, the Gallands' gardener, a patch of blueblouse and a patch of broad-brimmed straw hat over a fringe of whitehair, was planting bulbs. Mrs. Galland came down the path from theveranda loiteringly, pausing to look at the flowers and again at thesweep of hills and plain. The air was singularly still, so still thatshe heard the cries of the children at play in the yards of thefactory-workers' houses which had been steadily creeping up the hillfrom the town. She breathed in the peace and beauty of the surroundingswith that deliberate appreciation of age which holds to the happiness inhand. To-morrow it might rain; to-day it is pleasant. She was gettingold. Serenely she made the most of to-day.The gardener did not look up when she reached his side. She watched hisfingers firmly pressing the moist earth around the bulbs that he hadsunk in their new beds. There were only three more to set out, and herinclination, in keeping with her leisureliness, was to wait on thecompletion of his task before speaking. Again she let her glance wanderaway to the distances. It was arrested and held this time by two groupsof far-away points in the sky along the frontier, in the same brightlight of that other afternoon when Captain Arthur Lanstron had made hisfirst night over the range."Look!" she cried. "Look, look!" she repeated, a girlish excitementrippling her placidity.Aeroplanes and dirigibles had become a familiar sight. They were alwaysgoing and coming and manoeuvring, the Browns over their territory andthe Grays over theirs. But here was something new: two squadrons ofdirigibles and planes in company, one on either side of the white posts.For the fraction of a second the dirigibles seemed prisms and the planesstill-winged dragon-flies hung on a blue wall. With the next fractionthe prisms were seen to be growing and the stretch of the plane wingsbroadening."They are racing--ours against theirs!" exclaimed Mrs. Galland. "Look,look!"Still the gardener bent to his work, unconcerned."I forgot! I always forget that you are deaf!" she murmured.She touched his shoulder. The effect was magical on the stoop-shoulderedfigure, which rose with the spring of muscles that are elastic andjoints that are limber. His hat was removed with prompt and rathergraceful deference, revealing eyebrows that were still dark in contrastto the white hair. For only an instant did he remain erect, but longenough to suggest how supple and well-formed he must have been in youth.Then he made a grimace and dropped his hand demonstratively over hisknee."Pardon, Mrs. Galland, I have old bones. They always remind me if I tryto play any youthful tricks on them. Pardon! I did not see that you werehere. I," he said, in the monotonous voice of the deaf, which, however,had a certain attractive wistfulness--"I--" and from the same throat ashe saw the object of her gaze came a vibration of passionate interest."Yes, neck and neck! Coming right for the baron's tower, neck and neck!"he cried, in the zest of a contest understood and enjoyed.His hand rose in a vigorous, pulsating gesture; his eyes were snapping;his lips parted in an ecstasy that made him seem twenty years younger;his shoulders broadened and his chest expanded with the indrawing of adeep breath. This let go, the stoop returned in a sudden reaction, thebriefly kindled flame died out of his eyes, his lips took on the droopof age, and he thrust his hat back on his head, pulling the brim lowover his brow."Wonderful, but terrible--terrible!" said Mrs. Galland. "Another horroris added to war, as if there were not already enough. Oh, I know whatwar is! I've seen this garden all spattered with blood and dead bodiesin a row here at our feet, and heard the groans and the cheers--thegroans of the wounded here in the garden and the cheers of the men whohad taken the castle hill!"Feller, with the lids of shaded eyes half closed, watched the oncomingsquadrons in a staring mesmerism. His only movement was a tattoo of thefingers on his trousers' legs."War!" he exclaimed with motionless lips. "War!" he repeated softly,coaxingly. One would easily have mistaken the thought of war assomething delightful to him if he had not appeared so gentle anddetached. It seemed doubtful if he realized what he was saying or eventhat he was speaking aloud.As the Gray squadron started to turn in order to keep on their side ofthe white posts which circled around the spur of La Tir, one of thedirigibles failed to respond to its rudder and lost speed; that in therear, responding too readily, had its leader on the thwart. Anaeroplane, sheering too abruptly to make room, tipped at a dangerousangle and a tragedy seemed due within another wink of the eye."Huh-huh-huh!" came from Feller in quick breaths, like the panting of adog on a hot day."Oh!" gasped Mrs. Galland in one long breath of suspense.The envelope of the second dirigible grazed the envelope of its leader;the groggy plane righted itself and volplaned underneath a dirigible;and, though scattered, the Gray squadron drew away safely from theBrown, which, slowing down, came on as straight as an arrow inunchanged formation in a line over the castle tower. From the forwardBrown aeroplane, as its shadow shot over the garden, pursued by thegreat, oblong shadows of the dirigibles, a white ball was dropped. Itmade a plummet streak until about fifty feet above the earth, when itexploded into a fine shower of powder, leaving intact a pirouetting bitof white."I think that was Colonel Lanstron leading when he ought to leave suchwork to his assistants," said Mrs. Galland. "You remember him--why, itwas the colonel who recommended you! There, now, I've forgotten againthat you are deaf!"The slip of paper glided back and forth on slight currents of air andfinally fell among the rose-bushes a few yards from where the two werestanding. Feller brought it to Mrs. Galland."Yes, it was Colonel Lanstron," she said, after reading the message."The message says: 'Hello, Marta!' Any other officer would have said:'How do you do, Miss Galland!' He could not have known that she wasaway. I've just had a telegram from her that she will be home in themorning, and that takes me back to my idea that I came to speak about toyou," she babbled on, while Feller regarded her with a gentle,uncomprehending smile. "You know how she likes chrysanthemums and theyare in full bloom. We'll cut them and fill all the vases in theliving-room and her room and--oh, how I do forget! You're not hearing aword!" she exclaimed as she noted the helpless eagerness of his eyes."It is a great nuisance, deafness in a gardener. But I love my work. Itry to do it well," he said in his monotone."You do wonderfully, wonderfully!" she assented; "and you deserve greatcredit. Many deaf people are irritable--and you are so cheerful!"He smiled as pleasantly as if he had heard the compliment and passed hera small pad from his blouse pocket. With the pencil attached to it by astring she wrote her instructions slowly, in an old-fashioned hand,dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's."Pardon me, madam, but Miss Galland"--he paused, dwelling with a slightinflection on his mention of the daughter as the talisman that warrantedhis presuming to disagree with the mother--"Miss Galland, when she tookher last look around before going, said: 'Please don't cut any yet. Iwant to see them all abloom in their beds first.'""She has taken such an interest in them, and my idea was to please her.Of course, leave them," said Mrs. Galland. She made repeated vigorousnods of assent to save herself the trouble of writing. Starting back upthe steps, she murmured: "I suppose cut flowers are out of fashion--Iknow I am--and deaf gardeners are in." She sighed. "And you aretwenty-seven, Marta, twenty-seven!" She drew another, a very long sigh,and then her serenity returned."Ours did not pass theirs," observed the gardener, with a musing smilewhen he was alone; "but theirs nearly had a jolly spill there at theturn!"As he bent once more to his work a bumblebee approached on its glad,piratical errand from flower to flower in the rapt stillness, and Fellerlooked around with a slight courtesy of his hat brim."You and your fussily thunderous wings!" he said, half aloud. "I wonderif you think you're an aeroplane. Surely, they'd never train you toevolute in squadrons. You are an anarchist, you are, and an epicureaninto the bargain!"He went with his barrow for more bulbs. Meanwhile, the sun sank behindthe range. The plain lay bathed in soft, golden light; the ravines weretongues of black shadow. As the evening gun boomed out from a fortresson the Brown side of the frontier, Feller glanced around to see if anyone were watching. Assured that he was alone, he removed his hat, and,though he wiped the brim and wiped his brow, in his attitude was thesuggestion of the military stance of attention at colors. A minutelater, when the evening gun of the Grays across the white postsreverberated over the plain, he jammed his hat back on his head ratherabruptly and started to the tool house with his barrow."War! war!" he repeated softly. "Yes, war!" he added in eager desire.IVTHE DIVIDENDS OF POWERWesterling realized that the question of marriage as a socialrequirement might arise when he should become officially chief of staffwith the retirement of His Excellency the field-marshal. For the presenthe enjoyed his position as a bachelor who was the most favored man inthe army too much to think of marriage. This did not imply an absence offondness for women; rather the contrary. He liked sitting next to abeautiful neck and shoulders and having a pair of feminine eyes sparkleinto his at dinner; though, with rare exceptions, not the same neck andshoulders on succeeding nights. His natural sense of organizationdivided women into two classes: those of family and wealth, whom he metat great houses, and those purring kittens who live in small flats. Bothafforded him diversion. A woman had been the most telling influence inmaking him vice-chief of staff; an affair to which gossip gave thebreath of scandal had been an argument against him.It was a little surprising that the bell that the girl of seventeen hadrung in his secret mind when he was on one of the first rounds of theladder, now lost in the mists of a lower stratum of existence, shouldever tinkle again.... Yet he had heard its note in the tone of herprophecy with each step in his promotion; and while the other peoplewhom he had known at La Tir were the vaguest shadows of personalities,her picture was as definite in detail as when she said: "You have thewill! You have the ambition!" She had recognized in him the power thathe felt; foreseen his ascent to the very apex of the pyramid. She wasstill unmarried, which was strange; for she had not been bad-looking andshe was of a fine old family. What was she like now? Commonplace andprovincial, most likely. Many of the people he had known in his earlydays appeared so when he met them again. But, at the worst, he lookedfor an interesting half-hour.The throbbing activity of the streets of the capital, as his carproceeded on the way to her hotel, formed an energetic accompaniment tohis gratifying backward survey of how all his plans had worked out fromthe very day of the prophecy. Had he heard the remark of a greatmanufacturer to the banker at his side in a passing limousine, "Theregoes the greatest captain of industry of us all!" Westerling would onlyhave thought: "Certainly. I am chief of staff. I am at the head of allyour workmen at one time or another!" Had he heard the banker's answer,"But pretty poor pay, pretty small dividends!" he would have thought:"Splendid dividends--the dividends of power!"He had a caste contempt for the men of commerce, with their mercenarytalk about credit and market prices; and also for the scientists,doctors, engineers, and men of other professions, who spoke of things inbooks which he did not understand. Reading books was one of the faultsof Turcas, his assistant. No bookish soldier, he knew, had ever been agreat general. He resented the growing power of these leaders of thecivil world, taking distinction away from the military, even when, as aman of parts, he had to court their influence. His was the professionthat was and ever should be the elect. A penniless subaltern was agentleman, while he could never think of a man hi business as one.All the faces in the street belonged to a strange, busy world outsidehis interest and thoughts. They formed what was known as the public,often making a clatter About things which they did not understand, whenthey Should obey the orders of their superiors. Of late, their clatterhad been about the extra taxes for the recent increase of the standingforces by another corps. The public was bovine with a parrot's head. Yetit did not admire the toiling ox, but the eagle and the lion.As his car came to the park his eyes lighted at sight of one of thedividends--one feature of urban life that ever gave him a thrill. Abattalion of the 128th, which he had ordered that afternoon to the verygarrison at South La Tir that he had once commanded, was marchingthrough the main avenue. Youths all, of twenty-one or two, they were ina muddy-grayish uniform which was the color of the plain as seen fromthe veranda of the Galland house.Around them, in a mighty, pervasive monotone, was the roar of citytraffic, broken by the nearer sounds of the cries of children playing inthe sand piles, the bark of motor horns, the screech of small boys'velocipedes on the paths of the park; while they themselves were silent,except for the rhythmic tramp of the military shoes of identicalpattern, as was every article of their clothing and equipment from headto foot, whose character had been the subject of the weightiestdeliberation of the staff.How much can a soldier carry and how best carry it easily? What shoesare the most serviceable for marching and yet cheap? Nothing was soprecise in all their surroundings, nothing seemed so resolutelydependable as this column of soldiers. They were the last word infilling human tissue into a mould for a set task. Where these came fromwere other boys growing up to take their places. The mothers of thenation were doing their duty. All the land was a breeding-ground for thedividends of Hedworth Westerling.At the far side of the park he saw another kind of dividend--anothergroup of marching men. These were not in uniform. They were theunemployed. Many were middle-aged, with worn, tired faces. Beside theflag of the country at the head of the procession was that of universalradicalism. And his car had to stop to let them pass. For an instant theindignation of military autocracy rose strong within him at sight of thenational colors in such company. But he noted how naturally the men keptstep; the solidarity of their movement. The stamp of their army servicein youth could not be easily removed. He realized the advantage ofheading an army in which defence was not dependent on a mixture ofregulars and volunteers, but on universal conscription that broughtevery able-bodied man under discipline.These reservists, in the event of war, would hear the call of race andthey would fight for the one flag that then had any significance. Yes,the old human impulses would predominate and the only enemy would be onthe other side of the frontier. They would be pawns of his will--thewill that Marta Galland had said would make him chief of staff.Wasn't war the real cure for the general unrest? Wasn't the nationgrowing stale from the long peace? He was ready for war now that he hadbecome vice-chief, when the retirement of His Excellency, unable to bearthe weight of his years and decorations in the field, would make him thesupreme commander. One ambition gained, he heard the appeal of another:to live to see the guns and rifles that had fired only blank cartridgesin practice pouring out shells and bullets, and all the battalions thathad played at sham war in manoeuvres engaged in real war, under hisdirection. He saw his columns sweeping up the slopes of the Brown range.Victory was certain. He would be the first to lead a great modern armyagainst a great modern army; his place as the master of modern tacticssecure in the minds of all the soldiers of the world. The public wouldforget its unrest in the thrill of battles won and provinces conquered,and its clatter would be that of acclaim for a new idol of its oldfaith.VOFF TO THE FRONTIERRanks broken in the barracks yard, backs free of packs, shoulders freeof rifles, the men of the first battalion of the 28th, which Westerlinghad seen marching through the park, had no thought except the prospectof the joyous lassitude of resting muscles and of loosening tongues thathad been silent on the march. They were simply tired human beings in thedemocracy of a common life and service.The 128th had been recruited from a province in the high country distantfrom the capital. In the days of Maria's old baron, a baron of the sametype had plundered their ancestors, and in the days of the first Gallandthey formed a principality frequently at war with their neighbors of thesame blood and language. At length they had united with their neighborswho had in turn united with other neighbors, forming the present nationof the Grays, which vented its fighting spirit against other nations.Each generation must send forth its valorous and adventurous youth tothe proof of its manhood in battle, while those who survived wounds anddisease became the heroes of their reminiscences, inciting the youngergeneration to emulation. With each step in the evolution learning hadspread and civilization developed.Since the last war universal conscription had gone hand in hand withpopular education and the telegraphic click of the news of the world toall breakfast tables and cheap travel and better living. Every privateof the five millions was a scholar compared to the old baron; he had abroader horizon than the first Galland. In the name of defence, to holdtheir borders secure, the great powers were straining their resources tostrengthen the forces that kept an armed peace. Evolution never ceases.What next?In a group of the members of Company B, who dropped on a bench in thebarrack room, were the sons of a farmer, a barber, a butcher, an armyofficer, a day-laborer, a judge, a blacksmith, a rich man's valet, abanker, a doctor, a manufacturer, and a small shopkeeper."Six months more and my tour is up!" cried the judge's son."Six months more for me!""Now you're counting!""And for me--one, two, three, four, five, six!""Oh, don't rub it in," the manufacturer's son shouted above the chorus,"you old fellows! I've a year and six months more.""Here, too!" chimed in the banker's son. "A year and six months more ofiron spoons and tin cups and army shoes and army fare and early rising.Hep-hep-hep, drill-drill-drill, and drudgery!""Oh, I don't know!" said the day-laborer's son. "I don't have to get upany earlier than I do at home, and I don't have to work as hard as I'llhave to when I leave.""Nor I!" agreed the blacksmith's son. "It's a kind of holiday for me.""Holiday!" the banker's son gasped. "That's so," he added thoughtfully,and smiled gratefully over a fate that had been indulgent to him in amatter of fathers and limousines."Look at the newspapers! Maybe we shall be going to war," said themanufacturer's son."Stuff! Nonsense!" said the judge's son. "We are always having scares.They sell papers and give the fellows at the Foreign Office a chance tolook unconcerned. But let's have the opinion of an international expert,of the great and only philosopher, guide, companion, and friend. Whatdo you think of the crisis, eh, Hugo? Soberly, now. The fate of nationsmay hang on your words. If not, at least the price of a ginger soda!"It was around Hugo Mallin that the group had formed. Groups were alwaysforming around Hugo. He could spring the unexpected and incongruous andmake people laugh. Slight but wiry of physique, he had light hair, afreckled and rather nondescript nose, large brown eyes, and a broad,sensitive mouth. Nature had not attempted any regularity of features inhis case. She had been content with making each one a mobile servant ofhis mind. In repose his face was homely, and it was a mask."Come on, Hugo! Out with it!"Hugo's brow contracted; the lines of the mask were drawn in deliberateseriousness."I never hear war mentioned that I don't have a shiver right down myspine, as I did when I was a little boy and went into the cellar withouta light," he replied."Fear?" exclaimed Eugene Aronson, the farmer's son, whose big, plainface expressed dumb incomprehension. He alone was standing. Being thegiant and the athlete of the company, the march had not tired him."Fear?" some of the others repeated. The sentiment was astounding, andHugo was as manifestly in earnest as if he were a minister addressing aparliamentary chamber."Yes, don't you?" asked Hugo, in bland surprise."I should say not!" declared Eugene."Do you want to be killed?" asked Hugo, with profound interest."The bullet isn't made that will get me!" answered Eugene, throwing backhis broad shoulders."I don't know," mused Hugo, eying the giant up and down. "You're prettybig, Gene, and a bullet that only nicked one of us in the bark might getyou in the wood. However, if you are sure that you are in no danger,why, you don't count. But let's take a census while we are about it andsee who wants to be killed. First, you, Armand; do you?" he asked thedoctor's son, Armand Daution.Armand grinned. The others grinned, not at him, but at the quizzicalsolemnity of Hugo's manner."If so, state whether you prefer bullets or shrapnel, early in thecampaign or late, a la carte or table d'hote, morning or--" Hugo wenton.But laughter drowned the sentence, though Hugo's face was without asmile."You ought to go on the stage!" some one exclaimed."If it were as easy to amuse a pay audience as you fellows, I might,"Hugo replied. "But I've another question," he pursued. "Do you thinkthat the fellows on the other side of the frontier want to be killed?""No danger! They'll give in. They always do," said Eugene."I confess that it hardly seems reasonable to make war over the Bodlapooaffair!" This from the judge's son."Over some hot weather, some swamp, and some black policemen in Africa,"said Hugo."But they hauled down our flag!" exclaimed the army officer's son."On their territory, they say. We were the aggressors," Hugo interposed."It was _our_ flag!" said Eugene."But we wouldn't want them to put up their flag on our territory, wouldwe?" Hugo asked."Let them try it!" thundered Eugene, with a full breath from the bigbellows in his broad chest. "Hugo, I don't like to hear you talk thatway," he added, shaking his head sadly. Such views from a friend reallyhurt him; indeed, he was almost lugubrious. This brought another laugh."Don't you see he's getting you, Gene?""He's acting!""He always gets you, you old simpleton!" The judge's son gave Eugene anaffectionate dig in the ribs.Eugene was well liked and in the way that a big Saint Bernard dog isliked. At the latest manoeuvres, on the night that their division hadmade a rapid flank movement, without any apparent sense that his ownload was the heavier for it, he had carried the rifle and pack of PeterKinderling, a valet's pasty-faced little son "Peterkin," as he wascalled, was the stupid of Company B. Being generally inoffensive, thebutt of the drill sergeant, who thought that he would never learn eventhe manual of arms, and rounding out the variety of characters whichmakes for fellowship, he was regarded with a sympathetic kindliness byhis comrades."But I don't think you ought to joke about the flag That's sacred!"declared Eugene."Now you're talking!" said Jacob Pilzer, the butcher's son, who sat onthe other side of the bench from Eugene. He was heavily built, with anundershot jaw and a patch of liverish birthmark on his cheek."Yes," piped Peterkin, who had an opinion when the two strong men of thecompany agreed on any subject. But he spoke tentatively, nevertheless.He was taking no risks."Oh, if we went to war the Bodlapoo affair would be only an excuse,"said the manufacturer's son. "We shall go to war as a matter of broadnational policy.""Right you are!" agreed the banker's son. "No emotion about it. Emotionas an international quantity is dead. Everything is business now in thisbusiness age.""Killing people as a broad international policy!" mused Hugo _sottovoce_, as if this were a matter of his own thoughts.The others scarcely heard him as the manufacturer's son struck his fistin the palm of his hand resoundingly to demand attention."We need room in which to expand. We have eighty million people totheir fifty, while our territory is only a little larger than theirs.Our population grows; the Browns' does not!" he announced."But there is a remedy for that," Hugo interjected loftly, so softlythat everybody looked at him. "Why, all the conscripts of the army fortwo years could take a vow not to marry," he said. "We could reduce theoutput, as your father's factory does when the market is dull. We shouldnot have so many babies. This would be cheaper than rearing them to beslaughtered in their young manhood.""Hear ye! Hear ye!" shouted the doctor's son, in the midst of thehilarity that ensued. "Hugo Mallin solves the whole problem of eugenicsby destroying the field for eugenics!""The levity of a lot of mere unthinking privates who mistake themselvesfor sociological experts shall not deter me from finishing my speech,"pursued the manufacturer's son."Speak on!""Listen to the fount of wisdom play!""A beer if you produce an idea!""War must come some day. It must come if for no other reason than tostop the strikes, arouse patriotism, and give an impetus to industry. Anarmy of five millions on our side against the Browns' three millions! Ofcourse, they won't start it! We shall have to take the aggressive;naturally, they'll not.""And they'll run, they'll run, just as they always have" Eugene criedenthusiastically."You bet they will, or they'll be mush for our bayonets!" said Pilzer,the butcher's son."Will they? Do you really think they will?" asked Hugo, drawing down thecorners of his mouth in profound contemplation that was actuallymournful. "I wonder, now, I wonder if they can run any faster than Ican?"Everybody was laughing except him. If he had laughed too, he would nothave been funny. His faint, look of surprise over their outburst onlyserved to prolong it."Hugo, you're immense!""You're a scream!""But I am considering," Hugo resumed, when there was silence. "If bothsides ran as fast as they could when the war began, it would beinteresting to see which army reached home first. Some of us might getout of breath, but nobody would be killed." He had to wait on anotherlaugh before he could continue. It takes little to amuse men in garrisonif one knows how. "I don't want to be killed, and why should I want tokill strangers on the other side of the frontier?" He paused on therising inflection of his question, a calm, earnest challenge in hiseyes. "I don't know them. I haven't the slightest grudge against them."No grudge against the Browns--against the ancient enemy! The facesaround were frowning, as if in doubt how to take him."What did you come into the army for, then?" called Pilzer, thebutcher's son. "You didn't have to, being an only son. Talk that stuffto your officers! They will let you out. They don't want any cowardslike you!""Cowards! Hold on, there!" said Eugene, who was very fond of Hugo. Hespoke in the even voice of his vast good nature, but he looked meaninglyat the butcher's son."Coward? Is that the word, Jake?" Hugo inquired amiably. "Now, maybe Iam. I don't know. But it wouldn't prove that I wasn't if I fought youany more than if I fought the strangers on the other side of thefrontier.""Well, if you don't want to fight, what are you in the army for? That'sa fair question, isn't it?" growled Pilzer, in an appeal to publicopinion."Yes, you can carry a joke too far," said the army officer's son. "Yes,why?"The others nodded. An atmosphere of hostility was gathering around Hugo.In face of it a smile began playing about the corners of his lips. Thesmile spread. For the first time he was laughing, while all the otherswere serious. Suddenly he threw his arms around the necks of the mennext to him."Why, to be with all you good fellows, of course!" he said, "and tocomplete my education. If I hadn't taken my period in the army, youmight have shaved me, Eduardo; you might have fixed a horseshoe for me,Henry; you might have sold me turnips, Eugene, but I shouldn't haveknown you. Now we all know one another by eating the same food, wearingthe same clothes, marching side by side, and submitting to another kindof discipline than that of our officers--the discipline of closeassociation in a community of service. There's hope for humanity inthat--for humanity trying to free itself of its fetters. We have mixedwith the people of the capital. They have found us and we have foundthem to be of the same human family.""That's so! This business of moving regiments about from one garrison toanother is a good cure for provincialism," said the doctor's son."Judge's son or banker's son or blacksmith's son, whenever we meet inafter-life there will be a thought of fellowship exchanged in ourglances," Hugo continued. "Haven't we got something that we couldn't getotherwise? Doesn't it thrill you now when we're all tired from the marchexcept leviathan Gene--thrill you with a warm glow from the flow ofgood, rich, healthy red blood?""Yes, yes, yes!"There was a chorus of assent. Banker's son clapped valet's son on theshoulder; laborer's son and doctor's son locked arms and teetered on theedge of the cot together."And I've another idea," proceeded Hugo very seriously as the vows ofeternal friendship subsided. "It is one to spread education and thespirit of comradeship still further. Instead of two sets of autumnmanoeuvres, one on either side of the frontier, I'd have our army andthe Browns hold a manoeuvre together--this year on their side and nextyear on ours."The biggest roar yet rose from throats that had been venting a tendertone. Only the slow Eugene Aronson was blank and puzzled. But directlyhe, too, broke into laughter, louder and more prolonged than the others."You can be so solemn that it takes a minute to see your joke," he said."And humorous when we expect him to be solemn--and, presto, there hegoes!" added the judge's son.Hugo's lips were twitching peculiarly."Look at him!" exclaimed the manufacturer's son. "Oh, you've had us allgoing this afternoon, you old farceur, you, Hugo!"In the silence that waited on another extravagance from the entertainerthe sergeant entered the room."We shall entrain to-morrow morning!" he announced. "We are going toSouth La Tir on the frontier."Oh, joy! Oh, lucky 128th! It was to see still more of the world! Thesergeant stood by listening to the uproar and cautioning the men not tooverturn the tables and benches. Even the banker's and themanufacturer's sons, who had toured the country from frontier tofrontier in paternal automobiles, were as happy as the laborer's son."What fun it would be if we could visit back and forth with the fellowson the other side of the frontier!" said Hugo."What the--eh!" exclaimed the sergeant. "Will you never stop yourjoking, you, Hugo Mallin?""Never, sir," replied Hugo dryly. "It comes natural to me!"VITHE SECOND PROPHECYIn the reception-room, where he awaited the despatch of his card,Hedworth Westerling caught a glimpse of his person in a panel glass soconvenient as to suggest that an adroit hotel manager might have placedit there for the delectation of well-preserved men of forty-two. He sawa face of health that was little lined; brown hair that did not revealits sprinkle of gray at that distance; shoulders, bearing the gracefullydraped gold cords of the staff, squarely set on a rigid spine in hisnatural attitude. Yes, he had taken good care of himself, enjoying hispleasures with discreet, epicurean relish as he would this meeting witha woman whom he had not seen for ten years.On her part, Marta, when she had received the note, had been in doubt asto her answer. Her curiosity to see him again was not of itselfcompelling. The actual making of the prophecy was rather dim to her minduntil he recalled it. She had heard of his rise and she had heard, too,things about him which a girl of twenty-seven can better understand thana girl of seventeen. His reason for wanting to see her he had said wasto "renew an old acquaintance." He could have little interest in her,and her interest in him was that he was head of the Gray army. His workhad intimate relation to that which the Marta of twenty-seven, a Martawith a mission, had set for herself.A page came to tell Westerling that Miss Galland should be downdirectly. But before she came a waiter entered with a tea-tray."By the lady's direction, sir," he explained as he set the tray on atable opposite Westerling.Across a tea-table the prophecy had been made and across a tea-tablethey had held most of their talks. Having a picture in memory forcomparison, he was seeing the doorway as the frame for a second picture.When she appeared the picture seemed the same as of old. There was anundeniable delight in this first impression of externals. There had beenno promise that she would be beautiful, and she was not. There had beenpromise of distinction, and she seemed to have fulfilled it. For asecond she paused on the threshold rather diffidently. Then she smiledas she had when she greeted him from the veranda as he came up theterrace steps. She crossed the room with a flowing, spontaneous vitalitythat appealed to him as something familiar."Ten years, isn't it?" she exclaimed, putting a genuine quality ofpersonal interest into the words as she gave his hand a quick, firmshake. Then, with the informality of old acquaintances who had partedonly yesterday, she indicated a place on the sofa for him, while sheseated herself on the other side of the tea-table. "The terrace there inthe foreground," she said with conforming gestures of location, "thechurch steeple over the town, the upward sweep of the mountains, andthere the plain melting into the horizon. And, let me see, you took twolumps, if I remember?"He would have known the hand that poised over the sugar bowl though hehad not seen the face; a brownish hand, not long-fingered, not narrowfor its length--a compact, deft, firm little hand."None now," he said."Do you find it fattening?" she asked.He recognized the mischievous sparkle of the eyes, the quizzical turn ofthe lips, which was her asset in keeping any question from beingpersonal. Nevertheless, he flushed slightly."A change of taste," he averred."Since you've become such a great man?" she hazarded. "Is that toostrong?" This referred to the tea."No, just right!" he nodded.He was studying her with the polite, veiled scrutiny of a man of theworld. A materialist, he would look a woman over as he would a soldierwhen he had been a major-general making an inspection. She was slim,supple; he liked slim, supple women. Her eyes, though none the lessluminous, and her lips, though none the less flexible, did not seemquite as out of proportion with the rest of her face as formerly, nowthat it had taken on the contour of maturity, which was noticeable alsoin the lines of her figure. Yes, she was twenty-seven, with the vivacityof seventeen retained, though she were on the edge of being an old maidaccording to the conventional notions. Necks and shoulders that happenedto be at his side at dinner, he had found, when they were reallybeautiful, were not averse to his glance of appreciative anddiscriminating admiration of physical charm. But he saw her shrugslightly and caught a spark from her eyes that made him vaguelyconscious of an offence to her sensibilities, and he was whollyconscious that the suggestion, bringing his faculties up sharply, hadthe pleasure of a novel sensation."How fast you have gone ahead!" she said. "That little prophecy of minedid come true. You are chief of Staff!"After a smile of satisfaction he corrected her."Not quite; vice-chief--the right-hand man of His Excellency. I am abuffer between him and the heads of divisions. This has led to theerroneous assumption which I cannot too forcibly deny--"He was proceeding with the phraseology habitual whenever men or women,to flatter him, had intimated that they realized that he was the actualhead of the army. His Excellency, with the prestige of a career, must bekept soporifically enjoying the forms of authority. To arouse hisjealousy might curtail Westerling's actual power."Yes, yes!" breathed Marta softly, arching her eyebrows a trifle as shewould when looking all around and through a thing or when she found anyone beating about the bush. The little frown disappeared and she smiledunderstandingly. "You know I'm not a perfect goose!" she added. "Had youbeen made chief of staff in name, too, all the old generals would havebeen in the sulks and the young generals jealous," she continued. "Theone way that you might have the power to exercise was by proxy."This downright frankness was another reflection of the old days beforehe was at the apex of the pyramid. Now it was so unusual in hisexperience as to be almost a shock. On the point of arguing, he caught amischievous, delightful "Isn't that so?" in her eyes, and replied:"Yes, I shouldn't wonder if it were!"Why shouldn't he admit the truth to the one who had rung the bell of hissecret ambition long ago by recognizing in him the ability to reach hisgoal? He marvelled at her grasp of the situation."It wasn't so very hard to say, was it?" she asked happily, in responseto his smile. Then, her gift of putting herself in another's place,while she strove to look at things with his purpose and vision, in fullplay, she went on in a different tone, as much to herself as to him:"You have labored to make yourself master of a mighty organization. Youdid not care for the non-essentials. You wanted the reality of shapingresults.""Yes, the results, the power!" he exclaimed."Fifteen hundred regiments!" she continued thoughtfully, looking at agiven point rather than at him. "Every regiment a blade which you wouldbring to an even sharpness! Every regiment a unit of a harmonious whole,knowing how to screen itself from fire and give fire as long as bidden,in answer to your will if war comes! That is what you live and plan for,isn't it?""Yes, exactly! Yes, you have it!" he said. His shoulders stiffened as hethrilled at seeing a picture of himself, as he wanted to see himself,done in bold strokes. It assured him that not only had his own mindgrown beyond what were to him the narrow associations of his old La Tirdays, but that hers had grown, too. "And you--what have you been doingall these years?" he asked."Living the life of a woman on a country estate," she replied. "Sinceyou made a rule that no Gray officers Should cross the frontier we havebeen a little lonelier, having only the Brown officers to tea. Did youreally find it so bad for discipline in your own case?" she concludedwith playful solemnity."One cannot consider individual cases in a general order," he explained."And, remember, the Browns made the ruling first. You see, every yearmeans a tightening--yes, a tightening, as arms and armies grow morecomplicated and the maintaining of staff secrets more important. And youhave been all the time at La Tir, truly?" he asked, changing thesubject. He was convinced that she had acquired something that could notbe gained on the outskirts of a provincial town."No. I have travelled. I have been quite around the world.""You have!" This explained much. "How I envy you! That is a privilege Ishall not know until I am superannuated." While he should remain chiefof staff he must be literally a prisoner in his own country."Yes, I should say it was splendid! Splendid--yes, indeed!" Snappylittle nods of the head being unequal to expressing the joy of thememories that her exclamation evoked, she clasped her hands over herknees and swung back and forth in the ecstasy of seventeen."Splendid! I should say so!" She nestled the curling tip of her tongueagainst her teeth, as if the recollection must also be tasted."Splendid, enchanting, enlightening, stupendous, and wickedly expensive!Another girl and I did it all on our own.""O-oh!" he exclaimed."Oh, oh, oh!" she repeated after him. "Oh, what, please?""Oh, nothing!" he said. It was quite comprehensible to him how wellequipped she was to take care of herself on such an adventure."Precisely, when you come to think it over!" she concluded."What interested you most? What was the big lesson of all yourjourneying?" he asked, ready to play the listener."Being born and bred on a frontier, of an ancestry that was born andbred on a frontier, why, frontiers interested me most," she said. "Icollected impressions of frontiers as some people collect pictures. Ifound them all alike--stupid, just stupid! Oh, so stupid!" Her frowngrew with the repetition of the word; her fingers closed in on her palmin vexation. He recollected that he had seen her like this two or threetimes at La Tir, when he had found the outbursts most entertaining. Heimagined that the small fist pressed against the table edge coulddeliver a stinging blow. "As stupid as it is for neighbors to quarrel!It put me at war with all frontiers.""Apparently," he said.She withdrew her fist from the table, dropped the opened hand over theother on her knee, her body relaxing, her wrath passing into a kind ofshamefacedness and then into a soft, prolonged laugh."I laugh at myself, at my own inconsistency," she said. "I was warlikeagainst war. At all events, if there is anything to make a teacher ofpeace lose her temper it is the folly of frontiers.""Yes?" he exclaimed. "Yes? Go on!" And he thought: "I'm really having avery good time.""You see, I came home from my tour with an idea--an idea for a lifeoccupation just as engrossing as yours," she went on, "and opposed toyours. I saw there was no use of working with the grown-up folks. Theymust be left to The Hague conferences and the peace societies. Butchildren are quite alike the world over. You can plant thoughts in theyoung that will take root and grow as they grow.""Patriotism, for instance," he observed narrowly."No, the follies of martial patriotism! The wickedness of war, which isthe product of martial patriotism!"The follies of patriotism! This was the red flag of anarchy to him. Hestarted to speak, flushing angrily, but held his tongue and only emitteda "whew!" in good-humored wonder."I see you are not very frightened by my opposition," she rejoined in aflash of amusement not wholly untempered by exasperation."We got the appropriation for an additional army corps this year," heexplained contentedly, his repose completely regained."Thus increasing the odds against us. But perhaps not; for we aredealing with the children not with recruits, as I said. We callourselves the teachers of peace. I organized the first class in La Tir.I have the children come together every Sunday morning and I tell themabout the children that live in other countries. I tell them that achild a thousand miles away is just as much a neighbor as the one acrossthe street. At first I feared that they would find it uninteresting. Butif you know how to talk to them they don't.""Naturally they don't, when you talk to them," he interrupted.She was so intent that she passed over the compliment with a gesturelike that of brushing away a cobweb. Her eyes were like deep, clearwells of faith and repose."I try to make the children of other countries so interesting that ourchildren will like them too well ever to want to kill them when theygrow up. We have a little peace prayer--they have even come to like torecite it--a prayer and an oath. But I'll not bother you with it. Otherwomen have taken up the idea. I have found a girl who is going to starta class on your side in South La Tir, and I came here to meet some womenwho want to inaugurate the movement in your capital.""I'll have to see about that!" he rejoined, half-banteringly,half-threateningly."There is something else to come, even more irritating," she said, lessintently and smiling. "So please be prepared to hold your temper.""I shall not beat my fist on the table defending war as you diddefending peace!" he retaliated with significant enjoyment.But she used his retort for an opening."Oh, I'd rather you would do that than jest! It's human. It's going towar because one is angry. You would go to war as a matter of coldreason.""If otherwise, I should lose," he replied."Exactly. You make it easy for me to approach my point. I want toprevent you from losing!" she announced cheerfully yet very seriously."Yes? Proceed. I brace myself against an explosion of indignation!""It is the duty of a teacher of peace to use all her influence with thepeople she knows," she went on. "So I am going to ask you not to letyour country ever go to war against mine while you are chief of staff.""Mine against yours?" he equivocated. "Why, you live almost withingunshot of the line! Your people have as much Gray as Brown blood intheir veins, _Your_ country! _My_ country! Isn't that patriotism?""Patriotism, but not martial patriotism," she corrected him. "My thoughtis to stop war for both countries as war, regardless of sides. Promiseme that you will not permit it!""I not permit it!" He smiled with the kindly patronage of a great manwho sees a charming woman floundering in an attempt at logic. "It is forthe premier to say. I merely make the machine ready. The government saysthe word that makes it move. I able to stop war! Come, come!""But you can--yes, you can with a word!" she declared positively."How?" he asked, amazed. "How?" he repeated blandly.Was she teasing him? he wondered. What new resources of confusion hadten years and a tour around the world developed in her? Was it possiblethat the Whole idea of the teachers of peace was an invention to makeconversation at his expense? If so, she carried it off with a sinceritythat suggested other depths yet unsounded."Very easily," she answered. "You can tell the premier that you cannotwin. Tell him that you will break your army to pieces against theBrowns' fortifications!"He gasped. Then an inner voice prompted him that the cue was comedy."Excellent fooling--excellent!" he said with a laugh. "Tell the premierthat I should lose when I have five million men to their three million!What a harlequin chief of staff I should be! Excellent fooling! Youalmost had me!"Again he laughed, though in the fashion of one who had hardly unbent hisspine, while he was wishing for the old days when he might take tea withher one or two afternoons a week. It would be a fine tonic after hisisolation at the apex of the pyramid surveying the deference of thelower levels. Then he saw that her eyes, shimmering with wonder, grewdull and her lips parted in a rigid, pale line as if she were hurt."You think I am joking?" she asked."Why, yes!""But I am not! No, no, not about such a ghastly subject as a warto-day!" She was leaning toward him, hands on knee and eyes burning likecoals without a spark. "I"--she paused as she had before she broke outwith the first prophecy--"I will quote part of our children's oath: 'Iwill not be a coward. It is a coward who strikes first. A brave man evenafter he receives a blow tries to reason with his assailant, and doesnot strike back until he receives a second blow. I shall not let aburglar drive me from my house. If an enemy tries to take my land Ishall appeal to his sense of justice and reason with him, but if he thenpersists I shall fight for my home. If I am victorious I shall not tryto take his land but to make the most of my own. I shall never cross afrontier to kill my fellowmen.'"Very impressive she made the oath. Her deliberate recital of it had thequality which justifies every word with an urgent faith."You see, with that teaching there can be no war," she proceeded, "andthose who strike will be weak; those who defend will be strong.""Perhaps," he said."You would not like to see thousands, hundreds of thousands, of menkilled and maimed, would you?" she demanded, and her eyes held thehorror of the sight in reality. "You can prevent it--you _can_!" Herheart was in the appeal."The old argument! No, I should not like to see that," he replied. "Ionly do my duty as a soldier to my country.""The old answer! The more reason why you should tell the premier youcan't! But there is still another reason for telling him," she urgedgently.Now he saw her not at twenty-seven but at seventeen, girlish, thesubject of no processes of reason but in the spell of an intuition, andhe knew that something out of the blue in a flash was coming."For you will not win!" she declared.This struck fire. Square jaw and sturdy body, in masculine energy,resolute and trained, were set indomitably against feminine vitality."Yes, we shall win! We shall win!" he said without even the physicaldemonstration of a gesture and in a hard, even voice which was like thatof the machinery of modern war itself, a voice which the aristocraticsniff, the Louis XVI. curls, or any of the old gallery-display heroeswould have thought utterly lacking in histrionics suitable to theoccasion. He remained rigid after he had spoken, handsome,self-possessed.There was no use of beating feminine fists against such a stone wall.The force of the male was supreme. She smiled with a strange, quiveringloosening of the lips. She spread out her hands with fingers apart, asif to let something run free from them into the air, and the flame ofappeal that had been in her eyes broke into many lights that seemed toscatter into space, yet ready to return at her command. She glanced atthe clock and rose, almost abruptly."I was very strenuous riding my hobby against yours, wasn't I?" sheexclaimed in a flutter of distraction that made it easy for him todescend from his own steed. "I stated a feeling. I made a guess, athreat about your winning--and all in the air. That's a woman'sprivilege; one men grant, isn't it?""We enjoy doing so," he replied, all urbanity."Thank you!" she said simply. "I must be at home in time for thechildren's lesson on Sunday. My sleeper is engaged, and if I am not tomiss the train I must go immediately."With an undeniable shock of regret he realized that the interview wasover. Really, he had had a very good time; not only that, but--."Will it be ten years before we meet again?" he asked."Perhaps, unless you change the rules about officers dossing thefrontier to take tea," she replied."Even if I did, the vice-chief of staff might hardly go.""Then perhaps you must wait," she warned him, "until the teachers ofpeace have done away with all frontiers.""Or, if there were war, I should come!" he answered in kind. He halfwished that this might start another argument and she would miss hertrain. But she made no reply. "And you may come to the Gray capitalagain. You are not through travelling!" he added.This aroused her afresh; the flame was back in her eyes."Yes. I have all the memories of my journeys to enjoy, all their lessonsto study," she said. "There is the big world, and you want to have hadthe breath of all its climates in your lungs, the visions of all itspeoples yours. Then the other thing is three acres and a cow. If youcould only have the solidarity of the Japanese, their public spirit,with the old Chinese love of family and peace, and a cathedral near-byon a hill! Patriotism? Why, it is in the soil of your three acres. Ilove to feel the warm, rich earth of our own garden in my hands!Hereafter I shall be a stay-at-home; and if my children win," she heldout her hand in parting with the same frank, earnest grip of hergreeting, "why, you will find that tea is, as usual, at four-thirty."He had found the women of his high official world--a narrower world thanhe realized--much alike. Striking certain keys, certain chordsresponded. He could probe the depths of their minds, he thought, in asingle evening. Then he passed on, unless it was in the interest ofpleasure or of his career to linger. This meeting had left his curiositybaffled. He understood how Marta's vitality demanded action, whichexerted itself in a feminine way for a feminine cause. The cure for sucha fad was most clear to his masculine-perception. What if all the powershe had shown in her appeal for peace could be made to serve anotherambition? He knew that he was a great man. More than once he hadwondered what would happen if he were to meet a great woman. And heshould not see Marta Galland again unless war came.VIITIMES HAVE CHANGEDA prodigious brown worm, its body turning and rising and falling withthe grade and throbbing with the march of its centipede feet, wound itsway along a rising mountain road. In the strong, youthful figures set inthe universal type of military mould it might have been a regiment ofany one of many nations' but the tint of its uniform was the brown ofthe nine hundred regiments that prepared for war against the gray of thefifteen hundred under Hedworth Westerling.The 53d of the Browns had started for La Tir on the same day that the128th of the Grays had started for South La Tir. While the 128th wasgoing to new scenes, the 53d was returning to familiar ground. It haddetrained in the capital of the province from which its ranks had beenrecruited. After a steep incline, there was a welcome bugle note andwith shouts of delight the centipede's legs broke apart! Bankers',laborers', doctors', valets', butchers', manufacturers', and judges'sons threw themselves down on the greensward of the embankment to rest.With their talk of home, of relatives whom they had met at the station,and of the changes in the town was mingled talk of the crisis.Meanwhile, an aged man was approaching. At times he would break into akind of trot that ended, after a few steps, in shortness of breath. Hewas quite withered, his bright eyes twinkling out of an area of mothpatches, and he wore a frayed uniform coat with a medal on the breast."Is this the 53d?" he quavered to the nearest soldier"It certainly is!" some one answered. "Come and join us, veteran!""Is Tom--Tom Fragini here?"The answer came from a big soldier, who sprang to his feet and leapedtoward the old man."It's grandfather, as I live!" he called out, kissing the veteran onboth cheeks. "I saw sister in town, and she said you'd be at the gate aswe marched by.""Didn't wait at no gate! Marched right up to you!" said grandfather."Marched up with my uniform and medal on! Stand off there, Tom, so I cansee you. My word! You're bigger'n your father, but not bigger'n I was!No, sir, not bigger'n I was in my day before that wound sort o' bent meover. They say it's the lead in the blood. I've still got the bullet!"The old man's trousers were threadbare but well darned, and the holes inthe uppers of his shoes were carefully patched. He had a merry air ofoptimism, which his grandson had inherited."Well, Tom, how much longer you got to serve?" asked grandfather."Six months," answered Tom."One, two, three, four--" grandfather counted the numbers off on hisfingers. "That's good. You'll be in time for the spring ploughing. My,how you have filled out! But, somehow, I can't get used to this kind ofuniform. Why, I don't see how a girl'd be attracted to you fellows, atall!""They have to, for we're the only kind of soldiers there are nowadays.Not as gay as in your day, that's sure, when you were in the Hussars,eh?""Yes, I was in the Hussars--in the Hussars! I tell you, with our sabresa-gleaming, our horses' bits a-jingling, our pennons a-flying, and allthe color of our uniform--I tell you, the girls used to open their eyesat us. And we went into the charge like that--yes, sir, just that gayand grand, Colonel Galland leading!"Military history said that it had been a rather foolish charge, a fineexample of the vainglory of unreasoning bravery that accomplishesnothing, but no one would suggest such scepticism of an immortal eventin popular imagination in hearing of the old man as he lived over thatintoxicated rush of horses and men into a battery of the Grays."Well, didn't you find what I said was true about the lowlanders?" askedgrandfather after he had finished the charge, referring to the people ofthe southern frontier of the Browns, where the 53d had just beengarrisoned."No, I kind of liked them. I made a lot of friends," admitted Tom."They're very progressive.""Eh? eh? You're joking!" To like the people of the southern frontier wasonly less conceivable than liking the people of the Grays. "That'sbecause you didn't see deep under them. They're all on the outside--aflighty lot! Why, if they'd done their part in that last war we'd havelicked the Grays until they cried for mercy! If their army corps hadstood its ground at Volmer--""So you've always said," interrupted Tom."And the way they cook tripe! I couldn't stomach it, could you? And ifthere's anything I am partial to it's a good dish of tripe! And theirlight beer--like drinking froth! And their bread--why, it ain't bread!It's chips! 'Taint fit for civilized folks!""But I sort of got used to their ways," said Tom."Eh? eh?" Grandfather looked at grandson quizzically, seeking the causeof such heterodoxy in a northern man. "Say, you ain't been falling inlove?" he hazarded. "You--you ain't going to bring one of them southerngirls home?""No!" said Tom laughing."Well, I'm glad you ain't, for they're naturally light-minded. Iremember 'em well." He wandered on with his questions and comments. "Isit a fact, Tom, or was you just joking when you wrote home that thesoldiers took so many baths?""Yes, they do.""Well, that beats me! It's a wonder you didn't all die of pneumonia!" Hepaused to absorb the phenomenon. Then his half-childish mind, promptedby a random recollection, flitted to another subject which set him togiggling. "And the little crawlers--did they bother you much, the littlecrawlers?""The little crawlers?" repeated Tom, mystified."Yes. Everybody used to get 'em just from living close together. Had tocomb 'em out and pick 'em out of your clothes. The chase we used to callit.""No, grandfather, crawlers have gone out of fashion. And no moreepidemics of typhoid and dysentery either," said Tom."Times have certainly changed!" grumbled Grandfather Fragini.Interested in their own reunion, they had paid no attention to a groupof Tom's comrades near-by, sprawled around a newspaper containing thelatest despatches from both capitals. It was a group as typical as thatof the Grays around Hugo Mallin's cot; only the common voice was that ofdefence."Five million soldiers to our three million!""Eighty million people to our fifty million!""Because of the odds, they think we are bound to yield, no matter if weare in the right!""Let them come!" said the butcher's son. "If we have to go, it will beon a wave of blood.""And they will come some time," said the judge's son. "They want ourland.""We gain nothing if we beat them back. War will be the ruin ofbusiness,"-said the banker's son."Yes, we are prosperous now. Let well enough alone!" said themanufacturer's son."Some say it makes wages higher," said the laborer's son, "but I amthinking it's a poor way of raising your pay.""There won't be any war," said the banker's son "There can't be withoutcredit. The banking interests will lot permit it.""There can always be war," said the judge's son, "always when one peopledetermines to strike at another people--even if it brings bankruptcy.""It would be a war that would make all others in history a mere exchangeof skirmishes. Every able-bodied man in line--automatics a hundred shotsa minute--guns a dozen shots a minute--and aeroplanes and dirigibles!"said the manufacturer's son."To the death, too!""And not for glory! We of the 53d who live on the frontier will befighting for our homes.""If we lose them we'll never get them back. Better die than be beaten!"There was no humorist Hugo Mallin in this group; no nimble fancy to sendheresy skating over thin ice; but there was Herbert Stransky, withdeep-set eyes, slightly squinting inward, and a heavy jaw, an enormousman who was the best shot in the company when he cared to be. He hadlistened in silence to the others, his rather thick but expressive lipscurving with cynicism. His only speech all the morning had been in themidst of the reception in the public square of the town when he said:"This home-coming doesn't mean much to me. Home? Hell! The hedgerows ofthe world are my home!"He appeared older than his years, and hard and bitter, except when hiseyes would light with a feverish sort of fire which shone now as hebroke into a lull in the talk."Comrades," he began."Let us hear from the socialist!" a Tory exclaimed."No, the anarchist!" shouted a socialist."There won't be any war!" said Stransky, his voice gradually rising tothe pitch of an agitator relishing the sensation of his own words."Patriotism is the played-out trick of the ruling classes to keep downthe proletariat. There won't be any war! Why? Because there are toomany enlightened men on both sides who do the world's work. We of the53d are a provincial lot, but throughout our army there are thousandsupon thousands like me. They march, they drill, but when battle comesthey will refuse to fight--my comrades in heart, to whom the flag ofthis country means no more than that of any other country!""Hold on! The flag is sacred!" cried the banker's son."Yes, that will do!""Shut up!"Other voices formed a chorus of angry protest."I knew you thought it; now I've caught you!" This from the sergeant,who had seen hard fighting against a savage foe in Africa and thereforewas particularly bitter about the Bodlapoo affair. The welt of a scar onhis gaunt, fever-yellowed cheek turned a deeper red as he seizedStransky by the collar of the blouse.Stransky raised his free hand as if to strike, but paused as he facedthe company's boyish captain, slender of figure, aristocratic offeature. His indignation was as evident as the sergeant's, but he wasbiting his lips to keep it under control."You heard what he said, sir?""The latter part--enough!""It's incitation to mutiny! An example!""Yes, put him under arrest."The sergeant still held fast to the collar of Stransky's blouse.Stransky could have shaken himself free, as a mastiff frees himself froma puppy, but this was resistance to arrest and he had not yet made uphis mind to go that far. His muscles were weaving under the sergeant'sgrip, his eyes glowing as with volcanic fire waiting on the madness ofimpulse for eruption."I wonder if it is really worth while to put him under arrest?" saidsome one at the edge of the group in amiable inquiry.The voice came from an officer of about thirty-five, who apparently hadstrolled over from a near-by aeroplane station to look at the regiment.From his shoulder hung the gold cords of the staff. His left hand thrustin the pocket of his blouse heightened the ease of his carriage, whichwas free of conventional military stiffness, while his eyes had thepeculiar eagerness of a man who seems to find everything that comesunder his observation interesting and significant.It was Colonel Arthur Lanstron, whose plane had skimmed the Gallands'garden wall for the "easy bump" ten years ago. There was somethingmore than mere titular respect in the way the young captainsaluted---admiration and the diffident, boyish glance of recognitionwhich does not presume to take the lead in recalling a slightacquaintance with a man of distinction."Dellarme! It's all of two years since we met at Miss Galland's, isn'tit?" Lanstron said, shaking hands with the captain."Yes, just before we were ordered south," said Dellarme, obviouslypleased to be remembered."I overheard your speech," Lanstron continued, nodding toward Stransky."It was very informing."A crowd of soldiers was now pressing around Stransky, and in the frontrank was Grandfather Fragini."Said our flag was no better'n any other flag, did he?" piped the oldman. "Beat him to a pulp! That's what the Hussars would have done.""If you don't mind telling it in public, Stransky, I should like to knowyour origin," said Lanstron, prepared to be as considerate of ananarchist's private feelings as of anybody's.Stransky squinted his eyes down the bony bridge of his nose and grinnedsardonically."That won't take long," he answered. "My father, so far as I couldidentify him, died in jail and my mother of drink.""That was hardly to the purple!" observed Lanstron thoughtfully."No, to the red!" answered Stransky savagely."I mean that it was hardly inclined to make you take ft roseate view oflife as a beautiful thing in a well-ordered world where favors offortune are evenly distributed," continued Lanstron."Rather to make me rejoice in the hope of a new order of things--there-creation of society!" Stransky uttered the sentiment with thetriumphant pride of a pupil who knows his text-book thoroughly.By this time the colonel commanding the regiment, who had noticed theexcitement from a distance, appeared, forcing a gap for his passagethrough the crowd with sharp words. He, too, recognized Lanstron. Afterthey had shaken hands, the colonel scowled as he heard the situationexplained, with the old sergeant, still holding fast to Stransky'scollar, a capable and insistent witness for the prosecution; whileStransky, the fire in his eyes dying to coals, stared straight ahead."It is only a suggestion, of course," said Lanstron, speaking quite as aspectator to avoid the least indication of interference with thecolonel's authority, "but it seems possible that Stransky has clothedhis wrongs in a garb that could never set well on his nature if he triedto wear it in practice. He is really an individualist. Enraged, he wouldfight well. I should like nothing better than a force of Stranskys if Ihad to defend a redoubt in a last stand.""Yes, he might fight." The colonel looked hard at Stransky's rigidprofile, with its tight lips and chin as firm as if cut out of stone."You never know who will fight in the pinch, they say. But that'sspeculation. It's the example that I have to deal with.""He is not of the insidious, plotting type. He spoke his mind openly,"suggested Lanstron. "If you give him the limit of the law, why, hebecomes a martyr to persecution. I should say that his remarks mightpass for barrack-room gassing.""Very well," said the colonel, taking the shortest way out of thedifficulty. "We will excuse the first offence.""Yes, sir!" said the sergeant mechanically as he released his grip ofthe offender. "We had two anarchists in my company in Africa," heobserved in loyal agreement with orders. "They fought like devils. Theonly trouble was to keep them from shooting innocent natives for sport."Stransky's collar was still crumpled on the nape of his neck. Heremained stock-still, staring down the bridge of his nose. For a fullminute he did not vouchsafe so much as a glance upward over the changein his fortunes. Then he looked around at Lanstron gloweringly."I know who you are!" he said. "You were born to the purple. You havehad education, opportunity, position--everything that you and your kindwant to keep for your kind. You are smarter than the others. You wouldhang a man with spider-webs instead of hemp. But I won't fight for you!No, I won't!"He threw back his head with a determination in his defiance so intensethat it had a certain kind of dignity that freed it of theatricalaffectation."Yes, I was fortunate; but perhaps nature was not altogether unkind toyou," said Lanstron. "In Napoleonic times, Stransky, I think you mighteven have carried a marshal's baton in your knapsack.""You--what rot!" A sort of triumph played around Stransky's full lipsand his jaw shot out challengingly. "No, never against my comrades onthe other side of the border!" he concluded, his dogged stare returning.Now the colonel gave the order to fall in; the bugle sounded and thecentipede's legs began to assemble on the road. But Stransky remained astatue, his rifle untouched on the sward. He seemed of a mind to let theregiment go on without him."Stransky, fall in!" called the sergeant.Still Stransky did not move. A comrade picked up the rifle and fairlythrust it into his hands."Come on, Bert, and knead dough with the rest of us!" he whispered."Come on! Cheer up!" Evidently his comrades liked Stransky."No!" roared Stransky, bringing the rifle down on the ground with aheavy blow.Then impulse broke through the restraint that seemed to characterize theLanstron of thirty-five. The Lanstron of twenty-five, who had metcatastrophe because he was "wool-gathering," asserted himself. He puthis hand on Stransky's shoulder. It was a strong though slim hand thatlooked as if it had been trained to do the work of two hands in theprocess of its owner's own transformation. Thus the old sergeant hadseen a general remonstrate with a brave veteran who had been guilty ofbad conduct in Africa. The old colonel gasped at such a subversion ofthe dignity of rank. He saw the army going to the devil. But youngDellarme, watching with eager curiosity, was sensible of no familiarityin the act. It all depended on how such a thing was done, he wasthinking."We all have minutes when we are more or less anarchists," said Lanstronin the human appeal of one man to another. "But we don't want to bejudged by one of those minutes. I got a hand mashed up for a mistakethat took only a second. Think this over to-night before you act. Then,if you are of the same opinion, go to the colonel and tell him so. Come,why not?""All right, sir, you're so decent about it!" grumbled Stransky, takinghis place in the ranks.Hep-hep-hep! the regiment started on its way, with Grandfather Fraginikeeping at his grandson's side."Makes me feel young again, but it's darned solemn beside the Hussars,with their horses' bits a-jingling. Times have certainlychanged--officers' hands in their pockets, saying 'if you don't mind' toa man that's insulted the flag! Kicking ain't good enough for thattraitor! Ought to hang him--yes, sir, hang and draw him!"Lanstron watched the marching column for a time."Hep-hep-hep! It's the brown of the infantry that counts in the end," hemused. "I liked that wall-eyed giant. He's all man!"Then his livening glance swept the heavens inquiringly. A speck in theblue, far away in the realms of atmospheric infinity, kept growing insize until it took the form of the wings with which man flies. The planevolplaned down with steady swiftness, till its racing shadow lay largeover the landscape for a few seconds before it rose again with beautifulease and precision."Bully for you, Etzel!" Lanstron thought, as he started back to theaeroplane station. "You belong in the corps. We shall not let you returnto your regiment for a while. You've a cool head and you'd charge achurch tower if that were the orders."VIIITHANKS TO A BUMBLEBEE"Has he changed much?" Mrs. Galland asked, when she learned that Martahad seen Westerling."Jove has reached his own--the very top of Olympus, and he likes theprospect," Marta replied.The only home news of importance that her mother had to impart relatedto a tiny strip of paper with the greeting, "Hello, Marta!" that hadbeen dropped from the pilot aeroplane as the Brown aerial squadron flewover the garden after its race with the Gray. She noted Marta'scustomary quickening interest at mention of Lanstron's name. It hadbecome the talisman of a hope whose fulfilment was always beingdeferred."How different Lanny and Westerling are!" Marta exclaimed, the pictureof the two men rising before her vision. "Lanny trying so hard under thepressure of his responsibility not to be human and unable to forgethimself, and Westerling trying, really trying, to be human at times, butunable to forget that he is Jove! Did you wave your acknowledgments toLanny,'?""Why, no! How could I?" asked Mrs. Galland. "He went over so fast Ididn't know it was he--a little figure so far overhead.""It's odd, but I think I'd know Lanny a mile away by a sort ofinstinct," said Marta. "You know I'd like a gun that would fire a bomband drop a message of 'Hello, yourself!' right on his knee. Wouldn'tthat give him a surprise?""You and he are so full of nonsense that you--" But Mrs. Gallanddesisted. What was the use?Sometimes she wished that Colonel Lanstron would stay away altogetherand leave a free field for a newcomer. Yet if two or three weeks passedwithout a call from him she was apprehensive. Besides being one of theThorbourg Lanstrons, he was a most charming, capable man, who had risenvery rapidly in his profession. It had been only six months after he hadbolted up from the wreck of his plane by way of self-introduction toMarta before he alighted in the field across the road from the garden toreport a promise kept.Once she knew that he was a Lanstron of Thorbourg, a fact of hardlypassing interest to Marta, Mrs. Galland made him intimately welcome. Bythe time he had paid his third call he was Lanny to Marta and she wasMarta to him, quite as if they had known each other from childhood. Shehad a gift for unaffected comradeship. He was the kind of man with whomshe could be a comrade. There was always something to say the momentthey met and they were never through talking when he had to go. Theydisagreed so often that Mrs. Galland thought they made a business of it.She wondered how real friendship could exist between two suchcontroversialists. They could be seriously disputatious to the point ofquarrelling; they could be light-heartedly disputatious to the banteringpoint, where either was uncertain which side of the argument he hadoriginally espoused."The gardener did not cut the chrysanthemums," Mrs. Galland said. "Thatis why we had asters in the bowl at luncheon. His deafness is really across, I never realized before what a companion one naturally makes of agardener.""No, there's no purpose in having a deaf gardener," said Marta. "Naturedistributes her defects unintelligently. Now, if we had dumb demagogues,deaf gossips, and steel that when it was being formed into a sword-bladeor a gun would turn to putty, we should be much better off. But wecouldn't let Feller go, could we? He's already made himself a fixture.So few people would put up with his deafness! He's so desirous ofpleasing and he loves flowers.""And Colonel Lanstron recommended him. Except for his deafness he is aperfect gardener. Of course he had to have some drawback, for completeperfection is impossible," Mrs. Galland agreed.The old straw hat that shaded the fringe of white hair had been hoveringwithin easy approaching distance of the chrysanthemum bed ever since thewhistle of the train that brought Marta home had been heard from thestation. Feller was watching Marta when she paused for a moment on thesecond terrace steps, enjoying the sweep of landscape anew with thefreshness of a first glimpse and the intimacy of every familiar detailcut in the memory. It was her landscape, famed in history, where historymight yet be made.His greeting was picturesque and effective. With white head bared, helooked up from the chrysanthemums to her and back at them and up at heragain, with a sort of covert comradeship in his eyes which were young,very young for such white hair, and held out his little pad and pencil.She smiled approval and slowly worked out a "perfect" in thedeaf-and-dumb alphabet before she took the proffered pencil and wrote:"I practised the deaf-and-dumb alphabet on the train. I'm learning fast.We've never had such chrysanthemums before. Next year we shall have someirises--just a few--as fine as they have in Japan. How's yourrheumatism?"He had replaced the broad-brimmed hat over his brow and his lips werevisible in a lingering smile as he read the message."Thank you, Miss Galland," he said in his even monotone. "You are verykind and I am very fortunate to find a place like this. I already knewsomething about irises and I've been reading up on the subject. We'lltry to hold our own with those little Japanese. As for the rheumatism,since you are good enough to inquire, Miss Galland, it's about the same.My legs are getting old. There are bound to be some kinks in them.""You select those to cut--a great armful!" she slowly spelled out on herfingers, clapping her hands with a triumphant cry of "How's that?" atthe finish."Your time has come! To the sacrifice!" he exclaimed to the flowers.Very tenderly, as if he were an executioner considerate of the victimsof an inexorable law, he was snipping the stems, his head bent close tothe blooms, when a bumblebee appeared among the salvias a few feet away.Perhaps army staffs who neglect no detail have made a mistake inoverlooking the whirring of bumblebees' wings in affecting the fate ofnations. These plunderers are not dangerous from their size, but theyhave not yet been organized to the hep-hep-hep of partisanship. Theywould as soon live in a Gray as a Brown garden, as soon probe for anatom of honey on one side of the white posts as the other. This one asit drew nearer was well to one side over Feller's shoulders. With eyesand mind intent on his work, Feller turned his head absently, as onewill at an interruption."There you are again, my dear!" he said. "You must think you're abattery of automatics."He went on cutting chrysanthemums, apparently unconscious that he hadspoken."Bring them up on the veranda, please," Marta wrote on the pad, herfingers moving with unusual nervous rapidity, the only sign of herinward excitement.Coming to the head of the steps of the terrace above, she looked back.Feller's face was quite hidden under his hat and suddenly she seemed tostub her toe and fall, while she uttered a low cry of pain. The hat roselike a jack-in-the-box with the cover released. Feller bounded towardher, taking two of steps at a time. She scrambled to her feet hastily,laughed, and gestured to show that she was not hurt. He drew hisshoulders together and bent over spasmodically, gripping his knee."I can run off if something starts me just as spry as if I were twenty,"he said. "But after I've done it and the kinks come, I realize I've gotold legs.""Now I know he's not deaf!" Marta murmured, as he returned to his work.She frowned. She was angry. "Lanny, you have something to explain," shethought.But when Feller brought his armful of chrysanthemums to her on theveranda, there was no trace in her expression of the discovery she hadmade, and she wrote a direction on his pad in the usual fashion.IXA SUNDAY MORNING CALLAs a boy, Arthur Lanstron had persisted in being an exception to theinfluences of both heredity and environment. Though his father and bothgrandfathers were officers who believed theirs to be the truegentleman's profession, he had preferred any kind of mechanical toy toarranging the most gayly painted tin soldiers in formation on thenursery floor; and he would rather read about the wonders of naturalhistory and electricity than the campaigns of Napoleon and Frederick theGreat and my lord Nelson. Left to his own choice, he would miss theparade of the garrison for inspection by an excellency in order to askquestions of a man wiping the oil off his hands with cotton-waste, whowas far more entertaining to him than the most spick-and-span ramrod ofa sergeant.The first time he saw a dynamo in motion he was spellbound. This waseven more fascinating than the drill that the family dentist worked withhis foot. His tutor found him inclined to estimate a Caesar,self-characterized in his commentaries, as less humanly appealing thanhis first love, the engine-driver, with whom he kept up a correspondenceafter his father had been transferred to another post. He was given tomagic lanterns, private telegraph and telephone lines, trying to walk atight rope, and parachute acts and experiments in chemistry. When thefamily were not worried lest he should break his neck or blow his headoff investigating, they were irritated by a certain plebeian strain inhim which kept all kinds of company. His mother disapproved of hispicking an acquaintance with a group of acrobats in order to improve hisskill on the trapeze. His excuse for his supple friends was that theywere all "experts" in something, just as his tutor was in Greek verbs.Very light-hearted he was, busy, vital, reckless, with an earnest smilethat could win the post telegrapher to teach him the code alphabet orpersuade his father not to destroy his laboratory after he had singedoff his eyebrows. This may explain why he had to cram hard in the deadlanguages at times, with a towel tied around his head. He complainedthat they were out of date; and he wanted to hear the Gauls' story, too,before he fully made up his mind about Caesar. But for the livinglanguages he had a natural gift which his father's service abroad asmilitary attache for a while enabled him to cultivate.Upon being told one day that he was to go to the military school thefollowing autumn, he broke out in open rebellion. He had just decided,after having passed through the stages of engine-driver, telegraphoperator, railroad-signal watchman, automobile manufacturer, andsuperintendent of the city's waterworks, to build bridges over tropicaltorrents that always rose in floods to try all his skill in saving hisconstruction work."I don't want to go into the army!" he said."Why?" asked his father, thinking that when the boy had to give hisreasons he would soon be argued out of the heresy."It's drilling a few hours a day, then nothing to do," Arthur replied."All your work waits on war and you don't know that there will ever beany war. It waits on something nobody wants to happen. Now, if youmanufacture something, why, you see wool come out cloth, steel come outan automobile. If you build a bridge you see it rising little by little.You're getting your results every day; you see your mistakes and yoursuccesses. You're making something, creating something; there'ssomething going on all the while that isn't guesswork. I think that'swhat I want to say. You won't order me to be a soldier will you?"The father, loath to do this, called in the assistance of an ablepleader then, Eugene Partow, lately become chief of staff of the Browns,who was an old friend of the Lanstron family. It was not in Partow'smind to lose such a recruit in a time when the heads of the army weretrying, in answer to the demands of a new age, to counteract the oldidea that made an officer's the conventional avocation of a gentleman ofleisurely habits."No army that ever worked as hard in peace as the average manufactureror bridge-builder was ever beaten in battle if it fought anything likeequal numbers," he said. "The officer who works hard in the armydeserves more credit than he would in any other profession because theincentive for results seems remote. But what a terrible test of resultsmay be made in a single hour's action. There is nothing you have learnedor ever will learn that may not be of service to you. There is noinvention, no form of industrial organization that must not be includedin the greatest organization of all, whose plant and methods must be upto date in every particular. To be backward in a single particular maymean disaster--may mean that the loss of thousands of lives is due toyou. You must have self-control, courage, dash, judgment If you have notkept up, if you are not equal to the test, your inefficiency will meanyour shame and your country's suffering; while efficiency means a clearconscience and your country's security."Thus Partow turned the balance on the side of filial affection. He keptwatch of the boy, but without favoring him with influence. YoungLanstron, who wanted to see results, had to earn them. He realized inpractice the truth of Partow's saying that there was nothing he had everlearned but what could be of service to him as an officer. What theacrobats had taught him probably saved his life on the occasion of hisfirst flight across the range. The friendships with all sorts of peoplein his youth were the forerunner of his sympathy with the giant,wall-eyed Stransky who had mutinied on the march."Finding enough work to do?" Par tow would ask with a chuckle when theymet in these days, for he had made Lanstron both chief of intelligenceand chief aerostatic officer. Young Colonel Lanstron's was the duty ofgaining the secrets of the Gray staff and keeping those of the Brown andorganizing up-to-the-moment efficiency in the new forces of the air.He had remarked truly enough that the injury to his left hand served asa better reminder against the folly of wool-gathering than a string,even a large red string, tied around his finger. Thanks to skilfulsurgery working ingeniously with splintered bone and pulpy flesh, therewas nothing unpleasant to the eye in a stiffened wrist and scarredknuckles slightly misshapen. The fingers, incapable of spreading much,were yet serviceable and had a firm grip of the wheel as he rose fromthe aeroplane station on the Sunday morning after Marta's return homefor a flight to La Tir.He knew the pattern weaving under his feet as one knows that of his owngarden from an overlooking window. Every detail of the staff map,ravines, roads, buildings, battery positions, was stitched together inthe flowing reality of actual vision. No white posts were necessary totell him where the boundary between the two nations lay. The line wasdrawn in his brain.Nature was in a gracious humor, the very tree tops motionless. The richlandscape in Sunday quiet appealed to his affections. He loved hiscountry and he loved Marta. It had been on such a day as this when therewould be no danger, that he had taken her for her first flight. Theglimpses, as they flew, of her profile, so alive and tense, were freshto his eye. How serious she had been! How vivid her impressions! Howtempestuous her ideas! He recalled their talk upon their return; all hisquestions and her answers.       *       *       *       *       *"Sublime and ridiculous!" she had begun in a summing up. "It is likeseeing the life of a family through a glass roof--the big, universalfamily! Valleys seemed no larger than sauce-dishes on a table.""What was the sublime thing?""Man's toil! The cumulative result of it, on every hand, in the commonaim for food, comfort, happiness, and progress! Little details ofdifference disappeared. Towns, villages, houses were simply towns,villages, houses of any country.""And the supremely ridiculous thing?""A regiment of cavalry of the Grays and one of the Browns on the sameroad! They appeared so self-important, as if the sky would fall or theearth heave up to meet the sky if they got out of formation. I imaginedeach man a metal figure that fitted astride a metal horse of the kindthat comes to children at Christmas time. They might better be engagedin brass-ring-snatching contests at the merry-go-rounds of public fairs.I wanted to brush them all over with a wave of the hand as you might thebattalions of the nursery floor. Just drilling and drilling in order toslash at one another some day. Flight! flight! It makes one's mind asbig and broad as the world. Oh, what a wonderful talk I'll have for mykids next Sunday!"       *       *       *       *       *Now that Lanstron was the organizer of the aviation corps his ownflights were rare. Mostly they were made to La Tir. His visits to Martawere his holidays? All the time that she was absent on her journeyaround the world they had corresponded. Her letters, so revealing ofherself and her peculiar angles of observation, formed a bundle sacredlypreserved. Her mother's joking reference about her girlish resolutionnot to marry a soldier often recurred to him. There, he sometimesthought, was the real obstacle to his great desire.He wished, this morning, that he were not Colonel Lanstron, but thebridge-builder returning from his triumph after he had at last spannedthe chasm and controlled the floods. Ah, there was something likeromance and real accomplishment in that! What an easy time abridge-builder had, comparatively, too! What an easy master capital mustbe compared to Eugene Partow! But no! If Marta loved it would not matterwhether he were bridge builder or army builder. Yes, she was like that.And what right had he to think of marriage? He could not have any home.He was now in the capital; again, along the frontier--a vagabond of dutyand Partow's orders.       *       *       *       *       *When he alighted from the plane he thrust his left hand into his blousepocket. He always carried it there, as if it were literally sewn inplace. In moments of emotion the scarred nerves would twitch as thetelltale of his sensitiveness; and this was something he would concealfrom others no matter how conscious he was of it himself. He found theGalland veranda deserted. In response to his ring a maid came to theopen door. Her face was sad, with a beauty that had prematurely faded.But it lighted pleasurably in recognition. Her hair was thick and tawny,lying low over the brow; her eyes were a softly luminous brown and herfull lips sensitive and yielding. Lanstron, an intimate of the Gallandhousehold, knew her story well and the part that Marta had played in it.Some four years previously, when a baby was in prospect for Minna, whowore no wedding-ring, Mrs. Galland had been inclined to send the maid toan institution, "where they will take good care of her, my dear. That'swhat such institutions are for. It is quite scandalous for her and forus--never happened in our family before!"Marta arched her eyebrows."We don't know!" she exclaimed softly."How can you think such a thing, let alone saying it--you, a Galland!"her mother gasped in indignation."That is, if we go far back," said Marta. "At all events, we have noprecedent, so let's establish one by keeping her.""But for her own sake! She will have to live with her shame!" Mrs.Galland objected. "Let her begin afresh in the city. We shall give her agood recommendation, for she is really an excellent servant. Yes, shewill readily find a place among strangers.""Still, she doesn't want to go, and it would be cruel to send her away.""Cruel! Why, Marta, do you think I would be cruel? Oh, very well, thenwe will let her stay!"       *       *       *       *       *"Both are away at church. Mrs. Galland ought to be here any minute, butMiss Galland will be later because of her children's class," said Minna."Will you wait on the veranda?"He was saying that he would stroll in the garden when childish footstepswere heard in the hall, and after a curly head had nestled against themother's skirts its owner, reminded of the importance of manners in theworld where the stork had left her, made a curtsey. Lanstron shook asmall hand which must have lately been on intimate terms with sugar orjam."How do you do, flying soldier man?" chirruped Clarissa Eileen. It wasevident that she held Lanstron in high favor."Let me hear you say your name," said Lanstron.Clarissa Eileen was triumphant. She had been waiting for days with therevelation when he should make that old request. Now she enunciated itwith every vowel and consonant correctly and primly uttered; indeed, sherepeated it four or five times in proof of complete mastery."A pretty name. I've often wondered how you came to give it to her,"said Lanstron to Minna."You do like it!" exclaimed Minna with girlish eagerness. "I gave herthe most beautiful name I could think of because"--she laid her handcaressingly on the child's head and a madonna-like radiance stole intoher face--"because she might at least have a beautiful name when"--thedull blaze of a recollection now burning in her eyes--"when there wasn'tmuch prospect of many beautiful things coming into her life; though Iknow, of course, that the world thinks she ought to be called Maggie."       *       *       *       *      *Proceeding leisurely along the main path of the first terrace, Lanstronfollowed it past the rear of the house to the old tower. Long ago themoat that surrounded the castle had been filled in. The green of rows ofgrape-vines lay against the background of a mat of ivy on the ancientstone walls, which had been cut away from the loopholes set withwindow-glass. The door was open, showing a room that had been closed inby a ceiling of boards from the walls to the circular stairway that ranaloft from the dungeons. On the floor of flags were cheap rugs. A numberof seed and nursery catalogues were piled on a round table covered witha brown cloth."Hello!" Lanstron called softly. "Hello!" he called louder and yetlouder.Receiving no answer, he retraced his steps and seated himself on thesecond terrace in a secluded spot in the shadow of the first terracewall, where he could see any one coming up the main flight of steps fromthe road. When Marta walked she usually came from town by that way. Atlength the sound of a slow step from another direction broke on his car.Some one was approaching along the path that ran at his feet. Around thecorner of the wall, in his workman's Sunday clothes of black, but stillwearing his old straw hat, appeared Feller, the gardener. He paused toexamine a rose-bush and Lanstron regarded him thoughtfully and sadly:his white hair, his stoop, his graceful hands, their narrow finger-tipsturning over the leaves.As he turned away he looked up, and a glance of definite and unfalteringrecognition was exchanged between the two men. Feller's hat was promptlylowered enough to form a barrier between their eyes. His face wassingularly expressionless. It seemed withered, clayish, like the wallsof a furnace in which the fire has died out. After a few steps he pausedbefore another rose-bush. Meanwhile, both had swept the surroundings ina sharp, covert survey. They had the garden to themselves."Gustave!" Lanstron exclaimed under his breath."Lanny!" exclaimed the gardener, turning over a branch of the rose-bush.He seemed unwilling to risk talking openly with Lanstron."You look the good workman in his Sunday best to a T!" said Lanstron."Being stone-deaf," returned Feller, with a trace of drollery in hisvoice, "I hear very well--at times. Tell me"--his whisper was quiveringwith eagerness--"shall we fight? Shall we fight?""We are nearer to it than we have ever been in our time," Lanstronreplied.The hat still shaded Feller's face, his stoop was unchanged, but thebranch in his hand shook."Honest?" he exclaimed. "Oh, the chance of it! the chance of it!""Gustave!" Lanstron's voice, still low, came in a gust of sympathy, andthe pocket which concealed his hand gave a nervous twitch as if it heldsomething alive and distinct from his own being. "The trial wears onyou! You feel you must break out?""No, I'm game--game, I tell you!" Still Feller spoke to the branch,which was steady now in a firm hand. "No, I don't grow weary of thegarden and the isolation as long as there is hope. But being deaf,always deaf, and yet hearing everything! Always stooped, even when thebugles are sounding to the artillery garrison--that is somewhattiresome!""The idea of being deaf was yours, you know, Gustave," said Lanstron."Yes, and the right plan. It was fun at first going through the streetsand hearing people say, 'He's deaf as a stone!' and having everybodywork their lips at me while I pretended to study them in a dumb effortto understand. Actors have two hours of it an evening, and an occasionalchange of parts, but I act one part all the time. I get as taciturn as aclam. If war doesn't come pretty soon I shall be ready for a monasteryof perpetual silence.""Confound it, Gustave!" exclaimed Lanstron. "It's inhuman, old boy! Youshan't stay another day!" Discretion to the winds, he sprang to hisfeet.An impulse of the same sort overwhelmed Feller. His hand let go of thebranch. The brim of the hat shot up, revealing a face that was not old,but in mercurial quickness of expressive, uncontrollable emotion wasyoung, handsomely and attractively young in its frame of prematurelywhite hair. The stoop was wholly gone. He was tall now, his eyessparkling with wild, happy lights and the soles of the heavy workman'sshoes unconsciously drawn together in a military stance. Lanstron'stwitching hand flew from his pocket and with the other found Feller'shand in a strong, warm, double grip. For a second's silence theyremained thus. Feller was the first to recover himself and utter awarning."Miss Galland--Minna--some one might be looking."He drew away abruptly, his face becoming suddenly old, his stoopreturning, and began to study the branch as before. Lanstron droppedback to his seat and gazed at the brown roofs of the town. Thus theymight continue their conversation as guest and gardener."I didn't think you'd stick it out, but you wanted to try--you chose,"said Lanstron. "Come--this afternoon--now!""This is best for me--this to the end of the chapter!" Feller replieddoggedly. "Because you say you didn't think I'd stick it out--ah, howwell you know me. Lanny!--is the one reason that I should.""True!" Lanstron agreed. "A victory over yourself!""How often I have heard in imagination the outbreak of rifle-fire downthere by the white posts! How often I have longed for that day--for war!I live for war!""It may never come," Lanstron said in frank protest. "And, for God'ssake, don't pray for it in that way!""Then I shall be patient--patient under all irritations. The worst is,"and Feller raised his head heavily, in a way that seemed to emphasizeboth his stoop and his age, "the worst is Miss Galland.""Miss Galland! How?""She is learning the deaf-and-dumb alphabet in order the better tocommunicate with me. She likes to talk of the flowers--gardening is apassion with her, too--and all the while, in face of the honesty ofthose big eyes of hers and of her gentle old mother's confidence, I amliving a lie! Oh, the satire of it! And I have not been used to lying.That is my only virtue; at any rate, I was never a liar!""Then, why stay, Gustave? I will find something else for you.""No!" Feller shot back irritably. "No!" he repeated resolutely. "I don'twant to go! I mean to be game--I--" He shifted his gaze dismally fromthe bush which he still pretended to examine and suddenly broke offwith: "Miss Galland is coming!"He started to move away with a gardener's shuffling steps, looking fromright to left for weeds. Then pausing, he glanced back, his face inanother transformation--that of a comedian."La, la, la!" he clucked, tossing his head gayly. "Depend on me, Lanny!They'll never know I'm not deaf. I get my blue fits only on Sundays! Anddeafness has its compensations. Think if I had to listen to all thestories of my table companion, Peter, the coachman! La, la, la!" heclucked again, before disappearing around a bend in the path. "La, la,la! I'm the man for this part!"Lanstron started toward the steps that Marta was ascending. She movedleisurely, yet with a certain springy energy that suggested that shemight have come on the run without being out of breath or seeming tohave made an effort. Without seeing him, she paused before one of theurns of hydrangeas in full bloom that flanked the third terrace wall,and, as if she would encompass and plunge her spirit into their abundantbeauty, she spread out her arms and drew the blossoms together in a massin which she half buried her face. The act was delightful in its graceand spontaneity. It was like having a page out of her secret self. Itbrought the glow of his great desire into Lanstron's eyes."Hello, stranger!" she called as she saw him, and quickened her pace."Hello, pedagogue!" he responded.As they shook hands they swung their arms back and forth like a pair ofromping children for a moment."We had a grand session of the school this morning, the largest classever!" she said. "And the points we scored off you soldiers! You'll finddisarmament already in progress when you return to headquarters. We'reirresistible, or at least," she added, with a flash of intensity, "we'regoing to be some day.""So you put on your war-paint!""It must be the pollen from the hydrangeas!" She flicked herhandkerchief from her belt and passed it to him. "Show that you know howto be useful!"He performed the task with deliberate care."Heavens! You even have some on your ear and some on your hair; butI'll leave it on your hair; it's rather becoming. There you are!" heconcluded."Off my hair, too!""Very well. I always obey orders.""I oughtn't to have asked you to do it at all!" she exclaimed with asudden change of manner as they started up to the house. "But a habit offriendship, a habit of liking to believe in one's friends, wasuppermost. I forgot. I oughtn't even to have shaken hands with you!""Marta! What now, Marta?" he asked.He had known her in reproach, in anger, in laughing mockery, in militantseriousness, but never before like this. The pain and indignation in hereyes came not from the sheer hurt of a wound but from the hurt of itssource. It was as if he had learned by the signal of its loss that hehad a deeper hold on her than he had realized."Yes, I have a bone to pick with you," she said, recovering a grim sortof fellowship. "A big bone! If you're half a friend you'll give me thevery marrow of it.""I am ready!" he answered more pathetically than philosophically."There's not time now; after luncheon, when mother is taking her nap,"she concluded as they came to the last step and saw Mrs. Galland on theveranda.XA LUNCHEON AT THE GALLANDS'Seated at the head of the table at luncheon, Mrs. Galland, with herround cheeks, her rather becoming double chin, and her nicely dressedhair, almost snow-white now, suggested a girlhood in the Bulwer Lyttonand Octave Feuillet age, when darkened rooms were favored for thecomplexion and it was the fashion for gentlewomen to faint on occasion.She lived in the past; the present interested her only when it arousedsome memory. To-day all her memories were of the war of forty years ago."I remember how Mrs. Karly collapsed when they brought word of the deathof her son, and never recovered her mind. And I remember Eunice Steinerwhen they brought Charles home looking so white--and it was the very dayset for their wedding! And I remember all the wounded gathered at thefoot of the terrace and being carried in here, while the guns wereroaring out on the plain--and now it's all coming again!""Why, mother, you're very blue to-day!" said Marta."We have had these crises before. We--" Lanstron began, rallying her."Oh, yes, you have reason and argument," she parried gently. "I haveonly my feelings. But it's in the air--yes, war is in the air, as it wasthat other time. And I remember that young private, only a boy, who laycrumpled up on the steps where he fell. I bandaged him myself and helpedto make his position easier. Yes, I almost lifted him in my arms" Shewas looking at the flowers on the table but not seeing them. She wasseeing the face of the young private forty years ago."He asked me to bring him a rose. He said the smell of roses was sosweet and he felt so faint. I brought him the rose--and he was dead!""Yes, yes!" Marta breathed. She, too, in her quick imagination, wasseeing the young private and spatters of blood on the terrace. Lanstronfeasted his eyes on her face, which mirrored her emotion."Oh, the groans of the dying in the night and the cheering when the newsof victory came in!" Mrs. Galland continued. "I could not cheer. Butthat was, long, long ago--long ago, and yet only yesterday! And now weare to have it all over again. The young men must have their turn. Theywill not be satisfied by the experience of their fathers. Yes, all overagain; still more horrible--and it was horrible enough then! I used toget giddy easily. I do yet. But I didn't faint--no, not once through thedays of nursing, the weeks of suspense. I wondered afterward how I couldhave endured so much.""Are we of the septicized-serum age equal to it?" Marta exclaimed."Yes, we of the matter-of-fact, automatic gun-recoil age!" put inLanstron."Oh, mother," Marta went on, "I wish you would go with me to the classsome morning, you who have seen and felt war, and tell it all as you sawit to the children!""But," remonstrated Mrs. Galland, "I'm an old-fashioned woman; and,Marta, your father was an officer, as your grandfather was, too. I amsure he would not approve of your school, and I could do nothing againsthis wishes."She looked up with moistening eyes to a portrait on the opposite wallover the seat which her husband had occupied at table. Lanstron sawthere a florid, jaunty gentleman in riding-habit, gloves on knee, cropin hand. The spirit of the first Galland or of the stern grandfather onthe side wall--with Bluecher tufts in front of his ears sturdy defianceof that parvenu Bonaparte and of his own younger brother who had fallenfighting for Bonaparte--would have frowned on the descendant who hadfilled the house with many guests and paid the bills with mortgages inthe ebbing tide of the family fortunes. But Mrs. Galland saw only ahero. She shared his prejudices against the manufacturers of the town;she saw the sale of land to be cut up into dwelling sites, which hadsaved the Gallands from bankruptcy, as the working of the adverse fateof modern tendencies. Even as she had left all details of business toher husband, so she had of late left them to Marta's managing."Edward and I were just engaged before the outbreak of the war," sheproceeded. "How handsome he was in his Hussars' uniform! How frightenedI was and hew proud of his fine bravado when I heard him and a number offellow officers drinking here in this room to quick death and speedypromotion! Do they still have that toast, Colonel?""Yes, in some regiments," Lanstron answered. He would not say that whatwas good form in the days of the _beau sabreur_ was considered a littletheatrical in the days of the automatic gun-recoil."And when he came--oh, when you came home," breathed Mrs. Galland to theportrait, "with the scar on your cheek, how tanned and strong your handswere and how white mine as you held them so fast! And then"--she smiledin peaceful content--"then I did faint. I am not ashamed of it--I did!""Without any danger of falling far!" said Lanstron happily."Or with much of a jar!" added Marta."You prattling children!" gasped Mrs. Galland, her cheeks flushing. "Doyou think that I fainted purposely? I would have been ashamed to mydying day if I had feigned it!""And you did not faint in the presence of the dead and dying!" saidMarta thoughtfully, wonderingly, leaning nearer to her mother, her eyesathirst and drinking."But I believe it is only a wispy-waspy sort of girl that faints at allthese days. They're all so businesslike," said Mrs. Galland--"sobusinesslike that they are ceasing to marry."How many girls she had known to wait a little too long! If anythingcould awaken Marta to action it ought to be war, which was a greatmatch-maker forty years ago. The thought of a lover in danger hadprecipitated wavering hearts into engagements. Marta's mood was suchthat she received the hint openly and playfully to-day."Oh, I don't despair!" she exclaimed, straightening her shoulders anddrawing in her chin with a mock display of bravery. "I believe it was inan English novel that I read that any woman without a hump can get anyman she sets out for. It is a matter of determination and concentrationand a wise choice of vulnerable objects.""Marta, Marta!" gasped Mrs. Galland. In her tone was a volume oflamentation."Now that I'm twenty-seven mother is ready to take any risk on mybehalf, if it is masculine. By the time I'm thirty she will be ready togive me to a peddler with a harelip!" she said mischievously."A peddler with a harelip! Marta, will you never be serious?""Some day, mother," Marta went on, "when we find the right man, you holdhim while I propose, and together we'll surely--"Mrs. Galland could not resist laughing, which was one way to stopfurther absurdities--absurdities concealing a nervous strain theyhappened to be this time--while Colonel Lanstron was a little flushedand ill at ease. She had a truly silvery laugh--the kind no longer infashion among the gentry since golden laughs came in,--that went wellwith the dimples dipping into her pink cheeks.Contrary to custom, she did not excuse herself immediately afterluncheon for her afternoon nap, but kept battling with her nods untilnature was victorious and the fell fast asleep. Marta, grown restlesswith impatience, suggested to Lanstron that they stroll in the garden,and they took the path past the house toward the castle tower, stoppingin an arbor with high hedges on either side around a statue of Mercury."Now!" exclaimed Marta narrowly. "It was you, Lanny, who recommendedFeller to us as a gardener, competent though deaf!" With literal brevityshe told how she had proved him to be a man of most sensitive hearing."I didn't let him know that he was discovered. I felt too much pity forhim to do that. You brought him here--you, Lanny, you are the one toexplain.""True, he is not deaf!" Lanstron replied."You knew he was not deaf, while we wrote our messages to him and I havebeen learning the deaf-and-dumb alphabet! It was pretty fun, wasn't it?""Not fun--no, Marta!" he parried."He is a spy?" she asked."Yes, a spy. You can put things in a bright light, Marta!" He foundwords coming with difficulty in face of the pain and disillusion of herset look."Using some broken man as a pawn; setting him as a spy in the gardenwhere you have been the welcome friend!" she exclaimed. "A spy onwhat--on my mother, on Minna, on me, on the flowers, as a part of thismonstrous game of trickery and lies that you are playing?"There was no trace of anger in her tone. It was that of one mortallyhurt. Anger would have been easier to bear than the measuring,penetrating wonder that found him guilty of such a horrible part. Thoseeyes would have confused Partow himself with the steady, wellingintensity of their gaze. She did not see how his left hand was twitchingand how he stilled its movement by pressing it against the bench."You will take Feller with you when you go!" she said, rising.Lanstron dropped his head in a kind of shaking throb of his whole bodyand raised a face white with appeal."Marta!" He was speaking to a profile, very sensitive and yet likeivory. "I've no excuse for such an abuse of hospitality except theobesssion of a loathsome work that some man must do and I was set to do.My God, Marta! I cease to be natural and human. I am a machine. I keepthinking, what if war comes and some error of mine let the enemy knowwhere to strike the blow of victory; or if there were information Imight have gained and failed to gain that would have given us thevictory--if, because I had not done my part, thousands of lives of oursoldiers were sacrificed needlessly!"At that she turned on him quickly, her face softening."You do think of that--the lives?""Yes, why shouldn't I?""Of those on your side!" she exclaimed, turning away."Yes, of those first," he replied. "And, Marta, I did not tell you whyFeller was here because he did not want me to, and I was curious to seeif he had sustained power enough to keep you from discovering hissimulation. I did not think he would remain. I thought that in a week hewould tire of the part. But now you must have the whole story. You willlisten?""I should not be fair if I did not, should I?" she replied, with a wearyshadow of a smile.XIMARTA HEARS FELLER'S STORYTo tell the story as Lanstron told it is to have it from the partisanlips of a man speaking for a man out of the depths of a friendship growninto the fibre of youth. It is better written by the detached narrator.Gustave Feller's father had died when Gustave was twelve and his motherfound it easy to spoil an only son who was handsome and popular. Hesuffered the misfortune of a mental brilliancy that learns too readilyand of a personal charm that wins its way too easily. He danced well; hewas facile at the piano; and he had so pronounced a gift as an amateuractor that a celebrated professional had advised him to go on the stage.The two entering the cadet officers' school at the same time, chancemade them roommates and choice soon made them chums. They had in commoncleverness and the abundant energy that must continually express itselfin action, and a mutual attraction in the very complexity of dissimilartraits that wove well in companionship.While they were together Lanstron was a brake on his friend's impulsesof frivolity which carried him to extremes; but they separated afterreceiving their commissions, Feller being assigned to thehorse-artillery and Lanstron to the infantry and later to the staff. Incharge of a field-battery at manoeuvres Feller was at his best. But inthe comparative idleness of his profession he had much spare time foramusement, which led to gambling. Soon many debts hung over his head,awaiting liquidation at high rates of interest when he should come intothe family property.To the last his mother, having ever in mind a picture of him as a finefigure riding at the head of his guns, was kept in ignorance of thisside of his life. With her death, when he had just turned thirty, afortune was at his disposal. He made an oath of his resolution to payhis debts, marry and settle down and maintain his inheritanceunimpaired. This endured for a year before it began to waver; and thewavering was soon followed by headlong obsession which fed on itself. Ashis passion for gambling grew it seemed to consume the better elementsof his nature. Lanstron reasoned with him, then implored, then stormed;and Feller, regularly promising to reform, regularly fell each time intogreater excesses. Twice Lanstron saved him from court-martial, but thethird time no intercession or influence would induce his superiors tooverlook the offence. Feller was permitted to resign to avoid a scandal,and at thirty-three, penniless, disgraced, he faced the world and soughtthe new land which has been the refuge for numbers of his kind. Only onefriend bade him farewell as he boarded a steamer for New York, and thiswas Lanstron."Keep away from cities! Seek the open country! And write me,Gustave--don't fail!" said Lanstron.Letters full of hope came from a Wyoming ranch; letters that told howFeller had learned to rope a steer and had won favor with his fellowsand the ranch boss; of a one-time gourmet's healthy appetite for thefare of the chuck wagon. Lanstron, reading more between the lines thanin them, understood that as muscles hardened with the new life the oldpassion was dying and in its place was coming something equallydangerous as a possible force in driving his ardent nature to someexcess for the sake of oblivion. Finally, Feller broke out with thetruth."My hair is white now, Lanny," he wrote. "I have aged ten years in thesetwo. With every month of this new life the horror of my career hasbecome clear to me. I lie awake thinking of it. I feel unworthy toassociate with my simple, outspoken, free-riding companions. Remorse isliterally burning up my brain. It is better to have my mind diseased, mymoral faculties blurred, my body unsound; for to be normal, healthy,industrious is to remember the whole ghastly business of my dishonor."'Pay back! Pay back in some way!' a voice keeps saying. 'Pay back! Havean object in mind. Get to work on something that will help you to payback or you will soon take a plunge to lower depths than you have yetsounded.'"It is not the gambling, not the drinking--no! The thing that I cannotforget, that grows more horrible the more keenly awake clean livingmakes me to the past, is that I am inwardly foul--as foul as a priestwho has broken his vows. I have disgraced the uniform--my country'suniform. I may never wear that uniform again; never look the meanestprivate in a battery in the face without feeling my cheeks hot withshame. While I cannot right myself before the service, I should like todo something to right myself with my conscience. I should like to see abattery march past and look at the flag and into the faces of thesoldiers of my country feeling that I had atoned--feeling so for my ownpeace of mind--atoned by some real deed of service."I have been reading how Japanese volunteers made a bridge of theirbodies for their comrades into a Russian trench, and when everybody elsefelt a horrible, uncanny admiration for such madness I have envied themthe glorious exhilaration of the moment before the charge. That was asufficient reward in life for death. So I come again to you for help.Now that you are chief of intelligence you must have many secret agentswithin the inner circle of the army's activities. In the midst of peaceand the commonplaces of drill and manoeuvres there must be dangerousand trying work where the only distinction is service for the cause--ourcause of three million against five. Find a task for me, no matter howmean, thankless, or dangerous, Lanny. The more exacting it is the morewelcome, for the better will be my chance to get right with myself.""Come!" was Lanstron's cable in answer.At the time he had not chosen any employment for Feller. He was thinkingonly that something must be found. When he heard of the death of theGallands' gardener he recollected that before the passion for gamblingovertook Feller he had still another passion besides his guns. Thegarden of the Feller estate had been famous in its neighborhood. YoungLanstron had not been more fond of the society of an engine-driver thanyoung Feller of a gardener's. On a holiday in the capital with hisfellow cadets he would separate from them to spend hours in thebotanical gardens. Once, after his downfall began, at a riotous dinnerparty he had broken into a temper with a man who had torn a rose topieces in order to toss the petals over the table."Flowers have souls!" he had cried in one of his tumultuous, abandonedreversions to his better self which his companions found eccentric anddiverting. "That rose is the only thing in the room that is not foul--and I am the foulest of all!"The next minute, perhaps after another glass of champagne, he would bewinning a burst of laughter by his mimicry of a gouty old colonelreprimanding him for his erring career.Naturally, in the instinct of friendship, Lanstron's own account leftout the unpleasant and dwelt on the pleasant facts of Feller's career."His colonel did not understand him," he said. "But I knew the depths ofhis fine spirit and generous heart. I knew his talent. I knew that hewas a victim of unsympathetic surroundings, of wealth, of love ofexcitement, and his own talent. Where he was, something must happen. Hebubbled with energy. The routine of drill, the same old chaff of themess, the garrison gossip, the long hours of idleness while the busyworld throbs outside, which form a privileged life to most officers,were stifling to him. 'Let's set things going!' he would say in the olddays, and we'd set them. Most of our demerits were for some kind ofdeviltry. And how he loved the guns! I can see the sparkle of his men'seyes at sight of him. Nobody could get out of them what he could. If hehad not been put in the army as a matter of family custom, if he hadbeen an actor, or if he and I had gone to build bridges, then he mighthave a line of capital letters and periods after his name, and he wouldnot be a spy or I an employer of spies, doing the work of a detectiveagency in an officer's uniform because nobody but an officer may do it."At first Marta listened rigidly, but as the narrative proceeded herinterest grew. When Lanstron quoted Feller's appeal for any task,however mean and thankless, she nodded sympathetically andunderstandingly; when he related the incident of the rose, its appealwas irresistible. She gave a start of delight and broke silence."Yes. I recall just how he looked as he stood on the porch, his headbent, his shoulders stooped, twirling his hat in his hands, while motherand I examined him as to his qualifications," she said. "I remember hiswords. He said that he knew flowers and that, like him, flowers couldnot hear; but perhaps he would be all the better gardener because hecould not hear. He was so ingratiating; yet his deafness seemed such adrawback that I hesitated."Following the path to the tower leisurely, they had reached the tower.Feller's door was open. Marta looked into the room, finding in the neatarrangement of its furniture a new significance. He was absent, for itwas the dinner hour."And on my recommendation you took him," Lanstron continued."Yes, on yours, Lanny, on a friend's! You"--she put a cold emphasis onthe word--"you wanted him here for your plans! And why? You haven'tanswered that yet. What purpose of the war game does he serve in ourgarden?"His look pleaded for patience, while he tried to smile, which was ratherdifficult in face of her attitude."Not altogether in the garden; partly in the tower," he replied. "Youare to be in the whole secret and in such a way as to make my temptationclear, I hope. First, I think you ought to see the setting. Let us goin"Impelled by the fascination of Feller's romantic story and by acuriosity that Lanstron's manner accentuated, she entered the room.Apparently Lanstron was familiar with the premises. Passing through thesitting-room into the room adjoining, where Feller stored his tools, heopened a door that gave onto the circular stone steps leading down intothe dungeon tunnel."I think we had better have a light," he said, and when he had fetchedone from the bedchamber he descended the steps, asking her to follow.They were in a passage six feet in height and about three feet broad,which seemed to lead on indefinitely into clammy darkness. The dewystone walls sparkled in fantastic and ghostly iridescence under the raysfrom the lantern. The dank air lay moist against their faces."It's a long time since I've been here," said Marta, glad to break theuncanny sound of their footsteps in the weird silence with her voice."Not since I was a youngster. Then I came on a dare to see if there weregoblins. There weren't any; at least, none that cared to manifesthimself to me.""We have a goblin here now that we are nursing for the Grays--anup-to-date one that is quite visible," said Lanstron. "This is farenough." He paused and raised the lantern. With its light full in herface, she blinked. "There, at the height of your chin!"She noted a metal button painted gray, set at the side of one of thestones of the wall, which looked unreal. She struck the stone with herknuckles and it gave out the sound of hollow wood, which was followed,as an echo, by a little laugh from Lanstron. Pressing the button, apanel door flew open, revealing a telephone mouthpiece and receiver setin the recess. Without giving him time to refuse permission, her thoughtall submissive to the prompting spirit of adventure, she took down thereceiver and called: "Hello!""The wire isn't connected," explained Lanstron.Marta hung up the receiver and closed the door abruptly in a spasm ofreaction."Like a detective play!" were the first words that sprang to her lips."Well?" As she faced around her eyes glittered in the lantern's rays."Well, have you any other little tricks to show me? Are you asleight-of-hand artist, too, Lanny? Are you going to take a machine gunout of your hat?""That is the whole bag," he answered. "I thought you'd rather see itthan have it described to you.""Having seen it, let us go!" she said, in a manner that implied furtherreckoning to come."If out of a thousand possible sources one source succeeds, then thecost and pains of the other nine hundred and ninety-nine are more thanrepaid," he was saying urgently, the soldier uppermost in him. "Some ofthe best service we have had has been absurd in its simplicity and itsaudacity. In time of war more than one battle has been decided by athing that was a trifle in itself. No matter what your preparation, youcan never remove the element of chance. An hour gained in informationabout your enemy's plans may turn the tide in your favor. A Chinesepeasant spy, because he happened to be intoxicated, was able to give theJapanese warning in time for Kuroki to make full dispositions forreceiving the Russian attack in force at the Sha-ho. There are manyother incidents of like nature in history. So it is my duty to neglectno possible method, however absurd."By this time he was at the head of the steps. Standing to one side, heoffered his hand to assist Marta. But she seemed not to see it. Heraspect was that of downright antagonism."However absurd! yes, it is absurd to think that you can make me a partyto any of your plans, for--" She broke off abruptly with starting eyes,as if she had seen an apparition.Lanstron turned and through the door of the tool-room saw Fellerentering the sitting-room. He was not the bent, deferential oldgardener, nor was he the Feller changed to youth as he thought ofhimself at the head of a battery. His features were hard-set, a fightingrage burning in his eyes, his sinews taut as if about to spring upon anadversary. When he recognized the intruders he turned limp, his headdropped, hiding his face with his hat brim, and he steadied himself byresting a hand on the table edge."Oh, it's you, Lanny--Colonel Lanstron!" he exclaimed thickly. "I sawthat some one had come in here and naturally I was alarmed, as nobodybut myself ever enters. And Miss Galland!" He removed his hatdeferentially and bowed; his stoop returned and the lines of his facedrooped. "I was so stupid; it did not occur to me that you might beshowing the tower to Colonel Lanstron.""We are sorry to have given you a fright!" said Marta very gently."Eh? eh?" queried Feller, again deaf. "Fright? Oh, no, no fright. Itmight have been some boys from the town marauding."He was about to withdraw, in keeping with his circumspect adherence tohis part, which he played with a sincerity that half-convinced evenhimself at times that he was really deaf, when the fire flickered backsuddenly to his eyes and he glanced from Lanstron to the stairway indesperate inquiry."Wait, Feller! Three of us share the secret now. These are MissGalland's premises. I thought best that she should know everything,"said Lanstron."Everything!" exclaimed Feller. "Everything--" the word caught in histhroat. "You mean my story, too?" He was neither young nor old now. Heseemed nondescript and miserable. "She knows who I am?" he asked."Yes!" Lanstron answered."Lanny!" This almost reproachfully, as if the ethics of friendship hadbeen abused."Yes. I'm sorry, Gustave. I--" Lanstron began miserably."But why not?" said Feller, with a wan attempt at a smile. "You see--Imean--it does not matter!" he concluded in a hopeless effort atphilosophy."My thoughtlessness, my callousness, my obsession with my work! I shouldnot have told your story," said Lanstron."His story!" exclaimed Marta, with a puzzled look to Lanstron before sheturned to Feller with a look of warm sympathy. "Why, there is no story!You came with excellent recommendations. You are our very efficientgardener. That is all we need to know. Isn't that the way you wish it,Mr. Feller?""Yes, just that!" he said softly, raising his eyes to her in gratitude."Thank you, Miss Galland!"He was going after another "Thank you!" and a bow; going with the slowstep and stoop of his part, when Lanstron, with a masculine roughness ofimpulse which may be a sublime gentleness, swung him around and seizedhis hands in a firm caress."Forgive me, Gustave!" he begged. "Forgive the most brutal of allinjuries--that which wounds a friend's sensibilities.""Why, there is nothing I could ever have to forgive you, Lanny," hesaid, returning Lanstron's pressure while for an instant his quickeningmuscles gave him a soldierly erectness. Then his attitude changed to oneof doubt and inquiry. "And you found out that I was not deaf when youhad that fall on the terrace?" he asked, turning to Marta. "That is howyou happened to get the whole story? Tell me, honestly!""Yes""Had you suspected me before that?""Yes, if you must know. I observed you speak to a bumblebee you couldnot see," she said frankly, though she knew that her answer hurt him.There was no parleying with the insistence of his pale, drawn face andhis fingers playing in nervous tension on the table edge. Suddenly hesmiled as he had at the bumblebee."There you are again, confound you!" he exclaimed, shaking his finger atthe imaginary intruder on the silence of the garden. "Did anyone elsesuspect?" he asked in fierce intensity."No, I don't think so."He drew back with a long breath of relief, while his fingers now beat amerry tattoo."You saw so much more of me than the others, Miss Galland," he said witha charming bow, "and you are so quick to observe that you are hardly afair test. That little thunderer will not get me again. I'll fool theones I want to fool. And I'm learning, Lanny, learning all thetime--getting a little deafer all the time. Miss Galland," he added,struck in visible contrition by a new thought, "I am sorry"--he pausedwith head down for an instant--"very sorry to have deceived you.""But you are still a deaf gardener to me," said Marta, findingconsolation in pleasing him."Eh? eh?" He put his hand to his ear as he resumed his stoop. "Yes,yes," he added, as a deaf man will when understanding of a remark whichhe failed at first to catch comes to him in an echo. "Yes, the gardenerhas no past," he declared in the gentle old gardener's voice, "when allthe flowers die every year and he thinks only of next year'sblossoms--of the future!"Now the air of the room seemed to be stifling him, that of the rooflessworld of the garden calling him. His face spoke pitifully a desire forescape as he withdrew. The bent figure disappeared around a turn in thepath and they listened without moving until the sound of his slow,dragging footfalls had died away."When he is serving those of his own social station I can see how itwould be easier for him not to have me know," said Marta. "Sensitive,proud, and intense--" and a look of horror appeared in her eyes. "As hecame across the room his face was transformed. I imagine it was likethat of a man giving no quarter in a bayonet charge!""His secret was at stake!" Lanstron said in ready championship.She put up her hand as if to shut out a picture."Don't let us think of it!" she exclaimed with a shudder. "He did notknow what he was doing. His is one of the natures that have moments whenan impulse throws them off their balance and ruins the work of years.No, we must think only of his sacrifice, his enforced humiliation, inorder to try to make amends for the past according to his light. No onecould refuse him sympathy and respect."Feller had won the day for himself where a friend's pleas might havefailed. This was as it should be, Lanstron thought; and he smiledhappily over the rare thing in Marta that felt the appeal which Fellerhad for him."The right view--the view that you were bound to take!" he said."And yet, I don't know your plans for him, Lanny. Pity is one thing;there is another thing to consider," she replied, with an abrupt changeof tone. "But first let us leave Feller's quarters. We are intrudershere."XIIA CRISIS WITHIN A CRISIS"A broken-hearted man playing deaf; a secret telephone installed on ourpremises without our consent--this is all I know so far," said Marta,who was opposite Lanstron at one end of the circular seat in the arborof Mercury, leaning back, with her weight partly resting on her handspread out on the edge of the bench, head down, lashes lowered so thatthey formed a curtain for her glance. "I listen!" she added."Of course, with our three millions against their five, the Grays willtake the offensive," he said. "For us, the defensive. La Tir is in anangle. It does not belong in the permanent tactical line of ourdefences. Nevertheless, there will be hard fighting here. The Brownswill fall back step by step, and we mean, with relatively small cost toourselves, to make the Grays pay a heavy price for each step--just asheavy as we can!"They had often argued before with all the weapons known to controversy;but now the realization that his soldierly precision was bringing theforces of war into their personal relations struck her cold, with alogic as cold as his own seemed to her."You need not use euphonious terms," she said without lifting her lashesor any movement except a quick, nervous gesture of her free hand thatfell back into place on her lap. "What you mean is that you will kill asmany as possible of the Grays, isn't it? And if you could kill five forevery man you lost, that would be splendid, wouldn't it?""I don't think of it as splendid. There is nothing splendid about war,"he objected; "not to me, Marta.""Still you would like to kill five to one, even ten to one, wouldn'tyou?" she persisted."Marta, you are merciless!""So is war. It should be treated mercilessly.""Yes, twenty to one if they try to take our land!" he declared. "If wecould keep up that ratio the war would not last more than a week. Itwould mean a great saving of lives in the end. We should win.""Exactly. Thank you. Westerling could not have said it better as areason for another army-corps. For the love of humanity--the humanity ofour side--please give us more weapons for murder! And after you havemade them pay five to one or ten to one in human lives for the tangent,what then? Go on! I want to look at war face to face, free of thewill-o'-the-wisp glamour that draws on soldiers!""We fall back to our first line of defence, fighting all the time. TheGrays occupy La Tir, which will be out of the reach of our guns. Yourhouse will no longer be in danger, and we happen to know that Westerlingmeans to make it his headquarters.""Our house Westerling's headquarters!" she repeated. With a start thatbrought her up erect, alert, challenging, her lashes flickering, sherecalled that Westerling had said at parting that he should see her ifwar came. This corroborated Lanstron's information. One side wanted aspy in the garden; the other a general in the house. Was she expected tomake a choice? He had ceased to be Lanny. He personified war. Westerlingpersonified war. "I suppose you have spies under his very nose--in hisvery staff offices?" she asked."And probably he has in ours," said Lanstron, "though we do our best toprevent it.""What a pretty example of trust among civilized nations!" she exclaimed."And you say that Westerling, who commands the killing on his side, willbe in no danger?""Naturally not. As you know, a chief of staff must be at the wire headwhere all information centres, free of interruption or confusion or anypossibility of broken lines of communication with his corps anddivisions.""Then Partow will not be in any danger?""For the same reasons, no.""How comfortable! In perfect safety themselves, they will order othermen to death!""Marta, you are unjust!" exclaimed Lanstron, for he revered Partow asdisciple reveres master. "Partow has the iron cross!"--the prized ironcross given to both officers and men of the Browns for exceptionalcourage in action and for that alone. "He won it leading a second chargewith a bullet in his arm, after he had lost thirty per cent, of hisregiment. The second charge succeeded.""Yes, I understand," she went on a little wildly. "And perhaps thecolonel on the other side, who fought just as bravely and had evenheavier losses, did not get the bronze cross of the Grays because hefailed. Yes, I understand that bravery is a requisite of the militarycult. You must take some risk or you will not cause enough slaughter towin either iron or bronze crosses. And, Lanny, are you a person of suchdistinction in the business of killing that you also will be out ofdanger?"She had forgotten about the telephone; she had forgotten the picture ofdare-devil nerve he made when he rose from the wreck of his plane. Ifhis work were to make war, her work was against war--the mission of herlife as she saw it in the intense, passionate moments when some newabsurdity of its processes appeared to her. She was ready to seize anyargument his talk offered to combat the things for which he stood. Shedid not see, as her eyes poured her hot indignation into his, that hismaimed hand was twitching or how he bit his lips and flushed before hereplied:"Each one goes where he is sent, link by link, down from the chief ofstaff. Only in this way can you have that solidarity, that harmoniousefficiency which means victory.""An autocracy, a tyranny over the lives of all the adult males incountries that boast of the ballot and self-governing institutions!" sheput in."But I hope," he went on, with the quickening pulse and eager smile thatused to greet a call from Feller to "set things going" in their cadetdays, "that I may take out a squadron of dirigibles. After all this spybusiness, that would be to my taste.""And if you caught a regiment in close formation with a shower of bombs,that would be positively heavenly, wouldn't it?" She bent nearer to him,her eyes flaming demand and satire."No! War--necessary, horrible, hellish!" he replied. Something in herseemed to draw out the brutal truth she had asked for in place ofeuphonious terms."You apparently know where your profession ought to feel perfectly athome--but what is the use? What?" She put her hands over her face andshuddered. "I grow savage; but it is because I have known you so welland because everything you say brings up its answer irresistibly to mymind. I keep thinking of what mother said at luncheon--of her certaintythat war is coming. I see the garden spattered with blood, the woundedand the dying--an eddy in the conflict! And I am in a controversial eddywhirling round and round away from the main current of what you were totell me." She let her hands drop, but her eyes still held their lightsof hostility. "Go on. I listen!""When I became chief of intelligence I found that an underground wirehad been laid to the castle from the Eighth Division headquarters, whichwill be our general staff headquarters in time of war," he said. "Thepurpose was the same as now, but abandoned as chimerical. All that wasnecessary was to install the instrument, which Feller did. I, too, sawthe plan as chimerical, yet it was a chance--the one out of a thousand.If it should happen to succeed we should play with our cards concealedand theirs on the table.""The noble art of war, so sportsmanlike!" she exclaimed. "So like therules and ideals of the Olympic games! But the games will not serve tokeep nations virile. They must shed blood!""Sportsmanlike? Not in the least!" he said. "The sport and glamour ofwar are past. The army becomes a business, a trade that ought to beuniformed in blue jumpers rather than gold lace. We are in an era ofenormous forces, untried tactics, and rapidly changing conditions. Thisis why the big nations hesitate to make war; why they prepare well; whythe stake is so great that the smallest detail must not be overlooked."She could not hold back her arguments, reason was so unquestionably onher side."Yes, the cunning of the fox, the brutality of Cain, using modernscience and invention! Feint and draw your enemy into a cul-de-sac;screen your flank attacks; mask your batteries and hold their fire tillthe infantry charge is ripe for decimation! Oh, I have been brought upamong soldiers! I know!""The rest of Feller's part you have guessed already," he concluded. "Youcan see how a deaf, inoffensive old gardener would hardly seem to know aGray soldier from a Brown; how it might no more occur to Westerling tosend him away than the family dog or cat; how he might retain hisquarters in the tower; how he could judge the atmosphere of the staff,whether elated or depressed, pick up scraps of conversation, and, as atrained officer, know the value of what he heard and report it over the'phone to Partow's headquarters.""But what about the aeroplanes?" she asked. "I thought you were todepend on them for scouting.""We shall use them, but they are the least tried of all the newresources," he said. "A Gray aeroplane may cut a Brown aeroplane downbefore it returns with the news we want. At most, when the aviator maydescend low enough for accurate observation he can see only what isactually being done. Feller would know Westerling's plans before theywere even in the first steps of execution. This"--playing the thoughthappily--"this would be the ideal arrangement, while our planes anddirigibles were kept over our lines to strike down theirs. And, Marta,that is all," he concluded. "I've tried to make everything clear.""You have, quite!" Marta replied decisively. "Now it is my turn totalk.""You have been talking a little already!" he intimated good-naturedly."Only interruptions. That's not really talking," she answered, and brokeinto a sharp little laugh. A laugh was helpful to both after such a tautcolloquy, but it seemed only to renew her energies for conflict. "Ifthere is war, the moment that Feller's ruse is discovered he will beshot as a spy?" she asked."I warned him of that," said Lanstron. "I made the situation plain. Herefused the assignments I first suggested to him. He objected that theydid not offer any real expiation; they were not difficult or hazardousenough. I saw that I could not trick his conscience--what a conscienceold Gustave has!--by any nominal task. When I mentioned this one he wasinstantly keen. The deafness was his idea of a ruse for his purpose. Hewanted his secret kept. Thinking that his weakness for change would notlet him bear the monotony of a gardener's life as he saw himself bearingit in imagination, I recommended him to you. And there was thechance--the thousandth chance, Marta! He is a soldier, with a soldier'sfatalism. He sees no more danger in this than in commanding a battery ina crisis.""Naturally, as he is all impulse and fire. But you are the temperedsteel of self-control. You should save him from his impulses, not makeuse of them.""You put it bluntly, Marta. You--""My turn to talk!" she reminded him. "Did you of all her views ofFeller from his entrance to his quarters till he had gone. Her lips,which had kept so firm in argument, were parted and trembling insympathy."I can see how he would take it!" she exclaimed. "I see his white hair,his eyes, his fingers trembling on the edge of the table, his utterdejection--and then impulse, headlong, irresponsible, craving thedevil's company!""Yes, nothing could hold him," Lanstron agreed. "What makes it worse isthat with regular living, the pleasure of the garden, and a settledpurpose I have noticed his improvement already!""There is something so fine about him, something that deserves to winout against his weaknesses," she said reflectively."If there is no war, I hope--after a year or so, I hope and believe thatI may have him rewarded in some way that would make him feel that he hadatoned.""And we have been talking as if war were due to-morrow!" she exclaimed.The breaking light of a discovery, followed by a wave of happy relief,swept over her responsive features, from relaxing brows to chin, whichgave a toss on its own account. "Why, of course, Lanny! Till war doescome he is only a gardener with an illusion that is giving mentalstrength. Why didn't you put it that way before?" she asked in surpriseat so easy a solution having escaped them. "Let him stay, at least untilwar comes.""And then?""Lanny, you yourself, with all your information, you don't think--""No; though we are nearer it than ever before, it seems to me," he said,choosing his words carefully. "But it is likely that diplomacy will findits way out of this crisis as it has out of many others.""Then we'll leave that question till the evil day," she replied. "Wehave had a terrific argument, Lanny, haven't we? And you have won!"Her fingers flew out to his arm and rested lightly there after aninstant's firm pressure, as was her wont after an argument and theysheathed their blades. Their comradeship seemed to be restored in allits old glory of freedom from petty restraint. He was sure of one thing:that she would let her fingers remain on no other man's sleeve in thisfashion; and he hoped that she would let them remain there a long time.Very foolish he was about her, very foolish for a piece of humanmachinery driven by the dynamo of a human will."I have an impression that your goodness of heart has won," he suggestedgently."Or rather let us say that Feller has won.""Better still, yes, Feller has won!" he agreed. "Oh, it is good, good,good to be here with you, Marta, away from the grind for a littlewhile," he was saying, in the fulness of his anticipation of the hoursthey should have together before he had to go, when they heard the soundof steps. He looked around to see an orderly from the nearest militarywireless station."I was told it was urgent, sir," said the orderly, in excuse for hisintrusion, as he passed a telegram to Lanstron.Immediately Lanstron felt the touch of the paper his features seemed totake on a mask that concealed his thought as he read:"Take night express. Come direct from station to me. Partow."This meant that he would be expected at Partow's office at eight thenext morning. He wrote his answer; the orderly saluted and departed at arapid pace; and then, as a matter of habit of the same kind that makessome men wipe their pens when laying them down, he struck a match andset fire to one corner of the paper, which burned to his fingers' endsbefore he tossed the charred remains away. Marta imagined what he wouldbe like with the havoc of war raging around him--all self-possession andmastery; but actually he was trying to reassure himself that he oughtnot to feel petulant over a holiday cut short."I shall have to go at once," he said. "Marta, if there were to be warvery soon--within a week or two weeks--what would be your attitude aboutFeller's remaining?""To carry out his plan, you mean?""Yes."There was a perceptible pause on her part."Let him stay," she answered. "I shall have time to decide even afterwar begins.""But instantly war begins you must go!" he declared urgently."You forget a precedent," she reminded him. "The Galland women havenever deserted the Galland house!""I know the precedent. But this time the house will be in the thick ofthe fighting.""It has been in the thick of the fighting before," she said, with agesture of impatience."Not this kind of fighting, Marta," he proceeded very soberly. "Otherwars are no criterion for this. I know about the defences of the tangentbecause I helped to plan them. In order to keep the enemy in ignorancewe have made no permanent fortifications. But the engineers and thematerial will be ready, instantly the frontier is closed tointelligence, to construct defences suited to a delaying and punishingaction. Every human being will be subject to martial law; every resourceat military command. Every hill, house, ditch, and tree will be used ascover or protection and will be subject to attack."Not argument this, but the marshalling of facts of the kind in which hedealt as unanswerable evidence, while she listened with a still face anddilating eyes that did not look at him until he had finished. Then asmile came, a faint, drawn smile of irony, and her eyes staring into hiswere chilling and greenish-black in their anger."And the house of a friend meant nothing! It was only fuel for the hellyou devise!" she said, making each word count like shot singing overglare ice."It is only fair to myself to say that when I laid the sheets of my mapbefore Partow I had excluded your house and grounds," he pleaded indefence. "His thumb pounced on that telltale blank space. 'A key-point!So this is your tendon of Achilles, eh?' he said in his blunt fashion.""The blunt fashion is admired by soldiers," she replied withoutsoftening. "Yes, he could play chess with heaps of bodies! He is worsethan Westerling!""No, he would use his own premises, his brother's, his father's if itwould help. Well, then he took a pen and filled in the blank space withthe detail which is to make your house and garden the centre of aninferno.""How Christian!" breathed Marta. "I suppose he loves his grandchildrenand that they are taught the Lord's prayer!""I believe his only pastime is playing with them," admitted Lanstron,stumbling on, trying to be loyal to Partow, to duty, to country, nolonger calm or dispassionate, but demoralized under the lash. "He tellsthem that when they are grown he hopes there will be an end of war.""Worse yet--a hypocrite!""But, Marta, I never knew a man more sincere. He is working to the sameend as you--peace. If the Grays would play with fire he would give themsuch a burning that they will never try again. He would make war toohorrible for practice; fix the frontier forever where by, right itbelongs; make conquest by one civilized nation of another impossiblehereafter. Yes, when it is stalemate, when it is proved that the scienceof modern defence has made the weak so strong that superior numberscannot play the bully, then shall we have peace in practice!""My children's prayer and Partow in the same gallery!" she laughedstonily. "The peace of armament, not of man's superiority to the tigerand the tarantula! And you say it all so calmly. You picture the hell ofyour manufacture as coolly as if it were some fairies' dance!""Should I be enthusiastic? Should I view the prospect with anold-fashioned Hussar's hurrah?" he asked. "The right way is withoutillusions. Let us lose our heads, cry out for glory--and then chaos!""The heedless barbarism of ignorance intoxicated with primitive passionversus calculating, refined, intellectual, comprehending barbarism! Isee no choice," she concluded, rising slowly in the utter weariness ofspirit that calls for the end of an interview."Marta, you will promise not to remain at the house?" he urged."Isn't that my affair?" she asked. "Aren't you willing to leave eventhat to me after all you have been telling how you are to make a redoubtof our lawn, inviting the shells of the enemy into our drawing-room?"What could he say in face of a hostility so resolute and armed with theconviction of its logic? Only call up from the depths the two passionsof his life in an outburst, with all the force of his nature in play."I love this soil, my country's soil, ours by right---and I love you! Iwould be true to both!""Love! What mockery to mention that now!" she cried chokingly. "It'smonstrous!""I--I--" He was making an effort to keep his nerves under control.This time the stiffening elbow failed. With a lurching abruptness heswung his right hand around and seized the wrist of that trembling,injured hand that would not be still. She could not fail to notice themovement, and the sight was a magic that struck anger out of her."Lanny, I am hurting you!" she cried miserably."A little," he said, will finally dominant over its servant, and he wassmiling as when, half stunned and in agony--and ashamed of the fact--hehad risen from the debris of cloth and twisted braces. "It's allright," he concluded.She threw back her arms, her head raised, with a certain abandon as ifshe would bare her heart."Lanny, there have been moments when I would have liked to fly to yourarms. There have been moments when I have had the call that comes toevery woman in answer to a desire. Yet I was not ready. When I really goit must be in a flame, in answer to your flame!""You mean--I--."But if the flame were about to burst forth she smothered it in thespark."And all this has upset me," she went on incoherently. "We've both beencruel without meaning to be, and we're in the shadow of a nightmare; andnext time you come perhaps all the war talk will be over and--oh, thisis enough for to-day!"She turned quickly in veritable flight and hurried toward the house. Atthe bend of the path she wheeled and stood facing him, a hand tossed upand opening and closing as if she had caught a shaft of sunshine and letit go again. Thus she would wave to him from the veranda as he came upthe terrace steps. Indelible to him this picture, radiant of aversatile, impressionable vitality, of capacities yet unsounded, of adownright sincerity of impulses, faiths, and ideals which might buffether this way and that over a strange course. A woman unafraid ofdestiny; a woman too objective yet to know herself!"If it ever comes," she called, "I'll let you know! I'll fly to you in achariot of fire bearing my flame--I am that bold, that brazen, thatreckless! For I am not an old maid yet. They've moved the age limit upto thirty. But you can't drill love into me as you drill discipline intoarmies--no, no more than I can argue peace into armies!"For a while, motionless, Lanstron watched the point where she haddisappeared."If I had only been a bridge-builder or an engine-driver," he thought;"anything except this beastly--"But he was wool-gathering again. He pulled himself together and startedat a rapid pace for the tower, where he found Feller sitting by thetable, one leg over the other easily, engaged in the prosaic business ofsewing a button on his blouse. Lanstron rapped; no answer. He beat atattoo on the casing; no answer."Gustave!" he called; no answer.Now he entered and touched Feller's shoulder."Hello, Lanny!" exclaimed Feller, rising and setting a chair andbreaking into a stream of talk. "That's the way they all have to do whenthey want to attract my attention. I heard your voice and MissGalland's--having an argument in the garden, I should say. Then I heardyour step. Since I became deaf my sense of hearing has really grownkeener, just as the blind develop a keener sense of feeling. Eh? eh?" Hecupped his hand over his ear in the unctuous enjoyment of his gift ofacting. "Yes, Colonel Lanstron, would you like to know what a perfecttriumph we're going to pull off in irises next season--but, Lanny, youseem in a hurry!""Gustave, I am ordered to headquarters by the night express and I cameto tell you that I think it means war.""War! war!" Feller shouted. "Ye gods and little fishes!" In riotous gleehe seized a chair and flung it across the room. "Ye salty, whiskery godsand ye shiny-eyed little fishes! War, do you hear that, you plebeiantrousers of the deaf gardener? War!" Flinging the trousers after thechair, he executed a few steps. When he had thus tempered his elation,he grasped Lanstron's arm and, looking into his eyes with feverishresolution and hope, said: "Oh, don't fear! I'll pull it off. And then Ishall have paid back--yes, paid back! I shall be a man who can look menin the face again. I need not slink to the other side of the street whenI see an old friend coming for fear that he will recognize me. Yes, Icould even dare to love a woman of my own world! And--and perhaps theuniform and the guns once more!""You may be sure of that. Partow cannot refuse," said Lanstron, deeplyaffected. After a pause he added: "But I must tell you, Gustave, thatMiss Galland, though she is willing that you remain as a gardener, hasnot yet consented to our plan. She will make no decision until warcomes. Perhaps she will refuse. It is only fair that you should knowthis."For an instant Feller was downcast; then confidence returned at highpitch."Trust me!" he said. "I shall persuade her!""I hope you can. It is a chance that might turn the scales of victory--achance that hangs in my mind stubbornly, as if there were some fate init. Luck, old boy!""Luck to you, Lanny! Luck and promotion!"They threw their arms about each other in a vigorous embrace."And you will keep watch that Mrs. Galland and Marta are in no danger?""Trust me for that, too!""Then, good-by till I hear from you over the 'phone or I return to seeyou after the crisis is over!" concluded Lanstron as he hurried away.XIIIBREAKING A PAPER-KNIFEHedworth Westerling would have said twenty to one if he had been askedthe odds against war when he was parting from Marta Galland in the hotelreception-room. Before he reached home he would have changed them to tento one. A scare bulletin about the Bodlapoo affair compelling attentionas his car halted to let the traffic of a cross street pass, he bought anewspaper thrust in at the car window that contained the answer of thegovernment of the Browns to a despatch of the Grays about the disputethat had arisen in the distant African jungle. This he had already readtwo days previously, by courtesy of the premier. It was moderate intone, as became a power that had three million soldiers against itsopponent's five; nevertheless, it firmly pointed out that the territoryof the Browns had been overtly invaded, on the pretext of securing adeserter who had escaped across the line, by Gray colonial troops whohad raised the Gray flag in place of the Brown flag and remaineddefiantly in occupation of the outpost they had taken.As yet, the Browns had not attempted to repel the aggressor by arms forfear of complications, but were relying on the Gray government to ordera withdrawal of the Gray force and the repudiation of a commander whohad been guilty of so grave an international affront. The surprising andilluminating thing to Westerling was the inspired statement to the pressfrom the Gray Foreign Office, adroitly appealing to Gray chauvinism andjustifying the "intrepidity" of the Gray commander in response toso-called "pin-pricking" exasperations.At the door of his apartment, Francois, his valet and factotum, gaveWesterling a letter."Important, sir," said Francois.Westerling knew by a glance that it was, for it was addressed and marked"Personal" in the premier's own handwriting. A conference for ten thatevening was requested in a manner that left no doubt of its urgency."Let me see, do I dine at the Countess Zalinski's to-night?" askedWesterling. Both Francois and his personal aide kept a list of hisappointments."Not to-night, sir. To-night you--" said Francois."Good!" thought Westerling. "No excuses will be necessary to Marie inorder to be at the premier's by ten."Curiosity made him a little ahead of time, but he found the premierawaiting him in his study, free from interruption or eavesdropping.In the shadow of the table lamp the old premier looked his years. Hisdefinite features were easy material for the caricaturist, who does notdeal in halftones. A near view of them was not attractive. They had thelargeness which impresses the gallery from the floor of a parliamentarychamber, where delicate lines of sensibility and character lack thequality which the actor supplies with his make-up. As is often the casewith elderly statesmen, his face seemed like that of the crowd doneboldly as a single face, while his shrewd eyes in a bed of crow's-feet,when they lighted to their purpose in confidence, expressed hisunderstanding of the crowd and its thoughts and how it may be led.From youth he had been in politics, ever a bold figure and a daringplayer, but now beginning to feel the pressure of younger men's elbows.Fonder even of power, which had become a habit, than in his twenties, hesaw it slipping from his grasp at an age when the 'downfall of hisgovernment meant that he should never hold the reins again. He had beencalled an ambitious demagogue and a makeshift opportunist by hisenemies, but the crowd liked him for his ready strategy, his genius forappealing phrases, and for the gambler's virtue which hitherto had madehim a good loser."You saw our _communique_ to-night that went with the publication of theBrowns' despatch?" he remarked."Yes, and I was glad that I had been careful to send a spiritedcommander to that region," Westerling replied."So you guess my intention, I see." The premier smiled. He picked up along, thin ivory paper-knife and softly patted the palm of his hand withit. "We have had many discussions, you and I, Westerling," he said. "Butto-night I'm going to ask categorical questions. They may take us overold ground, but they are the questions of the nation to the army.""Certainly!" Westerling replied in his ready, confident manner."We hear a great deal about the precision and power of modern arms asfavoring the defensive," said the premier. "I have read somewhere thatit will enable the Browns to hold us back, despite our advantage ofnumbers. Also, that they can completely man every part of their frontierand that their ability to move their reserves rapidly, thanks to modernfacilities, makes a powerful flanking attack in surprise out of thequestion.""Some half-truths in that," answered Westerling. "One axiom, that musthold good through all time, is that the aggressive which keeps at italways wins. We take the aggressive. In the space where Napoleondeployed a division, we deploy a battalion to-day. The precision andpower of modern arms require this. With such immense forces andpresent-day tactics, the line of battle will practically cover thelength of the frontier. Along their range the Browns have a series offortresses commanding natural openings for our attack. These are almostimpregnable. But there are pregnable points between them. Here, ourmethod will be the same that the Japanese followed and that they learnedfrom European armies. We shall concentrate in masses and throw in waveafter wave of attack until we have gained the positions we desire. Oncewe have a tenable foothold on the crest of the range the Brown army mustfall back and the rest will be a matter of skilful pursuit."The premier, as he listened, rolled the paper-knife over and over,regarding its polished sides, which were like Westerling's manner offacile statement of a programme certain of fulfilment."We can win, then? We can go to their capital, or far enough to force agreat indemnity, the annexation of one of their provinces, perhaps, andthe taking over of their African colonies, which we can develop so muchbetter than they?"Westerling took care to show none of the eagerness which had set hispulses humming."To their capital!" he declared decisively. "Nothing less. For that Ihave planned.""And the cost in lives?""Five or six hundred thousand casualties, which means about a hundredthousand killed.""Ghastly! The population of a good-sized city!" exclaimed the premier."A small percentage out of five million soldiers; a smaller out ofeighty million population," Westerling returned."And how long do you think the war would last? How long the strain onour finances, the suspense to the markets?""About a month. We shall go swiftly. The completeness of modernpreparation must make a war of to-day brief between two great powers. Wemust win with a rush, giving the defenders no breathing spell, pouringmasses after masses upon the critical positions.""How long will it take to mobilize?""Less than a week after the railroads are put entirely at our service,with three preceding days of scattered movements," answered Westerling."Deliberate mobilizations are all right for a diplomatic threat thatcreates a furore in the newspapers and a depression in the stock-market,but which is not to be carried out. When you mean war, all speed and thewar fever at white heat.""Therefore, there would be little time for the public to hoard money orto provoke a panic. The government, knowing precisely what was beforeit, could take severe preventive measures.""But I may say that we should strike before mobilization is complete. Aday will be required to take the La Tir tangent and other outlyingpositions. The 128th and other regiments who will do this work arealready at the front. They were chosen because they came from distantprovinces and we can count on their patriotic fervor for brilliant andspeedy action, with resulting general enthusiasm for the whole army,which will be up in time for the assault on the Browns' permanentdefences.""You would have made a good politician, Westerling," the premierremarked, with a twitching uplift of the brows and a knowing gleam inhis shrewd old eyes."Thank you," replied Westerling, appearing flattered, though secretlyannoyed that any one should think that a chief of staff could care tochange places with any man in the world. Governments might come and go,but the army was the rock in the midst of the play of minor forces, theultimate head of order and power. "A man who is able to lead in anythingmust be something of a politician," he said suavely."Very true, indeed. Perhaps I had that partly in mind in making youvice-chief of staff," responded the premier enjoyably. "You spoke of thewar fever at white heat," he went on, returning to his muttons, "and ofthe army's enthusiasm for its work. There we come to the kernel in thenut, eh?" he asked, as he prodded the paper-knife into the palm of hishand."Drill, organization, discipline, and centralized authority and ahigh-spirited aristocracy of officers are most important," saidWesterling. "But after that come morale and the psychology of thesoldier." There he shrugged slightly, in indication of a resentment atthe handicap of human nature in his work. "The business of a soldier isto risk death in the way he is told. The keener he is for his cause thebetter. An ideal soldier is he who does not think for himself, butobserves every detail of training and will not stop until halted byorders or a bullet. Therefore we want the army hot with desire. Theofficers of a company cannot force their men forward. Withoutinsubordination or mutiny the men may stop from lack of interest afteronly a very small percentage of loss.""Lack of interest!" mused the premier. But Westerling, preoccupied withthe literal exposition of his subject, did not catch the flash ofpassing satire before the premier, his features growing hard andchallenging, spoke in another strain: "Then it all goes back to thepublic--to that enormous body of humanity out there!" He swung thepaper-knife around with outstretched arm toward the walls of the room."To public opinion--as does everything else in this age--to the people!I have seen them pressing close, about to remove me from power, and Ihave started a diversion which made them forget the object of theirdispleasure. I have thought them won one day, and the next I realizedthat they were going against me. Thank Heaven for the brevity of theirmemory, or we leaders would be hung high by our own inconsistencies! Hewho leads sees which way they will go, rushes to the head of theprocession, discovers them to themselves and turns a corner and theyfollow, thinking that they are going straight to the point. But alwaysthey are there, never older, never younger, never tiring--there, smilingor scowling or forgetting all about you, only to have a sudden fiercereminder overnight to surprise you--and our masters, yours and mine! Forno man can stand against them when they say no or yes.""You know the keys to play on, though," remarked Westerling with acomplimentary smile. "No one knows quite so well.""I ought to," replied the premier. "That was the purpose of thesemi-official _communique_ about Bodlapoo, which, of course, we canrepudiate later, if need be. I saw that the brilliant forced march ofour commander had excited popular enthusiasm. It does not matter if hewere in the wrong. Will race feeling rise to the pitch of war from thistouchstone with the proper urging? Of course, the impulse must come fromthe people themselves. We must seem to resist it, the better to arouseit." He bent the paper-knife into a bow with fingers that were rigid."Times are hard, factions are bitter, our cabinet is in danger, witheconomic and political chaos from overpopulation in sight," hecontinued. "We hunger for land, for fresh opportunities for development.An outburst of patriotism, concentrating every thought of the nation onwar!--is that the way out?"Westerling had only answered questions so far. Here was his cue forargument."We were never so ready," he said. "War must come some time. We shouldchoose the moment, not leave it to chance. The nation needs war as astimulant, as a corrective, as a physician. We grow stale; we think ofour domestic troubles. The old racial passions are weakening and withthem our virility. Victory will make room for millions in the place ofthe thousands who fall. The indemnity will bring prosperity. Because wehave had no war, because the long peace has been abnormal, is the reasonyou have all this agitation and all these strikes. They will be at anend. Those who are fit to rule will be in power.""And you are sure--sure we can win?" the premier asked with a long,tense look at Westerling, who was steady under the scrutiny."Absolutely!" he answered. "Five millions against three! It'smathematics, or our courage and skill are not equal to theirsAbsolutely! We have the power, why not use it? We do not live in a dreamage!"The premier sank deeper in his chair. He was silent, thinking. He whohad carried off so many great coups with rare ease was on the thresholdof one that made them all seem petty. He had heard random talk that someof the officers of the staff considered Westerling to be lath painted tolook like steel. There was a reported remark by Turcas, his assistant,implying that the ability to achieve a position did not mean the abilityto fill it. Jealousy, no doubt; the jealousy of rivals! The premierhimself was used to having members of his own cabinet ever on the watchfor the vulnerable spot in his back, which he had never allowed them tofind. Yet, there was the case of Louis Napoleon. He had the ability toachieve a position; he had been the lath painted to look like steel. Hehad all the externals which the layman associates with victory until hewent to the supreme test, which ripped him into slivers of rotten wood.The little Napoleon had been one of the premier's favorite bugabooexamples of stage realism tried out in real life. But it was ridiculousto compare him with the stalwart figure sitting across the table, whohad spoken the language of materialism without illusion.Westerling's ambition on edge communicated itself to the premier, whosesoft hands, long since divorced from any labor except officialhand-shaking and the exercise of authority, were bending the paper-knifewith unconscious vigor."All the achievements of power form only a dull background for victoryin war to a people's imagination!" he exclaimed. "Your name and mine tosymbolize an age! What power for us! What power for the nation!"From a sudden, unwitting exertion of his strength the knife which hadbeen the recipient of his emotions snapped in two. Rather carefully helaid the pieces on the table before he rose and turned to Westerling,his decision made."If the people respond with the war fever, then it is war!" he said. "Itake you at your word that you will win!"Westerling's chair creaked with the tense drawing of his muscles in theimpulse of delight. He had gained the great purpose; but there wasanother and vital one on his programme."A condition!" he announced. "From the moment war begins the army ismaster of all intelligence, all communication, all resources. Everythingwe require goes into the crucible!""And the press--the mischievous, greedy, but very useful press?" askedthe premier."It also shall serve; also obey. No lists of killed and wounded shall begiven out until I am ready. The public must know nothing except what Ichoose to tell. I act for the people and the nation.""That is agreed," said the premier. "For these terrible weeks everynerve and muscle of the nation is at your service to win for the nation.In three or four days I shall know if the public rises to the call. Ifnot--" He shook his head."While all the information given out is provocative to our people, youwill declare your hope that war may be averted," Westerling continued."This will screen our purpose. Finally, on top of public enthusiasm willcome the word that the Browns have fired the first shot--as they mustwhen we cross the frontier--that they have been killing our soldiers.This will make the racial spirit of every man respond. Having decidedfor war, every plan is worthy that helps to victory.""It seems fiendish!" exclaimed the premier in answer to a thoughteddying in the powerful current of his brain. "Fiendish withcalculation, but merciful, as you say.""A fast, terrific campaign! A ready machine taking the road!"Westerling declared. "Less suffering than if we went to war carelesslyfor a long campaign--than if we allowed sentiment to interfere withintellect.""I like your energy, your will!" said the premier admiringly. "And aboutthe declaration of war? We shall time that to your purpose.""Declarations of war before striking, by nations taking the aggressive,are a disadvantage," Westerling explained. "They are going out ofpractice. Witness the examples of Japan against Russia and the Balkanallies against Turkey. In these days declarations are not necessary as awarning of what is going to happen. They belong to the etiquette offencers.""Yes, exactly. The declaration of war and the ambassador's passportswill be prepared and the wire that fighting has begun will releasethem," agreed the premier. "Another thing," he added, "there is thequestion of the opinion of the world as represented by The Hague and thepeace societies. This government has always expressed sympathy withtheir ideas.""Naturally," Westerling put in. "We shall use hand-grenades, explosivesfrom dirigibles, every known power of destruction. So will the Browns,you may be sure. In such a cataclysm we shall have no time for niceties.The peace societies will have hardly formulated their protests to TheHague before the war is over. Our answer will be our victory--the powerthat goes with the prestige of unconquerable force. Victory, nothing butvictory counts!"Westerling was speaking by the book, expressing the ideas that he hadagain and again rehearsed as a part of the preparation, the eternalpreparation for the sudden emergency of war, which is the duty of thestaff. So letter-perfect was he in his lines that a layman might havescouted his realization of the enormousness of his responsibility."Yet if we did lose! If when I had given you all you ask your planswent wrong! If our army were broken to pieces on the frontier and thenthe nation, kept in ignorance of events, learned the truth"--the premierenunciated slowly and pointedly while he locked glances withWesterling--"that is the end for us both. You would hardly want toreturn to the capital to face public wrath!""We must win though we lose a million men!" he answered. "I stake mylife!" he cried hoarsely, striking his fist on the table."You stake your life!" repeated the premier with slow emphasis."Bravado hardly becomes a chief of staff. His place is not under fire,"Westerling explained. "However, I mean to make my headquarters at LaTir, immediately we have taken it, for the effect of having the leaderof the army promptly established on conquered territory.""I understand that," replied the premier. "But still you stake yourlife? That is the greatest thing a man has to stake. You stake your lifeon victory?" he demanded fiercely."I do!" said Westerling. "Yes, my life. We cannot fail!""Then it will be war, if the people want it!" said the premier. "I shallnot resist their desire!" he added in his official manner, at peace withhis conscience.XIVIN PARTOW'S OFFICEPartow was a great brain set on an enormous body. Partow's eyes had thefire of youth at sixty-five, but the pendulous flesh of his cheeks waspasty. Partow was picturesque; he was a personality with a dome foreheadsweeping back nobly to scattered and contentious, short gray hairs.Jealousy and faction had endeavored for years to remove him from hisposition at the head of the army on account of age. New governmentsdecided as they came in that he must go, and they went out with himstill in the saddle. He worked fourteen hours a day, took no holidaysand little exercise, violated the rules of health, and never appeared atgold-braid functions. The business of official display, as he saidpungently, he delegated to that specialist, his handsome vice-chief ofstaff.He had set up no silhouette of a charging soldier peppered with bulletmarks on the wall of his office, for this was a picture that he carriedin his mind. Pertinent to his own taste, under the glance of theportraits of the old heroes, was a little statuette of a harvestercalled Toil on his desk."That's the fellow we're defending," he would say, becoming almostrhapsodical. "I like to think back to him. He's the infantry before youput him in uniform."Let officers apply themselves with conspicuous energy and they heardfrom a genial Partow; let officers only keep step and free of courtsmartial, and they heard from a merciless taskmaster. Resign, please, ifyou like a leisurely life, he told the idlers; and he had a way ofmaking them so uncomfortable that they would take the advice. Among thesons of rest who had retired to mourn over the world going to the devilhe was referred to as not being a gentleman, which amused him; some saidthat he was crazy, which amused him even more.Peculiarly human, peculiarly dictatorial, dynamic, and inscrutable wasPartow, who never asked any one under him to work harder than himself.Lanstron appeared in the presence of Jove shortly after eight o'clockthe next morning after he left La Tir. Jove rolled his big head on hisshort neck in a nod and said:"Late!""The train was late, sir!""And you have disobeyed orders!" grumbled Partow."Disobeyed orders? How, sir?""And you look me in the eye as you always do! You think that excusesyou, perhaps?""No, sir. But I am bound to ask what orders?""Well, not orders, but my instructions; at least, my desire. Flyingyourself--directing a manoeuvre--racing the Grays!""You heard about it?""I hear about everything! I have told you not to risk your life. Livesare assets of various kinds in an army. It is my business to determinethe relative value of those of my subordinates. You are not to sacrificeyours.""I haven't yet, sir. I have it with me this morning," Lanstron replied,"and I have some news about our thousandth chance.""Hm-m! What is it?" asked Partow. When Lanstron had told the story,Partow worked his lips in a way he had if he were struck by a passingreflection which might or might not have a connection with the subjectin hand. "Strange about her when you consider who her parents were!" hesaid. "But you never know. His son," nodding to Toil, "might be a greatpainter or a snob. Miss Galland has an idea--that's something--andcharacter and a brain making arrows so fast that she shoots them intothe blue just for mental relief. She's quite a woman. If I were thirty,and single, I believe I'd fall in love with her. But don't you dare tellMrs. Partow. I want the fun of telling her myself. Hm-m! Why don't yousit down, young man?"Partow turned his thick, white palm toward a chair, and his smile, nowclearly showing that he was not deeply offended with Lanstron'sinsubordination, had a singular charm. The smile vanished as Lanstronseated himself and in its place came such a look as friend Toil had seenon very rare occasions."The way that the Grays gave out our despatch convinces me of theirintentions," Partow said. "Their people are rising to it and ours arerising in answer. The Grays have been transferring regiments fromdistant provinces to their frontier because they will fight better in aninvasion. We are transferring home regiments to our frontier becausethey will fight for their own property. By Thursday you will find thatopen mobilization on both sides has begun.""My department is ready," said Lanstron, "all except your decision aboutpress censorship.""A troublesome point," responded Partow. "I have procrastinated becausetwo definite plans were fully worked out. It is a matter of choicebetween them: either publicity or complete secrecy. You know I am nobeliever in riding two horses at once. My mind is about made up; but letme hear your side again. Sometimes I get conviction by probing anothermans."Lanstron was at his best, for his own conviction was intense."Of course they will go in for secrecy; but our case is different," hebegan.Partow settled himself to listen with the gift of the organizer whodraws from his informant the brevity of essentials."I should take the people into our confidence," Lanstron proceeded. "Ishould make them feel that we were one family fighting for all we holddear against the invader. If our losses are heavy, if we have a setback,then the inspiration of the heroism of those who have fallen and thedanger of their own homes feeling the foot of the invader next willimpel the living to greater sacrifices. For the Grays are in the wrong.The moral and the legal right is with us.""And the duty of men like you and me, chosen for the purpose," saidPartow, "is worthily to direct the courage that goes with moral right.The overt act of war must come from them by violating our frontier, notin the African jungle but here. Even when the burglar fingers thewindow-sash we shall not fire--no, not until he enters our house. Whenhe does, you would have a message go out to our people that will setthem quivering with indignation?""Yes, and I would let the names of our soldiers who fall first be knownand how they fell, their backs to their frontier homes and their facesto the foe.""Our very liberality in giving news will help us to cover the militarysecrets which we desire to preserve," Partow said, with slow emphasis."We shall hold back what we please, confident of the people's trust.Good policy that, yes! But enough! Your orders are ready, in detail, Ibelieve. You have nothing to add?""No, sir, nothing; at least, not until war begins.""Very well. We shall have the orders issued at the proper moment,"concluded Partow. "And Westerling is going to find," he proceeded aftera thoughtful pause, "that a man is readier to die fighting to hold hisown threshold than fighting to take another man's. War is not yet solelyan affair of machinery and numbers. The human element is stilluppermost. I know something, perhaps, that Westerling does not know. Ihave had an experience that he has not had and that few active officersof either army have had--I have been under fire."His eyes flashed with the memory of his charge, and visions of the daywhen Grandfather Fragini was a _beau sabreur_ and Marta Galland's fathertoasted quick death and speedy promotion seemed to cluster around him."Experience plus an old man's honest effort for a mind open to allsuggestion and improvements!" he exclaimed. "An open mind that let youhave your way in equipping more dirigibles and planes than Westerlingguesses we have, eh? And, perhaps, a few more guns! And you, too, havebeen under fire," he added. "Give me your hand--no, not that one, notthe one you shake hands with--the one wounded in action!"Partow enclosed the stiffened fingers in his own with something of thecaress which an old bear that is in very good humor might give to apromising cub."I have planned, planned, planned for this time," he said. "I haveplayed politics with statesmen to hold my place in the belief that I wasthe man for the work which I have done. The world shall soon know, asthe elements of it go into the crucible test, whether it is well done ornot. I want to live to see the day when the last charge made against ourtrenches is beaten back. Then they may throw this old body onto therubbish heap as soon as they please--it is a fat, unwieldy behemoth ofan old body!""No, no, it isn't!" Lanstron objected hotly. He was seeing only whatmost people saw after talking with Partow for a few minutes, his fine,intelligent eyes and beautiful forehead."All that I wanted of the body was to feed my brain," Partow continued,heedless of the interruption. "I have watched my mind as a navigatorwatches a barometer. I have been ready at the first sign that it waslosing its grip to give up. Yet I have felt that my body would go onfeeding my brain and that to the last moment of consciousness, whensuddenly the body collapses, I should have self-possession and energy ofmind. Under the coming strain the shock may come, as a cord snaps. Atthat instant my successor will take up my work where I leave it off.""Goerwitz, you mean." Lanstron referred in unmistakable apprehension tothe vice-chief of staff, whom all the army knew had no real ability ordecision underneath his pleasing, confident exterior."No, not Goerwitz," said Partow, with a shrug. "Some one who will go onwith the weaving, not by knotting threads but with the same threads in asmooth fabric." Lanstron felt an increased pressure of the hand, acommunicated tingling to his nerves. "I have chosen him. The old fogywho has aimed to join experience to youth chooses youth. You took yourmedicine without grumbling in the disagreeable but vitally importantposition of chief of intelligence. Now you--there, don't tremble withstage fright!" For Lanstron's hand was quivering in Partow's grasp,while his face was that of a man stunned."But Goerwitz--what will he say?" he gasped."Goerwitz goes to a division in reserve.""And the army! The government! What will they say at such--such a jumpfor a colonel?""The government leaves all to me from the day war begins. I shalltransfer others than Goerwitz--others who have had influence with thepremier which it was not wise to deny in time of peace.""Very well, sir," answered Lanstron, with a subordinate's automaticconsent to a superior's orders. His words sounded ridiculous in view ofhis feelings, yet they were more expressive than any florid speech."You are to be at the right hand of this old body," continued Partow."You are to go with me to the front; to sleep in the room next to mine;to be always at my side, and, finally, you are to promise that if everthe old body fails in its duty to the mind, if ever you see that I amnot standing up to the strain, you are to say so to me and I give you myword that I shall let you take charge."Lanstron was too stunned to speak for a moment. The arrangement seemed ahideous joke: a refinement of cruelty inconceivable. It was expectinghim to tell Atlas that he was old and to take the weight of the worldoff the giant's shoulders."Have you lost your patriotism?" demanded Partow. "Are you afraid?Afraid to tell me the truth? Afraid of duty? Afraid in your youth of theburden that I bear in age?"His fingers closed in on Lanstron's with such force that the grip waspainful."Promise!" he commanded."I promise!" Lanstron said with a throb."That's it' That's the way! That's the kind of soldier I like," Partowdeclared with change of tone, and he rose from his chair with a springthat was a delight to Lanstron in its proof of the physical vigor sostoutly denied. "We have a lot to say to each other to-day," he added;"but first I am going to show you the whole bag of tricks."His arm crooked in Lanstron's, they went along the main corridor of thestaff office hung with portraits of generals who had beaten or heldtheir own with the Grays. Passing through a door for which Partow heldthe key, they were in a dim, narrow passage with bare walls, lighted bytwo small gas flames. At the end was another, a heavy steel door, of thesort associated with the protection of bonds and securities, but in thiscase for the security of a nation's defence. Partow turned the knob ofthe combination back and forth and with the smooth swing of a greatweight on noiseless hinges the door opened and they entered a vaulthaving a single chair and a small table in the centre and lined bysections of numbered pigeonholes, each with a combination lock At thebase of one section was a small safe. It was not the first time thatLanstron had been in this vault. He had the combination of two of thesections of pigeonholes, aerostatics and intelligence. The rest belongedto other divisions."The safe is my own, as you know. No one opens it; no one knows what isin it but me," said Partow, taking from it an envelope and a manuscript,which he laid on the table. "There you have all that, is in mybrain--the whole plan. The envelope contains the combinations of all thepigeonholes, if you wish to look up any details.""Thank you!" Lanstron half whispered. It was all he could think of tosay."And you will find that there is more than you thought, perhaps: thereason why I have fought hard to remain chief of staff; why--" Partowcontinued in a voice that had the sepulchral uncanniness of a threatlong nursed now breaking free of the bondage of years within thesound-proof walls. "But--" he broke off suddenly as if he distrustedeven the security of the vault. "Yes, it is all there--my life's work,my dream, my ambition, my plan!"Lanstron heard the lock slide in the door as Partow went out and he wasalone with the army's secrets. As he read Partow's firm handwriting,many parts fell together, many moves on a chess-board grew clear. Hisbreath came faster, he bent closer over the table, he turned back pagesto go over them again. Every sentence dropped home in his mind like abolt in a socket.When he had finished the manuscript the trance of his thoughts held himin the same attitude. "Five millions to our three!" a voice keptrepeating to him. "In face of that this dream!" another voice wassaying. Had it been right to intrust such responsibility to one man ofPartow's age and right to transfer that responsibility to himself in anemergency? Yet how clear the plan in the confidence of its wisdom!Unconscious of the passage of time, he did not hear the door open orrealize Partow's presence until he felt Partow's hand on his shoulder."I see that you didn't look into any of the pigeonholes," the chief ofstaff observed.Lanstron pressed his finger-tips on the manuscript significantly."No. It is all there!""The thing being to carry it out!" said Partow. "God with us!" he addeddevoutly.XVCLOSE TO THE WHITE POSTSHave you forgotten Hugo Mallin, humorist of Company B of the 128thRegiment of the Grays, whom we left in their barracks under orders forSouth La Tir on the afternoon that Westerling called on Marta Galland?Have you forgotten Eugene Aronson, the farmer's son, and Jacob Pilzer,the butcher's son, and pasty-faced little Peterkin, the valet's son, andthe judge's son, and the other privates of the group that surroundedHugo Mallin as he aired heresies that set them laughing?Through the press, an unconscious instrument of his purpose, the astutepremier has inoculated them with the virus of militant patriotism. Dayby day the crisis has become more acute; day by day the war fever hasrisen in their veins. Big Eugene Aronson believes everything he reads;his country can do no wrong. Jacob Pilzer is most bellicose; he chafesat inaction, while they all suffer the discomforts of an empty factorybuilding in the rear of South La Tir which has become a temporarybarracks.On Tuesday they hear of crowds around the Foreign Office demanding war,on Wednesday of panics on the stock exchanges, on Thursday ofmobilization actually begun and a rigid press censorship established,and on Friday other regiments and guns and horses are detraining anddeparting right and left. Hurrying officers know nothing except whatthey have been told to do."When do we start? What are we waiting for?" demanded Pilzer. "I want tobe in the thick of the fighting and not trailing along with thereserves!" If any one in the 128th wins the bronze cross he means thatit shall be he and not Eugene Aronson."Never mind, you'll have a chance. There'll be war enough to go around,I am sure!" said Hugo Mallin."More than you'll want!" Pilzer shot back, thrusting out his jaw."I'm sure of that!" answered Hugo, the mask of his face drawn inquizzical solemnity. "I don't want any at all."This brought a tremendous laugh. All the laughs had been tremendoussince mobilization had begun in earnest, and the atmosphere was like thesuspense before a thunder-storm breaks.On Saturday evening the 128th was mustered in field accoutrements and afull supply of cartridges. In the darkness the first battalion marchedout at right angles to the main road that ran through La Tir and SouthLa Tir. At length Company B, deployed in line of skirmishers, lay downto sleep on its arms."We wait here for the word," Fracasse, the captain, whispered to hissenior lieutenant. "If it comes, our objective is the house and the oldcastle on the hill above the town."The tower of the church showed dimly when a pale moon broke through acloud. By its light Hugo saw on his right Eugene's big features andmassive shoulders and on his left the pinched and characterless featuresof Peterkin. A few yards ahead was a white stone post."That's their side over there!" whispered the banker's son, who was nextto Peterkin."When we cross war begins," said the manufacturer's son."I wonder if they are expecting us!" said the judge's son a triflehuskily, in an attempt at humor, though he was not given to humor."Just waiting to throw bouquets!" whispered the laborer's son. He, too,was not given to humor and he, too, spoke a trifle huskily."And we'll fix bayonets when we start and they will run at the sight ofour steel!" said Eugene Aronson. He and Hugo alone, not exceptingPilzer, the butcher's son, spoke in their natural voices. The otherswere trying to make their voices sound natural, while Pilzer's voice haddeveloped a certain ferocity, and the liver patch on his cheek twitchedmore frequently. "Why, Company B is in front! We have the post of honor,and maybe our company will win the most glory of any in the regiment!"Eugene added. "Oh, we'll beat them! The bullet is not made that will getme!""Your service will be over in time for you to help with the springplanting, Eugene," whispered Hugo, who was apparently preoccupied withmany detached thoughts."And you to be at home sucking lollipops!" Pilzer growled to Hugo."That would be better than murdering my fellowman to get his property,"Hugo answered, so soberly that it did not seem to his comrades that hewas joking this time. Pilzer's snarling exclamation of "White feather!"came in the midst of a chorus of indignation.Captain Fracasse, who had heard only the disturbance without knowing thecause, interfered in a low, sharp tone:"Silence! As I have told you before, silence! We don't want them to knowthat we are here. Go to sleep! You may get no rest to-morrow night!"But little Peterkin, the question in his mind breaking free of his lips,unwittingly asked:"Shall--shall we fight in the morning?""I don't know. Nobody knows!" answered Fracasse. "We wait on orders,ready to do our duty. There may be no war. Don't let me hear anotherpeep from you!"Now all closed their eyes. In front of them was vast silence whichseemed to stretch from end to end of the frontier, while to the rear wasthe rumble of switching railway trains and the rumble of provisiontrains and artillery on the roads, and in the distance on the plain theheadlight of a locomotive cut a swath in the black night. But thebreathing of most of the men was not that of slumber, though Eugene andPilzer slept soundly. Hours passed. Occasional restless movements toldof efforts to force sleep by changing position."It's the waiting that's sickening!" exploded the manufacturer's sonunder his breath, desperately."So I say. I'd like to be at it and done with the suspense!" said thedoctor's son."They say if you are shot through the head you don't know what killedyou, it's so quick. Think of that!" exclaimed Peterkin, huddling closerto Hugo and shivering."Yes, very merciful," Hugo whispered, patting Peterkin's arm."Sh-h-h! Silence, I tell you!" commanded Fracasse crossly. He wasfalling into a half doze at last.XVIDELLARME'S MEN GET A MASCOTAnd have you forgotten gigantic Private Stransky, born to the red, withthe hedgerows of the world his home? Have you forgotten Tom Fragini andthe sergeant and the others of Captain Dellarme's men of the 53d of theBrowns, whom we left marching along the road to La Tir, with oldGrandfather Fragini, veteran of the Hussars, in his faded uniform coatwith his medal on his breast, keeping step, hep-hep-hep?Grandfather Fragini has attached himself to the regiment while it restsin barracks a few hours' march from the frontier. He is accepted as themascot of the company in which both his grandson and Stransky areserving. But he never speaks to Stransky and refers to him in the thirdperson as "that traitor," which makes Stransky grin sardonically. Eachday's developments bring more color to his cheeks; his rheumatic oldlegs are limbering with the elixir of rising patriotism, though Tom andhis comrades are singularly without enthusiasm, according tograndfather's idea. They lead the newspapers gluttonously and theywelcome each item that promises a peaceful solution of the crisis.Inwardly, Grandfather Fragini is worried about the state of the army. Ishis race becoming decadent? Or, as he puts it, are the youngergeneration without sand in their craws? When he came into the barracksyard swinging his cap aloft and shouting the news that mobilization hadbegun there was not even a cheer."I suppose it means war," said Tom Fragini with a soberness that was inkeeping with the grave faces of his fellows. Stransky sitting at oneside by himself smiled."Well, you'd think it was a funeral!" grandfather exclaimed in disgust."There will be lots of funerals!" said Tom."I s'pose there will be; but if you get that in your mind how can youfight?" grandfather demanded. "Why, if any Hussar had spoken of funeralswe'd called him white-livered, that's what we would! We cheered till wewas hoarse; we danced and hugged one another; we rattled our sabres inour scabbards; we sang rip-roaring death-or-glory songs. When you'regoing to war you want to sing and shout. That's the way to keep yourspirits up.""Let's sing 'Ring-around-the-rosy' to please the old gentleman. Comeon!" suggested Stransky."I don't see that we are after either death or glory," said Tom. "We aregoing to do our duty."The impulse of enthusiasm seemed equally lacking in the others. Stranskygrinned and his deep-set eyes turned inward with a squint of knowingsatisfaction at the bony bridge of his nose."I'm not wanting any traitor to start any songs for me!" declaredgrandfather."Never mind. The fellows on the other side aren't any more enthusiasticthan we are, grandfather," Stransky said soothingly, in his mocking way."The fact is, we don't want to kill our brothers across the frontier andthey don't want to kill us or be killed. It's only the ruling classesthat want the proletariat to--""Fire away, Stransky! It's hours since you made a speech!" chirruped avoice."Look out, Bert, the sergeant's coming!" another voice warned theorator.The state of mind of the 53d was that of all the regiments of the Brownswith their faces toward the white posts, quiet, thoughtful, and grave;for they had not to arouse ardor for the aggressive. As they were toreceive rather than give blows they might be more honest with themselvesthan the men of the Grays.In marching order, with cartridge-boxes full, on Saturday night the 53dmarched out to the main pass road. When Grandfather Fragini found thathe had been ordered to remain behind he sought the colonel."I've got reasons! Let me come!" he pleaded."No. It is no place for you.""I can keep up! I can keep up! I feel like a boy!""But it is different these days, and this is the infantry. The bulletscarry far. You will not know how to take cover," the colonel explained."Well, if I am killed I won't be losing much time on this earth,"grandfather observed with cool logic. "But that ain't it. I'm worriedabout Tom. I'm afraid he ain't going to fight! I--I want to stiffen himup!""He will fight, all right. Sorry, but it is out of the question," saidthe colonel, turning away.Grandfather buried his face in his hands and shook with the sobs ofsecond childhood until an idea occurred to him. Wasn't he a free man?Hadn't he as much right as anybody to use the public highway? Drying hiseyes, he set out along the road in the wake of the regiment.One company after another left the road at a given point, bound for theposition mapped in its instructions Dellarme's, however, went on untilit was opposite the Galland house."We are depending on you," the colonel said to Dellarme, giving his handa grip. "You are not to draw off till you get the flag.""No, sir," Dellarme replied."Mind the signal to the batteries--keep the men screened--warn them notto let their first baptism of shell fire shake their nerves!" thecolonel added in a final repetition of instructions already indeliblyimpressed on the captain's mind.Moving cautiously through a cut, Dellarme's company came, aboutmidnight, to a halt among the stubble of a wheat-field behind a knoll.After he had bidden the men to break ranks, he crept up the incline."Yes, it's there!" he whispered when he returned. "On the crest of theknoll a cord is stretched from stake to stake," he said, explaining thereason for what was to be done, as was his custom. "The engineers placedit there after dusk and the frontier was closed, so that you would knowjust where to use your spades in the dark. Quietly as possible! Notalking!" he kept cautioning as the men turned the soft earth, "and nothigher than the cord, and lay the stubble side of the sods on thereverse so as to cover the fresh earth on the sky-line."When the work was done all returned behind the knoll except the sentriesposted at intervals on the crest to watch. With the aid of a smallelectric flash, screened by his hands, Dellarme again examined a sectionof the staff map that outlined the contour of the knoll in relation tothe other positions. After this he wrote in his diary the simple factsof the day's events, concluding with a sentiment of gratitude for thehonor shown to his company and a prayer that he might keep a clear headand do his duty if war came on the morrow."Now, every one get all the sleep he can!" he advised the men.Stransky slept, with his head on his arm, as soundly as Eugene Aronson,his antithesis in character; the others slept no better than the men ofthe 128th. The night passed without any alarm except that of their ownthoughts, and they welcomed dawn as a relief from suspense. There was nohot coffee this morning, and they washed down their rations with waterfrom their canteens. The old sergeant was lying beside Captain Dellarmeon the crest, the sunrise in their faces. As the mist cleared from theplain it revealed the white dots of the frontier posts in the meadow andbehind them many gray figures in skirmish order, scarcely visibleexcept through the glasses."It looks like business!" declared the old sergeant."Yes, it begins the minute they cross the line!" said Dellarme.His glance sweeping to the rear to scan the landscape under the light ofday, he recognized, with a sense of pride and awe, the tacticalimportance of his company's position in relation to that of the othercompanies. Easily he made out the regimental line by streaks ofconcealed trenches and groups of brown uniforms; and here and there werethe oblong, cloth stretches of waiting hospital litters. On the reverseslope of another knoll was the farmhouse, marked X on his map as theregimental headquarters, where he was to watch for the signal to fallback from his first stand in delaying the enemy's advance. Directly tothe rear was the cut through which the company had come from the mainpass road, and beyond that the Galland house, which was to be the secondstand."Can you see them from up here?" chirped a voice in a jubilant, cacklinglaugh that drew Dellarme's attention to his immediate surroundings, andhe saw Grandfather Fragini coming up to join him on the crest. He slidback on his stomach below the sky-line and held up an arresting hand."Kept along after you," piped the old man; "and it's just as Ithought--the glummest lot of funeral faces I ever seen!""You must not remain! Follow that cut there and it will take you out tothe road!" Dellarme told grandfather sharply."Just got to stay. Too tired to take another step," and grandfatherdropped in utter exhaustion. "Have to carry me if you want me to go.""That means two men out of the line," thought Dellarme."You're an archaic old fire-eater!" Stransky remarked in cynicalamusement to grandfather Fragini."And you're a traitor!" answered grandfather with all the energy hecould command.Now Dellarme disposed his men in line back of the ridge of fresh earththat they had dug in the night, ready to rush to their places when heblew the whistle that hung from his neck, but he did not allow them aglimpse over the crest."I know you are curious, but powerful glasses are watching for you toshow yourselves; and if a battery turned loose on us you'd understand,"he explained.The men wanted to talk but did not know what to talk about, so theyexamined their rifles critically as if they were unfamiliar gifts whichthey had found in their stockings on Christmas morning. Some began toempty their magazines of cartridges for the pleasure or occupation ofrefilling them; but one of the lieutenants stopped this. It might meandelay when the whistle blew. Thus the hours wore on, and the churchclock struck nine and ten."Never a movement down there!" called the sergeant from the crest toDellarme. "Maybe this is just their final bluff before they come toterms about Bodlapoo"--that stretch of African jungle that seemed veryfar away to them all."Let us hope so!" said Dellarme seriously."Hope there won't be any war! Just listen to that from an army officer,with the enemy right in front of him!" gasped grandfather.XVIIA SUNDAY MORNING IN TOWN"You ought not to leave the house--not this morning," protested Mrs.Galland when Marta was putting on her hat to start for the regularSunday service of her school."The children expect me," Marta explained."Hardly, hardly this morning. They will take it for granted that youwill not come."But Marta thrust her hatpin home decisively."Jacky Werther will certainly be there. Though he were the only one tocome, I would not disappoint him!" she said. "Heaven knows, mother, ifthere were ever a time for teaching peace it is to-day! And I can'tremain inactive. Just to sit still and wait in a time like this--that istoo terrible!""As you will!" Mrs. Galland responded with gentle resignation.Garden and veranda were as peaceful as on any other Sunday morning, butit was a different kind of peace--a peace mocked by sounds beyond itsboundaries which were to her like the rattling of the steel scales of ademon licking its jaws with its red tongue in voracious anticipation ofa gorge and stretching out great steel claws in readiness to sink theminto the flesh of its victims when Partow and Westerling gave the word.As Lanstron had said, this demon would feed on every resource and energyof the nation. It had no voice and no thought except kill, kill, kill!And man called this demon patriotism and love of country. Those whorisked death in the demon's honor got iron crosses and bronze crosses,but any one who dared to call it by its true name, if a man, receivedthe decoration of the white feather; if a woman, was regarded as asentimentalist and merely a woman, and told that she did not understandpractical human nature.Choosing to go to town by the castle road rather than down the terraceto the main pass road, Marta, as she emerged from the grounds, sawFeller, garden-shears in hand and in his workman's clothes instead ofhis Sunday black, a figure of stone watching the approach of somefield-batteries. In the week of distracting and cumulative suspense thathad elapsed since his secret had been revealed to her, their relationshad continued as before. She studiously kept up the fiction of hisdeafness by writing her orders. The question of allowing him toundertake his part as a spy had drifted into the background of her mindunder the distressing and ever-present pressure of the crisis. He was toremain until there was war, and thought about anything that implied thatwar was coming was the more hideous to her the nearer war approached."It will be averted! It cannot be!" she was thinking. Her glimpse of himhad no more interest for her at this moment of preoccupation than anyother familiar object of the landscape."The guns! The guns! How I love the guns!" he was thinking.She was almost past him before he realized her presence, which heacknowledged by a startled movement and a step forward as he took offhis hat. She paused. His eyes were glowing like coals under a blower ashe looked at her and again at the batteries, seeming to include her withthe guns in the spell of his fervid abstraction. He was unconscious thathe had ever been anything but a soldier. His throat was athirst forwords and his words craved a listening ear for all the pictures of themachinery of war in motion that crowded his imagination. To him thedemon was a fair, beckoning god in cloth of gold--a god of hope andfortune."Frontier closed last night to prevent intelligence about ourpreparations leaking out--Lanny's plan all alive--the guns coming," hewent on, his shoulders stiffening, his chin drawing in, his featuresresolute and beaming with the ardor of youth in action--"troops movinghere and there to their places--engineers preparing thedefences--automatics at critical points with the infantry--field-wireslaid--field-telephones set up--the wireless spitting--the caissonsfull--planes and dirigibles ready--search-lights in position"There the torrent of his broken sentences was checked A shadow passed infront of him. He came out of his trance of imageries of activities, sovividly clear to his military mind, to realize that Marta was abruptlyleaving."Miss Galland!" he called urgently. "Firing may commence at any minute.You must not go into town!""But I must!" she declared, speaking over her shoulder while she paused.It was clear that no warning would prevail against her determined mood."Then I shall go with you!" he said, starting toward her with a lightstep, in keeping with the gallantry of a man even younger than hisyears. He spoke in a tone of protective masculine authority, as anofficer might to a woman of whom he was fond when he saw her exposingherself to danger. He would escort her; he would see that no harm befellher. The impulse was spontaneous in an illusion free of the gardener'spart. But he saw her lips tighten and a frown gather."It is not necessary, thank you!" she answered, more coldly than she hadever spoken to him. This had a magically quick effect on his attitude."I beg pardon! I forgot!" he explained in his old man's voice, his headsinking, his shoulders drooping in the humility of a servant whorecognizes that he has been properly rebuked for presumption. "Not agunner any more--I'm a spy!" he thought, as he shuffled off withoutlooking toward the batteries again, though the music of wheels and hoofswas now close by. "I must turn my back on the guns, for they tempt me.And I must win her consent before I shall have even the dignity of aspy--and I will win it!" he added, brightening. "La, la, la! Trust me!"Marta had a glimpse, as she turned away, of an appealingly patheticfigure bent as under a wound to his spirits, which gave her a sense ofpersonal cruelty in the midst of a wave of pity and regret."He is what he is because of the army; a victim of a cult, a habit," shewas thinking. "Had he been in any other calling his fine qualities mighthave been of service to the world and he would have been happy."Then her sympathy was drawn to another object of war's injustice--a manapproaching under the guard of two soldiers. Suddenly the man plantedhis feet and refused to budge."I tell you, it isn't fair!" he cried in rage and appeal. "I tell you, Iwas only visiting on this side and got caught! I'm a reservist of thefirst line. If I don't answer the call I'll be branded a shirker in myvillage, and I've got to live in that village all my life. You betterkill me and have done with it!""Sorry," said one of the soldiers, "but you were caught trying to sneak.We're acting under orders. No use of balking.""Who wouldn't sneak?" demanded the prisoner desperately. "Oh, say, be alittle human! The worst of it is that I came over here to see my girl tosay good-by to her. I'm going to marry her," he pleaded, "though myfolks are against it because she's a Brown. It makes me so cheap--it--""We were told to take you to the general. He'll let you off if thereisn't any war, and he may, anyway. But he sure won't if you resistarrest." The soldiers seized his arms firmly. "Come along!" they said,and he went. Any one must go when a steel claw of the demon enforcesthe order.A company of infantry resting among their stacked rifles changed thecolor of the square in the distance from the gray of pavement to thebrown of a mass of uniforms. In the middle of the main street a major ofthe brigade staff, with a number of junior officers and orderlies, wasevidently waiting on some signal. Sentries were posted at regularintervals along the curb. The people in the houses and shops from timeto time stopped packing up their effects long enough to go to the doorsand look up and down apprehensively, asking bootless, nervous questions."Are they coming yet?""Do you think they will come?""Are you sure it's going to be war?""Will they shell the town?""There'll be time enough for you to get away!" shouted the major. "Allwe know is what is written in our instructions, and we shall act on themwhen the thing starts. Then we are in command. Meanwhile, get ready!"A lieutenant of a detachment of engineers coming at the double from across street stopped to inquire:"This way to the knitting mills?""Straight ahead! Can't go wrong!" the major answered."We are going to loophole their walls for the infantry," explained thelieutenant as he hurried on."Then they're going to fight in the town!""Blow our homes to pieces!""Destroy our property!"After this fusillade from the people the major glared at the retreatingback of the lieutenant as much as to say that some men would never learnto hold their tongues. Naturally, the duty of looking after refugees wasnot to his soldierly taste."We are doing it all for you, for the country," he explained. "We aregoing to make them pay for every foot they take--the invaders!""Yes, make them pay!" called a voice from the houses."Make them pay!" other voices joined in."It isn't the fellows just across the border that want to take ourproperty," said an elderly man. "They're good friends enough. It's theGrays' politicians and the fire-eaters in the other provinces.""The robbers!" piped a woman's high-pitched note. "I've got a son in thearmy, and if ever he leaves that mountain range and goes down the otherside with the Grays chasing him, he'll get worse from me than the Grayscould give him!""That's right! That's the way to talk!" came a chorus.Then the major became aware of a young woman who was going in the wrongdirection. Her cheeks were flushed from her rapid walk, her lips wereparted, showing firm, white teeth, and her black eyes were regarding himin a blaze of satire or amusement; an emotion, whatever it was, thatthoroughly centred his attention."Yes," she said, anger getting the better of her, "make them pay--andthey make you pay--and you make them pay--and so on!"The major smiled. It seemed the safe thing to do. He did not know butthe young woman might charge."Mademoiselle, I am sorry, but unless you live in this direction," hesaid very politely, "you may not go any farther. Until we have otherorders or they attack, every one is supposed to remain in his house orhis place of business.""This is my place of business!" Marta answered, for she was alreadyopposite a small, disused chapel which was her schoolroom, where a halfdozen of the faithful children were gathered around the masculineimportance of Jacky Werther, one of the older boys."Then you are Miss Galland!" said the major, enlightened. His smile hadan appreciation of the irony of her occupation at that moment. "Yourchildren are very loyal. They would not tell me where they lived, so wehad to let them stay there.""Those who have homes," she said, identifying each one of the faithfulwith a glance, "have so many brothers and sisters that they will hardlybe missed from the flock. Others have no homes--at least, not much of aone"--here her temper rose again--"taxes being so high in order that youmay organize murder and the destruction of property.""I--" gasped the major under the fire of those black eyes.But their flashes suddenly splintered into less threatening lights asshe realized the fatuity of this personal allusion."Oh, I'm not the town scold!" she explained with a nervous little laughthat helped her to recover poise.With the black eyes in this mood, the major was conscious only of adesire to please which conflicted with duty."Now, really, Miss Galland," he began solicitously, "I have beenassigned to move the civil population in case of attack. Your childrenought--""After school! You have your duty this morning and I have mine!" Martainterrupted pleasantly, and turned toward the chapel."They are putting sharpshooters in the church tower to get theaeroplanes, and there are lots of the little guns that fire bullets sofast you can't count 'em--and little spring wagons with dynamite to blowthings up--and--" Jacky Werther ran on in a series of vocal explosionsas Marta opened the door to let the children go in."Yet you came!" said Marta with a hand caressingly on his shoulder."It looks pretty bad for peace, but we came," answered Jacky,round-eyed, in loyalty. "We'd come right through the bullets 'cause wesaid we would if we wasn't sick, and we wasn't sick.""My seven disciples--seven!" exclaimed Marta as she counted them. "Andyou need not sit on the regular seats, but around me on the platform. Itwill be more intimate.""That's grand!" came in chorus. They did not bother, about chairs, butseated themselves on the floor around Marta's skirts."My, Miss Galland, but your eyes are bright!""And your cheeks are all red!""With little spots in the centre!""You're very wonderful, Miss Galland!"The church clock boomed out its deliberate strokes through ten, the hourset for the lesson, and all counted them--one--two--three. Marta wasthinking what a dismal little effort theirs was, and yet she was veryhappy, tremblingly happy in her distraction and excitement, that theyhad not waited for her at the door of the chapel in vain.She announced that there would be no talk this morning; they would onlysay their oath. Repeating in concert the pledge to the boys and girls ofother lands, the childish voices peculiarly sweet and harmonious incontrast to the raucous and uneven sounds of foreboding from the street,they came in due course to the words of the concession that the oathmade to militancy."If an enemy tries to take my land--""Children--I--" Marta interrupted with a sense of wonder and shock. Theypaused and looked at her questioningly. "I had almost forgotten thatpart!" she breathed confusedly."That's the part that makes all we're doing against the Grays right!"put in Jacky Werther promptly."As I wrote it for you! 'I shall appeal to his sense of justice andreason with him--'"Jaws dropped and eyes bulged, for above the sounds of the street rosefrom the distance the unmistakable crackling of rifle-fire which, asthey listened, spread and increased in volume."Go on--on to the end of the oath! It will take only a moment," saidMarta resolutely. "It isn't much, but it's the best we can do!"XVIIITHE BAPTISM OF FIREAfter the morning sun commenced to tickle the back of his neck, EugeneAronson, the giant of the 128th of the Grays, stretched his limbs ashealthily as a cub bear."No war yet!" he exclaimed, rubbing his eyes."Oh, we'd have called you if there were!" said the manufacturer's son,trying to make a joke, which was hard work with his clothes dew-soakedafter a sleepless night in the open."Wouldn't want you to miss it after coming so far," added the laborer'sson, aiming to show that he, too, was in a light-hearted mood."And how did you sleep?" asked Eugene, cheerily, of his neighbors."Fine!""First rate!""Like a stone!"Every man was too intent in forcing his own spontaneity to notice thatthat of the others was also forced."Like a top!" chimed in pasty-faced Peterkin, the valet's son, to be infashion."I didn't sleep much myself; in fact, not at all," said Hugo Mallin."Oh, ho!" groaned Pilzer, the butcher's son, with a broad grin that madea crease in the liver patch on his cheek."You see, it's a new experience for me," Hugo explained in a drawl, hisface drawn as a mask. "I'm not so used to war as you other fellows are.I'm not so brave!"There was a forced laugh because Hugo appeared droll, and when heappeared droll it was the proper thing to laugh. Besides, in the besthumor there is a grain of truth, whether you see it or not. This time anumber saw it quite clearly."I was thinking how ridiculous we all are," Hugo went on without changeof tone or expression, "grovelling here on our stomachs and pretendingthat we slept when we didn't and that we want to be killed when wedon't!""White feather again!" Pilzer exclaimed."Oh, shut up!" snapped the doctor's son irritably. "Let Hugo talk. He'sonly gassing. It's so monotonous lying here that any kind of nonsense isbetter than growling.""Yes, yes!" the others agreed.Hugo's outburst of the previous evening was forgotten. They welcomedanything that broke the suspense. Let the regimental wag make a littlefun any way that he could. As the officers had withdrawn somewhat to therear for breakfast, there was no constraint."I was thinking how I'd like to go out and shake hands with the Browns,"said Hugo. "That's the way fencers and pugilists do before they set to.It seems polite and sportsmanlike, indicating that there's noprejudice."There was a ripple of half-hearted merriment punctuated by exclamations."What a fool idea!""How do all your notions get into your head, Hugo?""Sometimes by squinting at the moonlight and counting odd numbers;sometimes by knowing that anything that's different is ridiculous; andsometimes by looking for tangent truths out of professorial ruts," Hugoobserved with a sort of erudite discursiveness which was the rankdissimulation of a hypocrite to Pilzer and wholly confusing to Peterkin,not to say a draught on mental effort for many of the others. "Forinstance, I got a good one from two fellows of the Browns whom I met onthe road the first day we arrived. They were reservists. We were soontalking together and so peaceably that I was sceptical if they wereBrowns at all. So I determined on a test. I told them I was from adistant province and hadn't travelled much and wouldn't they please takeoff their hats. They consented very good-naturedly.""Oh, good old Hugo! He got one on the Browns!""I'd like to have been there to see it!""And when they took off their hats, what then?""Why, I said: 'This isn't convincing at all.'" Hugo's drawl paused for asecond while interest developed. "'You haven't any horns! Haven't youany forked tails, either? Or are they curled up nicely inside yourtrousers' legs?'""Whew! But they must have felt cheap to have been got in that way!""And old Hugo looking so solemn!""Just like he does now!"But the judge's son said under his breath, "Very pretty!" and thedoctor's son, who was next him in the ranks, nodded understandingly."It seems they had checked their horns and tails at the frontier," Hugocontinued, "and, as I had left mine hanging in the rifle racks at thebarracks, we got on together like real human beings. I found they couldspeak my language better than my lesson-book try at theirs--yes, as wellas I can speak it myself--and that made it all the easier. After a whileI mentioned the war. They were very amiable and they didn't begin tocall me a swill-eating land-shark or any other of the pretty names I'veheard they are so fond of using. 'We want to keep what is ours,' theysaid. 'Your side will have to start the fight by crossing the line. Weshall not!"'"Because they know they'll be licked!" put in Pilzer hotly."No, we may beat them in fighting," agreed Hugo, "but these two fellowshad me beaten on the argument!""They hauled down our flag! They insulted us in their despatches! Theyquibble! They're the perfidious Browns!" cried big Eugene Aronson,speaking the lesson taught him by the newspapers, which had it from thepremier."There, he's got you again, Gene!""Yes, you funny old simpleton! You are almost too easy!"There was something of the vivacity of the barrack-room banter in theexclamations at Eugene's expense. Yet they were not the same. The lookon no man's face was the same. The humorist was silent."What next, Hugo?"He half stared at them, and his mask was not solemn but tragic."I was thinking how men work their courage up, as if patriotism were aMoloch of which they were afraid," he said. "How in order to get killedwe go out to kill others, when right is on their side! How you, Armand,or you, Eugene, might be dead before to-morrow! How--.""The bullet is not made that will get me!" exclaimed Eugene, with aswelling breath from his bellows-like lungs."Take him home to mother!" groaned Pilzer."That will do for you, Hugo Mallin!" came another interruption, a sharpone from Captain Fracasse, who had returned unobserved from the rear intime to overhear Hugo's remarks. "And that's the way to talk, Aronsonand Pilzer. As for you, Mallin, I've a mind to put you under arrest andsend you back for a coward! A coward--do you hear?""Ah-h!" breathed Pilzer in a guttural of satisfaction.Hugo crimsoned at first in confusion, then he looked frankly andunflinchingly at the captain."Very well, sir!" he said with a certain dignity which Fracasse, whowas a good deal of a martinet, found very irritating."No, that would suit you too well!" Fracasse declared. "You shall stay!You shall do the duty for which your country trained you and take yourshare of the chances.""Yes, sir!" answered Hugo. "But won't you," he asked persuasively andwith the wondering inquiry of the suggestion that had sprung into hisheretic brain, "won't you ask the men if there are not some here whoreally, in their hearts, the logic of their hearts--which is oftenbetter than brain logic--do not believe just as I do?""Have you gone insane? There are none!" In the impulse of anger thatswept his cheeks with a red wave Fracasse half drew his sword as if hewould strike Hugo. "And, Mallin, you are a marked man. I shall watchyou! I'll have the lieutenants and sergeants watch you. At the firstsign of flunking I'll make an example of you!""Yes, sir," answered Hugo, with the automatic deference of private toofficer but with a reserved and studious inquiry that made the captainbite his lip."I'll have Aronson and Pilzer watch you, too!" Fracasse added."Yes, sir!" said Pilzer promptly.Then, under the restraint of the captain's presence, there was a silencethat endured. The men were left to the sole resource of their thoughtsand observation of their surroundings. They were lying in a pasturefacing the line of white posts whose tops ran in an even row over levelground. On the other side of the boundary was a wheat-field. Here afarmer had commenced his fall ploughing. His plough was in the furrowwhere he had left it when he unhitched his team for the day, before anorderly had come to tell him that he must move out of his houseovernight. The wheat stubble swept on up to a knoll in the distance.All the landscape in front of Fracasse's company seemed to have beendeserted; no moving figures were anywhere in sight; no sign of theenemy's infantry. No trains came or went along the lines of steel intothe mountain tunnel, which had been mined at a dozen points by theBrowns. No vehicles and no foot-passengers dotted the highway into thetown. Over the mountains and over the plain, planes and dirigibles movedin wide circles restively, watching for a signal as hawks watch forprey. Suspense this--suspense of such a swift vibration that it was likea taut G string of a violin under the bow!Faintly the town clock was heard striking the hour. From eight to nineand nine to ten Fracasse's men waited; waited until the machine wasready and Westerling should throw in the clutch; waited until the troopswere in place for the first move before he hurled his battalionsforward. Every pawn of flesh facing the white posts had a thousandthoughts whirling in such a medley that he could be said to have nothought at all, only an impression juggled by destiny. No one would haveconfessed what he felt, while physical inactivity gave free rein tomental activity. That thing of a nation's nightmare; that thing forwhich generations had drilled without its materializing; that thing ofspeculation, of hazard, of horror; that thing of quick action andlong-enduring consequences was coming.They did not know how the captain at their back received his orders;they only heard the note of the whistle, with a command familiar to atrained instinct on the edge of anticipation. It released a spring intheir nerve-centres. They responded as the wheels respond when thethrottle is opened. Jumping to their feet they broke into a run, bodiesbent, heads down, like the peppered silhouette that faced Westerling'sdesk. What they had done repeatedly in drills and manoeuvres they werenow doing in war, mechanically as marionettes."Come on! The bullet is not made that can get me! Come on!" cried thegiant Eugene Aronson.He leaped over a white post and then over the plough, which was also inhis path. Little Peterkin felt his legs trembling. They seemed to bedetached from his will, and the company's and the captain's will, andchurning in pantomime or not moving at all. If Hugo Mallin had beencalled a coward, what of himself? What of the stupid of the company, whowould never learn even the manual of arms correctly, as thedrill-sergeant often said? A new fear made him glance around. He wouldnot have been surprised to find that he was already in the rear. Butinstead he found that he was keeping up, which was all that wasnecessary, as more than one other man assured his legs. After thirty orforty yards most of the legs, if not Peterkin's, had worked out theirshiver and nearly all felt the exhilaration of movement in company. Thencame the sound that generations had drilled for without hearing; thesound that summons the imagination of man in the thought of how he willfeel and act when he hears it; the sound that is everywhere like thesong snatches of bees driven whizzing through the air."That's it! We're under fire! We're under fire!" flashed as crookedlightning recognition of the sound through every brain.There was no sign of any enemy; no telling where the bullets came from."Such a lot of them, one must surely get me!" Peterkin thought.Whish-whish! Th-ipp-whing! The refrain gripped his imagination with anunseen hand. He seemed to be suffocating. He wanted to throw himselfdown and hold his hands in front of his head. While Pilzer and Aronsonwere not thinking, only running, Peterkin was thinking with the rapidityof a man falling from a high building. Worse! He did not know how far hehad to go. He was certain only that he was bound to strike ground."An inch is as good as a mile!" He recollected the captain's teaching."Only one of a thousand bullets fired in war ever kills a man"--but hewas certain that he had heard a million already. Then one passed veryclose, its swift breath brushing his cheek with a whistle like a s-s-stthrough the teeth. He dodged so hard that he might have dislocated hisneck; he gasped and half stumbled, but realized that he had not beenhit. And he must keep right on going, driven by one fear againstanother, in face of those ghastly whispers which the others, for themost part, in the excitement of a charge, had ceased to hear.Again he would be sure that his legs, which he was urging so franticallyto their duty, were not playing pantomime. He looked around to find thathe was still keeping up with Eugene and felt the thrill of the braveryof fellowship at sight of the giant's flushed, confident face revellingin the spirit of a charge. And then, just then, Eugene convulsivelythrew up his arms, dropped his rifle, and whirled on his heel. As hewent down his hand clutched at his left breast and came away red anddripping. After one wild, backward glance, Peterkin plunged ahead."Eugene!" Hugo Mallin had stopped and bent over Eugene in the supremeinstinct of that terrible second, supporting his comrade's head."The bullet is not--made--." Eugene whispered, the ruling passion strongto the last. A flicker of the eyelids, a gurgle in the throat, and hewas dead.Fracasse had been right behind them. The sight of a man falling wassomething for which he was prepared; something inevitably a part of thegame. A man down was a man out of the fight, service finished. A man upwith a rifle in his hand was a man who ought to be in action."Here, you are not going to get out this way!" he said in the irritationof haste, slapping Hugo with his sword. "Go on! That's hospital-corpswork."Hugo had a glimpse of the captain's rigid features and a last one ofEugene's, white and still and yet as if he were about to speak hisfavorite boast; then he hurried on, his side glance showing otherprostrate forms. One form a few yards away half rose to call "Hospital!"and fell back, struck mortally by a second bullet."That's what you get if you forget instructions," said Fracasse with nosense of brutality, only professional exasperation, "Keep down, youwounded men!" he shouted at the top of his voice.The colonel of the 128th had not looked for immediate resistance. He hadtold Fracasse's men to occupy the knoll expeditiously. But by the commonimpulse of military training, no less than in answer to the whistle'scall, in face of the withering fire they dropped to earth at the base ofthe knoll, where Hugo threw himself down at full length in his place inline next to Peterkin."Fire pointblank at the crest in front of you! I saw a couple of menstanding up there!" called Fracasse. "Fire fast! That's the way to keepdown their fire--pointblank, I tell you! You're firing into the sky! Iwant to see more dust kicked up. Fire fast! We'll have them out of theresoon! They're only an outpost."Hugo was firing vaguely, like a man in a dream, and thinking that maybeup there on the knoll were the two Browns he had met on the road andperhaps their comrades were as fond of them as he was of Eugene. It is amistake for a soldier to think much, as Westerling had repeatedly said.Pilzer was shooting to kill. His eye had the steely gleam of his riflesight and the liver patch on his cheek was a deeper hue as he sought toavenge Eugene's death. Drowned by the racket of their own fire, not evenPeterkin was hearing the whish-whish of the bullets from Dellarme'scompany now. He did not know that the blacksmith's son, who was thefourth man from him, lay with his chin on his rifle stock and a tinytrickle of blood from a hole in his forehead running down the bridge ofhis nose.Fracasse, glancing along from rifle to rifle, as a weaver watches thethreads of a machine loom, saw that Hugo was firing at too high anangle."Mallin!" he called. Hugo did not hear because of the noise, andFracasse had to creep nearer, which was anything but cooling to histemper. "You fool! You are shooting fifty feet above the top of theknoll! Look along your sight!" he yelled.Fracasse observed, with some surprise, that Hugo's hand was steady as hecarefully drew a bead. Hugo saw a spurt of dust at the point slightlybelow the crest where he aimed; for he was the best shot in the companyat target practice."I'm not killing anybody!" he thought happily.XIXRECEIVING THE CHARGEWhat about Stransky of the Reds, who would not fight to please theruling classes? What about Grandfather Fragini, who would fight onprinciple whenever a Gray was in sight? Now we leave the story ofFracasse's men at the foot of the knoll for that of the Browns on thecrest.Young Dellarme, new to his captain's rank, with lips pressed tightlytogether, his delicately moulded, boyish features reflecting theconfidence which it was his duty to inspire in his company, watching theplain through his glasses, saw the movement of mounted officers to therear of the 128th as a reason for summoning his men."Creep up! Don't show yourselves! Creep up--carefully--carefully!" hekept repeating as they crawled forward on their stomachs. "And no one isto fire until the command comes."Hugging the cover of the ridge of fresh earth which they had thrown upthe previous night, they watched the white posts. Stransky, who had beenruminatively silent all the morning, was in his place, but he was notlooking at the enemy. Cautiously, to avoid a reprimand, he raised hishead to enable him to glance along the line. All the faces seemed drawnand clayish."They don't want to fight! They're just here because they're orderedhere and haven't the character to defy authority," he thought. "Theleaven is working! My time is coming!"But Grandfather Fragini's cheeks had a hectic flush; his heart wasbeating with the exhilaration of an old war-horse. Looking over Tom'sshoulder, he squinted into the distance, his underlip quivering againsthis toothless gums."My eyesight's kind of uncertain," he said. "Can you see 'em?""There by the white posts--those lying figures!" said Tom. "They'realmost the color of the stubble.""So I do, the land-sharks! Down on their bellies, too! No flag, either!But that ain't no reason why we shouldn't have a flag. It ought to bewaving at 'em in defiance right over our heads!""Flags draw fire. They let the enemy know where you are,' Tom explained."The Hussars didn't bother about that. We let out a yell and went after'em!" growled grandfather. "Appears to me the fighting these days isgrovelling in the dirt and taking care nobody don't get hurt!""Oh, there'll be enough hurt--don't you worry about that!" said a voicefrom the line."Good thing an old fellow who's been under fire is along to stiffen yourookies!" replied grandfather tartly. "You'll be all right once you getgoing. You'll settle down to be real soldiers yet. And I'd like to heara little more cussing. How the Hussars used to cuss! Too much readingand writing nowadays. It makes men too ladylike."By this time he had once more attracted the captain's attention."Grandfather Fragini, you must drop back--you must! If you don't, I'llhave you carried back!" called Dellarme, sparing the old man only aglance from his concentrated observation on the front.When he looked again at the enemy any thought of carrying out his threatvanished, for the minute had come when all his training was to be put toa test. The figures on the other side of the white posts were rising. Hewas to prove by the way he directed a company of infantry in actionwhether or not he was worthy of his captain's rank. He breathed one ofthose unspoken prayers that are made to the god of one's own efficient,conscientious responsibility to duty. The words of it were: "May I keepmy head as if I were at drill!" Then he smiled cheerily. In order thathe might watch how each man used his rifle, he drew back of the line,his slim body erect as he rested on one knee, his head level with theother heads while he fingered his whistle. His lieutenants followed hisexample even to the detail of his cheery smile. There was a slightstirring of heads and arms as eyes drew beads on human targets. Theinstant that Eugene Aronson sprang over the white post a blast fromDellarme's whistle began the war.It was a signal, too, for Stransky to play the part he had planned; tomake the speech of his life. His six feet of stature shot to its feetwith a Jack-in-the-box abruptness, under the impulse of a mighty andreckless passion."Men, stop firing!" he cried thunderously. "Stop firing on yourbrothers! Like you, they are only the pawns of the ruling class, whokeep us all pawns in order that they may have champagne and caviare.Comrades, I'll lead you! Comrades, we'll take a white flag and go downto meet our comrades and we'll find that they think as we do! I'll leadyou!"Grandfather Fragini, impelled by the hysterical call of the Hussarspirit, also sprang up, waving his hat and trembling and swaying withthe emotion that racked his old body."Give it to 'em! Aim low! Give it to 'em--give it to 'em, horns andhoofs, sabre and carbine!" he shouted in a high, jumpy voice. "Give itto 'em! Make 'em weep! Make 'em whine! Make 'em bellow!"Both appeals were drowned in the cracking of the rifles working asregularly as punching-machines in a factory. Every soldier was seeingonly his sight and the running figures under it. Mechanically andautomatically, training had been projected into action, anticipationinto realization. A spectator might as well have called to a man in ahundred-yard dash to stop running, to an oarsman in a race to jump outof his shell.So centred was Dellarme in watching his men and the effect of their firethat he did not notice the two silhouettes on the sky-line, makingridicule of all his care about keeping his company under cover, untilthe doctor, who alone had nothing to do as yet, touched him on the arm.At the moment he looked around, and before he could speak a command, ahospital-corps man who was near Grandfather Fragini threw himself in alow tackle and brought the old man to earth, while the company sergeantsprang for Stransky with an oath. But Stransky was in no mood to submit.He felled the sergeant with a blow and, recklessly defiant, stared atDellarme, while the men, steadily firing, were still oblivious of thescene. The sergeant, stunned, rose to his knees and reached for hisrevolver. Dellarme, bent over to keep his head below the crest, hadalready drawn his as he hastened toward them."Stransky," said Dellarme, "you have struck an officer under fire! Youhave refused to fight! Within the law I am warranted in shooting youdead!""Well!" answered Stransky, throwing back his head, his face seeming allbig, bony nose and heavy jaw and burning eyes."Will you get down? Will you take your place with your rifle?" demandedDellarme.Stransky laughed thunderously in scorn. He was handsome, titanic, andbarbaric, with his huge shoulders stretching his blouse, which fellloosely around his narrow hips, while the fist that had felled thesergeant was still clenched."No!" said Stransky. "You won't kill much if you kill me and you'd killless if you shot yourself! God Almighty! Do you think I'm afraid?Me--afraid?"His eyes in a bloodshot glare, as uncompromising as those of a bull inan arena watching the next move of the red cape of the matador, regardedDellarme, who hesitated in the revulsion of the horror of killing and inadmiration of the picture of human force before him. But the oldsergeant, smarting under the insult of the blow, his sandstone featuresmottled with red patches, had no compunctions of this order. He wasready to act as executioner."If you don't want to shoot, I can! An example--the law! There's noother way of dealing with him! Give the word!" he said to Dellarme.Stransky laughed, now in strident cynicism. It was the laugh of the red,of bastardy, of blanketless nights in the hedgerows, and boot soles wornthrough to the macadam, with the dust of speeding automobiles blown inthe gaunt face of hunger. Dellarme still hesitated, recollectingLanstron's remark. He pictured Stransky in a last stand in a redoubt,and every soldier was as precious to him as a piece of gold to a miser."One ought to be enough to kill me if you're going to do it to slowmusic," said Stransky. "You might as well kill me as the poor fools thatyour poor fools are trying to--"Another breath finished the speech; a breath released from a ball thatseemed to have come straight from hell. The fire-control officer of aregiment of Gray artillery on the plain, scanning the landscape for theorigin of the rifle-fire which was leaving many fallen in the wake ofthe charge of the Gray infantry, had seen two figures on the knoll. "Howkind! Thank you!" his thought spoke faster than words. No need ofrange-finding! The range to every possible battery or infantry positionaround La Tir was already marked on his map. He passed the word to hisguns.The burst of their first shrapnel-shell blinded all three actors in thescene on the crest of the knoll with its ear-splitting crack and theforce of its concussion threw Stransky down beside the sergeant.Dellarme, as his vision cleared, had just time to see Stransky jerk hishand up to his temple, where there was a red spot, before another shellburst, a little to the rear. This was harmless, as a shrapnel's showerof fragments and bullets carry forward from the point of explosion. Butthe next burst in front of the line. The doctor's period of idleness wasover. One man's rifle shot up as his spine was broken by a jagged pieceof shrapnel jacket. Now there were too many shells to watch themindividually."It's all right--all right, men!" Dellarme called again, assuming hischeery smile. "It takes a lot of shrapnel to kill anybody. Our batterieswill soon answer!"His voice was unheard, yet its spirit was felt. The men knew throughtheir training that there was no use of dodging and that their bestprotection was an accurate fire of their own."Shelling us, the ---- ----!" gasped Grandfather Fragini, who hadexperience, if he were weak in reading and writing. "All noise andsmoke!"--as it was to a larger degree in his day.Stransky had half risen, a new kind of savagery dawning on his featuresas he regained his wits. With inverted eyes he regarded the red ends ofhis fingers, held in line with the bridge of his nose. He felt of thewound again, now that he was less dizzy. It was only a scratch and hehad been knocked down like a beef in an abattoir by an unseen enemy, onwhom he could not lay hands! He glared around as if in search of thehidden antagonist. The sergeant had crept forward to be a steadyinginfluence to the men in their first trial, if need be, and the doctorand a hospital-corps man were dragging a wounded man out of fine withoutexposing their own shoulders above the crest. Stransky rolled his eyesin and out; the tendons of his neck swelled; his jaw worked as ifcrunching pebbles. Deafeningly, the shrapnel jackets continued to crackwith "ukung-s-sh--ukung-s-sh" as the swift breath of the shrapnelmissiles spread."Give it to 'em! Give it to 'em!" Grandfather Fragini cried, his oldvoice a quavering bird note in the pandemonium. "My, but they do comefast!" he gasped.Yes, a trifle faster than in your day, grandfather, when a gun of thehorse-artillery had to be relaid after the recoil, which is now taken upby an oil chamber, while the gunner on his seat behind the breech keepsthe sight steady on the target. The guns of one battery of that Grayregiment of artillery, each firing six fourteen-pound shells a minutemethodically, every shell loaded with nearly two hundred projectiles,were giving their undivided attention to the knoll.How long could his company endure this? Dellarme might well ask. He knewthat he would not be expected to withdraw yet. With a sense of relief hesaw Fracasse's men drop for cover at the base of the knoll and then,expectation fulfilled, he realized that rifle-fire now reinforced theenemy's shell fire. His duty was to remain while he could hold his men,and a feeling toward them such as he had never felt before, which waslove, sprang full-fledged into his heart as he saw how steadily theykept up their fusillade.The sergeant, who now had time to think of Stransky, was seized with aspasm of retributive rage. He drew his revolver determinedly."You brought this on! I'll do for you!" he cried, turning toward thespot where he had left Stransky, only to lower his revolver in amazementas he saw Stransky, eager in response to a new passion, spring forwardinto place and pick up his rifle."If you will not have it my way, take it yours!" said the best shot inthe company, as he began firing with resolute coolness."They have a lot of men down," said Dellarme, his glasses showing themany prostrate figures on the wheat stubble. "Steady! steady! We haveplenty of batteries back in the hills. One will be in action soon."But would one? He understood that with their smokeless powder theGray guns could be located only by their flashes, which would notbe visible unless the refraction of light were favorable. Then"thur-eesh--thur-eesh" above every other sound in a long wail! No manever forgets the first crack of a shrapnel at close quarters, the firstbullet breath on his cheek, or the first supporting shell from his sidein flight that passes above him."That is ours!" called Dellarme."Ours!" shouted the sergeant."Ours!" sang the thought of every one of the men.Over the Gray batteries on the plain an explosive ball of smoke hung inthe still air; then another beside it."Thur-eesh--thur-eesh--thur-eesh," the screaming overhead becamea gale that built a cloud of blue smoke over the offending Graybatteries--beautiful, soft blue smoke from which a spray of steeldescended. There was no spotting the flashes of the Browns' guns inorder to reply to them, for they were under the cover of a hill, usingindirect aim as nicely and accurately as In firing pointblank. Thegunners of the Gray batteries could not go on with their work under sucha hail-storm, they were checkmated. They stopped firing and began movingto a new position, where their commander hoped to remain undiscoveredlong enough to support the 128th by loosing his lightnings against thedefenders at the critical moment of the next charge, which would be madeas soon as Fracasse's men had been reinforced.There was an end to the concussions and the thrashing of the air aroundDellarme's men, and they had the relief of a breaking abscess in theear. But they became more conscious of the spits of dust in front oftheir faces and the passing whistles of bullets. In return, they madethe sections of Gray infantry in reserve rushing across the levels,leave many gray lumps behind. But Fracasse's men at the foot of theslope poured in a heavier and still heavier fire."Down there's where we need the shells now!" spoke the thought ofDellarme's men, which he had anticipated by a word to the signalcorporal, who waved his flag one--two--three--four--five times. Come on,now, with more of your special brand of death, fire-control officer!Your own head is above the sky-line, though your guns are hidden. Fivehundred yards beyond the knoll is the range! Come on!He came with a burst of screams so low in flight that they seemed tobrush the back of the men's necks with a hair broom at the rate of athousand feet a second. Having watched the result, Dellarme turned witha confirmatory gesture, which the corporal translated into the wigwag of"Correct!" The shrapnel smoke hanging over Fracasse's men appeared aheavenly blue to Dellarme's men."They are going to start for us soon! Oh, but we'll get a lot of them!"whispered Stransky gleefully to his rifle.Dellarme glanced again toward the colonel's station. No sign of theretiring flag. He was glad of that. He did not want to fall back in faceof a charge; to have his men silhouetted in the valley as theyretreated. And the Grays would not endure this shower-bath long withoutgoing one way or the other. He gave the order to fix bayonets, andhardly was it obeyed when he saw flashes of steel through the shrapnelsmoke as the Grays fixed theirs. The Grays had five hundred yards to go;the Browns had the time that it takes running men to cover the distancein which to stop the Grays."We'll spear any of them who has the luck to get this far!" whisperedStransky to his rifle. The sentence was spoken in the midst of a salvoof shrapnel cracks, which he did not hear. He heard nothing, thoughtnothing, except to kill.The Gray batteries on the plain, having taken up a new position andbeing reinforced, played on the crest at top speed instantly the Grayline rose and started up the slope at the run. With the purpose ofconfusing no less than killing, they used percussion, which burst onstriking the ground, as well as shrapnel, which burst by a time-fuse inthe air. Fountains of sod and dirt shot upward to meet descending spraysof bullets. The concussions of the earth shook the aim of Dellarme'smen, blinded by smoke and dust, as they fired through a fog at bentfigures whose legs were pumping fast in dim pantomime.But the guns of the Browns, also, have word that the charge has begun.The signal corporal is waiting for the gesture from Dellarme agreed uponas an announcement. The Brown artillery commander cuts his fuses twohundred and fifty yards shorter. He, too, uses percussion for moraleffect.Half of the distance from the foot to the crest of the knoll Fracasse'smen have gone in face of the hot, sizzling tornado of bullets, whenthere is a blast of explosions in their faces with all the chaotic andirresistible force of a volcanic eruption. Not only are they in themidst of the first lot of the Browns' shells at the shorter range, butone Gray battery has either made a mistake in cutting its fuses orstruck a streak of powder below standard, and its shells burst amongthose whom it is aiming to assist.The ground seems rising under the feet of Fracasse's company; the air issplit and racked and wrenched and torn with hideous screams of invisibledemons. The men stop; they act on the uncontrollable instinct ofself-preservation against an overwhelming force of nature. A few withoutthe power of locomotion drop, faces pressed to the ground. The rest fleetoward a shoulder of the slope through the instinct that leads a huntedman in a street into an alley. In a confusion of arms and legs, pressingone on the other, no longer soldiers, only a mob, they throw themselvesbehind the first protection that offers itself. Fracasse also runs. Heruns from the flame of a furnace door suddenly thrown open.The Gray batteries have ceased firing; certain gunners' ears burn underthe words of inquiry as to the cause of the mistake from an artillerycommander. Dellarme's men are hugging the earth too close to cheer. Adesire to spring up and yell may be in their hearts, but they know thedanger of showing a single unnecessary inch of their craniums above thesky-line. The sounds that escape their throats are those of a winningteam at a tug of war as diaphragms relax.With the smoke clearing, they see twenty or thirty Grays plastered onthe slope at the point where the charge was checked. Every one of thoseprostrate forms is within fatal range. Not one moves a finger; even theliving are feigning death in the hope of surviving. Among them is littlePeterkin, so faithful in forcing his refractory legs to keep pace withhis comrades. If he is always up with them they will never know what isin his heart and call him a coward. As he has been knocked unconscious,he has not been in the pell-mell retreat.His first stabbing thought on coming to was that he must be dead; but,no; he was opening his eyes sticky with dust. At least, he must bewounded! He had not power yet to move his hands in order to feel where,and when they grew alive enough to move, what he saw in front of himheld them frigidly still. His nerves went searching from his head to hisfeet and--miracle of Heaven!--found no point of pain or spot soppy withblood. If he were really hit there was bound to be one or the other, heknew from reading.Between him and the faces of the Browns--yes, the actual, living,terrible Browns--above the glint of their rifle barrels, was no obstaclethat could stop a bullet, though not more than three feet away was acrater made by a shell burst. The black circle of every muzzle on thecrest seemed to be pointing at him. When were they going to shoot? Whenwas he to be executed? Would he be shot in many places and die thus? Orwould the very first bullet go through his head? Why didn't they fire?What were they waiting for? The suspense was unbearable. The desperationof overwhelming fear driving him in irresponsible impulse, he doubled uphis legs and with a cat's leap sprang for the crater.A blood-curdling burst of whistles passed over his head as a dozenrifles cracked. This time he was surely killed! He was in some otherworld! Which was it, the good or the bad? The good, for he had a glimpseof blue sky. No, that could not be, for he had been alive when he leapedfor the crater, and there he was pressed against the soft earth of itsbottom. He burrowed deeper blissfully. He was the nearest to the enemyof any man of the 128th, and he certainly had passed through a gamut ofemotions in the half-hour since Eugene Aronson had leaped over a whitepost.       *       *       *       *        *"Confound it! If we'd kept on we'd have got them! Now we have to do itall over again!" growled Fracasse distractedly as he looked around atthe faces hugging the cover of the shoulder--faces asking, What next?each in its own way; faces blank and white; faces with lips working andeyes blinking; faces with the blood rushing back to cheeks in baffledanger. One, however, was half smiling--Hugo Mallin's."You did your share of the running, I'll warrant, Mallin!" said Fracasseexcitedly, venting his disgust on a particular object."Yes, sir," answered Hugo. "It was very hard to maintain a semblance ofdignity. Yes, sir, I kept near you all the time so you could watch me.Wasn't that what you wanted me to do, sir?""Good old Hugo! The same old Hugo!" breathed the spirit of the company.Three or four men burst into a hysterical laugh as if something hadbroken in their throats. Everybody felt better for this touch ofdrollery except the captain. Yet, possibly, it may have helped him inrecovering his poise. Sometimes even a pin-prick will have this effect."Silence!" he said in his old manner. "I will give you something to jokeabout other than a little setback like this! Get up there with yourrifles!"He formed the nucleus of a firing-line under cover of the shoulder, andthen set the remainder of his company to work with their spades making atrench. The second battalion of the 128th, which faced the knoll, wasalso digging at the base of the slope, and another regiment in reservewas deploying on the plain. After the failure to rush the knoll the Graycommander had settled down to the business of a systematic approach.And what of those of Fracasse's men who had not run but had dropped intheir tracks when the charge halted? They were between two lines offire. There was no escape. Some of the wounded had a mercifully quickend, others suffered the consciousness of being hit again and again; thedead were bored through with bullet holes. In torture, the survivorsprayed for death; for all had to die except Peterkin, the pasty-facedlittle valet's son.Peterkin was quite safe, hugging the bottom of the shell crater under aswarm of hornets. In a surprisingly short time he became accustomed tothe situation and found himself ravenously hungry, for the strain of thelast twelve hours had burned up tissue. He took a biscuit out of hisknapsack and began nibbling it, as became a true rodent.XXMARTA'S FIRST GLIMPSE OF WARAs Marta and the children came to the door of the chapel after therecitation of the oath, she saw the civil population moving along thestreet in the direction of the range. Suddenly they paused in a commonimpulse and their heads turned as one head on the fulcrum of theirnecks, and their faces as one face in a set stare looked skyward."Keep on moving! No danger!" called the major of the brigade staff."Pass the word--no danger! It's not going to drop any bombs; it's only ascout plane trying to locate the positions of the defences we've thrownup overnight. No danger--keep moving!"He might as well have tried to distract the attention of the grand standfrom the finish of a horse-race. More than the wizard's spell, yearsbefore, at the first sight of man in flight held them in suspense asthey watched a plane approaching with the speed of an albatross down thewind straight on a line with the church tower where the sharpshooterswere posted. The spread of the wings grew broader; the motor was makinga circle of light as large as a man's hat-box, and the aviator was thesize of some enormous insect when three or four sharp reports wereaudible from the church tower.Still the plane came on intact over the spire. The sharpshooters hadonly rimmed the target, without injury to braces or engine. But they hadanother chance from the windows on the nearer side of the tower; and thecrowd saw there the glint of rifle barrels. This time they got thebull's-eye. The aviator reeled and dropped sidewise, a dead weightcaught by the braces, with his arm dangling. A teetering dip of theplane and his body was shaken free. His face, as he neared the earth inhis descent, bore the surprised look of a man thumped on the backunexpectedly.Marta pressed her fingers to her ears, but not soon enough to keep outthe sound of a thud on the roof of the building across the street fromthe chapel."I was a coward to do that! I shall see worse things!" she thought, andwent to the major, who had turned to the affairs of the living directlyhe saw that neither the corpse of the aviator nor the wreck of the planewas to strike in the street. "I will look after these children," shesaid, "and we will care for as many of the old and sick as we can in ourhouse.""The children will find their relatives or guardians in the processionthere," he answered methodically. "If they do not, the government willlook after them. It will not do for you to take them to your house. Thatwould only complicate the matter of their safety." Here he wasinterrupted by a precipitate question from one of his lieutenants, whohad come running up. "No! No matter what the excuse, no one can remain!"he answered. "The nation is not going to take the risk of letting spiesget information to the enemy for the sake of gratifying individualinterests. Every one must go!" Then he called to an able-bodied citizenof thirty years or so in the procession: "Here, you, if you're not inthe reserve I have work for you!""But I was excused from army service on account of heart trouble!"explained the able-bodied citizen."We all have heart trouble to-day," remarked the major pithily. "Men aregiving up their lives in defence of you and your property. Every man ofyour age must do his share when required. Go with this orderly!" was thefinal and tart conclusion of the argument. "And see that he is madeuseful," he added to the orderly.An explosion in the factory district made windows rattle and brought anhysterical outcry from some of the women."It's nothing!" the major called, in the assurance of a shepherd to hissheep. "Blowing up some building that furnish cover for the enemy'sapproach in front of our infantry positions! You will hear more of it.Don't worry! Do as you're told! Keep moving! Keep moving!"Now he had time to conclude what he had to say to Marta."As your house will soon be under fire, it will be not refuge for thechildren; and, in any event, we should net want to leave them to thecare of the Grays with the parents on our side," he explained in amanner none the less final because of its politeness. "Every detail hasbeen systematically arranged under government supervision. Privateefforts will only bring confusion and hardship where we would have orderand all possible mercy. As for the old, the sick, and the infirm--thosewho cannot bear being carried far are being moved to the hospital andbarracks outside the town."In proof of his words, ambulances and requisitioned carriages filledwith the sick and infirm were already proceeding up one of the sidestreets."It's not human, though!" Marta exclaimed in the desperation ofhelplessness."No, it is war, which has a habit of being inhuman," replied the major,turning to call to a woman: "Now, madame, if you leave that pillowbehind you will not be dropping your other things and having to stop allthe time to pick them up!""But it's the finest goose feathers and last year's crop!" said thewoman; and then gasped: "Oh, Lord! I left my silver jug on the mantel!""As I've told you before--as the printed slips we distributed when wewoke you at dawn told you," said the major with some asperity, "you wereto take only light things easily portable, and after you had gone,wagons would get what you had packed and left ready at the door of yourhouses, with your names clearly marked, up to two hundred pounds. Therest we trust to the mercy of the Grays."There was nothing for Marta to do but start homeward. The thought thather mother was alone made her hasten at a pace much more rapid than theprocession of people, whose talk and exclamations formed a monotoneaudible in its nearness, despite the continuous rifle-fire, now brokenby the pounding of the guns."I wish I had brought the clock--it was my great-grandfather's.""Johnny, you keep close to me!""And they've taken my wife off to the hospital--separated us!"Some were excruciatingly alive to the situation; others were in a daze.But one cry always roused them from their complaints; always brought aflash to the dullest eye: Retribution! retribution! Taken from theirpeaceful pursuits arbitrarily by the final authority of physical force,which they could not dispute, their minds turned in primitive passion torevenge through physical force."I hope our army makes them pay!""Yes, make them pay! Make them pay!""It's all done to beat the Grays, isn't it, Miss Galland? They aretrying to take our land," said Jacky Werther as Marta parted from him."Yes, it is done to beat the Grays," she answered. "Good luck, Jacky!"Yes, yes, to beat the Grays! The same, idea--the fighting nature, thebrute nature of man--animated both sides. Had the Browns really triedfor peace? Had they, in the spirit of her oath, appealed to justice andreason? Why hadn't their premier before all the world said to thepremier of the Grays, as one honest, friendly neighbor to another over amatter of dispute:"We do not want war. We know you outnumber us, but we know you wouldnot take advantage of that. If we are wrong we will make amends; if youare wrong we know that you will. Let us not play tricks in secret togain points, we civilized nations, but be frank with each other. Let usnot try to irritate each other or to influence our people, but torealize how much we have in common and that our only purpose is commonprogress and happiness."But no. This was against the precedent of Cain, who probably got Abelinto a cul-de-sac, handed down to the keeping of the Roman aristocrat,the baron, the first Galland, and the fat, pompous little man. It woulddeprive armies of an occupation. It would make statesmanship too simpleand naive to have the distinction of craft, which gave one man the rightto lead another. Both sides had to act in the old fashion of mutualsuspicion and chicanery.She was overwrought in the fervor of her principles; she was in ananguish of protest. Her spirit, in arms against an overwhelming factthat was wrong, sinful, ridiculous, demanded some expression in action.Now she was half running, both running away from horror and towardhorror; in a shuttle of resolutions and emotions: a being at war withwar. Passing the head of the procession, she soon had the castle road toherself, except for orderlies on motor-cycles and horseback, until atrain of automobile wagons loaded with household goods roared by. Thefull orchestra of war was playing right and left: crashing, high-pitchedgun-booms near at hand; low-pitched, reverberating gun-booms in thedistance. At the turn of the road in front of the castle she saw thegunners of the batteries that Feller had watched approaching making anemplacement for their guns in a field of carrots that had not yet beenharvested. The roots of golden yellow were mixed with the tossingspadefuls of earth.A shadow like a great cloud in mad flight shot over the earth, and withthe gunners she looked up to see a Gray dirigible. Already it wasturning homeward; already it had gained its object as a scout. On thefragile platform of the gondola was a man, seemingly a human mite aiminga tiny toy gun. His target was one of the Brown aeroplanes."They're in danger of cutting their own envelope! They can't get theangle! The plane is too high!" exclaimed the artillery commander. Bothhe and his men forgot their work in watching the spectacle of aerialDavid against aerial Goliath. "If our man lands with his little bomb,oh, my!" he grinned. "That's why he is so high. He's been waiting upthere.""Pray God he will!" exclaimed one of the gunners."Look at him volplane--motor at full speed, too!"The pilot was young Etzel, who, as Lanstron had observed, would charge achurch tower if he were bidden. He was taking no risks in missing. Hisego had no cosmos except that huge, oblong gas-bag. He drove for it as ahawk goes for its prey. One life for a number of lives--the sacrifice ofa single aeroplane for a costly dirigible--that was an exchange in favorof the Browns. And Etzel had taken an oath in his heart--not standing ona cafe table--that he would never let any dirigible that he attackedescape."Into it! Making sure! Oh, splen--O!" cried the artillery commander.A ball of lightning shot forth sheets of flame. Dirigible and plane werehidden in an ugly swirl of yellowish smoke, rolling out into a purplecloud that spread into prismatic mist over the descent of cavortinghuman bodies and broken machinery and twisted braces, flying pieces oftattered or burning cloth. David has taken Goliath down with him in adeath grip.An aeroplane following the dirigible as a screen, hoping to get homewith information if the dirigible were lost, had escaped thesharpshooters in the church tower by flying around the town. However, itran within range of the automatic and the sharpshooters on top of thecastle tower. They failed of the bull's-eye, but their bullets, rimmingthe target, crippling the motor, and cutting braces, brought thecrumpling wings about the helpless pilot. The watching gunners uttered"Ahs!" of horror and triumph as they saw him fall, gliding this way andthat, in the agony of slow descent."Come, now!" called the artillery commander. "We are wasting precioustime."Entering the grounds of the Galland house, Marta had to pass to one sideof the path, now blocked by army wagons and engineers' materials andtools. Soldiers carrying sand-bags were taking the shortest cut,trampling the flowers on their way."Do you know whose property this is?" she demanded in a burst of anger."Ours--the nation's!" answered one, perspiring freely at his work."Sorry!" he added on second thought.Already parts of the first terrace were shoulder-high with sand-bags andone automatic had been set in place, Marta observed as she turned to theveranda. There her mother sat in her favorite chair, hands relaxed asthey rested on its arms, while she looked out over the valley in thesupertranquillity that comes to some women under a strain--as soldierswho have been on sieges can tell you--that some psychologists interpretone way and some another, none knowing even their own wives."Marta, did any of the children come?" Mrs. Galland asked in her usualpleasant tone. So far as she was concerned, the activity on the terracedid not exist. She seemed oblivious of the fact of war."Yes, seven.""And did you hold your session?""Yes."Marta's monosyllables absently answering the questions were expressiveof her wonder at her mother. Most girls do not know their mothers muchbetter than psychologists know their wives."I am glad of that, Marta. I am glad you went and sorry that I opposedyour going, because, Marta, whatever happens one should go regularlyabout what he considers his duty," said Mrs. Galland. "They have been asconsiderate as they could, evidently by Colonel Lanstron's orders," sheproceeded, nodding toward the industrious engineers. "And they've packedall the paintings and works of art and put them in the cellar, wherethey will be safe."The captain of engineers in command, seeing Marta, hurried toward her."Miss Galland, isn't it?" he asked. "I have been waiting for you.I--I--well, I found that I could not make the situation clear to yourmother.""He thinks me in my second childhood or out of my head," Mrs. Gallandexplained with a shade of tartness. "And he has been so polite in tryingto conceal his opinion, too," she added with a comprehending smile.The captain flushed in embarrassment."I--I can't speak too strongly," he declared when he had regained hiscomposure. "Though everything seems safe here now, it may not be in anhour. You must go, all of you. This house will be in an inferno as soonas the 53d falls back, and I can't possibly get your mother toappreciate the fact, Miss Galland.""But I said that I did appreciate it and that the Gallands have been ininfernos before--perhaps not as bad as the one that is coming--but,then, the Gallands must keep abreast of the times," replied Mrs.Galland. "I have asked Minna and she prefers to remain. I am glad ofthat. I am glad now that we kept her, Marta. She is as loyal as my oldmaid and the butler and the cook were to your grandmother in the lastwar. Ah, the Gallands had many servants then!""This isn't like the old war. This place will be shelled, enfiladed! Andyou two--" the captain protested desperately."I became a Galland when I married," said Mrs. Galland, "and theGalland women have always remained with their property in time of war.Naturally, I shall remain!""Miss Galland, it was you--your influence I was counting on to--" Thecaptain turned to Marta in a final appeal.Mrs. Galland was watching her daughter's face intently."We stay!" replied Marta, and the captain saw in the depths of her eyes,a cold blue-black, that further argument was useless.With a shrug of his shoulders he was turning to go when his lieutenant,hurrying up and pointing to the row of lindens at the edge of theestate, exclaimed:"If we only had those trees out of the way! They cut the line of ourfire! They form cover and protection for the enemy.""The orders are against it," replied the captain."Lanstron may be a great soldier, but--" declared the lieutenantpetulantly."Cut the lindens if it will help the Browns!" called Mrs. Galland."Cut the lindens, mother! Is everything to be destroyed--everything tosatisfy the appetite of savagery?" exclaimed Marta. Then, in an abruptchange of mood, inexplicable to the captain and even to herself, sheadded: "My mother says to cut the lindens. And you will tell us when togo into the house?" Marta asked the captain."Yes. There is no danger yet--none until we see the 53d falling back."What mockery, what uncanny staginess for either her mother or herself tobe so calm! Yet, what else were they to do? Were they to scream? Or fallinto each other's arms and sob? Marta found a strange pleasure inlooking at her garden before it was spattered with blood, as it had beenin the last war. It had never seemed more beautiful. There was asublimity in nature's obliviousness to the thrashing of the air withshells in a gentle breeze that fluttered the petals of the hydrangeas.The sight of Feller coming along the path of the second terrace broughtin sudden vividness to her mind that question which must soon bedecided: whether or not she would allow him to remain to carry out hisplan. He still had the garden-shears in hand. He was walking with theslow and soft step which was in keeping with the serenity of hisoccupation. Pausing before the chrysanthemum bed, he touched his hat,and as he awaited her approach he lifted one of the largest blooms thatwas drooping from its weight on the slender stem."They look well, don't you think?" he asked cautiously; and he was verycool, while his eyes had a singular limpidity, speaking better than anywords the sadness of his story and the dependence of his hope ofregeneration upon her."Yes, quite the best they ever have," she replied, inclined to look awayfrom him, conscious of her sensitiveness to his appeal, and yet stilllooking at him, while she marvelled at him, at herself, at everything."Thank you," he said. "You don't know how much that means, how pleased Iam."Now came the sweep of a rising roar from the sky with the command toattention of the rush of a fast express-train past a country railwaystation. Two Gray dirigibles with their escort of aeroplanes--information like that which Mrs. Galland and Feller had seen race alongthe frontier--were bearing toward the pass over the pass road. Oneglimpse of the squadron was as a match to Feller's military passion. Heswept off his old straw hat and with it all of the gardener's chrysalis.Feller the artillerist gazed aloft in feverish excitement."Lanny has them guessing! They're bound to know his plans if it takesall the air craft in the shop!" he exclaimed. "And what are we doing?Yes, what are we doing?" he cried in alarm as his glance swept the skyin front of the squadron, already even with the terrace in its terrificspeed.The automatic and the riflemen in the tower banged away to no purpose,for the aerostatic officers of the Grays had been apprised of the dangerin that direction."Minutes, seconds count! Where are our high-angle guns?" Feller went on.He was unconsciously gesticulating with all the fervor of hurrying abattery into place to cover an infantry retreat in a crisis. "Andthey're turning! What's the matter? What are high-angle guns for,anyway, with such targets naked over our lines? Ah-h! Beautiful!"The central sections of the envelope of the rear dirigible had been tornin shreds; it was buckling. Clouds of blue shrapnel smoke broke aroundits gondola. A number of field-guns joined forces with a battery ofhigh-angle guns in a havoc that left a drifting derelict that had ceasedto exist to Feller's mind immediately it was out of action; for he sawthat the remainder of the squadron had completed its loop and waspointing toward the plain."And they were low enough to see all they want to know and risingnow--evidently already out of reach of our guns--and nothing againstthem!" he groaned as he saw a clear sky ahead of the big disk and itsattending wings, while clenched fists pumping up and down with themovement of his forearms shook his whole body in a palpitation of angrydisgust. "Lanny, what's the matter! Lanny, they've beaten you! Eh? What?What--" A long whistle broke from his lips. His body still, transfixed,he cupped his hands over his eyes. "So, that is it! That is your plan,Lanny, old boy!" he shouted. "But if one of their confounded littleaviators gets back, he has the story!"From a great altitude, literally out of the blue of heaven, high overthe Gray lines, Marta made out a Brown squadron of dirigibles and planesdescending across the track of the Grays."Catch them as they come back! Between them and home--between thebadger and his hole!" Feller went on explosively; and then, while thetwo squadrons were approaching at countering angles, he breathed thethoughts that the spectacle aroused in his quick brain: "This iswar--war! Talk about your old-fashioned, take-snuff-my-card-sir courage,pray-and-swear courage--what about this? What about old Lanny's chosenmen of the air, without boasts or oaths, offering their lives in no wildcharge, but coolly, hand on lever, concentratedly, scientifically, insane, twentieth-century fashion, just to keep our positions secret!Now--now for it!"The Gray dirigibles, stern on, were little larger than umbrellas and theplanes than swallows; the Brown dirigibles, side on, were big sausagesand their planes specks. To the eye, this meeting was like that of twosmall flocks of soaring birds apparently unable to change their course.But imagination could picture the fearful crash of forces, whose woundedwould find the succor of no hospital except impact on the earth below.Marta put her hands over her eyes for only a second, she thought, beforeshe withdrew them in vexation--hadn't she promised herself not to becowardly?--to see one Brown dirigible and two Brown aeroplanes ascendingat a sharp angle above a cloud of smoke to escape the high-angle guns ofthe Grays."We've got them all! No lips survive to tell what the eye saw!"exclaimed Feller, his words bubbling with the joy of water in thesunlight. "As I thought," he continued in professional enthusiasm anddiscrimination. "We are getting the theory of one feature of the newwarfare in practice. It isn't like the popular dream of wiping outarmies by dropping bombs as you sail overhead. The force of gravity isagainst the fliers. You have only to bring them to earth to put them outof action. Plane driven into plane dirigible into dirigible, and an endof bomb-dropping and scouting! War will still be won by the infantryand the guns. Yes, the guns--the new guns! They--"Feller recalled with a nervous shock flashing through his system that hewas a gardener, a gentle old gardener. He put his hat back on a headalready bent, while the shoulders, after a pathetic shrug, drew togetherin the accustomed stoop. His slim fingers slipped under the largestchrysanthemum blossom, his attitude the same as when he had held it upfor Marta's inspection before they heard the roar of the Gray squadron'smotors."I think that we might cut them all now and fill the vases," hesuggested, a musical, ingratiating note in his voice. "To-morrow we maynot have a chance.""Yes," she agreed mechanically, her thoughts still dwelling on thecollision of the squadrons."And some of the finest ones for you to take now," he added, plying theshears as he made his selections. "I'll bring the rest," he concludedwhen he had gathered a dozen choice blossoms.His fingers touched hers as the stems changed hands. In his eyes,showing just below the rim of his hat, was the light which she had seenfirst during the dramatic scene in his sitting-room and the appeal ofdeference, of suffering, and of the boyish hope of a cadet.XXISHE CHANGES HER MINDThe indefatigable captain of engineers had turned spectator. Withhigh-power binoculars glued to his eyes, he was watching to see if thefaint brown line of Dellarme's men were going to hold or break. If itheld, he might have hours in which to complete his task; if it broke, hehad only minutes.Marta came up the terrace path from the chrysanthemum bed in time towatch the shroud of shrapnel smoke billowing over the knoll, tovisualise another scene in place of the collision of the squadrons, andto note the captain's exultation over Fracasse's repulse."How we must have punished them!" he exclaimed to his lieutenant. "Howwe must have mowed them down! Lanstron certainly knew what he wasdoing.""You mean that he knew how we should mow them down?" asked Marta.Not until she spoke did he realize that she was standing near him."Why, naturally! If we hadn't mowed them down his plan would havefailed. Mowing them down was the only way to hold them back," he said;and seeing her horror made haste to add: "Miss Galland, now you knowwhat a ghastly business war is. It will be worse here than there.""Yes," she said blankly. Her colorless cheeks, her drooping underlipconvinced him that now, with a little show of masculine authority, hewould gain his point."You and your mother must go!" he said firmly.This was the very thing to whip her thoughts back from the knoll. Hewas thunderstruck at the transformation: hot color in her cheeks, eyesaflame, lips curving around a whirlwind of words."You name the very reason why I wish to stay. Why do you want to savethe women? Why shouldn't they bear their share? Why don't you want themto see men mowed down? Is it because you are ashamed of your profession?Why, I ask?"The problem of dealing with an angry woman breaking a shell fire ofquestions over his head had not been ready-solved in the captain'scurriculum like other professional problems, nor was it mentioned in theofficial instructions about the defences of the Galland house. He aimedto smile soothingly in the helplessness of man in presence of femininefury."It is an old custom," he was saying, but she had turned away."Picking flowers! What mockery! Lanny's plan--mow them down! mow themdown! mow them down!" she went on, more to herself than to him, as shedropped the chrysanthemums on the veranda table.In a fire of resolution she hastened back down the terrace steps. TheGrays and the Browns were fighting in their way for their causes; shemust fight in her way for hers. Stopping before Feller, she seemedtaller than her usual self and quivering with impatience."Have you connected the wire to the telephone yet?" she asked abruptly."No, not yet," he answered."Then please come with me to the tower!"Whatever his fears, he held them within the serene bounds of thegardener's personality, while his covert glimpse of her warned himagainst the mistake of trying to dam the current of a passion running sostrong."Certainly, Miss Galland," he said agreeably, quite as if there werenothing unusual in her attitude. No word passed between them as he keptpace with her rapid gait along the path, but out of the corner of hiseye he surveyed in measuring admiration and curiosity the straight lineof nose and forehead under its heavy crown of hair, with a few detachedand riotous tendrils."Bring a lantern!" she said, as they entered his sitting-room, in a waythat left no excuse for refusal.When he had brought the lantern she took it from his hand and led theway into the tunnel."Please make the connection so that I can speak to Lanny!" sheinstructed him after she had pressed the button and the panel door ofthe telephone recess flew open.For an instant he hesitated; then curiosity and the unremittingauthority of her tone had their way. He dropped to his knees, ran hisfingers into an aperture between two stones and made a jointure of twowire ends."All ready!" he said, and eagerly. What a delightfully spirited rage shewas in! And what the devil was she going to do, anyway?As she took the receiver from the hook she heard an electric bell at theother end of the line, but no "Hello!""The bell means that Lanny will be called if he is there. No one excepthim is to talk over this telephone," Feller explained softly.Marta waited for some time before she heard a familiar, calm voice, witha faint echo of irritation over being interrupted in the midst ofpressing duties."Well, Gustave, old boy, it can't be that you are in touch withWesterling yet?""It is I--Marta!" and she came abruptly to the flaming interrogationthat had brought her there. "I want to ask a question. I want a clearanswer--I want everything clear! If Feller's plan succeeds it means thatyou will know where the Grays are going to attack?""Yes; why, yes, Marta!""So that you can mow them down?""That is one way of putting it--yes.""If I keep your secret--if I let the telephone remain, I am anaccomplice! I shall not be that--not to any kind of murder! I shall notlet the telephone remain!""As you will, Marta," he replied. "But anything that leads to victorymeans less slaughter in the end. For we have tested our army well enoughto know that only when it is decimated will it ever retreat from itsmain line of defence.""The old argument!" she answered bitterly."As you will, Marta! Only, Marta--I plead with you--please, please leavethe house!" he begged passionately.Again that request, which was acid to the raw spot of her anger! Againthat assumption that she must desert her own home because uninvitedguests would make it the theatre of their quarrel! How clear andunassailable her reply in the purview of her distraught logic!"Why particularly care for one life when you deal in lives by thewholesale?" she demanded. "Why think of my life when you are takingother lives every minute?""Because I am human, not just a machine! Because yours is the one lifeof all to me--because I love you!" Feller, getting only one side of thetalk, cautiously watching her as he held up the lantern to throw herface more clearly in relief, saw her start and caught the sound of aquick indrawing of breath between her lips, while something electricquivered through her frame. Then, as one who has twinged from apin-prick of distraction which she will not permit to waive her from awhite-heat purpose, she exclaimed, in rapid, stabbing, desperatesentences:"That! That now! After what I said to you a week ago! That in the midstof your mowing! No, no, no!" She drove the receiver down on the hook andblazed out to Feller: "Now you will tear out the 'phone'"He steadied himself against the wall, covering his face with his hands,and for the first time in her life she heard a man sob."My one chance--my last chance--gone!" he said brokenly. "The chancefor me to redeem myself, so that I might again look at the flag withoutshame, taken from me in the name of mercy, when, by helping to bringvictory and shorten the war, I might have saved thousands of lives!" heproceeded dismally."The old argument! Lanny has just used it!" said Marta. But coming froma man sobbing it sounded differently. His hands fell away from his faceas if they were a dead weight. She saw him a wreck of a human being withonly his eyes alive, regarding her in harrowing wonder and reproach."When I was a gardener eating at the kitchen table, playing the part ofa spy--I who was honor man at the military school--I who had aconscience that sent me back from the free life on the plains to try toatone--when I hoped to do this thing in order to prove that I was fit todie if not to live----"He was as a man pitting his last grain of strength against overwhelmingodds. There were long, poignant pauses between his sentences as heseemed to strive for coherence."--in order to prove it for my country, for Lanny, and for you who havebeen so kind to me!" he concluded, another dry sob shaking him.His chin dropped to his breast. Even the spark in his eyes flickeredout. In the feeble lantern light that deepened the shadows of his facehe was indescribably pitiful. She could not look away from him. Therewas something infectious about his misery that compelled her to feelwith his nerves."Please," he pleaded faintly--"please leave me to myself. I will tearout the telephone--trust me--only I wish to be alone. I am uncertain--Isee only dark!"He sank lower against the wall, his head fell forward, though not so farbut he could see her from under his eyebrows. She started as she had atthe telephone, her breath came in the same sweep between her lips, andhe looked for a passionate refusal; but it did not come. She seemed insome spell of recollection or projection of thought. A lustrous veil wasover her eyes. She was not looking at him or at anything in the range ofher vision. She shuddered and abruptly seized her left wrist with herright hand, as Lanstron had in the arbor, which had brought her cry of"I'm hurting you!" In this inscrutable attitude she was silent for atime."Let it remain--it means so much to you!" she said wildly, and hurriedpast him still clasping her wrist.He stared into the darkness that closed around her. With the last soundof her footsteps he became another Gustave Feller, who, all mercurialvivacity, clucked his tongue against the roof of his mouth with a "La,la, la!" as his hand shot out for the receiver. There it paused, andstill another idea animated still another Gustave Feller."Why not tear out the telephone--why not?" he mused. "Why didn't I agreeto her plan? Why can't I ever carry more than one thing in mind at once?I forgot that we were at war. I forget that I am already at the front. Ihave skill! God knows, I ought to have courage! Volunteers who have bothare always welcome in war. Any number of gunners will be killed! When anartillery colonel saw what I could do he would take me on withoutfurther questioning. Then I should not be a spy, shuffling and whining,but bang-bang-bang on the target!"In imagination he now had a gun. His hand made a movement ofmanipulation, head bent, eye sighting."How do you like that? You will like this one less! And here'sanother--but, no, no!" He dropped against the wall again; he drove hisnails into his palms in a sort of castigation. "I am the same as asoldier now--a soldier assigned to a definite duty for my flag. I shouldbreak my word of honor--a soldier's word of honor! No, not that again!"He snatched down the receiver to make sure that temptation did notreappear in too luring a guise, and still another Gustave Feller was inthe ascendant."Didn't I say to trust it to me, Lanny?" he called merrily. "MissGalland consents!""She does? Good! Good for you, Gustave!""Her second thought," Feller rejoined. "And, Lanny," he proceeded inboyish enthusiasm, using a slang word of military school days, "it wasbulludgeous the way we brought down their planes and dirigibles! How Iache to be in it when the guns are so busy! With batteries back of thehouse and an automatic in the yard, things seem very homelike. I--""Gustave," interrupted Lanstron, "we all have our weaknesses, andperhaps yours is to play a part. So keep away from the fight and don'tthink of the guns!""I will, I swear!" Feller answered fervently. "One thought, one duty!I'll 'phone you when the house is taken, and if you don't hear from meagain, why, you'll know the plan has failed and I'm a prisoner. But,trust me, Lanny! Trust me--for my flag and my country against theinvader!""Against the invader--that justifies all! And get Miss Galland out ofit. You seem to have influence with her. Get her out of it!""Trust me!""Bless you, and God with you!""One thought, one duty!" repeated Feller with the devoutness of a monktrying to forget everything except his aves as he started toward thestairway. "I wonder if we still hold the knoll!" he mused, extinguishingthe lantern. "We do! we do!" he cried when he was in the doorway. "Oh,this is life!" he added after a deep-drawn breath, watching the littleclouds of shrapnel smoke here and there along the base of the range.XXIIFLOWERS FOR THE WOUNDEDWas there nothing for Marta to do? Could she only look on in a fever ofrestlessness while action roared around her? On the way from the towerto the house the sight of several automobile ambulances in the road atthe foot of the garden stilled the throbs of distraction in her templeswith an answer. The wounded! They were already coming in from the field.She hurried down the terrace steps. The major surgeon in charge,surprised to find any woman in the vicinity, was about to tell her soautomatically; then, in view of her intensity, he waited for her tospeak."You will let us do something for them?" Marta asked. "We will make themsome hot soup."He was immediately businesslike. No less than Dellarme or Fracasse orLanstron or Westerling, he had been preparing throughout hisprofessional career for this hour. The detail of caring for the men whowere down had been worked out no less systematically than that ofwounding them."Thank you, no! We don't want to waste time," he replied. "We must getthem away with all speed so that the ambulances may return promptly.It's only a fifteen-minute run to the hospital, where every comfort andappliance are ready and where they will be given the right things toeat.""Then we will give them some wine!" Marta persisted."Not if we can prevent it! Not to start hemorrhages! The field doctorshave brandy for use when advisable, and there is brandy with all theambulances."Clearly, volunteer service was not wanted. There was no room at theimmediate front for Florence Nightingales in the modern machine of war."Then water?"The major surgeon aimed to be patient to an earnest, attractive youngwoman."We have sterilized water--we have everything," he explained. "If wehadn't at this early stage I ought to be serving an apprenticeship in avillage apothecary shop. Anything that means confusion, delay,unnecessary excitement is bad and unmerciful."Marta was not yet at the end of her resources. The recollection of thedying private who had asked her mother for a rose in the last warflashed into mind."You haven't flowers! They won't do any harm, even if they aren'tsterilized. The wounded like flowers, don't they? Don't you likeflowers? Look! We've millions!""Yes, I do. They do. A good idea. Bring all the flowers you want to."The major surgeon's smile to Marta was not altogether on account of hersuggestion. "It ought to help anybody who was ever wounded anywhere inthe world to have you give him a flower!" he was thinking.She ran for an armful of blossoms and was back before the arrival of thefirst wounded man who preceded the stretchers on foot. He was holding upa hand bound in a white first-aid bandage which had a red spot in thecentre. Those hit in hand or arm, if the surgeon's glance justified it,were sent on up the road to a point a mile distant, where transportationin requisitioned vehicles was provided. These men were triumphant intheir cheerfulness. They were alive; they had done their duty, and theyhad the proof of it in the coming souvenirs of scars.Some of the forms on stretchers had peaceful faces in unconsciousnessof their condition. Others had a look of wonder, of pain, ofapprehension in their consciousness that death might be near. The singleword "Shrapnel!" by a hospital-corps corporal told the story of crushedor lacerated features, in explanation of a white cloth covering a headwith body uninjured.Feller, strolling out into the garden under the spell of watching shellbursts, saw what Marta was doing. With the same feeling of relief atopportunity for action that she had felt, he hastened to assist her,bringing flowers by the basketful and pausing to watch her distributethem--watching her rather than the wounded and enjoying incidentalthrills at examples of the efficiency of artillery fire."The guns--the guns are going to play a great part!" he thought. "Theserapid-firers will recover all the artillery's prestige of Napoleon'stime!"Many of the wounded themselves looked at Marta even more than at theflowers. It was good to see the face of a woman, her eyes limpid withsympathy, and it was not what she said but the way she spoke thatbrought smiles in response to hers. For she was no solemn ministeringangel, but high-spirited, cheery, of the sort that the major surgeonwould have chosen to distribute flowers to the men. Every remark of thevictims of war made its distinct and indelible impression on thegelatine of her mind."I like my blue aster better than that yellow weed of yours, Tom!""You didn't know Ed Schmidt got it? Yes, he was right next me in theline.""Say, did you notice Dellarme's smile? It was wonderful.""And old Bert Stransky! I heard him whistling the wedding march as hefired.""Miss, I'll keep this flower forever!""They say Billy Lister will live--his cheek was shot away!""Once we got going I didn't mind. It seemed as if I'd been fighting foryears!""Hole no bigger than a lead-pencil. I'll be back in a week!""Yes; don't these little bullets make neat little holes?""We certainly gave them a surprise when they came up the hill! I wonderif we missed the fellow that jumped into the shell crater!""Our company got it worst!""Not any worse than ours, I'll wager!""Oh--oh--can't you go easier? Oh-h-h--" the groan ending in a clenchingof the teeth."Hello, Jake! You here, too, and going in my automobile? And we've bothgot lower berths!""Sh-h! That poor chap's dying!"Worst of all to Marta was the case of a shrapnel fracture of thecranium, with the resulting delirium, in which the sufferer'sincoherence included memories of childhood scenes, moments on thefiring-line, calls for his mother, and prayers to be put out of misery.A prod of the hypodermic from the major surgeon, and "On theoperating-table in fifteen minutes" was the answer to Marta's questionif the poor fellow would live.Until dark, in groups, at intervals, and again singly, the wounded werecoming in from a brigade front in the region where the rifles werecrackling and the shrapnel clouds were hanging prettily over the hills;and stretchers were being slipped into place in the ambulances, whileMarta kept at her post."We shan't have much more to do at this station," said the major surgeonwhen a plodding section of infantry in retreat arrived.XXIIISTRANSKY FIGHTS ALONEEvery unit engrossed in his own work! Every man taught how a weak linkmay break a chain and realizing himself as a link and only a link! Thecaptain of engineers forgot Marta's existence as an error of hissubordinates caught his eye, and he went to caution the axemen to cutcloser to the ground, as stumps gave cover for riflemen. For the timebeing he had no more interest in the knoll than in the wreckage ofdirigibles which were down and out of the fight.After all, the knoll was only a single point on the vast staff map--onlyone of many points of a struggle whose progress was bulletined throughthe siftings of regimental, brigade, division, and corps headquarters innet results to the staff. Partow and Lanstron overlooked all. Theirknowledge made the vast map live under their eyes. But our concern iswith the story of two regiments, and particularly of two companies, andthat is story enough. If you would grasp the whole, multiply theconflict on the knoll by ten thousand.There had been the engrossment of transcendent emotion in repelling thecharge. What followed was like some grim and passionless trance withtriggers ticking off the slow-passing minutes. Dellarme aimed to keepdown the fusillade from Fracasse's trench and yet not to neglect thefair targets of the reserves advancing by rushes to the support of the128th. Reinforced, the gray streak at the bottom of the slope poured ina heavier fire. Above the steady crackle of bullets sent and the whistleof bullets received rose the cry of "Doctor! Doctor!" which meant eachtime that another Brown rifle had been silenced. The litter bearers,hard pressed to remove the wounded, left the dead. Already death was afamiliar sight--an article of exchange in which Dellarme's men dealtfreely. The man at Stransky's side had been killed outright. He lay facedown on his rifle stock. His cap had fallen off. Stransky put it back onthe man's head, and the example was followed in other cases. It was agood idea to keep up a show of a full line of caps to the enemy.Suddenly, as by command, the fire from the base of the knoll ceasedaltogether. Dellarme understood at once what this meant--the next stepin the course of a systematic, irresistible approach by superiornumbers. It was to allow the ground scouts to advance. Individual grayspots detaching themselves from the gray streak began to crawl upward insearch of dead spaces where the contour of the ground would furnish someprotection from the blaze of bullets from the crest."Over their heads! Don't try to hit them!" Dellarme passed the word."That's it! Spare one to get a dozen!" said Stransky, grinning in readycomprehension. He seemed to be grinning every time that Dellarme lookedin that direction. He was plainly enjoying himself. His restless naturehad found sport to its taste.The creeping scouts must have signalled back good news, for groups begancrawling slowly after them."Over their heads! Encourage them!" Dellarme commanded.After they had advanced two or three hundred yards they stopped,shoulders and hands exposed in silhouette, and began to work feverishlywith their spades."Now let them have it!""Oh, beautiful!" cried Stransky. "That baby captain of ours has somebrains, after all! We'll get them now and we'll get them when they run!"But they did not run. Unfalteringly they took their punishment whilethey turned over the protecting sod in the midst of their own dead andwounded. In a few minutes they had dropped spades for rifles, and othersections either crawled or ran forward precipitately and fell to thetask of joining the isolated beginnings into a single trench.Again Dellarme looked toward regimental headquarters, his fixed, cheerysmile not wholly masking the appeal in his eyes. The Grays had only twoor three hundred yards to go when they should make their next charge inorder to reach the crest. But his men had fifteen hundred to go in thevalley before they were out of range. After their brave resistancefacing the enemy they would receive a hail of bullets in their backs.This was the time to withdraw if there were to be assurance of a saferetreat. But there was no signal. Until there was, he must remain.The trench grew; the day wore on. Two rifles to one were now playingagainst his devoted company, which had had neither food nor drink sinceearly morning. As he scanned his thinning line he saw a look ofbloodlessness and hopelessness gathering on the set faces of which hehad grown so fond during this ordeal. Some of the men were crouching toomuch for effective aim."See that you fire low! Keep your heads up!" he called. "For your homes,your country, and your God! Pass the word along!"Parched throat after parched throat repeated the message hoarsely andleaden shoulders raised a trifle and dust-matted eyelashes narrowedsharply on the sights."For the man in us!" growled Stransky. "For the favor of nature at birththat gave us the right to wear trousers instead of skirts! For the joyof hell, give them hell!""For our homes! For the man in us!" they repeated, swallowing the wordsas if they had the taste of a stimulant. But Dellarme knew that itwould not take much to precipitate a break. He himself felt that he hadbeen on that knoll half a lifetime. He looked at his watch and it wasfive o'clock. For seven hours they had held on. The Grays' trench wascomplete the breadth of the slope; more reserves were coming up. Thebrigade commander of the Grays was going to make sure that the nextcharge succeeded.At last Dellarme's glance toward regimental headquarters showed the flagthat was the signal for withdrawal. Could he accomplish it? The firstlieutenant, with a shattered arm, had gone on a litter. The old sergeantwas dead, a victim of the colonial wars. Used to fighting savageenemies, he had been too eager in exposing himself to a civilized foe.He had been shot through the throat."Men of the first section," Dellarme called, "you will slip out of linewith the greatest care not to let the enemy know that you are going!""Going--going! Careful! Men of the first section going!" the parchedthroats repeated in a thrilling whisper."Those who remain keep increasing their fire!" called Dellarme again."Cover the whole breadth of the trench!"Every fourth man wormed himself backward on his stomach until he wasbelow the sky-line, when his stiffened limbs brought him to his feet andhe started on a dead run down into the valley and toward a cut behindanother knoll across the road from the Galland house."Tom Fragini, with your corporal dead I put you in charge of the firstsection! What are you waiting for, Corporal Fragini?"Tom was bending over Grandfather Fragini, who had been forgotten byeverybody in the ordeal. The old man was lying where he had fallen afterthe first burst of shrapnel."Can't go! Got a game leg!" said grandfather, pointing to a swollenankle that had been bruised by a piece of shrapnel jacket that had lostmost of its velocity before striking him. "You do your duty and leave mealone. I ain't a fighting man any more. I done my work when I steadiedyou young fellows.""Yes, go on, Fragini," said Dellarme. "Attend to your men. Everybody inhis place. We'll get the old man away on a litter.""Yes, you go or you ain't any grandson of mine!" shouted the old man ina high-pitched voice. "Just been promoted, too! You'll be up forinsubordination in a minute, you young whelp!"Dellarme meant to look after grandfather, but his attention wasengrossed in seeing that his men withdrew cautiously, for every minutethat he was able to delay the enemy's charge was vital. He himselfpicked up a rifle in order to increase the volume of fire when the thirdsection was starting. As the fourth and last section drew off he utteredhis first cry of triumph of the day as his final look revealed the Graysstill in place. But they would not wait long once all fire from theknoll had ceased. Stransky, who was in the fourth section, remained togive a parting shot."Good-by, d---- you!" he called to the Grays. "You'll hear more from melater!"Then Dellarme saw that grandfather had not yet been carried away and nolitters remained. What was to be done? Grandfather was prompt with hisown view."Just leave me behind. I've done my work, I tell you!" he declared."Can't lose you, grandpop!" said Stransky.Quickly shifting his pack to the ground, he squatted with his back tothe old man."I ain't going to--and you're a traitor, anyway; that's what you are!""No back talk! No politics in this!" Stransky replied. "Get up! Youcarry your skin and I'll carry your bones. Get up quick!"With Dellarme's authoritative assistance grandfather mounted. ThenDellarme put Stransky's pack on his own back."Let me carry your rifle, too," he said to Stransky as they started."Not much!" answered Stransky. "I was just married to that rifle thismorning. We're on our honeymoon trip and getting fairly well acquainted,and expect shortly to settle down to a busy domestic life."He set off at a lope and gained the rear of the section in his firstburst of speed. As the other men got their second wind, however,Stransky began to puff and they soon drew away from him."Put me down! I ain't going to depend on any traitor that insulted theflag!" protested grandfather."That's the way! Call out to me now and then so I'll know you're there,"said Stransky. "You're so light I mightn't know it if you fell off."Dellarme did not think it right to expose the last section by asking itto delay. Shepherd of his flock and miser of his pieces of gold, nowthat their work was done the one thing he wanted in the world was thatthey should escape without further punishment. Already the van of thefirst section was disappearing into the cut in safety. But the fourthsection, which had held to the last, had yet a thousand yards to go overa path bare of cover except a single small bush. At any moment heexpected to hear a cheer from the knoll, and what would follow the cheerhe knew only too well. Yet he tarried with Stransky out of one man'simpulse not to desert another in danger. At the same time he was wrothwith the old man for having made such a nuisance of himself."What are you waiting for?" Stransky demanded of Dellarme."I like good company," answered Dellarme cheerfully."Compliment for you, grandfather!" said Stransky."Put me down!" screamed grandfather."Still there, eh? Thanks, grandpop!" said Stransky, turning onDellarme. "Can't you run any faster than that, captain? Your place iswith your men, sir. If you got wounded I'd have to carry you, too. Yourcompany's gaining on you every minute. Hurry up!"From the peremptory way that he spoke, Dellarme might have been theprivate and Stransky the officer."Right!" said Dellarme in face of such unanswerable military logic, andbroke into a run.Stransky adapted himself to a pace which he thought he could maintain,and plodded on, eyes on the bush as a half-way point. After a while heheard a mighty hurrah, which was cut short abruptly; then spits of dustabout their feet hastened the steps of the last section, which was nearthe cut. He saw men drop out of line to make a cradle of their arms forcomrades who had been hit; and these finally passed out of danger withtheir burdens."No flock in sight! It's the turn of the individual birds!" thoughtStransky, and heard a familiar sound about his ears."Bullets!" exclaimed grandfather. "Don't whistle like they used to. Theykind of crack and sizzle now. Maybe if they hit me I'll stop 'em, andthat'll save you.""That's so," replied Stransky glumly, realizing that he was running witha human shield on his back. "But they'll go right through him he's sothin," he thought in relief. The worst of it was that he had to receivewithout sending, which made him boil with rage. He wished that the bushhad legs so it could run toward him; he half believed that it had andwas retreating. "They're shooting right at us, and that's in our favor.It's hard to get the bull's-eye at that range," he assured grandfather.Whish-whish-whish! Enough pellets were singing by to have torn away therim of the target, yet none got the centre before Stransky droppedbehind the bush. Blessed bush! Back of it was a bowlder. Thrice-blessedbowlder! It protected grandfather as securely as the armor of abattleship."We are having a noisy time," remarked Stransky as two or three of theleaves fell. "Intelligent thieves! How did you guess we were here?" andhe put his big thumb to his big nose."But they didn't know about the bowlder!" said the old man with a senilegiggle. "Say, I didn't mean it when I called you a traitor--not afterthe fight! I just said that to make you mad so you'd put me down and weshouldn't lose a good fighting man trying to save an old bag of boneslike me. You ain't no traitor! You're a patriot!""More politics, when I'm simply full of cussedness!" grumbled Stransky."Not having any home, I'm fighting to save the other fellows' homes,principally because I was married this morning by a shrapnel-shell to alady that understands me perfectly. Say, shall we give them a few?" heasked with a squint down the bridge of his nose as he took up his rifle."Yes, give 'em a few!" grandfather urged when they ought to haveremained quiet, as the firing was dying down. It was not worth while toshoot at a bush, and after all the torrent of lead that they had pouredinto the bush the Grays had concluded that nothing behind it couldremain alive.Stransky aimed at a head and shoulder on the sky-line, which he took forthose of an officer, and was accurate enough to make the head andshoulders duck and to get a swarm of bullets in return."Children, why will you waste your country's ammunition?" said Stransky,firing again."That's the way to talk!" said grandfather approvingly. "Nothing like alittle gayety and ginger in war."Now a Brown battery whose fire could be spared from other work dropped afew shells on the knoll and so occupied the attention of the 128th thatit had no time to attend to occasional bullets from snipers."Think we're no account! Shall we charge them now we've got the supportof the guns?" chuckled Stransky."You Hussar, you!" Grandfather gave Stransky a slap on the back. "With athousand like you we could charge me whole army, if the general wouldlet us!""But he wouldn't let us," replied Stransky. "I could even tell you why."With the shadows gathering he slipped back to grandfather's side, andafter it was quite dark he said that it was time for the old Hussar tomount his fiery steed. Grandfather's hands slipped from aroundStransky's neck at the first trial; with the next, Stransky took thebony fingers in his grip and held them clasped on his chest with onehand, proceeding as quietly as he could, for he had an idea that theGrays were already moving down from the knoll under cover of night."Yes, sir, I'm glad I came!" said grandfather faintly and meanderingly."I wasn't sure about Tom--all this new-fangled education and theseuniforms without any color in 'em. But I saw him firing away steady as arock; yes, sir! I was in it, too, under fire! It made my heartthump-thump like the old days. And we're going to hold 'em--we're goingto teach the land-sharks--I'm very happy--made my heart thump so--kindof tired me--"The old man's voice died away into silence. His knees weakened theirgrip and his legs swung pendulum-like with Stransky's steps."What about me for a sleeping-car!" thought Stransky. "But he'scertainly harder to carry."Yet it pleased Stransky not to waken his passenger until they reachedthe station his ticket called for. Entering the cut, he was halted bythe challenging cry of "Who goes there?" in his own tongue."Stransky of the Reds!" he roared back. "Stransky, private of the53d--Stransky and his bride and grandfather!""All right, Bert!" was the answer. "Hurrah for you! I'd know your oldbull voice out of a thousand."Even this did not arouse grandfather. Stransky trudged on past thesentry, across a road and up three series of steps of a garden terrace,through a breach in a breastwork of sand-bags, and was again athome--the only home he knew--among the comrades of his company. Most ofthem had fallen asleep on the ground after finishing their rations, logsof men in animal exhaustion. Some of those awake were too weary to givemore than a nod and smile and an exclamation of delight. They hadwitnessed too much horror that day to be excited over a soldier with anold man on his back. A few of the others, including Tom Fragini,gathered around the pair."We've arrived, grandfather!" said Stransky, squatting. There was noanswer. "He certainly sleeps sound. I wonder if--.""Yes," said Dellarme, who with Tom eased the fall of the limp body.The thumping of an old man's heart with the youth of a Hussar had beentoo much for it."He was game!" said Stransky. "There isn't much in this world except tobe game, I've concluded; and you can't be so old or so poor or sobig-nosed and wall-eyed that you can't be game."Marta, coming out on the veranda, had not heard his remark, but she hadseen a leonine sort of private bearing an old man on his back and hadguessed that he had remained behind to save a life when every man inuniform had been engaged in taking life."You are tired! You are hungry!" she said with urgent gentleness. "Comein!"He followed her into the house and dropped on a leather chair before ashining table in a room panelled with oak, wondering at her and athimself. No woman of Marta's world had ever spoken in that way to him.But it was good to sit down. Then a maid with a sad, winsome face andtender eyes brought him wine and bread and cold meat and jam. He gulpeddown a glassful of the wine; he ate with great mouthfuls in the ravenouscall of healthy, exhausted tissues, while the maid stood by to cut morebread."When it comes to eating after fighting--"He looked up when the first pangs of hunger were assuaged. Enormous,broad-shouldered, physical, his cheeks flushed with the wine, his eyesopened wide and brilliant with the fire that was in his nature--eyesthat spoke the red business of anarchy and war."Say, but you're pretty!"Springing up, he caught her hand and made to kiss her in the brashnessof impulse. Minna struck him a stinging blow in the face. He received itas a mastiff would receive a bite from a pup, and she stood her ground,her eyes challenging his fearlessly."So you are like that!" he said thoughtfully. "It was a good one, andyou meant it, too.""Decidedly!" she answered. "There's more where that came from!""As I was telling the Grays this afternoon! Good for you!" He sat downagain composedly, while she glared at him. "I'm still hungry. I've hadwine enough; but would you cut me another slice of bread?"She cut another slice and he covered it generously with jam. Then littleClarissa Eileen entered and pressed against her mother's skirts,subjecting Stransky to childhood's scrutiny. He waved a finger at herand grinned and drew his eyes together in a squint at the bridge of hisnose, making a funny face that brought a laugh."Your child?" Stransky asked Minna."Yes.""Where's her father? Away fighting?""I don't know where he is!""Oh!" he mused. "Was that blow for him at the same time as for me?" hepursued thoughtfully."Yes, for all of your kind.""M-m-m!" came from between his lips as he rose. "Would you mind holdingout your hand?" he asked with a gentleness singularly out of keepingwith his rough aspect."Why?" she demanded."I've never studied any books of etiquette of polite society, and I am apoor sort at making speeches, anyhow. But I want to kiss a good woman'shand by way of apology. I never kissed one in my life, but I'm getting alot of new experiences to-day. Will you?"She held out her hand at arm's length and flushed slightly as he pressedhis lips to it."You certainly do cut thick slices of bread," he said, smiling. "And youcertainly are pretty," he added, passing out of the door as jauntily asif he were ready for another fight and just in time to see the colonelof the regiment come around the house. He stood at the salute, halfproudly, half defiantly, but in nowise humbly."Well, Major Dellarme!" was the colonel's greeting of the companycommander."Major?" exclaimed Dellarme."Yes. Partow has the power. Four of the aviators have iron crossesalready and promotion, too; and you are a major. Company G got into amess and the whole regiment would have been in one unless you held on.So I let you stay. It all came out right, as Lanstron planned--right sofar. But your losses have been heavy and here you are in the thick of itagain. Your company may change places with Company E, which has had arelatively easy time.""No, sir; we would prefer to stay," Dellarme answered quietly."Good! Then you will take this battalion and I'll transfer Groller toAlvery's Bad loss, Alvery--shrapnel. The artillery has been doing uglywork, but that is all in favor of the defensive. If we can hold them onthis line till to-morrow noon, it's all we want for the present," heconcluded."We'll hold them! Don't worry!" put in Stransky.If a private had spoken to a colonel in this fashion at drill, withoutbeing spoken to, it would have been a glaring breach of militaryetiquette. Now that they were at war it was different. Real comradeshipbetween officer and man begins with war."We shall, eh?" chuckled the colonel. "You look big enough to holdanything, young man! Here! Isn't this the fellow that Lanstron got off?""Yes, sir," answered Dellarme."Well, was Lanstron right?""Yes, sir.""Wonderful man, Lanstron!""He knows just' a little too much!" Stransky half growled.XXIVTHE MAKING OF A HEROA digression, this, about pale, little Peterkin, the valet's son, whomwe left nibbling a biscuit in perfect security after his leap in mortalterror. When Fracasse's men rose from their trench for the final chargeand found that the enemy had gone, Peterkin, hearing their cheer and thethunderous tread of their feet, dared to look above the edge of theshell crater. Here was his company coming and he not in the ranks wherehe belonged. Of course he ought to have gone back with them when theywent; whatever they did he ought to do. This was the only safe way forone of his incurable stupidity, as the drill sergeant had told himrepeatedly.He recognized the stocky butcher's son and other familiar figures amonghis comrades. Their legs, unlike his, had not been paralyzed withfright; they had been able to run. He was in an absolute minority ofone, which he knew, from the experience of his twenty years of life andhis inheritance as a valet's son, meant that he was utterly in thewrong. In a minute they would be sweeping down on him. They would bejeering him and calling him a rabbit or something worse for hiding inthe ground.Fright prompted him to a fresh impulse. Picking up his rifle, which hehad not touched since his leap, he faced toward the now unoccupied crestof the knoll and commenced firing. Meanwhile, Fracasse's men had reachedthe point where their first charge had broken, marked by a line ofbodies, including that of the manufacturer's son, who had thought thatwar would be beneficial as a deterrent to strikes and an impetus toindustry, lying with his head on his arm, his neck twisted, and thewhites of his eyes idled skyward. In a spasm of sickening realization ofhow impossible it was for those who had not run back to survive betweentwo lines of fire, they heard a shot from the ground at their feet andbeheld the runt of the company in the act of making war single-handed.It was a miracle! It was like the dead coming to life!"Peterkin?""Yes, Peterkin!""With a whole skin!"Probably it was a great mistake for him to have a whole skin, thoughtPeterkin. He scrambled to his feet and kept pace with the others, hopingthat he would be overlooked in the ranks."I'm so glad! Dear little Peterkin!" said Hugo Mallin, who was atPeterkin's side.His knowledge of Hugo's gentle nature convinced Peterkin that Hugo wastrying to soften the forthcoming reprimand.When their feet at last actually stood on the knoll which had dealtdeath to their ranks and they saw the brown figures of the enemy thathad driven them back in full flight, the men of the 128th felt thethrill of triumph won in the face of bullets. This is a thrill byitself, primitive and masculine, that calls the imagination of men towar for war's sake. Pilzer, the butcher's son, wanted to kill for thesheer joy and revenge of killing. He rejoiced in the dead and the bloodspots that, as clearly as the trench itself, marked the line thatDellarme's men had occupied along the crest of the knoll. It pleased himto use one of the bodies as a rest for his rifle, while he laid hissight in ecstasy on the large target of two men of the last section whowere bringing off one of the wounded, and he swore when they got away."But there's another out there all alone!" he cried. "Better say yourprayers, for I'm going to get you," he whispered; though, as we know,Stransky was not hit.Peterkin had been doing his best to make amends for past errors bypresent enthusiasm of application. He fired no less earnestly than thebutcher's son. Now that Eugene Aronson was dead, Pilzer had becomePeterkin's chief patron and guide. He would be doing right if he didwhat that brave Pilzer did, he was thinking, while he was conscious ofFracasse's eyes boring into his back. With the others, but no moreexpeditiously, however frightened, he fell back to cover from the burstof shell fire; and then, with the word to break ranks, he found himselfthe centre of a group including not only his captain but the colonel ofthe regiment. He could not quite make out the expressions on theirfaces, but he surmised that they were wondering how any man born underthe flag of the Grays could be such a coward as he was. Probably hewould be shot at sunrise."How did it happen?" Fracasse asked.His tone was very pleasant, but Peterkin felt that this was only thecalmness of a judge hearing the evidence of a culprit. Punishment wouldbe, accordingly, the more drastic. He was too scared to tell the truth.He spoke softly, with the mealy tongue of a valet father who neverexplained why the wine was low in the decanter by any reference to aweakness of his own palate."I didn't hear the whistle to fall back," he said, "so I stayed.""Didn't hear the whistle!" exclaimed the captain. He looked at thecolonel and the colonel looked at him. The colonel stroked his mustacheas if it were a nice mustache. "There wasn't any whistle," said Fracassewith a wry grin."Yes, my boy; and then?" asked the colonel, who had never before calledany private in his regiment "my boy."A bright light broke on Peterkin. Inherited instinct did not permit himto show much emotion on his face, and he had, too, an inherited gift ofinvention. He rubbed his rifle stock with his palm and bowed much inthe fashion of the parent washing his hands in gratitude for acompliment."And I didn't want to run," he continued. "I wanted to take that hill.That was what we were told to do, wasn't it, sir?""Yes, yes!" said the colonel. "Go on!"The light grew brighter, showing Peterkin's imagination the way tohigher flights."I jumped quick into the crater, knowing that if I jumped quick I wouldnot be hit," he proceeded, his thin voice accentuating his deferentialmodesty. "My! but the bullets were thick, going both ways! But Iremembered the lectures to recruits said that it took a thousand to killa man. I found that I had cover from the bullets from our side and somecover from their side. I could not lie there doing nothing, I decided,after I had munched biscuits for a while--""Coolly munching biscuits!" exclaimed the colonel."Yes, sir; so I began firing every time I had a chance and I picked offa number, I think, sir.""My boy," said the colonel, putting his hand on Peterkin's shoulder, "Iam going to recommend you for the bronze cross."The bronze cross--desired of generals and privates--for Peterkin, whenPilzer had been so confident that he should win the first that came tothe 128th now that Eugene Aronson was dead!"I--I--" stammered Peterkin."And so modest about it!" added the colonel. "Remembered the lectures torecruits and acted on them faithfully!"The old spirit of the nation was not dead. Here it was reappearing in avalet's son, as it was bound to reappear in all classes! Yes, Peterkinhad supplied the one shining incident of the costly day to the colonel,who found himself without his headquarters for the night at the Gallandhouse as planned, waiting for orders on this confounded little knoll. Hewas wondering if his regiment would be out in reserve and given a reston the morrow, when an officer of the brigade staff broughtinstructions:"The batteries are going to emplace here for your support in themorning. You will move as soon as your men have eaten and occupypositions B-31 to B-35. That gives you a narrow front for one battalion,with two battalions in reserve to drive home your attack. The chief ofstaff himself desires that we take the Galland house before noon. Theenemy must not have the encouragement of any successes.""So easy for Westerling to say," thought the colonel; while aloud heacknowledged the message with proper spirit.Before the order to move was given the news of it passed from lip to lipamong the men in tired whispers. Since dawn they had lived through theimpressions of a whole war, and they had won. With victory they had notthought of the future, only of their hunger. After the nightmare of thecharge, after hearing death whispering for hours intimately in theirears, they were too weary and too far thrown out of the adjustments ofany natural habits of thought and feeling to realize the horror ofeating their dinners in the company of the dead. Now they were to gothrough another hell, but many of them in their exhaustion were chieflyconcerned as to whether or not they should get any sleep that night.Peterkin could hear his heart thumping and feel chills running down hisspine. How should he ever live up to a bronze cross--the precious crossgiven for valor alone, which marked him as heroic for life--when all hewanted to do was to crawl away to some quiet, safe place and munch morebiscuits? He had once been a buttons who looked down on scullery boys,but how gladly would he be a scullery boy forever if he could escape tothe rear where he would hear no more bullets!His conscience smote him; he wanted a confessor. He had an impulse totell the whole truth to Hugo Mallin, for Hugo was the one man in thecompany who would sympathetically understand the situation. Yet he didnot find the words, because he was rather pleased with the reclame ofbeing a hero, which was an entirely new experience in a family that hadbeen for generations in service.Hugo Mallin had fired when the others fired; advanced when the othersadvanced. He had done his mechanical part in a way that had not excitedFracasse's further acute displeasure, and he had no sense of physicalfatigue, only of mental depression, of the elemental things that he hadseen and felt this day in a whirling pressure on his brain.It seemed to him that all his comrades had changed. They could never bethe same as before they had set out to kill another lot of men on thecrest of the knoll. He could not keep a comparison out of mind: One ofthe dead Browns, lying in almost the same position, looked enough likethe manufacturer's son to be his brother. He pictured Eugene Aronson'sparents receiving the news of his death--the mother weeping, the fatherstaring stonily. And he saw many mothers weeping and many fathersstaring stonily.XXVTHE TERRIBLE NIGHTThe satire of war makes the valet's son a hero; the chance of war killsthe manufacturer's son and lets the day-laborer's son live; the sport ofwar gives the latent forces of a Stransky full play; the mercy of wargrants Grandfather Fragini a happy death; the glory of war bringsDellarme quick promotion; the glamour and the spectacular folly of warturn the bolts of the lightnings which man has mastered against man.Perhaps the savage who learned that he could start a flame by rubbingtwo dry sticks together may have set fire to the virgin forest and wildgrass in order to destroy an enemy--and naturally with disastrousresults to himself if he mistook the direction of the wind.Marta Galland's thoughts at dusk when she returned up the steps to thehouse were much the same as Hugo Mallin's after Fracasse had taken theknoll. While he had felt the hot whirlwind of war in his face, she hadwitnessed the wreckage that it left. She also was seeing fathers staringand mothers weeping. Her experience with the wounded drawing deep on thewells of sympathy, heightened her loathing of war and of all who plannedand ordered it and led its legions. A Stransky righting would have beenrepulsive to her, but a Stransky trying to save a life was noble.Except for the few minutes when she had gone out on the veranda and hadseen Stransky bringing in the lifeless body of Grandfather Fragini, shehad been engaged since dark in completing the work of moving valuablearticles from the front to the rear rooms of the house, which had beenbegun early in the day by Minna and the coachman.Shortly after Stransky had finished his meal Minna came to say thatMajor Dellarme wished to speak to Miss Galland. Dellarme a major! Thiswas his reward for his part in filling the ambulances with groans! Inthe days when he was at the La Tir garrison he had been a frequentcaller. Now, in the perversity of her reasoning, out of the chaos of thetangent odds of her impressions since she had gone to hold the sessionof her school that morning, she thought of him as peculiarly one whogave to the profession of arms the attraction that had made it thevocation of the aristocrat. Waiting for her in the dismantleddining-room, despite all that he had passed through, his greeting hadthe diffident, boyish manner of her recollection; and despite a night onthe ground his brown uniform was without creases, giving him awell-groomed, even debonair, appearance."I scarcely thought that we should ever meet under these conditions," hesaid slightly constrained, a touch of color in his cheeks.She had no excuse for her reply unless, in truth, she were in trainingfor the town scold. But he typified an idea. He gave to war the aspectof refinement."If you did not expect it, why did you enter the army?" she asked.He saw that she was not quite herself. The strain of the day hadunnerved her. Yet he answered her bootless question with simpledirectness."I liked the idea of being a soldier. I was reared in the atmosphere ofthe army, and I hoped that I might do my duty if war came."Perhaps this was point one for him. Marta shrugged her shoulders."I might have guessed beforehand what you would say," she replied. "Yousent for me?""Hardly that, please. I asked if I might see you. The captain ofengineers tells me that you insist on staying and I came to beg you tokeep in the back of the house. You will be safe there. Any shell thatmay enter will explode in the front rooms and the fragments will not gothrough the second wall.""Yes, we understand that. We have already removed our heirlooms," shereplied indifferently.The fatalism of her attitude and his alarm lest she had gone a littleout of her head aroused all the innate horror of a man at the thought ofa woman under fire. He broke out desperately:"Miss Galland, this is no place for you! You do not realize--"He had made the same mistake as the captain of engineers--touched a spotof irritation as raw as it had been in the morning."Why shouldn't I stay here? Why shouldn't every wife and mother be herein the fire zone? You soldiers die--it is very easy to die--and leave usto suffer. You destroy and leave us to build up. You go on a debauch ofkilling and come home to the women to nurse you. Why make us suffer theconsequences without sharing the glory of the deed?"Such reasoning was not in the province of his training. He feared thatshe was about to become hysterical."Really, Miss Galland, I--women and children--I--" he was stammering."Better kill the children young than go to the expense of bringing themup before they are killed!" she went on, not hysterically, unless frozenintensity is hysteria. "Children clinging to your knees might stop you,but I suppose you would have a police force to tear the children awayrather than miss the masculine privilege of murder.""Miss Galland, you are overwrought. I--"She interrupted him with half-breathed laughter."Don't I look it--hysterical?" she exclaimed. "How awkward for you if Ishould fall on the floor and kick and scream!"With a peculiar uplifting of the brows which spoke a brittle humor, shelooked at the floor as if selecting a place for the performance."That is not your way," he managed to say. He was quite adrift inconfusion at the recollection of quotations he had heard about woman'ssubtleties and inconsistencies and her charm. Resorting to the lastweapon in his armory--which the captain of engineers had alreadyused--his attitude changed to a soldierly sternness. "Miss Galland, Ifeel that it is my duty, as long as you are going to stay, to make surethat--"She killed the sentence on his lips with a gleam of mockery from hereyes. He understood that she had again anticipated what he was going tosay."There are times when you must be firm with a woman, aren't there? Andthe time has come for you to be firm!" The color in his cheeks deepened.He knew what to do with his men on the knoll, but not what to do in thepresent situation. "This is our home; our home is our country. Here weremain; but, naturally, we don't propose to stick our heads out of thewindows in a shower of shrapnel bullets," she continued. "Even yoursoldiers are not so zealous for death but they fight behind sand-bags.They are not like Mohammedan fatalists who so love to die for theirillusions that they bare their breasts to bullets. We have alreadyarranged sleeping-quarters in the rear. Good night!"She held out her hand with a smile of conventional pleasantry. Had itnot been for the sound of firing, which still continued, and for thewalls denuded of pictures, they might have been parting at the head ofthe stairs at a house-party. She stopped half-way up in an impulse tocall back happily:"You see, masculine firmness did calm feminine hysteria!""Oh, Miss Galland!" he exclaimed. "Miss Galland, you are beyond me!""What a pose! How foolish to break out in that way!" she thoughtangrily, as she hastened up the rest of the flight and along thecorridor. "To him of all men! A pattern-plate of an officer, who neverhas had anything but a military thought! But everything is pose!Everything is abnormal! And sleep? Sleep is a pose, too. I feel as if myeyes would remain open forever. Oh, I wish they would begin the fightingand tear the house to pieces if they are going to! I wish--"She was at the door of her mother's room, which was like an antiqueshop. Old plates lay on top of old tables, with vases on the floor underthe tables. Surrounded by her treasures, Mrs. Galland awaited theattack; not as a soldier awaits it, but as that venerable Roman senatorof the story faced the barbarous Gauls--neither disputing the power oftheir spears nor yielding the self-respect of his own mind and soul. Shehad lain down in her wrapper for the night, and the light from a singlecandle--she still favored candles--revealed her features calm andphilosophical among the pillows. Yet the magic of war, reaching deepinto hidden emotions, had her also under its spell. Her voice was atonce more tender and vital."Marta, I see that you are all on wires!""Yes; jangling wires, every one, jangling every second out of tune,"Marta acquiesced."Marta, my father"--her father had been a premier of the Browns--"alwayssaid that you may enjoy the luxury of fussing over little things, forthey don't count much one way or another; but about big things you mustnever fuss or you will not be worthy of big things. Marta, you cannotstop a railroad train with your hands. This is not the first war onearth and we are not the first women who ever thought that war waswrong. Each of us has his work to do and you will have yours. It does nogood to tire yourself out and fly to pieces, even if you do know so muchand have been around the world."She smiled as a woman of sixty, who has a secret heart-break that shehad never given her husband a son, may smile at a daughter who is bothson and daughter to her, and her plump hand, all curves like her plumpface and her plump body, spread open in appeal.Marta, who, in the breeding of her generation, felt sentiment as more orless of a lure from logic, dropped beside the bed in a sudden burst ofsentiment and gathered the plump hand in hers and kissed it."Mother, you are wonderful!" she said. "Mother, you are great!""Tush, Marta!" said Mrs, Galland. "You shouldn't say that. Yourgrandfather was great--a very great man. He never quite got his deserts;no good man does in politics.""You are better than great," said Marta. "You soothe; you help; youhave--what shall I call it?--the wisdom of mothers! Minna has it, too."She ran a tattoo of kisses along the velvety skin of Mrs. Galland's arm.Mrs. Galland was blushing, and out of the depths of her eyes bubbled alittle fountain of stars."Marta, you have kissed me often before," she said, "but you have been alittle patronizing from your hilltop of youth and knowledge. Sometimesyou have looked to me lonely up there on your hilltop and I know that Ihave been lonely sometimes in my valley of the years where knees are notgood at climbing hills.""It was not my intention," Marta said rather miserably."No, it is a businesslike age," answered Mrs. Galland."I--you mean I was too detached? I was not human?""You are now. You make me very happy," her mother replied. "But you mustsleep," she insisted.After a time, her ear becoming as accustomed to the firing as a citydweller's to the distant roar of city traffic Mrs. Galland slept. ButMarta could not follow her advice. If, transiently at least, she hadfound something of the peace of the confessional, the vigor of youth wasin her arteries; and youth cannot help remaining awake under someconditions. She tiptoed across the hall into her own room and seatedherself by the window, which had often spread the broadening vista oflandscape with its lessening detail before her eyes.On other nights she had looked out into opaqueness with the drum-beat ofrain on the roof; into the faint starlight when there was only thevagueness of heights and levels; into the harvest moonlight with itsspectral unreality. Now the symbol of what the ear had heard the eyesaw: war, working in tones of the landscape by day with smokelesspowder; war, revealed by its tongues of flame at night. Ugly bursts offire from the higher hills spread to the heavens like an aurora borealisand broke their messengers in sheets of flame over the lower hills--thebatteries of the Browns sprinkling death about the heads of the gunnersof the Grays emplacing their batteries. Staccato flashes from a singlepoint counted so many bullets from an automatic, which, directed by thebeams of the search-lights, found their targets in sections of advancinginfantry. Hill crests, set off with flashes running back and forth,demarked infantry lines of the Browns assisting the automatics.There were lulls between the crashes of the small arms and the heavy,throaty speech of the guns; lulls that seemed to say that both sides hadpaused for a breathing spell; lulls that allowed the battle in thedistance to be heard in its pervasive undertone. In one Of them, wheneven the undertone had ceased for a few seconds, Marta caught faintlythe groans of a wounded man--one of the crew of a Gray dirigible burnedby an explosion and brought in his agony softly to earth by a billowingpiece of envelope which acted as a parachute.Fighting proceeded in La Tir in stages of ferocity and blank silence.The upper part of the town, which the Browns still held, was indarkness; the lower part, where the Grays were, was illuminated."Another one of Lanny's plans!" thought Marta. "He would have them workin the light, while we fire out of obscurity!"Soon all the town was in darkness, for the Grays had cut the wire in themain conduit shortly after she had heard the groans of the wounded man.There the automatics broke out in a mad storm, voicing their feelings atgetting a company in close order in a street for the space of a minute,before those who escaped could plaster themselves against doorways orfind cover in alleys. Then silence from the automatics and a cheer fromthe Browns that rasped out its triumph like the rubbing together ofsteel files.From the line of defence, that included the first terrace of the Gallandgrounds as the angle of a redoubt, not a shot, not a sound; silence onthe part of officers and men as profound as Mrs. Galland's slumber,while one of the Browns' search-lights, like some great witch'sslow-turning eye in a narrow radius, covered the lower terraces and theroad.Marta gave intermittent glances at the garden; the glances of aguardian. She happened to be looking in that direction when figuressprang across the road, crouching, running with the short, quick stepsof no body movement accompanying that of the legs. The search-lightcaught them in merciless silhouette and the automatic and the riflesfrom behind the sand-bags on the first terrace let go. Some of thefigures dropped and lay in the road and she knew that she had seen menhit for the first time. Others, she thought, got safely to the cover ofthe gutter on the garden side. Of those on the road, some were still andsome she saw were moving slowly back on their stomachs to safety. Nowthe search-light laid its beam steadily on the road. Again silence. Fromthe upper terrace came a great voice, like that of the guns, from ahuman throat:"Why didn't we level those terraces? They'll creep up from one to theother!" It was Stransky.In answer was another voice--Dellarme's."Perhaps there wasn't time to do everything. And if this position istaken before we are ready to go, it will not be from that side, but fromthe side of the town.""We're making them pay for seeing our garden, but, anyhow, we won't letthem pick any flowers," Stransky remarked pungently."If they get as far as the first terrace--well, in case of a crisis, wehave hand-grenades," Dellarme added in explanation. "But, God knows, Ihope we shall not have to use them."After an interval, more figures made a rush across the road. They, too,in Stransky's words, paid a price for seeing the garden. But the flashesfrom the rifles and the automatic provided a target for a Gray battery.The blue spark that flies from an overhead trolley or a third rail,multiplied a hundredfold, broke in Marta's face. It was dazzling,blinding as a bolt of lightning a few feet distant, with the thundercrash at the same second, followed by the thrashing hum of bullets andfragments against the side of the house."I knew that this must come!" something within her said. If she had notbeen prepared for it by the events of the last twelve hours she wouldhave jumped to her feet with an exclamation of natural shock and horror.As it was, she felt a convulsive, nervous thrill without rising from herseat. A pause. The next shell burst in line with the first, out by thelinden-trees; a third above the veranda."We've got that range, all right!" thought the Gray battery commander,who had judged the distance by the staff map. This was all he wanted toknow for the present. He would let loose at the proper time to supportthe infantry attack, when there were enough driblets across the road tomake a charge. The driblets kept on coming, and, one by one, the numberof dead on the road was augmented.Marta was diverted from this process of killing by piecemeal by a moretheatric spectacle. A brigade commander of the Grays had ticked an orderover the wires and it had gone from battery to battery. Not only manyfield-guns, which are the terriers of the artillery, but some guns ofsiege calibre, the mastiffs, in a sudden outburst started a havoc oftumbling walls and cornices in the upper part of the town.Then an explosion greater than any from the shells shot a hemisphere oflight heavenward, revealing a shadowy body flying overhead, and aninstant later the heavens were illuminated by a vast circle of flame asthe dirigible that had dropped the dynamite received its death-blow. Butalready the Brown infantry was withdrawing from the town, destroyingbuildings that would give cover for the attack in the morning as theywent. Two or three hours after midnight fell a silence which was to lastuntil dawn. The combatants rested on their arms, Browns saying to Grays,"We shall be ready for the morrow!" and Grays replying: "So shall we!"Marta, at her window, her eyes following the movements of the display,now here, now there, found herself thinking of many things, as in theintermissions between the acts of a drama. She wondered if the groaning,wounded man were crying for water or if he were wishing that some one athome were near him. She thought of her talk with Lanstron over thetelephone and how mad and feminine and feeble it must have sounded to amind working in the inexorable processes of the clash of millions ofmen. She saw his left hand twitching in his pocket, his right handgripping it to hold it still, on that afternoon when, for the firsttime, she had understood his injury in the aeroplane accident as thetalisman of his feelings--his controlled feelings! Always his controlledfeelings!She saw Feller leaning against the moist wall of the dank tunnel,suffering as it had never seemed to her that man could suffer, his agonyan irresistible plea. She saw Westerling, so conscious of his strength,directing his chessmen in a death struggle against Partow. And he wascoming to this house as his headquarters when the final test of thestrength of the Titans was made.She hoped that her mother was still sleeping; and she had seconds whenshe was startled by her own calmness. Again, the faces of the childrenin her school were as clear as in life. She breathed her gratitude thatthe procession in which they moved to the rear was hours ago out of thetheatre of danger. In the simplicity of big things, her duty was toteach them, a future generation, no less than Feller's duty was to thepursuing shadow of his conscience. She should see war, alive, naked,bloody, and she would tell her children what she had seen as a warning.Silence, except an occasional rifle-shot--silence and the darknessbefore dawn which would, she knew, concentrate the lightnings around thehouse. She glanced into her mother's room and marvelled as at a miracleto find her sleeping. Then she stole down-stairs and opened the outerdoor of the dining-room. A step or two brought her to the edge of theveranda. There she paused and leaned against one of the stone pillars.Dellarme himself was in a half-reclining position, his back to a tree.He seemed to be nodding. Except for a few on watch over the sand-bags,his men were stretched on the earth, moving restlessly at intervals,either in an effort to sleep or waking suddenly after a spell ofharassed unconsciousness.XXVIFELLER IS TEMPTEDWith the first sign of dawn there was a movement of shadowy forms takingposition in answer to low-spoken commands. The search-light yielded itsvigil to the wide-spread beam out of the east, and the detail of thesetting where Marta was to watch the play of one of man's passions,which he dares not permit the tender flesh of woman to share, grewdistinct. Bayonets were fixed on the rifles that lay along the parapetof sand-bags in front of the row of brown shoulders. Back of them in theyard was a section of infantry in reserve, also with bayonets fixed,ready to fill the place of any who fell out of line, a doctor andstretchers to care for the wounded, and a detachment of engineers tomend any breaches made in the breastwork by shell fire.The gunner of the automatic sighted his barrel, slightly adjusted itselevation, and swung it back and forth to make sure that it workedsmoothly, while his assistant saw that the fresh belts of cartridgeswhich were to feed it were within easy reach. Dellarme, walking behindhis men, cautioning them not to expose their heads and at the same timeto fire low, had his cheery smile in excellent working order."We expect great things of you!" this smile said as he bent over thegunner with a pat on the shoulder."I understand!" said the upward glance in reply.Marta could not deny that there was something fine about Dellarme'ssmile no less than in his bearing and his delicately, chiselledfeatures. It had the assurance and self-possession of a surgeon about toperform a critical operation, the difference being that, unlike thesurgeon, he shared in the risk, which was for the purpose of takingvigorous young lives rather than saving lives enfeebled by disease. Wasit this that gave to war its halo--this offering of the most valuablething man possesses to sudden destruction that made war heroic?But where was the romance of the last war forty years ago? Where theglad songs going into battle? The glitter of buttons and the pomp ofshowy uniforms? The general's staff watching the course of the action bythe billows of black smoke? Gone where the railroad sent thestage-coach, electricity sent the candle and horse-drawn street-cars,serum sent diphtheria, the knife sent the appendix, and rifled cannonand explosive shells sent the wooden walls of old ships of the line.It occurred to none of the actors, and to Marta alone, in the tight,foreboding silence, to look aloft. There was a serene blue sky. Thebirds were tuning up for their morning songs when she heard the dullecho of distant guns, soon to be submerged in other thunders at nearerpoints along the frontier. With every faculty an alert wire strung insuspense, she was instantly aware of the appearance of a figure whoselack of uniform made it conspicuous on that stage.In straw hat and blue blouse, shuffling with his old man's walk, Fellercame along the path from the gate. He was in retreat from the enticingpicture of the regiment of field-guns in front of the castle that wasready for action. As the infantry had never interested him, he would besafe from temptation in the yard. He stopped back of the engineers, hisglance roving down the line of brown shoulders until it rested on theautomatic. This also was a gun, though it fired only bullets. Hisfingers began beating a tattoo on his trousers' seam; a hungrybrilliance shone in his eyes. He took four or five steps forward as ifdrawn by an overpowering fascination."This is no place for you!" said one of the engineers."No, and don't waste any time, either, old man!" said another. "Back toyour bulbs!"Feller did not even hear them. For the moment he was actually deaf."Fire!" said Dellarme's whistle. "Thur-r-r!" went the automatic insoulless, mechanical repetition, its tape spinning through the cylinder,while the rifles spoke with the human irregularity of steel-tippedfingers pounding at random on a drumhead. All along the line facing LaTir the volume of fire spread until it was like the concert of a mightyloom.Marta could see nothing of the enemy, but she guessed that he was makinga rush from the second to the third terrace and from the outskirts ofthe town. The engineer's repeated warning unheard above the din, hetouched Feller on the leg. Feller looked around with a frown ofquerulous abstraction just as the breaking of a storm of shell fireobscured Marta's vision with dust and smoke. She felt her head jerk asif it would go free of her neck with each explosion, until shereinforced her nerves with the memory of an old soldier's warning aboutthe folly of dodging missiles that were already past before you heardthem. She knew that she was perfectly safe behind the pillar.The Gray batteries having tried out their range by the flashes of theautomatic the previous evening were making the most of the occasion."Uk-ung-n-ng!" the breaking jackets whipped out their grists. A crash onthe roof brought a small avalanche of slate tumbling down. A concussionin the dining-room was followed by the tinkling of falling window-glass.The engineers had work immediately when two of the infantrymen and theirrifles and the sand-bags on which they leaned were hurled together in aheap of sand and torn flesh. Other bags were placed in the breach; othermen sprang forward and began firing. The reserves, the hospital-corpsmen and the engineers hugged the breastwork for cover. The leavesclipped from the trees by bullets were blown aside with the hurricanebreaths of shrapnel bursts; bullets whistled so near Marta that sheheard their shrillness above every other sound. She was amazed that thehouse still remained standing--that any one was alive. But she had aglimpse of Dellarme maintaining his set smile and another of Feller, whohad crept up behind the automatic, making impatient "come-on! come-on!what-is-the-matter-with-you?" gestures in the direction of the batteriesin front of the castle."Thur-eesh--thur-eesh!" As the welcome note swept overhead he waved hishands up and down in mad rapture and then peeped over the breastwork toascertain if the practice were good. The Brown batteries had been alittle slow in coming into action, but they had the range from the Graybatteries' flashes the previous night and, undisturbed in the securityof their own flashes screened by the trees, soon broke the precision ofthe opposing fire.Now shells coming infrequently fell short or went wide. The air cleared.Marta could again see distinctly, and she marvelled that the brownfigures were proceeding with their knitting as if nothing had happened.She could not resist a thrill of grim admiration for their steadiness oran appreciative thrill as she saw Feller eagerly peering over theautomatic gunner's shoulder to watch the effect of his fire. Suddenly,both the rifles and the automatic, which had been firing deliberately,began to fire with desperate rapidity. It was as if a boxer, sparringslowly, let out all his power in a rain of blows. She could see nothingof the Grays, but she understood that they were making a rush.Then a chance shell, striking at the one point which the man who firedit six thousand yards away would have chosen as his bull's-eye, obscuredFeller and the automatic and its gunners in the havoc of explosion.Feller must have been killed. The dust settled; she saw Dellarme makingfrantic gestures as he looked at his men. They were keeping up theirfusillade with unflinching rapidity. Through the breach left in thebreastwork she had glimpses, as the dust was finally dissipated, of grayfigures, bayonets fixed, pressing together as they came on fiercelytoward the opening. The Browns let go the full blast of their magazines.Had that chance shell turned the scales? Would the Grays get into thebreastwork?All Marta's faculties and emotions were frozen in her stare of suspenseat the breach. Her heart seemed straining with the effort of the living,who heard nothing, thought nothing, in the crux of their effort. War'sown mesmerism had made her forget Feller and everything except thegamble, the turn of the card, while the gray figures kept stumbling onover their fallen. Then her heart leaped, a cry in a gust of shortbreaths broke from her lips as the Browns let go a rasping, explosive,demoniacal cheer. The first attack had been checked!After triumph, terror, faintness, and a closing of her eyes, she openedthem to see Feller, with his old straw hat--brim torn and crownlessnow--still on his head, rise from the debris and shake himself like adog coming ashore from a swim. While the engineers hastened to repairthe breach he assisted Stransky, who had also been knocked down by theconcussion, to lift the overturned automatic off the gunner. The doctor,putting a hand on the gunner's heart, shook his head, and twohospital-corps men removed the body to make room for the engineers.Dellarme could now spare attention from the charge of the Gray infantryto observe the results of the shell fire. With the gunner dead, helooked for the gunner's assistant, who lay several feet distant. AsDellarme and the doctor hastened to him he raised himself to a sittingposture and looked around in dazed inquiry. The doctor poured a cup ofbrandy from his flask and held it to the assistant's lips, whereon heblinked and nodded his head in personal confirmation of the fact thathe was still alive. But when he tried to raise his right arm the handwould not join in the movement. His wrist was broken.For once Dellarme's cheery smile deserted him. There was no one left toman the automatic, so vital in the defence, and even if somebody couldbe found the gun was probably out of commission. As he started toward ithis smile, already summoned back, was shot with surprise at sight of thegun in place and a stranger in blue blouse, white hair showing through acrownless straw hat, trying out the mechanism with knowing fingers.Dellarme stared. Feller, unconscious of everything but the gun, rightedthe cartridge band, swung the barrel back and forth, and then fired ashot."You--you seem to know rapid-firers!" Dellarme exclaimed in blankincomprehension."Yes, sir!" Feller raised his finger, whether in salute as a soldier oras a gardener touching his hat it was hard to say."But how--where?" gasped Dellarme.This time the movement of the finger was undoubtedly in salute, inperfect, swift, military salute, with head thrown back and shouldersstiff. Feller the gardener was dead and buried without ceremony."Lanstron's class, school for officers, sir. Stood one in ballistics,prize medallist control of gun-fire. Yes, sir, I know something aboutrapid-firers," Feller replied, and fired a few more shots. "A littlehigh, a little low--right, my lady, right!"Stransky was back in his place next to the automatic and firing whenevera head appeared. He rolled his eyes in a characteristic squint ofscrutiny toward the new recruit."Beats spraying rose-bushes for bugs, eh, old man?" he asked."Yes, a lead solution is best for gray bugs!" Feller remarked pungently,and their glances meeting, they saw in each other's eyes the joy ofhell."A pair of anarchists!" exclaimed Stransky grinning, and tried a shotfor another head.As if in answer to prayer, a gunner had come out of the earth.Sufficient to the need was the fact. It was not for Dellarme to askquestions of a prize-medallist graduate of the school for officers in ablue blouse and crownless straw hat. His expert survey assured him thatbefore another rush the enemy had certain preparations to make. He mightgive his fighting smile a recess and permit himself a few minutes'relaxation. Looking around to ascertain what damage had been done to thehouse and grounds, he became aware of Marta's presence for the firsttime."Miss Galland, you--you weren't there during the fighting?" he cried ashe ran toward her."Yes," she said rather faintly."If I had known that I should have been scared to death!""But I was safe behind the pillar," she explained. "Your company did itswork splendidly," she added, looking at him with eyes dull andwondering."Do you think so? They _are_ splendid, my men! They make one try to beworthy of them. Thank you!" he said, blushing with pleasure. "But, MissGalland, please--there's no firing now, but any minute----.""Yes?"He did not attempt masculine firmness this time, only boyish pleadingand a sort of younger-brother camaraderie."Miss Galland, you're such a good soldier--please--and I'm sure you havenot had your breakfast, and all good soldiers never neglect theirrations, not at the beginning of a war! Miss Galland, please--." Yes, ashe meant it, please be a good fellow.She could not resist smiling at the charming manner of his plea. Shefelt weak and strange--a little dizzy. Besides, her mother's voice nowcame from the doorway and then her mother's hand was pressing her arm."Marta, if you remain out here, I shall!" announced Mrs. Galland."I was just coming in," said Marta.Dellarme, his cap held before him in the jaunty fashion of officers,bowed, his face beaming his happiness at her decision.As they entered the dining-room Marta saw that the shell which hadentered the window had burst just over the heavy mahogany table and afragment of the jacket had cut a long scar in the rich fibre. Shepaused, her breath coming and going hotly. She felt the smarting pain ofa file drawn over the skin. The table was very old; for generations ithad been a family treasure. As a child she had loved its polishedsurface and revered its massive solidity."Oh! Oh! Somebody ought to be made to pay for such wickedness!" sheexclaimed wrathfully."It will plane down and it is nothing we could help, Marta," said Mrs.Galland. "Fortunately, all the portraits were out of the room.""Mother, you--you are just a little too philosophical!" complainedMarta."Come!" Mrs. Galland slipped her hand into Marta's. "Two women can'tfight both armies. Come! I prescribe hot coffee It is waiting; and, doyou know, I find a meal in the kitchen very cosey."Being human and not a heroine fed on lotos blossoms, and being exhaustedand also hungry, when she was seated at table, with Minna adroitlyurging her, Marta ate with the relish of little Peterkin in the shellcrater munching biscuits from his haversack.XXVIIHAND TO HANDWith Mrs. Galland on guard, insistent that wherever her daughter wentshe should go, Marta might not so easily expose herself again. For thetime being she seemed hardly of a mind to. She sat staring at thekitchen clock on the wall in front of her, the only sign of any break inthe funereal march of her thoughts being an occasional deep-drawnbreath, or a shudder, or a clenching of the hands, or a bitter smile ofirony.An hour or more of intermittent firing passed in the suspense oflistening to a trickle of water undermining a dam. Then, with the roarof waters carrying away the dam, a cataract of shell fire broke andcontinued in far heavier volume than that of the first attack."The last war was nothing like this!" murmured Mrs. Galland.At every concussion against the walls of the house, at every crashwithin the house, Marta pressed her nails tighter into her palms.Abruptly as the inferno of the guns had commenced, it ceased, and thesteady, passionate, desperate blasts of the rifles, now uninterrupted,were more deadly and venomous if less shocking to the ear.The movement of the minute-hand on the clock-face became uncanny andmerciless to her eye in its deliberate regularity. Dellarme had beentold to hold on until noon, she knew. Was he still smiling? Was Fellerstill happy in playing a stream of lead from the automatic? Was thesecond charge of the Grays, which must have come to close quarters whenthe guns went silent, going to succeed?The rifle-fire died down suddenly and she heard a cheer like that ofthe morning, only wilder and fiercer and even less human. Could it befrom the Browns celebrating a repulse? Or from the Grays after takingthe position? What did it matter? If the Grays had won there was an endto the agony so far as her mother and herself were concerned--an end tomurder on the lawn and devastation of their property. But, at length,the rifle-fire beginning again in a slow, irregular pulse told her thatthe Browns had held.Now another long intermission. The demon was wiping his brow andrecovering his breath, Marta thought; he was repairing damaged joints inhis armor and removing the flesh of victims from his claws. But he wouldnot rest long, for the war was young--exactly one day old--and manybattalions of victims remained unslain.How slowly the big hand of the clock kept hitching on from minute-markto minute-mark! Yet no more slowly than the hands of clocks in distantprovinces of the Browns or of the Grays, where this day was as quiet andpeaceful as any other day.Mrs. Galland had settled down conscientiously to play solitaire, afavorite pastime of hers; but she failed to win, as she complained toMarta, because of her stupid way this morning of missing the combinationcards."I really believe I need new glasses," she declared."Let me help you," said Marta. Welcome idea! Why hadn't she thought ofit before? It was something to do."But, Marta--there you are, covering up the jack of spades, the verycard I need--though it will not help now. I've lost again!" exclaimedMrs. Galland at length. "Why, Marta, you miss worse than I do!""Do I? Do I?" asked Marta in blank surprise and irritation. "Please letme try once alone. I'll not miss this time. Correct me if I do."She played with the deliberation and accuracy of Feller should he haveto make a little ammunition for his automatic go a long way, and Mrs.Galland did not observe a single error."Hurrah! I won!" Marta cried triumphantly, with some of her oldvivacity.Then she drew away from the table wearily. The strain of concentratingher mind had been worse than that of the battle; or, rather, it hadmerely added another strain to a tortured brain after a sleepless night.For her ears had been constantly alert. The demon had moved one of hisclaws to fresh ground; the inferno on the La Tir side of the frontierhad shifted to a valley beyond the Galland estate, where the firingappeared to come from the Brown side. Breaking from the leash ofsilence, guns, automatics, rifles--each one straining for a speedrecord--roared and crashed and rattled in greedy chorus, while the clockticked perhaps a hundred times. Thus famished savages might boll theirfood in a time limit. Thereafter, for a while, the battle was desultory.Then came another outburst from Dellarme's men, which she interpreted asthe response to another rush by the Grays; and this yelping of the demonwas not that of the hound after the hare, as in the valley, but of thehare with his back to the wall. When it was over there was no cheer.What did this mean? Oh, that slow minute-hand, resting so calmly betweenhitches of destiny, now pointing to a quarter after eleven! For half acentury, it seemed to her, Marta had endured watching its snail pace.Now inaction was no longer bearable. Without warning to her mother shebolted out of the kitchen. Mrs. Galland sprang up to follow, but Minnabarred the way."One is enough!" she said firmly, and Mrs. Galland dropped back into herchair.In the front rooms Marta found havoc beyond her imagination. A portionof the ceiling had been blown out by a shell entering at an up-stairswindow; the hardwood floors were littered with plaster and window-glassand ripped into splinters in places."How can we ever afford repairs!" she thought.But she hurried on, impelled by she knew not what, through thedining-room, and, coming to the veranda, stopped short, with dilatingeyes and a cry of grievous shock. Two of his men were carrying Dellarmeback from the breastwork where they had caught him in their arms as hefell. They laid him gently on the sward with a knapsack under his head.His face grew whiter with the flow of blood from the red hole in theright breast of his blouse. Then he opened his lips and whispered to thedoctor: "How is it?" Something in his eyes, in the tone of that faintquestion, required the grace of a soldier's truth in answer."Bad!" said the doctor."Then, good-by!" And his head fell to one side, his lips set in hischeery smile.Had ever any martyr shown a finer spirit dying for any cause? Martawondered. She felt the sublimity of a great moment, an inexorablesadness. She knew that she should never forget that cheery smile or thatwhite face. What was danger to anybody? What was death if you had seenhow he had died?His company was a company with his smile out of its heart and in itsplace blank despair. Many of the men had stopped firing. Some had evenrun back to look at him and stood, caps off, backs to the enemy,miserable in their grief. Others leaned against the parapet, rifles outof hand, staring and dazed."They have killed our captain!""They've killed our captain!"--still a captain to them. A general'sstars could not have raised him a cubit in their estimation."And once we called him 'Baby Dellarme,' he was so young and bashful!Him a baby? He was a king!""Men, get to your places!" cried the surviving lieutenant ratherhopelessly, with no Dellarme to show him what to do; and Marta saw thatfew paid any attention to him.In that minute of demoralization the Grays had their chance, but onlyfor a minute. A voice that seemed to speak some uncontrollable thoughtof her own broke in, and it rang with the authority and leadership of amature officer's command, even though coming from a gardener in blueblouse and crownless straw hat."Your rifles, your rifles, quick!" called Feller. "We're only beginningto fight!"And then another voice in a bull roar, Stransky's:"Avenge his death! They've got to kill the last man of us for killinghim! Revenge! revenge!"That cry brought back to the company all the fighting spirit of thecheery smile and with it another spirit--for Dellarme's sake!--which hehad never taught them."Make them pay!""He was told to stay till noon!""They'll find us here at noon, alive or dead!"Stransky picked up one of several cylindrical objects that were lying athis feet."He wouldn't use this--he was too soft-hearted--but I will!" he cried,and flung a hand-grenade, and then a second, over the breastwork. Theexplosions were followed by agonized groans from the Grays hugging thelower side of the terrace. For this they had crawled across the road inthe night--to find themselves unable to move either way and directlyunder the flashes of the Browns' rifles.Feller's and Stransky's shouts rose together in a peculiar unity ofdirection and full of the fellowship they had found in their firstexchange of glances."You engineers, make ready!""Hand-grenades to the men under the tree! That's where they're going totry for it--no wall to climb over there!""You engineers, take your rifles--and bayonet into anything that wearsgray!""Get back, you men by the tree, to avoid their hand-grenades! Form upbehind them, everybody!""No matter if they do get in at first! Back, you men, from under thetree!"There was not a single rifle-shot. In a silence like that before theword to fire in a duel, all orders were heard and the more readilyobeyed because Dellarme's foresight had impressed their sense upon themen in his quiet way.The sand-bags by the tree were blown up by the Grays. Then, before thedust had hardly settled, came a half score of hand-grenades thrown bythe first men of a Gray wedge, scrambling as they were pushed throughthe breach by the pressure of the mass behind. In that final struggle ofone set of men to gain and another to hold a position, guns orautomatics or long-range bullets played no part. It was the grapple ofcold steel with cold steel and muscle with muscle, in a billowing,twisting mob of wrestlers, with no sound from throats but strainingbreaths; with no quarter, no distinction of person, and bloodshot eyesand faces hot with the effort of brute strength striving, in primitivedesperation, to kill in order not to be killed. The cloud of rocking,writhing arms and shoulders was neither going forward nor backward. Itsmovement was that of a vortex, while the gray stream kept on pouringthrough the breach as if it were only the first flood from some graylake on the other side of the breastwork.Marta had come to the edge of the veranda, at once drawn and repelled,feeling the fearful suspense of the combat, the savage horror of it, andherself uttering sounds like the straining breaths of the men. What aplace for her to be! But she did not think of that. She was there. Thedreadful alchemy of war had made her a stranger to herself. She was mad;they were mad; all the world was mad!One minute--two, perhaps--not three--and the thing was over. She sawthe Grays being crushed back and realized that the Browns had won, whena last detail of the lessening tumult fixed her attention with itsgladiatorial simplicity. Here, indeed, it was a case of man to man withthe weapons nature gave them.Standing higher than the others on the edge of the breach was that giantwho had brought Grandfather Fragini in pickaback, looking a young god onan escarpment of rock on Olympus. His great nose showed in silhouette atintervals of wrestling lurches back and forth as he tugged at the rifleof a thick-set soldier of the Grays with a liver patch on the cheek thatmade his face hideous enough for an incarnation of war's savagery. Atlast Jacob Pilzer tumbled backward over the breastwork. Unlucky Pilzer!That bronze cross was further away than ever for him, while Stranskyshook the trophy of a captured rifle aloft, a torn sleeve revealing theweaving muscles of his powerful arm."I thought so!" cried Feller. "Attacks on frontal positions by daylightare going out of fashion!"It was he who mercifully arrested the shower of hand-grenades thatfollowed the exit of the enemy. Two of the guns of the castle batteries,having changed their position, were making havoc enough at pointblankrange, with a choice of targets between the Grays huddled on the otherside of the breastwork and those in retreat."We'll have peace for a few hours now," said Stransky, squinting downhis nose. "And we'll have something to eat. I ought to have got thatfellow with the beauty-spot on his physiognomy, but, confound him, hewas an eel!"By this time the men had recovered their breath. It occurred to them bycommon impulse that a cheer was due, and for the first time they brokeinto a hurrah with wide-open throats."Another--for Dellarme!" called Stransky, who seemed to think that heand not the callow lieutenant was in command.This they gave, standing instinctively at attention, with heads bared,for the leader whose spirit survived in them; a cheer with triumph inits roar, but a different sort of triumph from the first cheer.Listening to it were the wounded among the Grays who had fallen withinthe breastwork to be trampled by the Browns as they had pressed forward.The doctor, but a moment ago a fiend himself with features of rage, now,in the second nature of his calling, with a look of tender sympathy, wasministering without distinction of friend or foe. One of the Grays, hischeek bearing the mark of a boot heel, raised himself, and, in defianceand the satisfaction of the thought to his bruises and humiliation,pointing his finger at Feller, Marta heard him say:"You there, in your straw hat and blue blouse, they've seen you--a manfighting and not in uniform! If they catch you it will be a drumhead anda firing squad at dawn!""That's so!" replied Feller gravely. "But they'll have to make a betterjob of it than you fellows did if they're going to----"He turned away abruptly but did not move far. His shoulders relaxed intothe gardener's stoop, and he pulled his hat down over his eyes andlowered his head as if to hide his face. He was thus standing, inert,when a division staff-officer galloped into the grounds."Splendid! Splendid! There's some iron crosses in this for you!" he wasshouting before he brought his horse to a standstill. "The way you heldon gained the day for Lanstron's plan. They tried to flank in the valleyafter their second attack on your position failed We drew them on andhad them--a battalion in close order--under the guns for a couple ofminutes. It was ghastly! Our losses have been heavy enough, but nothingto theirs--and how they are driving their men in! But where is MajorDellarme?"When he saw Dellarme's still body he dismounted and in a tide offeeling which, for the moment, submerged all thought of the machine,stood, head bowed and cap off, looking down at Dellarme's face."I was very fond of him! He was at the school when I was teaching there.But a good death--a soldier's death!" he said. "I'll write to his mothermyself." Then the voice of the machine spoke. "Who is in command?""I am, sir!" said the callow lieutenant, coming up.Feller's fingers moved in a restless beat on his trousers' seam, hislips half parted as if he must speak, but the men of the company spokefor him."Bert Stransky!" they roared.It was not according to military etiquette, but military etiquette meantnothing to them now. They were above it in veteran superiority."And--" Stransky had started to point to Feller, whose name he did notknow, when a forbidding gleam under the hat brim arrested him."Where's Stransky?" demanded the staff-officer."You're looking at him!" replied Stransky with a benign grin.Seeing that Stransky was only a private, the officer frowned at theanomaly when a lieutenant was present, then smiled in a way thataccorded the company parliamentary rights, which he thought that theyhad fully earned."Yes, and he gets one of those iron crosses!" put in Tom Fragini."What for?" demanded Stransky in surprise. They were making a lot offuss about him when he had not done anything except to work out hisindividual destiny."Yes--the first cross for Bert of the Reds!""And we'll let him make a dozen anarchist speeches a day!""Yes, yes!" roared the company."By all means--but not for this; for trying to save an old man's life!"put in Marta.After his survey of that amazing company the officer was the more amazedto hear a woman's voice in such surroundings."The ays have it!" he announced cheerfully. He lifted his cap to Marta.With tender regard and grave reverence for that company, he took extremecare with his next remark lest a set of men of such dynamic spirit mightrepulse him as an invader. "The lieutenant is in command for thepresent, according to regulations," he proceeded. "You will retireimmediately to positions 48 to 49 A-J by the castle road. You have doneyour part. To-night you sleep and to-morrow you rest."Sleep! Rest! Where had they heard those words before? Oh, yes, in adistant day before they went to war! Sleep and rest! Better far than aniron cross for every man in the company! They could go now withsomething warmer in their hearts than consciousness of duty well done;but this time they need not go until their dead as well as their woundedwere removed."You're not coming with us?" Stransky whispered to Feller."Eh? eh?" Feller put his hand to his ear. "Quite deaf!" he quavered."But I judge you ask if I am coming with you. No. I have to stay to lookafter my garden. It has been sadly damaged, I fear.""That's right--of course you're deaf!" agreed Stransky, well knowing thecontrary. "I'll be lonely without you, pal. It was love at first sightwith me!""And with me!" Feller whispered. "You and I, with a brigade of infantryand guns--" he began, but remembering his part, as he often would in themiddle of a sentence since the distraction of war was in his mind, heturned to go."A cheer for the old gardener! We don't know who he is or was, and it'snone of our business. He saved the day!" called Stransky.Feller started; he paused and looked back as he heard that stentorianchorus in his honor; and, irresistibly, he made a snappy officer'ssalute before starting on."That was very sweet to me," he was thinking, and then: "A mistake! amistake! One thought! One duty!"Making to pass around the corner of the house, he was confronted byMarta, who had come to the end of the veranda. There, within hearing ofthe soldiers, the dialogue that followed was low-toned, and it was swiftand palpitant with repressed emotion."Mr. Feller, I saw you at the automatic. I heard what the woundedprivate of the Grays said to you and realized how true it was.""He is a prisoner. He cannot tell.""Does he need to? You have been seen--the conspicuous figure of a man ingardener's garb fighting on the very terrace of his own garden! The Graystaff is bound to hear of such an extraordinary occurrence. It is one ofthose stories that travel of themselves. And Westerling will find thatsame gardener here when he comes! What hope have you for your ruse,then?""I--I--no matter! I forgot myself, when Lanny had warned me not to gonear the guns. My promise to him! My duty! I accept what I have preparedfor myself--that is a soldier's code.""But I shall not let you risk your life in this fashion.""You--" A searching look--a look of fire--from his eyes into hers, whichwere bright with appeal."I feel that I have no right to let you go to your death by a firingsquad," she interrupted hurriedly, "and I shall not! For I decide nownot to allow the telephone to remain!""But my chance--my one chance to--""You have it there--happiness in the work you like, the work for whichyou seem to have been born--at least, a better work than spying anddeceit--the right that you have won this morning there with the gun!""I"--he looked around at the automatic ravenously and fearsomely--"I--""It is all simply arranged. There is time for me to use the telephonebefore the Grays arrive. I shall tell Lanny why you took charge of thegun and how you handled it, and I know he will want you to keep it.""And the uniform--the uniform again! Yes, the uniform--if only a gunnerprivate's uniform!" he exclaimed in short, pulsating breaths of ecstasy."Yes, count on that, too! And good-by!""Good-by! I--" But she had already turned away. "I've changed my mind!Exit gardener! Enter gunner! I'm going with you! I'm going with you!" hecried in a jubilant voice that arrested the attention of every one onthe grounds. They saw him throw his arms around Stransky and then rushto the automatic. "One thought! One duty! Oh, that is easy now!" hebreathed, caressing the breech with a flutter of pats from both hands.XXVIIIAN APPEAL TO PARTOW"You, Marta--you are still there!" Lanstron exclaimed in alarm when heheard her voice over the tunnel telephone. "But safe!" he added inrelief. "Thank God for that! It's a mighty load off my mind. And yourmother?""Safe, too.""And Minna and little Clarissa Eileen?""All safe.""Well, you're through the worst of it. There won't be any more fightingaround the house, and certainly Westerling will be courteous. But whereis Gustave?""Gone!""Gone!" he repeated dismally.In a flash he had guessed another tragedy for poor Gustave, who musthave once more failed to stick to his purpose, thus shattering the lasthope that the thousandth chance would ever come to anything."Wait until you hear how he went," Marta said. With all the vividness ofher impressions, a partisan for the moment of him and Dellarme, shesketched Feller's part with the automatic.As he listened, Lanstron's spirit was twenty again, with the fever thatFeller's "let's set things going!" could start rollicking in his veins.What did the thousandth chance matter? Only a wool-gatherer would everhave had any faith in it. Victory for Gustave! Victory for the friend inwhom he believed when others had disbelieved! Victory for those giftsthat had broken a career against army routine in peace, once they hadfull play in war!"I can see him," he said. "It was a full breath of fresh air to thelungs of a suffocating man. I--"Marta was off in interruption in the full tide of an appeal."You must--I promised--you must let him have the uniform again!" shebegged. "You must let him keep his automatic. To take it away would belike separating mother and child; like separating Minna from ClarissaEileen.""Better than an automatic--a battery of guns!" replied Lanstron. "Thisis where I will use any influence I have with Partow for all it isworth. Now, let the red-tapists dare to point to his past when I askanything for him and I'll overwhelm them with the living present! Yes,and he shall have the iron cross. It is for such deeds as his that theiron cross was meant.""Thank you," she said. "It's worth something to make a man as happy asyou will make him. Yes, you are real flesh and blood to do this, Lanny."Her point won with surprising ease, when she had feared that militaryform and law could not be circumvented, she leaned against the wall inreaction. For twenty-four hours she had been without sleep. The interestof her appeal for Feller had kept up her strength after the excitementof the fight for the redoubt was over. Now there seemed nothing left todo."No doctor who ever examined me for promotion has yet found that Iwasn't flesh and blood," Lanstron remarked a little plaintively."Then the doctor must have kept the truth from Partow," she told himwith a faint return of the teasing spirit that he knew well. "He wantsonly men of steel, with nerves of copper wire run by an electricbattery, on his staff, I'm sure."Lanstron laughed very humanly for an automaton."I'll suggest the battery to him. It might prove a labor saver," hesaid. "Being a little old-fashioned, he has depended on clockwork, whichrequires a special orderly to wind us when we fun down and nod at ourdesks." Then he turned solicitous. "The Gray staff will certainly giveyou an escort beyond the Gray lines, where you will find a place toestablish yourselves comfortably."The suggestion brought her energy back with the snap of a whip."No!" she declared. "We stay in our home. It's ours! No one else has anyright there while our taxes are paid. Doesn't my children's oath say:'I'll not let a burglar drive me out of my house'?""Isn't that coming around to my view, Marta?" he asked. "Aren't werefusing to leave the nation's house because a burglar is trying toenter?""Lanny, you, with all your intellect--when you know the oath as well asI--you pettifog like that! The oath says to appeal to justice and reasoneven after the first blow is struck. Why doesn't our premier appeal tothe people of the Grays?""They garbled his last despatch, as it was, to suit their purpose.""Their government garbled it. I meant to appeal not to their premier butto the people, as human beings to human beings. Over there they're humanbeings just as much as we are. Why didn't Partow speak, too, as chief ofstaff, if he is so fond of peace? He is the one--not the Fellers and theDellarmes and the Stranskys, who merely act up to their faith andtraining as pawns--he in the security of his cabinet making war. Whydidn't he say: 'We do not want war. We will not mobilize our army. Wewill do nothing to arouse the war passion?'""Their government would only have been convinced of an easier conquest,and by this time they would have been up to the main line of defence.Marta, when the diplomatic history of the war is known it will be foundthat the Gray government struck as a matter of cold, deliberateintention. Bodlapoo was only an excuse to carry out a plan of conquest.""So Partow has taught the Browns," she answered stubbornly. "That is onepartisan view. What is theirs? What is Westerling teaching the Grays?""Marta--really, I--""What a smashing argument _really_ is! You see that you really are notfor peace, but for war. But won't you ask Partow to do one thing, if hestill insists that he is for peace? I wonder if he will chuckle or laughat my suggestion, or will he grin or roar? Though you know that he willdo them all, ask him to send out a flag of truce to the Grays and begthem to stay their operations while his appeal--an appeal with a littleof the Christ spirit in it, from one Christian nation to another to stopthe murder--is read to the Gray soldiers and ours; to those who have tosuffer and die! Oh, I'd like to help write that appeal, telling thewomen what I have seen! Do you think if it were given to the world thatthe Grays would still come on? Ask him, Lanny, ask him to make thatsimple human appeal, as brother to brother, to the court of allhumanity! Ask him, please, Lanny!""I shall, Marta!" he replied seriously, in respect for her seriousnessthrobbing with the abandoned play of her vitality, though he knew howfruitless the request would be. He loved her the more for this outburst.He loved her for her quick sympathies with any one in trouble, whetherFeller or Minna; for all of her inconsistencies which were so real toher; for her dreams, her visions, her impulses, because she tried to putthem in action, and he envied Feller for having fought in defence of herhouse. How could he expect her to interest herself exclusively in him asone human being when all human beings interested her so profoundly? Ifthe world were peopled with Martas and their disciples then her proposalwould be practicable."That's fine of you, Lanny!" she said. "You've taken it like a goodstoic, this loss of your thousandth chance. You really believed in it,didn't you?""Forgotten already, like the many other thousandth chances that havefailed," he replied cheerfully. "One of the virtues of Partow's steelautomatons is that, being tearless as well as passionless, they nevercry over spilt milk. And now," he went on soberly, "we must be sayinggood-by.""Good-by, Lanny? Why, what do you mean?" She was startled."Till the war is over," he said, "and longer than that, perhaps, if LaTir remains in Gray territory.""You speak as if you thought you were going to lose!""Not while many of our soldiers are alive, if they continue to show thespirit that they have shown so far; not unless two men can crush one manin the automatic-gun-recoil age. But La Tir is in a tangent and alreadyin the Grays' possession, while we act on the defensive. So I shouldhardly be flying over your garden again.""But there's the telephone, Lanny, and here we are talking over it thisvery minute!" she expostulated."You must remove it," he said. "If the Grays should discover it theymight form a suspicion that would put you in an unpleasant position."The telephone had become almost a familiar institution in her thoughts.Its secret had something of the fascination for her of magic."Nonsense!" she exclaimed. "I am going to be very lonely. I want tolearn how Feller is doing--I want to chat with you. So I decide not tolet it be taken out. And, you see, I have the tactical situation, as yousoldiers call it, all in my favor. The work of removal must be done atmy end of the line. You're quite helpless to enforce your wishes. And,Lanny, if I ring the bell you'll answer, won't you?""I couldn't help it!" he replied."Until then! You've been fine about everything to-day!""Until then!"When Marta left the tower she knew only that she was weary with themind-weariness, the body-weariness, the nerve-weariness of a spectatorwho has shared the emotion of every actor in a drama of death and findsthe excitement that has kept her tense no longer a sustaining force.As she went along the path, steps uncertain from sheer fatigue, hersensibilities livened again at the sight of a picture. War, personalwar, in the form of the giant Stransky, was knocking at the kitchendoor. His two-days-old beard was matted with dust and there were driedred spatters on his cheek. War's furnace flames seemed to have tannedhim; war seemed to be breathing from his deep chest; his big nose waswar's promontory. But the unexposed space of his forehead seemedsingularly white when he took off his cap as Minna came in answer to hisknock. Her yielding lips were parted, her eyes were bright with inquiryand suspicion, her chin was firmly set."I came to see if you would let me kiss your hand again," said Stransky,squinting through his brows wistfully."Would that do you any good?" Minna asked."A lot--a big lot!" said Stransky. "But if it is easier for you, why,you can give me another blow in the face. I deserve it. It would showthat you weren't quite indifferent; that you took some interest in me.""I see your nose has been broken once. You don't want it broken a secondtime. I'm stronger than you think!" Minna retorted, and held out herhand carelessly as if it pleased her to humor him.He was rather graceful, despite his size, as he touched his lips to herfingers. Just as he raised his head a burst of cheering rose from theyard."So you've found that we have gone, you brilliant intellects!" heshouted, and glared at the wall of the house in the direction of thecheers."Quick! You have no time to lose!" Minna warned him."Quick! quick!" cried Marta.Stransky paid no attention to the urgings. He had something more to sayto Minna."I'm going to keep thinking of you and seeing your face--the face of agood woman--while I fight. And when the war is over, may I come tocall?" he asked.His feet were so resolutely planted on the flags that apparently theonly way to move them was to consent."Yes, yes!" said Minna. "Now, hurry!""Say, but you make me happy! Watch me poke it into the Grays for you!"he cried and bolted."It seems to me that he is the biggest, most ridiculous man I ever saw!"said Minna, as she watched him out of sight. "I'm tired, just tired todeath, aren't you?" she added to Marta."Exactly!" agreed Marta. "I feel as if I had worked my way through hellto heaven and heaven was the chance to sleep."Within the kitchen Mrs. Galland was already slumbering soundly in herchair. Overhead Marta heard the exclamations of male voices and thetread of what was literally the heel of the conqueror--guests that hadcome without asking! Intruders that had entered without any process oflaw! Would they overrun the house, her mother's room, her own room?Indignation brought fresh strength as she started up the stairs. Thehead of the flight gave on to a dark part of the hall. There she paused,held by the scene that a score or more of Gray soldiers, who hadriotously crowded into the dining-room, were enacting.XXIXTHROUGH THE VENEERThese men in the dining-room were members of Fracasse's company of theGrays whom Marta had seen from her window the night before rushingacross the road into the garden. It is time for their story--the storyof their attack on the redoubt. One of those who remained motionless onthe road was the doctor's son. If he had sprained his ankle atmanoeuvres, the whole company would have gossiped about the accident.If he had died in the garrison hospital from pneumonia, the barrackswould have been blue for a week. If he had fallen in the charge acrossthe white posts, the day-laborer's son on his right and the judge's sonon his left would have felt a spasm of horror.This is death, they would have thought; death that barely missed us;death that lays a man in the full tide of youth, as we are, silent andstill forever.Twelve hours after the war had begun, when the judge's son missed thedoctor's son from the ranks, he remarked:"Then they must have got him!""Yes, I Saw him roll over on his side," said the laborer's son.There was no further comment. The lottery had drawn the doctor's sonthis time; it would get some one else with the next rush. Existence hadresolved itself into a hazard; all perspective was merged into abrimstone-gray background. The men did not think of home and parents, asthey had on the previous night while they waited for the war to begin,or of patriotism. Relatives were still dear and country was still dear,but the threads of these affections were no longer taut. They hungloose. Fatalism had taken the place of suspense. There is no occurrencethat frequency will not make familiar, and they were already familiarwith death.A man might even get used to falling from a great height. At first, inlightning rapidity of thought, all his life would pass in review beforehim and all his hopes for the future would crowd thick. But what if hewere to go on descending for hours; yes, for days? Would not hissensations finally wear themselves down to a raw, quivering brain andthe brain at length grow callous? Suppose, further, that a number of menhad been thrown over a precipice at the same time as he and that thebottom of the abyss was the distance from star to star! Suppose thatthey fell at the same rate of speed! The first to be dashed against ashelf of rock would be a ghastly reminder to each man of his ownapproaching end. But, proceeding on horror's journey, he would becomeaccustomed to such pictures. He would feel hunger and cold. Physicaldiscomfort would overwhelm mental agony. If a biscuit shot out from thepocket of a corpse, wouldn't the living hand grab for it in brutegreediness?The thinner the veneer of civilized habit, the more easily the animal,always waiting and craving war, breaks through. And the animal wasstrong in Jacob Pilzer, the butcher's son. He had a bull's heart andlacked the little tendrils of sensibility whose writhing would tire him.Hugo Mallin had these tendrils by the thousand. He had so many that theygave him a reserve physical endurance like a kind of intoxication. Hefelt as if he had been drinking some noxious, foamy wine which made hismind singularly keen to every impression. Therefore he and Pilzer aloneof Fracasse's company were not utterly fatigued.The savagery of Pilzer's bitterness at seeing another get the bronzecross before he received one turned not on little Peterkin, the valet'sson, but on Hugo. As he and Hugo moved, elbow to elbow, picking theirway forward from the knoll, he eased his mind with rough sarcasm atHugo's expense. He christened Hugo "White Liver." When Hugo stumbledover a stone he whispered:"White Liver, that comes from the shaking knees of a coward!"Hugo did not answer, nor did he after they had crossed the road and wereunder the cover of the fourth terrace wall, and Pilzer whispered:"Still with us, little White Liver? Cowards are lucky. But your timewill come. You will die of fright."They worked their way ahead in the darkness to the third terrace andthen to the second, without drawing fire. There they were told to unsliptheir packs "and sleep--sleep!"Fracasse passed the word, as if this were also an order which perforcemust be obeyed. They dropped down in a row, their heads against the coldstone wall. So closely packed were their bodies that they could feel oneanother's breaths and heart-beats. Where last night they had thought ofa multitude of things in vivid flashes, to-night nothing was vivid afterthe last explosion in the town and there was an end of firing. Spaces ofconsciousness and unconsciousness were woven together in a kind ofpatchwork chaos of mind. For the raw brains were not yet quitecalloused; they quivered from the successive benumbing shocks of theday.Hugo would not even cheat himself by trying to close his eyes. He layquite still looking at the quietly twinkling, kindly stars. Unlike hiscomrades, he had not to go to hell in order to know what hell was like.He had foreseen the nature of war's reality, so it had not come as asurprise. Sufficient universal projection of this kind of imaginationmight afford sufficient martial excitement without war.His mind was busy in the gestation of his impressions and observationssince he had crossed the frontier. Definitely he knew that he was notafraid of bullets or shell fire, and in this fact he found no creditwhatever. The lion and the tiger and the little wild pigs of SouthAmerica who will charge a railroad train are brave. But it took somecourage to bear Pilzer's abuse in silence, he was thinking, while he wasconscious that out of all that he had seen and felt in the conflict ofmultitudinous angles of view was coming something definite, which wouldresult in personal action, fearless of any consequences.The thing that held him back from a declaration of self was the palefaces around him; his comrades of the barracks and manoeuvres. Heloved them; he thought, student fashion, that he understood them. Heliked being their humorist; he liked to win their glances of affection.The fortitude to endure their contempt, their enmity, their ostracismwould not save those dear to him in his distant provincial home fromhumiliation and heart-break. There was the rub: his father and motherand his sweetheart. He was an only son. His sweetheart was a goddess tohis eyes. What purpose is there in the rebellion of a grain of sand onthe seashore, in the insubordination of one of five million soldiers?Hadn't Westerling answered all doubts with the aphorism, "It is amistake for a soldier to think too much"?Thus pondering, in the company of the stars, Hugo, who had so manythoughts of his own that he led a double life, awaited the dawn. Whenthe church spire became outlined in the rosy, breaking light of theeast, he thought how much it was like the church spire of his own town.He saw that he was in what had been a beautiful, tenderly cared-for oldgarden before soldiery had ruthlessly trampled its flowers.Raising his head to a level with the terrace wall--the second terracewas low--he could see the piles of sand-bags on the first terrace onlytwenty feet away and an old house that belonged to the garden. Thelocation appealed to him as his glance swept over plain and mountainsglistening with dew. It must be glorious to come down from the verandaat daybreak or day's end to look at the flowers at your feet and thehorizon in the distance."Could little White Liver sleep away from home and mamma? Did he longfor mamma to tuck him among the goose feathers, with a sweet biscuit inhis paddy?" inquired Pilzer awakening.Hugo looked around at Pilzer in his quizzical fashion."Jake, you are unnecessarily uprooting an aster with the toe of yourboot," he said.Pilzer had a torrent of abuse ready to his tongue's end when Fracasseinterrupted with a hoarse, whispered warning:"Silence, Pilzer! You talk too much."Now the irascible Pilzer had a further grudge against Hugo for havingmade him the object of a reprimand."You!" he whispered, when the captain's back was turned, calling Hugo afoul name.This cut through even Hugo's philosophy and the blood went in a hot rushto his cheeks; but he slipped on his pack, as the others were doing, andreadjusted his cartridge-box. Word was passed to make ready for anotherrush, and soon the men knew that yesterday was not part of the hideousnightmare which had kept their legs quivering mechanically, as in thecharge, while they slept, but that the nightmare was a continuingreality and the peace of morning a dream.Under cover of the rain of shell fire on Dellarme's position, alreadydescribed, they mounted the wall of the second terrace and ran to thewall of the first terrace. They had expected to suffer terribly, butpassed safely underneath a sheet of bullets that caught other sectionsof their regiment on the lower terraces. Over their heads were themuzzles of the Browns' rifles, blazing toward the road, while in thedirection of the tower they saw the first charge of another regimentmelting like snow under sprays of flame. They could not fire atDellarme's men and Dellarme's men could not fire at them without leaningover the parapet. They could not go ahead. There was no room to theirrear, for the reserves behind the third terrace had rushed up to thesecond terrace; those behind the fourth to the third; and still othersacross the road to the fourth, in successive waves.With a welter of slaughter around them, Fracasse's men were in somethingof the position that little Peterkin had enjoyed in the shell crater.They ate a breakfast of biscuits, washed down by water from theircanteens. Trickles of sand from bullet holes sprinkled their shouldersand they had enough resiliency of spirit to grin when a stream of sandfrom a bag torn by a shell burst ran down the back of Pilzer's neck. Itwas rather amusing to hear Jake growling as he twisted in his blouse.Hugo caught the humor of it in another sense, for the same shell burstthrew a piece of brown sleeve matted in a piece of flesh among theflowers. The next instant he saw a squad of Grays who sprang up to rushtoward the linden stumps go down under the hose stream from theautomatic with the precision of having been struck by an electriccurrent. Not occupied, as he had been yesterday, with the business ofkeeping to his part as a physical cog in the machine, he was seeing waras a spectator--as Marta saw it, as only a privileged few ever see it.Society, he was thinking, took the trouble to bring boys through thewhooping-cough and measles, pay for clothing and doctors' bills, and,while it complained about business losses and safe-guarded trees andharvests and buildings, destroyed the most valuable product of all witha spatter of bullets from a rapid-firer.The position of him and his comrades struck him as tragically ludicrous.Were they grown men? Had they reasoning minds? Were they of the greatraces that had given the world steam-power, electric power, anaesthesia,and antiseptics? Had they the religion of Christ? Had they aninheritance of great ages of art, literature, music, and philosophy? Didthey guard the treasures of their libraries and galleries? Would theyshudder in indignation if some one sent a bullet through the SistineMadonna, or throw a bomb at the Venus de Milo, or struck a rare Chineseporcelain into fragments with an axe?Yes; oh, yes!Here were beings created in the likeness of their Maker, whose criterionof superiority over other animals was in these symbols and not in thatof tooth, claw, or talon, disembowelling their fellow creatures. Herewere beings huddled together like a lot of puppies or cubs on an islandin the midst of carnage which was not a visitation of the Almighty, butof their own making. And suicide and homicide were against the law inthe lands of both the Browns and the Grays!The whole business was monstrous, lunatic, inconceivable. Yet he himselfwas one of the actors, without the character or the courage to breakfree of the machine which was taking lives with the irresponsibility ofa baby hammering at the jewels of a watch. The fact that he knew bettermade him far more culpable, he thought, than little Peterkin or any ofhis comrades. Yes, he was despicable; he was a coward!All were lulled into a sense of security except Captain Fracasse, whohad a set frown of apprehension which came of a professional knowledgenot theirs. Little Peterkin, warmed by the autumn sunlight, began tobelieve in his star. If there were to be a special dispensationproviding shell craters and the reverse walls of redoubts for him, hemight retain his reputation for heroism.The sand still working its way downward between Pilzer's bare skin andhis undershirt irritated him to unusual restlessness of ambition forglory and bronze crosses. He was the strong man of his company, nowthat Eugene Aronson was dead. He must prove his importance. Aninspiration made him leap to his feet. This brought his head within afoot of the top of the parapet, with an enemy's rifle barrel in easyreach. Fortunately, or unfortunately, he was the type who must precedeaction with a boast; a bite with a growl. Let all see that he was aboutto do a gallant, clever thing."Watch me snatch that rifle!" he announced."No, you don't! Get down!" snapped Fracasse. "We aren't invitinghand-grenades. It's a wonder that we have escaped so far.""Hand-grenades!" gasped Peterkin, going white.But nobody observed his pallor. Every one else was gasping,"Hand-grenades!" under his breath; or, if not, his thoughts wereshrieking, "Hand-grenades!" There was a restless movement, a wistfullook to the rear."Keep quiet!" whispered Fracasse. "Let us hope it isn't known that we'rehere."They became as still as men of stone."Well, if they are going to throw grenades then they will throw them!"exclaimed Peterkin with the bravery of fear. He must do or say somethingworthy of a hero, he thought, in order to prove that he was not asscared as he knew he had looked and still felt."You have the right sort of _sang-froid_, Peter Kinderling!" whisperedFracasse. "And you, Pilzer, showed a proper spirit, too, if wronglydirected."Under cover of this favor, Peterkin drew a little out of line, making agreat pretence of stretching his legs and yawning--yawning with asincerely dropped jaw and a quivering lip. He pressed his chin againstthe ground and this stopped the quivering. Also, he was in a position towatch the parapet closely and to make a quick spring.Fatalism had become suspense--suspense without action to take theirminds off the prospect, the suspense of death lurking in a cloud whichmight break in a lightning flash! They thought that they knew the fullgamut of horrors; but nothing that they had yet gone through was anycriterion for what they now had to endure. All understood the nature ofa hand-grenade, which bursts like a Nihilist's bomb. It was as easy,they knew, to toss hand-grenades over the sand-bags into human flesh asapples into a basket. They felt themselves bound and gagged, waiting foran assassin to macerate them at his own sweet will.The second hour was worse than the first, the third worse than thesecond. In lulls they heard the voices of Dellarme and his men, whichseemed more ominous than the crash of rifles or the scream and crack ofshells. Finally there was a lull which they knew meant the supremeattempt to storm the position from the town side. They heard thecommotion that followed Dellarme's death; the sharp, rallying commandsof Feller and Stransky; and then, as Peterkin saw a black object flyfree of a hand over the parapet he made a catlike spring, followed byanother and another, and plunged face downward at the angle where theface of the redoubt bent toward the town.He thought that he was dead, and found, as he had in the shell crater,that he was not. After the two explosions he heard groans that chilledhis blood, and looked around to see living faces like chalk, withglassy, beady, protruding eyes, and a dozen men killed and evisceratedand mangled in bleeding confusion.But Hugo and Pilzer and those of Peterkin's immediate group were alive.They were in their places, while he was alone and out of his place. Hehad bolted, while they held their ground; now he would be revealed inhis true light. The bronze cross would be lost before it was pinned tohis breast. From where he lay, however, he could see the other face ofthe redoubt and a wedge of men about to mount the sand-bags. His nextact was born of the inspired cunning of his fear of being exposed,which was almost as compelling as his fear of death. He waved his handexcitedly to the others to come on."Charge! Charge! This is the way!" shrieked Peterkin.His voice had the terror of a man floating toward a falls and callingfor a rope, but not so to Fracasse, to whom it was the voice of a greatchance. Why hadn't he thought of this before? Of course, he should movearound under cover of the reverse wall of the redoubt to join in theattack on the weak point! The valet's son had shown him the way."Come, men, come! Follow me and Peterkin!" cried Fracasse.Did they follow? Westerling or any expert in the psychology of war couldunderstand how ripe was their mood. "It is the wait under rightconditions that will make men fiends unleashed when the word to storm isgiven," an older authority had written. Under sentence of death for sixhours, they welcomed any opportunity to get at grips with those who hadheld death suspended over their heads.You will use hand-grenades, will you? Snug behind sand-bags you willtear the flesh of our comrades to pieces, will you? They saw red, thered of raw fragments of flesh; the red of the gush from torn arterywalls--all except Hugo and Peterkin, who might well begin to believethat there was a measure of art in heroism. Peterkin seemed to shareleadership at the captain's side, but he slipped and fell--he had weakankles, anyway--as Fracasse's men pressed the rear of the wedge forwardwith the strength of mass, only to be borne back by men, riddled withbullets, tumbling fairly into their faces.As we have seen, there was no getting through a breach under theconcentrated blasts of a hundred rifles, and Pilzer, who, by using humanshoulders for steps, had reached the parapet, turned a back somersaultwith out his rifle. However, he seized one from a dead man's handbefore the captain had noticed the loss. Some of the company joined inthe flight of the attackers from the town into the open, but Hugo andPilzer and their friends remained under cover of the wall. They stillsaw red, the red of a darker anger--that of repulse.When, finally, they burst into the redoubt after it was found that theBrowns had gone, all, even the judge's son, were the war demon's, own.The veneer had been warped and twisted and burned off down to the rawanimal flesh. Their brains had the fever itch of callouses forming. Nota sign of brown there in the yard; not a sign of any tribute after allthey had endured! They had not been able to lay hands on the murderousthrowers of hand-grenades. Far away now was the barrack-room genialityof the forum around Hugo; in oblivion were the ethics of an inheritedcivilization taught by mothers, teachers, and church.But here was a house--a house of the Browns; a big, fine house! Theywould see what they had won--this was the privilege of baffled victory.What they had won was theirs! To the victor the spoils! Pell-mell theycrowded into the dining-room, Hugo with the rest, feeling himself astraw on the crest of a wave, and Pilzer, most bitter, most ugly of all,his short, strong teeth and gums showing and his liver patch red, lumpy,and trembling. In crossing the threshold of privacy they committed theact that leaves the deepest wound of war's inheritance, to go on fromgeneration to generation in the history of families."A swell dining-room! I like the chandeliers!" roared Pilzer.With his bayonet he smashed the only globe left intact by the shellfire. There was a laugh as a shower of glass fell on the floor. Even thejudge's son, the son of the tribune of law, joined in. Pilzer thenripped up the leather seat of a chair. This introductory havoc whettedhis appetite for other worlds of conquest, as the self-chosen leader ofthe increasing crowd that poured through the doorway."Maybe there's food!" he shouted. "Maybe there's wine!""Food and wine!""Yes, wine! We're thirsty!""And maybe women! I'd like to kiss a pretty maid servant!" Pilzer added,starting toward the hall."Stop!" cried Hugo, forcing his way in front of Pilzer.He was like no one of the Hugos of the many parts that his comrades hadseen him play. His blue eyes had become an inflexible gray. He wasstanding half on tiptoe, his quivering muscles in tune with thequivering pitch of his voice: a Hugo in anger! This was a tremendousjoke. He was about to regain his reputation as a humorist by a brilliantdisplay in keeping with the new order of their existence."We have no right in here! This is a private house!"But the fever of their savagery--the infectious savagery of themob--wanted no humor of this kind."Out of the way, you white-livered little rat!" cried Pilzer, "or I'llprick the tummy of mamma's darling!"What happened then was so sudden and unexpected in Hugo that all werevague about details. They saw him in a catapultic lunge, mesmeric in itsswiftness, and they saw Pilzer go down, his leg twisted under him andhis head banging the floor. Hugo stood, half ashamed, half frightened,yet ready for another encounter.Fracasse, entering at this moment, was too intent on his mission toconsider the rights of a personal difference between two of his company,though he heard and noted Pilzer's growling complaint that he had beenstruck an unfair blow."There's work to do! Out of here, quick! We are losing valuable time!"he announced, rounding his men toward the door with commandinggestures. "We are going in pursuit!"Marta, who had observed the latter part of the scene from the shadows ofthe hall, knew that she should never forget Hugo's face as he turned onPilzer, while his voice of protest struck a singing chord in herjangling nerves. It was the voice of civilization, of one who couldthink out of the orbit of a whirlpool of passionate barbarism. She couldsee that he was about to spring and her prayer went with his leap. Shegloried in the impact that felled the great brute with the liver patchon his cheek, which was like a birthmark of war.After the men were gone she regretted that she had not gone to Hugo andexpressed her gratitude. She vaguely wondered if she should see himagain and hoped that she might. The two faces, Hugo's and Pilzer's, inthe instant of Hugo's protest and Pilzer's contempt, were as clear as inlife before her eyes.Then a staff-officer appeared in the doorway. When he saw a woman enterthe room he frowned. He had ridden from the town, which was empty ofwomen, a fact that he regarded as a blessing. If she had been a maidservant he would have kept on his cap. Seeing that she was not, heremoved it and found himself in want of words as their eyes met aftershe had made a gesture to the broken glass on the floor and thelacerated table top, which said too plainly:"Do you admire your work?"The fact that he was well groomed and freshly shaven did not in any wisedissipate in her feminine mind his connection with this destruction. Hehad never seen anything like the smile which went with the gesture. Hereyes were two continuing and challenging flames. Her chin was held highand steady, and the pallor of exhaustion, with the blackness of herhair-and eyes, made her strangely commanding. He understood that she wasnot waiting for him to speak, but to go."I did not know that there was a woman here!" he said."And I did not know that officers of the Grays were accustomed to enterprivate houses without invitations!" she replied."This is a little different," he began.She interrupted him."But the law of the Grays is that homes should be left undisturbed,isn't it? At least, it is the law of civilization. I believe youprofess, too, to protect property, do you not?""Why, yes!" he agreed. He wished that he could get a little respite fromthe steady fire of her eyes. It was embarrassing and as confusing as thewhite light of an impracticable logic."In that case, please place a guard around our house lest some more ofyour soldiers get out of control," she went on."I can do that, yes," he said. "But we are to make this a staffheadquarters and must start at once to put the house in readiness.""General Westerling's headquarters?" she inquired.He parried the question with a frown. Staff-officers never giveinformation. They receive information and transmit orders."I know General Westerling. You will tell him that my mother, Mrs.Galland, and our maid and myself are very tired from the entertainmenthe has given us, unasked, and we need sleep to-night. So you will leaveus until morning and that door, sir, is the one out into the grounds."The staff-officer bowed and went out by that door, glad to get away fromMarta's eyes. His inspection of the premises with a view to plans forstaff accommodation could wait. Westerling would not be here for twodays at least."Whew! What energy she has!" he thought. "I never had anybody make mefeel so contemptibly unlike a gentleman in my life."Yet Marta, returning to the hall, had to steady herself in a dizzymoment against the wall. Complete reaction had come. She craved sleep asif it were the one true, real thing in the world. She craved sleep forthe clarity of mind that comes with the morning light. In the hazinessof fleecy thought, as slumber drew its soft clouds around her, her lastconscious visions were the pleasant ones rising free of a background ofhorror: of Feller's smile when he went back to his automatic for good;of Dellarme's smile as he was dying; of Stransky's smile as Minna gavehim hope; and of Hugo's face as he uttered his flute-like cry ofprotest. In her ears were the haunting calmness and contained force ofLanstron's voice over the telephone. She was pleased to think that shehad not lost her temper in her talk with the staff-officer. No, she hadnot flared once in indignation. It was as if she had absorbed some ofLanny's own self-control. Lanny would approve of her in that scene withan officer of the Grays. And she realized that a change had come overher--a change inexplicable and telling--and she was tired--oh, so tired!It had been exhausting work, indeed, for one woman, though she had beenaround the world, making war on two armies.       *       *       *       *        *Meanwhile, all too flushed with energy, the energy of movement, to thinkof the feud between Hugo and Pilzer, Fracasse's men had sped along thecastle road. Little Peterkin easily kept pace. There was no danger inpursuit. In him was the same zest of the chase which Animated hiscomrades. They dropped down on a ledge without much regard to order.Before them, at close range, was a company breaking out of close orderin a _sauve-qui-peut_ rout up a reverse slope. It was not Dellarme'scompany, but some other that had mistaken its direction and retired toolate and by the wrong road.You will throw hand-grenades, will you? thought Fracasse's men. You willmangle our fellows when they Can't strike back, will you? Now you'llpay! Now it is our turn! We have seen our blood flow and now yours willflow!The lust of the red slipped the cartridge clips into the magazines andheld a true aim in the mad delight of slaughter. No one minded, for noone heard--not even little Peterkin--the scattering bullets in return.They had reached the stage where the objective thought of revenge whollysubmerged the subjective thought of personal danger, which is the moodof the hungry tiger in the hunt. They were the veritable finishedproducts of veteran experience in purpose and marksmanship. Hugo, too,was firing, but far over the head of every target; firing like a man ina trance who needs some deciding incident to bring him out of it intothe part he was to play.Only occasional figures who had not escaped over the ridge were to beseen. The fewer the targets the greater the concentration. A wholecompany was firing on a dozen straggling figures. But one--that one inthe pasture--seemed to have a charmed life. The ground around him waspeppered with dust spots. He had only a few yards more to go to safety;yes his head--the exasperation of him!--was in line with the crestbefore he fell.Where was there any more prey? With ferret quickness eyes swept therange of vision. Out of an orchard into the stubble of a wheat-fieldbroke a panicky mass; a score or more of men who had lost their officerand their heads presumably. They were the nail under the hammer, a brownblot, a target."Ah!" a chorus of excited exclamations in greeting of the game flushedfrom cover ran along the line. Just the way you got our fellows with thehand-grenades, we will get you! This was the thought, this the prayerwhich they saw being fulfilled by the glad medley of their fire whenHugo Mallin sprang up and threw down his rifle as if it were somethingwhose touch had become venomous. He threw it down with featurestransformed in the uplifting thought and the relief of a finalresolution taken."I am through!" he cried. "I will not murder my fellowman who has doneme no wrong! I cannot, I will not kill!"Fracasse, who was near by, heard enough to understand the purport of thedeclaration, and his recollection of Hugo's heresy and all the prejudicethat he had formed against Hugo and the abhorrence of Hugo's offence tothe strict militarist brought a rush of anger to his brain as he leapedup and drawing his sword, struck at Hugo with the flat of it. He aimedfor Hugo's back, but a bullet had hit Hugo in the calf of his leg and,his knees giving under him, he received the blow on the head and fellunconscious.When he came to it was with a twitch of pain in his ribs. He saw theglowering faces of his comrades above him and realized that Pilzer hadgiven him a kick which expressed the general opinion."Once ought to be enough of that," said the doctor, who was bandagingthe leg, speaking to Pilzer.Yet in the doctor's eyes Hugo saw no favor, only the humanity of hisoccupation of mercy to criminal and king alike. But Hugo expected nofavor and he was glad of what he had done as he swooned again. When hecame to a second time, his head aching with throbs, it was with a senseof falling. He found that he was on a litter that had just been setdown. Evidently this was by order of the colonel, who was standing overHugo in the company of some officers. All were regarding him as if hewere a species of reptile."World anarchist ideas, which is another word for treason or whiteliver," observed the colonel. "To think that it happened in my regiment!But I'll not try to cover it for the regiment's good name. He will getthe full measure of the law!""The placard is a good idea," suggested an officer."Yes, put on by one of his comrades!""The punishment of public opinion. It shows how sound the army is atheart."Hugo, lowering his glance, was able to see a sheet of note-paper pinnedto his blouse. It was lettered, but he could not make out the words.Then he heard the approach of a galloping horse, whose hoofs seemed tostrike his head, and heard the horse stop and an orderly sayingsomething about Company I having got too far forward into a mess and theneed of litters."We can spare this one," said the colonel.Hugo was rolled roughly onto the ground by the roadside and left alone.He managed to raise himself on his elbow and saw that the lettering ofthe placard was "Coward!" Officers and soldiers and hospital-corps mencalled attention to it as they passed. The sun was very hot and he wasgrowing feverish. Painfully he dragged himself to the shelter of a tree,and then, looking around, saw that he was near the big house of theterraced garden.XXXMARTA MEETS HUGOThe general staff-officer of the Grays, who had tasted Marta's temper onhis first call, when he returned the next morning did not enterunannounced. He rang the door-bell."I have a message for you from General Westerling," he said to her. "Thegeneral expresses his deep regret at the unavoidable damage to yourhouse and grounds and has directed that everything possible be doneimmediately in the way of repairs."In proof of this the officer called attention to a group ofservice-corps men who were removing the sand-bags from the firstterrace. Others were at work in the garden setting uprooted plants backinto the earth."His Excellency says," continued the officer, "that, although the houseis so admirably suited for staff purposes, we will find another if youdesire."He was too polite and too considerate in his attitude for Marta not tomeet him in the same spirit."That is what we should naturally prefer," and Marta bowed her head inindecision."We should have to begin installing the telegraph and telephone serviceon the lower floor at once," he remarked. "In fact, all arrangementsmust be made before the general's arrival.""He has been a guest here before," she said reminiscently anddetachedly.Her head dropped lower, in apparent disregard of his presence, as shetook counsel with herself. She was perfectly still, without even themovement of an eyelash. Other considerations than any he might suggest,he subtly understood, held her attention. They were the criterion bywhich she would at length assent or dissent, and nothing could hurry theMarta of to-day, who yesterday had been a creature of feverish impulse.It seemed a long time that he was watching that wonderful profile underthe very black hair, soft with the softness of flesh, yet firmly carved.She lifted her head gradually, her eyes sweeping past the spot whereDellarme had lain dying, where Feller had manned the automatic, whereStransky had thrown Pilzer over the parapet. He saw the glance arrestedand focussed on the flag of the Grays, which was floating from a staffon the outskirts of the town, and slowly, glowingly, the light ripplingon its folds was reflected in her face."She is for us! She is a Gray!" he thought triumphantly. The woman andthe flag! The matter-of-fact staff-officer felt the thrill of sentiment."I think we can arrange it," Marta announced with a rare smile ofassent."Then I'll go back to town and set the signal-corps men to work," hesaid."And when you come you will find the house at your disposal," sheassured him.Except that he was raising his cap instead of saluting, he was consciousof withdrawing with the deference due to a superior.In place of the smile, after he had gone, came a frown and a look in hereyes as if at something revolting; then the smile returned, to besucceeded by the frown, which was followed by an indeterminate shakingof the head.The roar of battle kept up its steady refrain in the direction of therange. Marta had heard it when she fell asleep and heard it when sheawakened. A battery of heavy guns of the Grays broke their flashes froma knoll this side of the one where Dellarme's men had made their firststand. At the foot of the garden, where yesterday she had distributedflowers to the wounded Browns, a regiment of Gray infantry was marchingpast a train of siege-guns. All the figures moving on the landscape,which yesterday had been brown, had changed to gray. The Grays weremasters of the town and all the neighborhood.Marta stepped down from the veranda in response to the call of the openair to physical vigor renewed after sweet sleep. Rather than returndirectly to the kitchen, where breakfast was waiting, she would goaround the house. She stopped before a Japanese maple which had beensplit by a shell striking in a crotch. Was there any hope of saving it?No. She turned white about the lips, with red spots on her cheeks, andat length nodded her head as if in answer to some inward question.Over the sward, cut by shell fragments, lay torn limbs and bits of bark,and in the shade of a tree near the road she had a glimpse of theshoulder of the gray uniform of a prostrate man. The rest of him washidden by the low-hanging branches of one of the Norway spruces whichbordered the estate at this point. Another step and she saw a circularred spot on a white leg bandage; another, and a white square of paperpinned to a blouse; another, and she identified the wounded man as herhero of the scene in the dining-room.Hugo's eyes were closed, his breaths slow, in restless sleep. His face,flushed with fever, was winningly boyish and frank. He who had had thecourage to speak alone against the opinion of his fellows, to voice abelief that made every sympathetic chord in her own mind sing withpraise and understanding, the courage to say that invasion was wrongeven when made by his own people, had been labelled coward and left todie!The exaltation of his features when he had been the champion of herbeliefs and her impulse against the barbarism of his comrades and thecharm of their resignation now, the pitifulness of his condition--allhad an appeal as she bent over him that called for an expression havingthe touch of the sublimely feminine. She took his hand in hers andpressed it gently. He awoke and brought himself jerkily to a sittingposture. The effort made a crash in his head that sent his sensesswimming. She thought that he was going to swoon and slipped her armbehind him in support and, the Marta of impulse, pressed her lips to hisbrow. After the first racking throb of his temples he was able to steadyhimself, and as she drew away she saw his blue eyes starting in wonderat her act."I--I had to do it to thank you for what you did in the dining-room!"she stammered."Oh! Oh! It was very beautiful of you, but I couldn't help beingsurprised, for it was rather unusual--from a stranger." He smiled, andHugo had a gift in smiles, as we know: smiles for laughter, smiles forreassurance, and smiles to cure embarrassment. "It was almost asrefreshing as a drink of water," he concluded impersonally."You are thirsty?""This--this is morning, isn't it?" Hugo went on quizzically."Yes, yes!""Then it must be the next day," he pursued, still quizzically. "You see,I said I would not kill any more--and I will not--and I was shot and gottagged without even being shipped as freight. I was thirsty last night,very thirsty, and some one--I think it was Jake Pilzer--some one said togo to the fountain of hell for a drink, but I--I don't think that a verygood place to get a drink, do you?"Weak and faint as he was, he put a touch of drollery into the questionwhich made her laugh, her eyes sparkling through a moist haze."You're real, aren't you?" he inquired in sudden perplexity. "I'm notdreaming?""As real as the water I shall bring you."Soon Marta was back, holding a glass to his lips."There's no doubt about it; you are real!" said Hugo."I feel as if the chimney were still hot but that you had drenched thefire in the grate.""Who put this on you?" she asked as she unpinned the placard."I've a vague idea, from a vague overhearing of the colonel's remarks,that it is public opinion," he replied, and seeing, that she was aboutto tear it up, he arrested her action. "No, I think I'd like to save itas a souvenir--the odds are so greatly against me--as a sort of souvenirto keep up my courage."His tone, the way he drew the muscles of his face, ironed out her frownof disgust at public opinion with a smile. For he made his kind ofcourage no less light-hearted and free of pose than Dellarme had madehis.Directly the coachman, whom Marta had summoned when she went for thewater, appeared with an improvised litter, and the two bore in at thekitchen door a guest for breakfast whose arrival gave Mrs. Galland adistinctly visible surprise. His uniform was gray, and in her heart ofhearts she hated gray as the symbol of an enemy whom her husband hadfought. But when Marta told the story of the part he had played indefence of the chandelier, personal partisanship abetted the motherlyimpulse that was already breaking down prejudice. She was busy with adozen suggestions for his comfort, quite taking matters out of Marta'shands."I know more about the care of the sick than you do!" she insisted. "Onelump or two in your coffee, sir? There, there, you had better let mehold the cup for you. You are sure you can sit up? Then we must have apillow.""I'll fetch one from the other room," put in Minna."Two will be better!" Marta called after her."It is delightful to have breakfast in your kitchen, madame," said Hugoto Mrs. Galland in a way that ought to have justified her in thinkingherself the most charming and useful person in the world.XXXIUNTO CAESARIt was more irritating than ever for Mrs. Galland to keep pace with herdaughter's inconsistencies. There was a Marta listening in partisansympathy to Hugo's story of why he had refused to fight and telling thestory of her school in return. There was a Marta seizing Hugo's hand ina quick, impulsive grasp as she exclaimed: "Your act personified what Itaught my children!" There was a Marta planning how he should besecreted in the coachman's quarters over the stable, where he would bereasonably free from discovery until his strength was regained. Thenhere was another Marta, after Hugo had been carried away on the litter,saying coolly to her mother:"'Unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's!' We have our property, ourhome to protect. Perhaps the Grays have come to stay for good, sograciousness is our only weapon. We cannot fight a whole armysingle-handed.""You have found that out, Marta?" said Mrs. Galland."We have four rooms in the baron's tower and a kitchen stove," Martaproceeded. "With Minna we can make ourselves very comfortable and leavethe house to the staff.""The Gallands in their gardener's quarters! The staff of the Grays inours! Your father will turn in his grave!" Mrs. Galland exclaimed."But, mother, it is not quite agreeable to think of three women livingin the same house with a score of strange men!" Marta persisted."I had not thought of that, Marta. Of course, it would be abominable!"agreed Mrs. Galland, promptly capitulating where a point of proprietywas involved.When Marta informed the officer--the same one who had rung the door-bellon his second visit--of the family's decision he appeared shocked at theidea of eviction that was implied. But, secretly pleased at the turn ofevents, he hastened to apologize for war's brutal necessities, andMarta's complaisance led him to consider himself something of adiplomatist. Yes, more than ever he was convinced of the wisdom of aninvader ringing door-bells.Meanwhile, the service-corps men had continued their work until nowthere was no vestige of war in the grounds that labor could obliterate;and masons had come to repair the walls of the house itself andplasterers to renew the broken ceilings.All this Marta regarded in a kind of charmed wonder that an invadercould be so considerate. Her manner with the officers in charge ofpreparations had the simplicity and ease which a woman of twenty-seven,who is not old-maidish because she is not afraid of a single future, mayemploy as a serene hostess. She frequently asked if there were goodnews."Yes," was the uniform reply. An unexpected setback here or resistancethere, but progress, nevertheless. But she learned, too, that the firsttwo days' fighting along the frontier had cost the Grays fifty thousandcasualties."In order to make an omelet you must break eggs!" she remarked."Spoken like a true soldier--like a member of the staff!" was the reply.In her constraint and detachment they realized her consciousappreciation of the fact that in earlier times her people had been forthe Browns; but in her flashes of interest in the progress of the war,flashes from a woman's unmilitary mind, they judged that her heart waswith the Grays. And why not? Was it not natural that a woman with morethan her share of intellectual perception should be on the right side?From her associations it was not to be expected that she would make anoutright declaration of apostasy. This would destroy the value and theattractiveness of her conversion Reverence for the past, for a fatherwho had fought for the Browns, against her own convictions, made herattitude appear singularly and delicately correct.Though everything was ready for them, the staff delayed coming owing tothe stubbornness of some heavy guns of the Browns, which, while they haddirected no shells against the house, had shown that they had the rangeby unexpectedly playing havoc with infantry in close order on the passroad at the foot of the garden and with transportation on the castleroad. But at last the battery was silenced and the mind of the armymight establish itself in its offices on the ground floor and itsquarters on the second floor without being in danger.The war was a week old--a week which had developed other tangents andtraps than La Tir--on the morning that the first instalment of juniorofficers came to occupy the tables and desks. Where the family portraitshad hung in the dining-room were now big maps dotted with brown and grayflags. Portable field cabinets with sectional maps on a large scale werearranged around the walls of the drawing-room. In what had been thelounging room of the old days of Galland prosperity, the refrain of halfa dozen telegraph instruments made medley with the clicking oftypewriters. Cooks and helpers were busy in the kitchen; for the staffwere to live like gentlemen; they were to have their morning baths,their comfortable beds, and regular meals. No twinge of indigestion orof rheumatism from exposure was to interfere with the working of theirprecious intellectual processes. No detail of assistance would belacking to save any bureaucratic head time and labor The bedrooms wereapportioned according to rank--that of the master awaited the master;the best servant's bedroom awaited Francois, his valet.When Bouchard, the chief of intelligence, who fought the battle of witsand spies against Lanstron, came, two hours before Westerling was due,the last of the staff except Westerling and his personal aide hadarrived Bouchard, with his iron-gray hair, bushy eyebrows, strong,aquiline nose, and hawk-like eyes, his mouth hidden by a bristlymustache, was lean and saturnine, and he was loyal. No jealous thoughtentered his mind at having to serve a man younger than himself. He didnot serve a personality; he served a chief of staff and a profession.The score of words which escaped him as he looked over the arrangementswere all of directing criticism and bitten off sharply, as if heregretted that he had to waste breath in communicating even a thought."I tell nothing, but you tell me everything!" said Bouchard's hawk eyes.He was old-fashioned; he looked his part, which was one of the manypoints of difference between him and Lanstron as a chief ofintelligence.After he had gone through the house he went for a flyspecking tour ofthe grounds, where he came upon a private of the Grays on crutches. Withrest and good food the tiny hole in Hugo's leg from the mercifulsmall-calibre bullet had healed rapidly. Confinement was irksome on asunny day. He had grown strong enough in spirit to face his fate,whatever it might be, and in the absence of the watchful coachman he hadrisked the delight of a convalescent's adventure in the open, clad inhis uniform, the only clothes he had. Bouchard saw instantly that thisprivate did not wear the insignia of staff service."What are you doing here?" he asked."Getting well of a wound," answered Hugo, looking frankly into the hawkeyes."Evidently!" said Bouchard, who was always irritated when told what hecould see for himself. "Why aren't you at a hospital?""I was not wanted there!" said Hugo."What! what!" But Bouchard had wasted two words. "Your name andregiment?" he asked."Hugo Mallin, of the 128th," replied Hugo."Uh-h!" Bouchard's pigeonhole memory had retained the name."Charge--mutiny under fire; anarchism!" he went on, chopping out thewords as if they were chips from a piece of granite. "Well, you have notescaped trial by hiding.""I did not flatter myself that with one leg against a whole army I hadmuch chance, sir!" Hugo replied respectfully."Uh-h!" The hawk eyes flashed their disapproval of such controversialfreedom of language from a private. Had he had his way he would havehanged Hugo to the nearest tree; for Bouchard had truly a mediaeval soul.But Hugo's case was so extraordinary that it had reached Westerling'sears, and Bouchard knew that Westerling wished to see Hugo when he wasapprehended. It was not for Bouchard to consider this desire of a chiefof staff to deal with the case of a private in person as singular. Norequest of the chief of staff was singular to him. It became a matter ofnatural law. He called to one of the staff guards who was pacing backand forth near by."Take this man in charge and watch him sharply until General Westerlingsends for him!""And you will get justice from General Westerling!" It was Marta'svoice. In approaching she had unavoidably overheard part of theconversation. "Justice is his first characteristic!" she added as thehawk eyes turned their scrutiny into hers, which were calm and smiling.Hugo had not seen Marta since he had been carried to the coachman'squarters. Minna had visited him frequently, bearing inquiries from hermistress as well as custards. He had looked forward to a talk with Martaas a kindred spirit, yet it was difficult for him to reconcile thewoman speaking now with the woman who had kissed him on the forehead.But he said nothing as he was marched away."Miss Galland!" exclaimed Bouchard in a way that said he knew her story."Yes, that little monkey can depend on more justice than he deserves.The unanswerable evidence is on the chief of staff's desk awaiting hisarrival."Bouchard's hawk eyes probed hers for an instant longer and seemed tofind nothing to call further curiosity; then he lifted his cap andproceeded with his tour of inspection.Marta smiled thoughtfully as she watched his receding figure, while hereyelashes narrowed and she inclined her head with a nod before she movedaway in the direction of the tower. There was almost complete silencealong the front. Since yesterday's action, which had checked the gunscommanding the range of the house, there had been little firing. Sheguessed that the lull was only a recess of preparation for the grandattack on the first line of permanent defence, and that probably thiswould follow Westerling's arrival. He was due at four o'clock and hewould be characteristically prompt to the minute."It must not be! Hugo Mallin is too fine a spirit to be sacrificed. I'llgo on my knees, if need be, to Westerling," Marta was thinking as shepaced back and forth in her room. On her knees to him! She stoppedshort, struck in revolt with a memory of the way he had looked at heronce as she sat across the tea-table from him in the hotelreception-room. "No, I could not endure that except as a last resort. Ifever there were a time to use all my wits it is now--to save HugoMallin, the one soldier who acted out the principles which I taught mychildren!"XXXIITEA ON THE VERANDA AGAINAs it lacked one minute to four when Hedworth Westerling, chief of staffin name as well as power now, alighted from the gray automobile thatturned in at the Galland drive, the chauffeur thought well enough ofhimself to forget the crush of supplies and ambulances that had delayedHis Excellency's car for at least ninety seconds in the main street ofthe town. Though His Excellency had not occupied his new headquarters assoon as he expected, this could have no influence on results. If he hadlost fifty thousand men on the first two days and two hundred thousandsince the war had begun, should he allow this to disturb his well-beingof body or mind? His well-being of body and mind meant the ultimatesaving of lives.The Grays were winning; this alone counted in the present. They wouldcontinue to win; this alone counted in the future. They had won bycrowding in reserves till the positions attacked yielded to superiorstrength. Thus they would continue to win until the last positions hadyielded.Five million mothers' sons against three million mothers' sons! Five tothree pounds of flesh! Five to three ounces of blood! With equal skill,superior strength must always tell. Westerling and his staff wereresponsible for the skill. If their minds would work better for it, thenation could well afford to feed them on nightingales' tongues.Confidence is the handmaiden of skill. Confidence is the edge on thesword; confidence brings the final charge that wins the redoubt.Confidence was reflected in Westerling's bearing and in his smile ofcommand as he passed through the staff rooms, Turcas and Bouchard in histrain, with tacit approval of the arrangements. Finally, Turcas, nowvice-chief of staff, and the other chiefs awaited his pleasure in thelibrary, which was to be his sanctum. On the massive seventeenth-centurydesk lay a number of reports and suggestions. Westerling ran throughthem with accustomed swiftness of sifting and then turned to hispersonal aide."Tell Francois that I will have tea on the veranda."From the fact that he took with him the papers that he had laid aside,subordinate generals, with the gift of unspoken directions which is apart of their profession, understood that he meant to go over thesubjects requiring special attention while he had tea."Everything is going well--well!" he added in a way that said thateverything must be if he said so and that he knew how to make everythinggo well. "And we shall be up pretty late to-night. Any one who feels theneed had better take a nap"--the implication being that he did not."Well!" ran the unspoken communication of confidence through the staff.So well that His Excellency was calmly taking tea on the veranda! Forthe indefatigable Turcas the detail; for Westerling the front of Jove."Well!" The thrill of the word was with him in a flight of sentiment ashe stood on that veranda where a certain prophecy had been made to ayoung colonel. Sight of the rippling folds of the flag of his country onthe outskirts of the town prolonged the thrill. His eyes swept the palehorizon of the distances of plain and Mountain and lowered to thegarden. Above the second terrace he saw a crown of woman's hair--hair ofa jet abundance, radiant in the sunlight and shading a face that broughtfamiliar completeness to the scene.He had told Marta only two weeks ago that he should see her again ifwar came; and war had come. With the inviting prospect of a few holidaymoments in which to continue the interview that had been abruptlyconcluded in a hotel reception-room, he started down the terrace steps.Their glances met where the second terrace path ended at the secondterrace flight; hers shot with a beam of restrained and questioning goodhumor that spoke at least a truce to the invader."You called sooner than I expected," she said in a note of equivocalpleasantry."Or I," he rejoined with a shade of triumph, the politest of triumph. Hewas a step above her, her head on a level with the pocket of his blouse.His square shoulders, commanding height, and military erectness werethus emphasized, as was her own feminine slightness."I want to thank you," she said. "As becomes a soldier, your forethoughtwas expressed in action. It was the promptness of the men you sent tolook after the garden which saved the uprooted plants before they werepast recovery.""I wished it for your sake and somewhat for my own sake to be the samethat it was in the days when I used to call," he said graciously. "Teawas from four to five, do you remember? Will you join me? I have justordered it."A generous, pleasant conqueror, this! No one knew better than Westerlinghow to be one when he chose. He was something of an actor. Leaders ofmen of his type usually are."Why, yes. Very gladly!" she assented with no undue cordiality and noundue constraint, quite as if there were no war."It was the Browns who cut the lindens?" he suggested significantly."They said that it was necessary as part of the defence," she replied."We shall plant new ones and have the pleasure of watching them grow."Neutrality could not be better impersonated he thought, than in theeven cleaving of her lips over the words. They seemed to say that astorm had come and gone and a new set of masters had taken the place ofthe old. As they approached the veranda Francois was placing the teathings."Quite the same! That was your chair, as I remember," said Westerlingafter indicating to Francois that he might go, "and this was mine."But the teapot was not Mrs. Galland's--it belonged to the staff."This is different," observed Marta, touching her finger-tip to the coatof arms of the Grays on the side of a cup."Yes, my own field kit," he answered, thinking that the novelty of teafrom a soldier's service had appealed to her; for she was smiling."So, you being the host and I the guest now, why, you pour!" she said.There was a touch of brittleness in her tone--of half-teasing,half-serious brittleness."Oh, no, no!" he protested laughingly, and found her glance flashingthrough her brows holding him fast in an indefinable challenge."I shall pour when you do us the honor to come to tea at the gardener'squarters in the tower," she said."No, no!" he objected. "The tea conditions are the same as before."He was earnest for his point. It would please his masculine fancy towatch those firm, small fingers pausing over the cup before the plungeof a lump of sugar stirred the miniature ocean in waves; to watch thefirm little hand in its grip of the handle of the pot."Conditions the same as before?" She laughed softly. "How can they be inmy thoughts or yours?" she asked with a sudden show of seriousness."We did turn you out of house and home--I understand!" he exclaimedapologetically. "And that is the symbol of it to you!" He indicated thecoat of arms."The symbol of the conqueror, isn't it?" he asked playfully, for in thecompany of women it pleased him to be playful."Conqueror? It's a big word!" she mused. "I hadn't thought of it inconnection with pouring tea"--which might be another way of saying thatshe had just been thinking of it very hard and might be trying to findwhether it had a pleasant or an unpleasant side. Clearly, here was aMarta different from any yet precipitated by the alchemy of war.The resourceful variety of her! Oh, it was like the old days! It madehim feel young, as young as when he had been a colonel commanding thegarrison on the other side of the white posts. She had intelligence, yetwas at the same time distinctly feminine, with the gift of as much talkabout who should pour tea as about how to storm a redoubt. She did notcarry her mental wares on her sleeve. She flashed them in a way thatprompted curiosity as to the next exhibit. He had sought primarily,selfishly, to be entertained at tea, and he was being entertained. Towant to win was his nature. He understood, too, that she wanted to win.He liked that quality in her the more because it heightened the valve ofvictory for him."Then, if you don't think of it in connection with pouring tea, let metell you what I think of when I sit on this veranda. I think of you ashostess. You refuse to play the part!" he exclaimed with thatpersistence, softened a little, perhaps, yet suggestive of the qualitycharacterized by the firm jaw and still eyes, which won his point atstaff councils. Again he was conscious of one of her sweeping glances ofappraisal, with just a glint of admiration and even approval tucked awayin the recesses of her smile."Suppose we compromise," she suggested thoughtfully, with the gravity ofone making a great concession. "Suppose you do the heavy work, and pour,and I drop the sugar in the cups."But Westerling always used a half concession as a lever to gain a fullconcession."I'd really better do it all--act out the host and the conqueror!" hedeclared. "One can't compromise principles.""Oh! Why?" She was distinctly interested, leaning nearer to him andplaying a tattoo with one set of fingers on the back of the other hand."Anything except your doing all the honors leaves me in the sameinvidious position," he answered. "It compounds my felony. It shows thatyou do think that we failed by our conduct to show respect for yourproperty. It leaves me feeling that you think that I do not regard thisas your veranda, your garden, your home, sacred by more than the laws ofwar--by an old friendship!"He made his appeal finely, as he well knew how to do. A certain magneticeloquence that went well with his handsome face and sturdy bearing hadbeen his most successful asset in making him chief of staff.The tattoo of her fingers died down while she listened to his final,serious reasons about a subject that became peculiarly significant; andher brows lifted, her eyes opened in the surprise of one who gets asudden new angle of light."You put it very well. In that case--" she said, and his glance and hersdropped, his to the capable hand on the handle of the teapot, hers intothe cup. "With the honors of war and officers permitted to retain theirside-arms?" she asked."Yes; oh, yes!" he answered happily.She smiled her acknowledgment with just that self-respect ofcapitulation which flatters the victor with the thought that he hasovercome no mean opponent--the highest form of compliment known to theguild of courtiers.He was susceptible to it and, in turn, to the curiosity about her thathad remained unsatisfied at the end of their talk in the hotel. Her ownveranda was the natural, familiar place to judge the work of time inthose character-forming years from seventeen to twenty-seven. She wasnot like what she had been in the artificial surroundings of a fortnightago. She filled the eye and the mind now in the well-knit suppleness offigure and the finished maturity of features which bore the mark ofinner growth of knowledge of life. She was not a species of intellectualexotic, as he had feared, too baffling to allow the male intellect tofeel comfortable, but very much, as he noted discriminatingly, a womanin all the physical freshness of a woman in her prime."Just like the old days, isn't it?" he exclaimed with his first sip,convinced that the officers' commissary supplied excellent tea in thefield."Yes, for the moment--if we forget the war!" she replied, and lookedaway, preoccupied, toward the landscape.If we forget the war! She bore on the words rather grimly. The changethat he had noted between the Marta of the hotel reception-room and theMarta of the moment was not altogether the work of ten years. It haddeveloped since she was in the capital. In these three weeks war hadbeen brought to her door. She had been under heavy fire. Yet thissubject of the war was the one which he, as an invader, consideredhimself bound to avoid."We do forget it at tea, don't we?" he asked."At least we need not speak of it!" she replied.Safely, then, at first, their conversation ran not on the present but onan intimate past, free of any possible bumpers. The train of memoriesonce started, she herself gave it speed if it stopped at a way station;cargo if it went empty. Prone to avoid recollections that made him feelold--to feel old was to be out of date in his profession---he foundthese livening with the youth of thirty-two and gratifying as youth'sdreams become reality. Feeling as young as a colonel, he had theconsciousness of being chief of staff. This was enough to make anysoldier enjoy the place and the company and to drink his tea slowly soas to prolong the recess from duty. His second cup growing cold, he wasreminded of the value of time, and with a playfully reproachful look atMarta he put a warning finger of conscience on the papers that laybeside the bread plate."There's work--always work for a chief!" he declared. "I--"Marta was quick to act on the hint. Her hands flew to the arms of herchair as she spoke."There's always the garden for me! But first--" Yes, first there waspoor Hugo.Westerling flushed guiltily that she should have taken his words as ahint, which was only half of his emotion. The other half shot out hishand in a restraining, companionable touch on her forearm, while hiseyes--his calculating gray eyes--glinted a youthful entreaty."Please! I didn't finish my sentence!" he begged. "You remember thatoften I used to wait after tea until the sunset--""And reached your quarters late for dinner, I also remember!" she putin. But she remained in the same position, his finger-tips on her arm,her hands holding her body free of the chair. "That is, when you did notstay to dinner!" she added."I am staying to-night. I was going to ask if you wouldn't remain on theveranda while I go over these papers. It--it would be very cosey andpleasant."One of these papers, she knew, must be the evidence against Hugo Mallin.She preferred not to make a direct appeal but to have Westerling bringup the subject himself. His smile and the look with which he regardedher spoke his appreciation of the picture she made and his fear oflosing it. Very cosey and pleasant, yes, the company of a prophetess,with a ray of sunlight making her hair an aurora of flashing bronzeovertopping a brown face, the eyes holding answers to an increasingnumber of unasked questions about the new forces that he had found inher."Why, yes," she agreed with evident pleasure, for she was thinking ofHugo.Turcas now came, in answer to Westerling's ring. The orders andsuggestions on the table seemed to be the product of this lath of a man,the vice-chief, but a lath of steel, not wood, who appeared a runnertrained for a race of intellects in the scratch class. One by one,almost perfunctorily, Westerling gave his assent as he passed the papersto Turcas; while Turcas's dry voice, coming from between a narrowopening of the thin lips, gave his reasons with a rapid-firer'sprecision in answer to his chief's inquiries.With each order somewhere along that frontier some unit of a greatorganism would respond. The reserves from this position would betransferred to that; such a position would be felt out before dark by areconnaissance in force, however costly; the rapid-firers of the 19thDivision would be transferred to the 20th; despite the 37th Brigade'slosses, it would still form the advance; General So-and-So would besuperseded after his failure of yesterday; Colonel So-and-So would takehis place as acting major-general; more care must be exercised inrecommendations for bronze crosses, lest their value so depreciate thatofficers and men would lack incentive to win them.Marta was having a look behind the scenes at the fountainhead of greatevents. Power! power! The absolute power of the soldier in the saddle,with premier and government and all the institutions of peace only a dimbackground for the processes of war! Opposite her was a man who couldmake and unmake not only generals but even the destinies of peoples. Byevery sign he enjoyed his power for its own sake. There must be a chiefof the five millions, which were as a moving forest of destruction, andhere was the chief, his strength reflected in the strong muscles of hisshort neck as he turned his head to listen to Turcas. Marta recalledthe contrast between Westerling and Lanstron as they faced each otherafter the wreck of the aeroplane ten years ago: the iron invincibilityof the elder's sturdy, mature figure and the alert, high-strunginvincibility of the slighter figure of the younger man."The evidence you asked for in that Mallin mutiny case," said Turcas,indicating the only remaining paper."Yes, I want to go into that--it's a question of policy," saidWesterling.He had taken up the paper thoughtfully after Turcas withdrew, when helooked up to Marta in answer to a movement in her chair. She had bentforward in a pose that freed her figure from the chair-back in anoutline of suppleness and firmness; her lips were parted, showing afaint line of the white of her teeth, and he caught her gazing at him ina kind of wondering admiration. But she dropped her eyelids instantlyand said deliberately, less to him than to herself:"You have the gift!"No tea-table flattery that, he knew; only the reflection of a fact whoseexistence had been borne in on her by observation."The gift? How?" he inquired, speaking to the fringe of hair that halfhid her lowered face.She looked up, smiling brightly."You don't know what gift! Not the pianist's! Not the poet's!" (Oh, tosave Hugo! The method she had chosen to save him, alien to all herimpulses, born of the war's stress on her mind, seemed the wise one inview of her knowledge of the man before her) "Why, of course, thesupreme gift of command! The thing that made you chief of staff! And thewar goes well for you, doesn't it?"Delicious morsel, this, to a connoisseur in compliments! He tasted itwith the same self-satisfied smile that he had her first prophecy. Toher who had then voiced a secret he had shared with no one, as his chestswelled with a full breath, he bared another in the delight of theimpression he had made on her."Yes, as you foresaw--as I planned!" he said. "Yes, I planned all, stepby step, till I was chief of staff and ready. I convinced the premierthat it was time to strike and I chose the hour to strike; for Bodlapoowas only a convenient excuse for the last of all the steps"The subjective enjoyment of the declaration kept him from any keennotice of the effect of his words. Lanny was right. It had been a war ofdeliberate conquest; a war to gratify personal ambition. All her lifeMarta would be able to live over again the feelings of this moment. Itwas as if she were frozen, all except brain and nerves, which were onfire, while the rigidity of ice kept her from springing from her chairin contempt and horror. She would always wonder how the bonds of herpurpose to save Hugo held her tongue But still another purpose came onthe wings of diabolical temptation which would pit the art of womanagainst the power of a man who set millions against millions inslaughter to gratify personal ambition. She was thankful that she waslooking down as she spoke, for she could not bring herself to anothercompliment. Her throat was too chilled for that yet."The one way to end the feud between the two nations was a war thatwould mean permanent peace," he explained, seeing how quiet she was andrealizing, with a recollection of her children's oath, that he had gonea little too far. He wanted to retain her admiration. It had become asprecious to him as a new delicacy to Lucullus."Yes, I understand," she managed to murmur; then she was able to lookup. "It's all so immense!" she added. "And you have yet another paperthere?" she said with a little gesture that might have been taken as theexpression of a hope that she was not overstaying her welcome."This is very interesting," he said, watching her narrowly now, "thecase of a private, one Hugo Mallin, who refused to fight because he wasagainst war on principle. Four charges: assault on a fellow soldier,cowardice, treason, and insubordination under fire.""Enough, I should say!" said Marta in a low tone."A question of which one to press--of an example," continued Westerling,reading the full official statement for the first time."What is the punishment?" she asked."Why, of course, death!" he replied, somewhat absently, inpreoccupation. "Extraordinary! And they have located him, it seems He ishere at headquarters!""Yes; certainly," Marta said. "We found him under a tree, deserted andwounded, labelled coward, and we cared for him.""Indeed!" exclaimed Westerling. "He must have appealed strongly to yoursympathies."There was no sharpness in the words, but he had lapsed from the personalto the official manner."To my sense of humanity!" Her reply was made in much the same tone ashis remark, where he had expected emotion, even passion. More than everwas he certain that she had undergone some revealing experience since hehad seen her in the capital. "Yes, to any one's sense of humanity--awounded, thirsty man in a fever!" There came, with a swift and mellowingcharm, the look of a fervent and exalted tenderness and thepulse-arresting quiver of intensity that had swept over her at her firstsight of Hugo under the tree. "I know that he was not a coward in onesense," she added, "for I saw him make the assault named in the firstcharge."She proceeded with the story of what she had witnessed in thedining-room. There was no appeal on Hugo's account. Appraising thequalities of the Marta of the moment in contrast with the Marta ofseventeen and the Marta of three weeks ago, Westerling was significantlyconscious of her attitude of impartiality, free of any attempt atfeminine influence, and of her evident desire to help him with the factsthat she knew."The charge of assault is only incidental," said Westerling. "But Mallinwas in the right about his comrades entering the house; right about thedestruction of property. It is our business to protect property, notonly as a principle but as a matter of policy. We do not desire to makethe population of the country we occupy unnecessarily hostile.""I judged that from your kindness in repairing the damage done to ours,"she assured him, and added happily: "Though I don't suppose that you goso far in most cases as to set uprooted plants back in their beds.""No; that is a refinement, perhaps," he answered, laughing. She was notonly more agreeable but also more sane than at the hotel. He liked theidea of continuing to despatch his work while retaining her company. "Imust have a talk with Mallin," he said. "I must settle his case so thatif similar cases arise subordinates will know what to do withoutconsulting me. Would you mind if I sent for him?" He reached for thebell to call an orderly."Yes, I should like to hear what he says to you and what you say tohim," she confessed with unfeigned interest, which brought a suggestionthat he was to be put on trial before her at the same time as Mallin wason trial before Westerling. His fingers paused on the bell head withoutpressure. "I told him that you were a just man," she remarked, "that anyone would be certain of justice from you."He rang the bell; and after he had sent for Mallin, warming under thecompliment of her last remark, he dared a reconnaissance along the lineof inquiry which he had wanted to undertake from the first."Mallin's ideas about war seem to be a great deal like your own," hehinted casually."As I expressed them at the hotel, you mean!" she exclaimed. "That seemsages ago--ages!" The perplexity and indecision that, in a space ofsilence, brooded in the depths of her eyes came to the surface inwavering lights. "Yes, ages! ages!" The wavering lights grew dim with akind of horror and she looked away fixedly at a given point.He was conscious of a thrill; the thrill that always presaged victoryfor him. He realized her evident distress; he guessed that terriblepictures were moving before her vision, and he changed the subject."I know how revolting it must have been to have seen those soldierswantonly smashing your chandelier and gloating over their mischief," hesaid. "Really, the Captain was to blame for letting his men get out ofhand. He seems not to have been a competent man. We can train and trainan officer, but when war comes--well, no amount of training will supplya certain quality that must be inborn--the quality of command.""Such as Dellarme had!" she exclaimed absently, under her breath.She had forgotten her part and Westerling's presence. The given point ofher gaze was exactly where Dellarme lay when he died. She wasunconsciously smiling in the way that he had smiled. But to Westerlingit seemed that she was smiling at space. He was puzzled; his perceptionpiqued."Who was Dellarme?" he was bound to ask."The officer in command of the company of infantry posted behind thesand-bags in the yard--he was killed!" she answered, turning her facetoward Westerling without the smile, singularly expressionless."Yes, he must have had the quality from the defence he made," agreedWesterling, in the hearty tribute of a taxable soldier to a capablesoldier. So very well had that one small position been held that everydetail was graven on the mind of a chief of staff who was supposed toleave details to his brigade commanders. It was he himself who hadordered the final charge after the brigade commander had adviseddelaying another attack until the redoubt could be hammered to piecesby heavy guns brought up from the rear. "But he had to go!" Westerlingexclaimed doggedly; for he could not resist this tribute, in turn, tohis own success in making an example for timid brigade commanders in thefuture by driving in more reserves until the enemy yielded."Yes!" she agreed without any change in the set face and moody eyes."You saw something of the defence?""Yes!" Marta replied in a way that aroused his imagination.This, he recalled, had always been her gift. The slow-drawn monosyllablewas pregnant with revelations which his knowing mind could readilysupply. She had been in the midst of the fury of the most tenaciousfighting within a small space that the war had yet to chronicle. She hadbeen an intimate of the splendid desperation of the Browns; known theirthoughts and feelings. What a multitude of impressions were stored inher sensitive mind, impressions which, for the moment, seemed to benumbher! How she could make them speak from her eyes and quiver from hervery finger-tips when she chose! He would yet hear her vivid account ofall that she had seen. It would be informatory--a reflection of thespirit of the Browns. Her quietness itself was compelling in its latentstrength, and strength was the thing he most admired. More and morequestions winged themselves into his thoughts, while his next one servedthe purpose of passing the time until Hugo came."There was a man out of uniform, in a gardener's garb, in charge of theautomatic," he remarked. "It was so puzzling that I heard of it. Yousee, there is no limit to what a chief of staff may know.""Yes, our gardener," she replied."Your gardener! Why, how was that? Wasn't he in the reserves if he werea Brown? Wasn't he called to the colors at the outbreak of the war?"In spite of himself the questions were somewhat sharp. They seemed totake Marta by surprise, which, however, was evanescent."I wonder!" she said, as interested as Westerling in the suggestion."Something a soldier would think of immediately and a woman wouldn't. Iknow that we lost our gardener."That was all. She did not attempt any further explanation or enlarge onthe subject, but let it go as an inquiry unexplained in the course ofconversation.Had Westerling been inclined to pursue it further he would have beeninterrupted by the arrival of a figure with a bandaged leg and headwhich came hobbling cheerfully around the corner of the house oncrutches, escorted by an infantryman. The guard saluted and withdrewinto the background. Hugo saluted and removed his cap and looked atWesterling with the faintest turn of a smile on his lips, which plainlyspoke his quizzical appreciation of the fact that he was in the presenceof dazzling heights for a private.Marta had a single glance from him--a glance of peculiar inquiry andastonishment, sweeping over the tea things fairly into her eyes. Then itwas gone. He might have been the most dutiful and respectful soldier ofthe five millions as he waited on the head of the five millions tospeak.Westerling read the four charges. Then he asked the stereotypedquestion:"What have you to say to them?"When he looked up from the paper he saw a face that was a mask, agentle, pleasant mask, and blue eyes looking quite steadily into his ownwith a sort of well-established and dreamy fatalism."Nothing, sir," said Hugo respectfully.Westerling frowned. Though a confession of guilt simplified everything,perhaps he frowned to find no embarrassment in his presence in theprivate; perhaps he apprehended impertinence in the soft blue eyes."You know what that means--the charges sustained?""Yes, sir!""And you have nothing to say?" Westerling's frown deepened. There was anundercurrent of urgency in his tone. This mild culprit, waiting for thewheels of justice to roll over him without a protest, gave him no lightas to a policy that should apply to other cases. He resented, too, anysuggestion of readiness for martyrdom No man of power who is anything ofa politician and not a fool likes to make martyrs. "Nothing?" herepeated. "Nothing at all in your own behalf?"A faint expression appeared on the mask. So insistently could Hugo'smask hold attention that Westerling noted even a slight, thoughtfuldrawing down of the brow and one corner of the mouth. He could notconceive that the laws of gravity could be upset or that a private wouldundertake to have fun at the expense of a chief of staff."Nothing, sir, unless I should make a long speech," he said. "Do youwant me to do that, sir?"Westerling held his irritation in control and looked around at Marta. Hesaw only wonder in her eyes as she intently regarded Hugo, which was hisown feeling, he suddenly realized."I have hardly time to listen to long speeches," he remarked."I thought not, sir," replied Hugo, unmoved. "That is why I said I hadnothing to say. And in want of a long speech the best that I could do toexplain would be to ask you to read certain books."An explosion of his breath in astonishment saved Westerling from harshexpletives. For one thing, he was piqued. Though he would not admit iteven to himself, he had, perhaps, fancied the idea of playing the gentleand patient dispenser of justice before Marta A private on trial for thegreatest of military crimes seraphically advising a chief of staff toread books! There were not enough words in the dictionary to rebuke theinsubordination of such conceit! The only way to look at the thing wasas a kind of grim jest. He retrieved his vexation with a laugh as heturned to Marta.She was smiling irresistibly, in concert with his own mood, as shecontinued to regard Hugo. Hugo's mask was entirely for Westerling. Hedid not seem to see Marta now, and through his mask radiated theconsiderate understanding of one who can put himself in another'splace--which was Hugo's besetting fault or virtue, as you choose. Inshort, the chief of staff had a feeling that this private knew exactlywhat he, the chief of staff, was thinking."Yes, I was certain, sir," said Hugo, "that you were too busy either tolisten to speeches or to read books. You have months of hard work beforeyou, sir."His respectful "sirs" had the deference of youth to an elder; otherwise,he was an equal in conversation with an equal. Westerling still kept histemper, but the way that his under jaw closed indicated that he had madeup his mind."One charge is enough," he said in a businesslike fashion. "On thefiring-line you threw down your rifle. You refused to fight any more.You said: 'Damn patriotism! I'm through!' Is that so?"A slight flush shot into Hugo's cheeks; he twisted his shoulder on hiscrutch as if he had a twinge of pain, but his face did not change itsexpression."No, sir. I did not say: 'Damn patriotism!' I'm afraid Captain Fracassewas out of temper when he reported that. I didn't say, 'Damnpatriotism!' because I did not think that then and do not now. Would youcare to have my recollection of what I said?""Yes!" breathed Marta with so intent an emphasis that Westerling turnedsharply, only to find her smiling at him. Her smile said that shethought that Hugo's story would be interesting."Yes; go ahead!" said Westerling."I think that I can recall my words very accurately, sir," Hugoproceeded. "They were important to me. I was the individual mostaffected in the matter. I said: 'I am through. I will not murder myfellowmen who have done me no wrong. I cannot, I will not kill!'""That is all?" queried Westerling, again looking at Marta, this timecovertly, while he played with a teaspoon.Brooding uncertainty had flooded the sparkle out of her eyes. She wasstatue-like in her stillness, her breaths impalpable in their softness.But the points of her knuckles were ghostly, sharp spots on her tightlyclenched hands. All that Westerling could tell was that she wasthinking, and thinking hard. There was a space of silence broken only bythe movement of the teaspoon. Hugo was the first to speak."I believe in patriotism, sir. That means love of country. I love mycountry," he said slowly.A preachment of patriotism from this nonchalant private was a straw toomuch for Westerling's patience. He made a nervous gesture--a distinctlynervous one as he dropped the teaspoon. He would have an end ofnonsense."You will answer questions!" he said. "First, you dropped your rifle?""Yes, sir.""You refused to fight?""Yes, sir.""You know the penalty for this?"Hugo inclined his head. He was silent."Shot for treason--and immediately!" Westerling went on, irritated atthe man's complaisance. Then he bit his lip. This was harsh talk beforeMarta. He expected to hear her utter some sort of protest against suchcruelty, and instead saw that her face remained calm and that there wasnothing but wonder in her eyes. She knew how to wait."Then, sir," said Hugo, speaking, evidently, because he was expected tosay something, "I suppose, of course, that I shall be shot. But"--he wassmiling in the way that he would when he brought a "good one" to thehead in the barracks--"but it will not be necessary to do it more thanonce, will it? To tell you the truth, I had not counted on being shotmore than once."Westerling was like a man who had lunged a blow at an object and struckonly air."I said that he was not a coward," Marta remarked quietly. There wasnothing in her manner to imply that she was defending Hugo. She seemedto be incidentally justifying a previous observation of her own.A smile in face of death! Westerling's prayer was for countless massesof infantry who would smile in face of death and do his bidding. Hecould not resist a soldier's admiration, which, however, he would notpermit to take the form of words. The form which it took was a sharpthrust of his fist into the hollow of his hand. He had, too, a sense ofdefeat which was uppermost as he spoke--a defeat that he was bound toretrieve."You have a home, a father, and a mother?" he asked."Yes, sir.""And perhaps a sweetheart?" Westerling proceeded.Hugo unmistakably flushed."I don't think sir, that official statistics require an answer to thatquestion. I"--and again that confounded smile, as Westerling wasbeginning to regard it--"I trust, sir, that I shall not have to be shotmore than once if we do not bring any one not yet officially of myfamily into the affair.""You do not seem to like life," Westerling observed."I love life!" answered Hugo earnestly. "I try to get something out ofevery minute of it; if nothing particular, at least the miracle ofliving and breathing and thinking and seeing--seeing such beautifulscenes as this." He looked away toward the glorious landscape. It wasthe first time that he had lifted the steady gaze of those studious blueeyes from Westerling, but directly they were back on duty. "It isbecause I love life," he continued, "and think that everybody else mustlove life, that I do not want to kill. Because I love my country I knowthat others love their country, and I want them to keep their country."Marta's glance had followed Hugo's into the distance. It still restedthere intently. To Westerling she showed only a profile, with the shadowof the porch between them and the golden light of receding day in thebackground: a golden light on a silhouette of ivory, a silhouette thatyou might find without meaning or so full of meaning as to hold anobserver in a quandary as to what she was thinking or whether or not shewas thinking at all.Westerling had the baffled consciousness of fencing with a culprit atthe bar who had turned adversary. It was the visionary's white logic ofthe blue dome against the soldier's material logic of _x_ equals initialvelocity. Here was an incomprehensible mortal who loved life and yet wasready to die for love of life. Here was love of country that refused toserve country.All a pose, a clever bit of acting to play on his feelings through thepresence of a woman, Westerling concluded. And Marta was still lookingat the landscape. Her mind seemed withdrawn from the veranda. Only herbody remained. All the impulse of Westerling's military instinct andtraining, rebelling at an abstract ethical controversy with a privateabout book heresies that belonged under the censor's ban, called for theword of authority from the apex of the pyramid to put an end to talkwith an atom at the base. But that profile--that serene ivory in thegolden light, so unlike the Marta of the hotel reception-room--wascompellingly present though her mind were absent. It suggested loss oftemper as the supreme weakness. He had permitted a controversy. He mustargue his man down; he must find his adversary's weak point."Your province is one of the most patriotic," he said. "Its people areof the purest blood of our race. They have always been loyal. They havealways fought determinedly. To no people would a traitor be soabhorrent. Do you want the distinction of being a traitor--one lonetraitor in your loyal province?"Hugo was visibly affected. The twisted corner of his mouth quivered."I had thought of that, too, sir," he said."Suppose your father and mother knew that your comrades had labelled youa coward before the whole army; that they had thought you worthy only ofkicks and to be left to die by the roadside. Suppose that your fatherand mother knew that the story of Hugo Mallin, coward and traitor, whothrew down his rifle under fire is being told throughout the land--as Ishall have it told--until your name is a symbol for cowardice andtreason. How would your father and mother feel?"There was an unsteady movement of Hugo's body on his crutches. Heswallowed hard, moistening dry lips; and the mobility of feature thatcould change the mask into the illumination of varied emotions spokehorror and asked for pity."I--I--as a matter of mercy, when I have admitted the charge, I ask younot to bear on that, sir!" he stammered. Then the crutches creaked witha stronger grip of his hands and a stiffening of his body as he masteredhis feelings. The mask recovered its own, even to the drawing down ofthe corner of the mouth. "I have reasoned that all out, sir," he wenton. "It was the thing which kept me from throwing down my rifle beforewe made our first charge. I have written a letter to my father andmother."Marta had been so engrossed in the landscape that she seemed not to havebeen listening. It was her voice, come out of the distance, that asked,without any inflection except that of tense curiosity:"May we see the letter?"As she turned her eyes looked directly into Hugo's, their gaze locked,as it were: hers that of a simple request, his that of puzzled,unsatisfied scrutiny."May we?" she repeated to Westerling, looking now frankly at him,"though I don't know as it is in keeping with the situation or with yourwishes to grant the whim of a woman. But you see," she added smiling,"that is what comes of having a woman present."If she had any double meaning Westerling could not find it in her eyes."I am willing," said Hugo. "Indeed, I shall be very glad to have my sideheard.""Yes, let us see the letter," assented Westerling; for he, too, wascurious.When Hugo had given it to Westerling and he saw that it was not verylong, he began reading aloud:"'I've kept very well and cheerful and I'm cheerful now,'" the letterbegan. "'Please always think of me as cheerful. Everybody in our companyhas fought well; just as bravely as our forefathers did in the wars oftheir day.'""Which hardly agrees with your ideas," observed Westerling."Exactly, sir. Men should be brave for their convictions," answeredHugo. "And, as you said, the men of our province are loyal to the oldideas. They believe they ought to fight the Browns."Then followed a brief, intimate, appealing story of how each of his deadcomrades had fallen."'You can read these to their folks at home, if you want to. They mightlike to know.'"Irresistibly there crept into Westerling's face at these recitals ofsoldierly courage the satisfaction of the commander with the spirit ofhis men. Here was proof of the valor of the units of his army."'Now I have something to tell you which will hurt you very much,'"Westerling read on, "'but you must recollect that I was always regardedas a little queer. And I don't think people will hold you to blame on myaccount. I hope they will sympathize with you for having such a son. Youwill have heard the story from the men of the company, but I also wantto tell it to you....'"After it was told the letter proceeded:"'I feel that I was a coward up to the moment that everybody else wascalling me a coward. Then I felt free and happy, as if I had been trueto myself. I felt that I had been just as much in the wrong as if weshould break into our neighbor's house and take his property because wewere stronger than he. How would you feel if a neighbor entered yourhouse and made it his own? You would call in the police. But what ifthere were no police? Would that make it right?'"Marta's own opinions! The spirit of her children's prayer! Head bent,hands clasped, she was simply listening."'Would it be cowardice if one of the neighbor's family said, "I willnot take any further part in this robbery!" when he saw you, mother,weeping over you, father, as you lay dead after trying to defend yourhouse? When I was asked to fire at those running men it was likestanding on a neighbor's door-step and firing down the street at myneighbors in flight. I could not do it. I could not do it though twentymillion men were doing the same thing. No, I could not do it any morethan you could commit murder, father. That is all. Perhaps when thosewho survive from my company come home, after they have been beaten asthey will be--'""What!" Westerling exploded.All the force of his being had to take umbrage at this. Beaten! Martasaw the rigid, unyielding Westerling who had cried, "We shall win!" whenshe made her second prophecy. But the comparison did not occur to him.Nothing occurred to him but red anger, until the first dart of reasonwarned him, a chief of staff, that a private had made him completelylose his temper. He recovered his poise with a laugh and without evenglancing at Marta."Well, we might as well hear the reasons for your expert opinion," hesaid, his satire a trifle hoarse after the strain of his emotion."Because the Browns fight for their homes!" answered Hugo "When thegreat crisis comes they have a reserve strength that we have not:conscience, the intelligent conscience of this age that cannot foolitself with false enthusiasm continually. They are fighting as I shouldpray that I might fight if the Browns invaded our country; as I mightfight against a murderous burglar. For I will fight, sir, I will fightwith my face to the white posts, but not with my back to them! TheBrowns have no more right to cross our frontier than we have to crosstheirs!"There was a perceptible shudder on Marta's part, an abrupt, tossingelevation of her head. She stared at the spot where Dellarme had lain inthe garden. Dellarme's smile was back on her lips; it seemed graventhere. Her eyes, which Westerling could not see, were leaping flames."I'm afraid you will not have the chance," Westerling observed, as hereturned the letter to Hugo, its reading unfinished. "What if every manheld your views? What would become of the army and the nation?" hedemanded."Why, I think I have made that plain," replied Hugo. He appeared no lessweary than Westerling over continual beating of the air to no purpose."We should retreat to our own soil, where we belong.""And you are ready to be shot for that principle?"The question was sharp and final."Yes, if being shot for what I did is dying for it--though I prefer tolive for it!" said Hugo, still without any pose. He refused to play fora chapter in the future book of martyrs to peace. This was theirritating thing about him to a soldier, who deprecated all kinds ofpersonal bravado and show as against the efficiency of the modernmilitary machine, when men were supposed to respond to duty in the faceof death as automatically as in any business requiring team-work, withan every-day smile like Hugo's on their lips."Then," Westerling began, and broke off abruptly. His eyes sought Marta.The affair seemed to have worn on her nerves also. There was adistinctly appreciable effort at self-control in the slow way that sheturned her head. The flame in her eyes was suddenly suffused in a liquidglance which slowly brightened with a suggestion."It is extraordinary!" she breathed. "Don't you think that the blow onhis head and the fever afterward has something to do with it?"Hugo answered for himself."My views are the same as they were before the blow and the act thatbrought the blow!" he said, with a slight cast of the eye toward Martawhich intimated that he wanted no help from the deserter of theprinciples which she had professed to him previously.She shuddered as if hurt, but only momentarily."Psychological, I suppose--psychological and irresponsible abnormality!"she murmured, avoiding Hugo's look and bending her own on Westerlingpersistently."Long words!" said Hugo. "Insanity is shorter."But Westerling did not seem to hear. His thought was shaped by thesuperb misery and sensitiveness in Marta's face. He had done wrong toask her to remain. Of course the scene had been painful to her. Shewould not be herself if she wanted to see a man tried for his life. Heknew that views not unlike Hugo's were latent in many minds lackingHugo's initiative that would respond to the right impulse. A way outoccurred to him as inspiration, which pleased his sense of craft. Thepress, which the premier reported was irritated by his censorship--thepress which must have sensation, the traffic of its trade--should have adetailed account of how one of our indomitable regiments placarded aprivate as coward, proving thereby that the army was a unit ofaggressive zeal."You are alone--one man in a million in your ideas!" he declared, withjudicial gravity. "We shall postpone your trial and leave public opinionto punish you. Your story will be given to the press in full; your namewill be a byword throughout the land, an example, and while you areconvalescing you will remain a prisoner. When you are well we shall haveanother talk I may give you a chance, for the sake of your father andmother and your sweetheart and the good opinion of your neighbors, toredeem yourself.""I had to tell you what I felt, sir," said Hugo. "Thank you for lettingme live, after you knew."He saluted and turned away. Marta and Westerling watched him as hehobbled around the corner of the house and in a heavy silence listenedto the crunch of his crutch tips on the gravel growing fainter. Herlashes, those convenient curtains for hiding thought, dropped asWesterling looked around; but he saw that her lips had reddened and thatshe was drawing a long, deep, energizing breath. When the lashes lifted,there was still wonder in her eyes--wonder which had become definitetribute to him. The assurance he wanted was that he had borne himselfwell, and he had it."You kept your patience beautifully," she told him. "It seems to me thatyou were both kind and wise.""How I was to be merciful against the facts puzzled me," he replied,"until you saved the day with your suggestion of psychologicalirresponsibility.""Then I helped? I really helped?""You did, decidedly! You--" There he broke off, for he found himselfspeaking to her profile.She had looked away in a sudden flight of abstraction, very far away,where the lowering sun was stretching the shadows of the foot-hillstoward the white posts. Capes and pillars and promontories of shadowthere in the distance! Swinging, furry finger-points of shadow from thetall hollyhocks in the garden swaying with the breeze! The dark shade ofthe house's mass over the yard!It was time for him to be at his desk. But she seemed far from anysuggestion of going. She seemed to expect him to wait; otherwise hemight have concluded that she had forgotten his presence. Yet were he torustle a paper he knew that she would hear it. Though she did not changeher position in the chair, she appeared subtly active in every fibre.He found waiting easy, free as he was to watch the beauty of her profilein the glory of the sunset. The superb thing about her was that shealways called for study. Her lips moved in sensitive turns; her breastrose in soft billows with her breaths; the long, flickering eyelashesran outward from black to bronze and to feather tips of gold. In timemeasured by the regular standard of clock ticks, which in the brain mayeither race madly or drag mercilessly, she was not long silent. When shespoke she' did not look entirely around at first; he had no glimpse intoher eyes."It was another experience of war," she said moodily, returning to thesubject of Hugo. "Yes, something like the final chapter of experience,the trial of this dreamer." Then a wave of restless impatience with herabstraction swept over her. Speaking of dreamers, she herself would stopdreaming. "For experience does make a great difference, doesn't it?" sheexclaimed with a sad, knowing smile. After a perceptible pause her eyessuddenly glowed into his. All the commotion of her thought wasgalvanized into purpose in the look. "I have had a heart full and a mindfull of experiences!" she said. "I have been close to war--closer thanyou! I have looked on while others fought!"The thing was coming! He should hear the story of the change that warhad wrought in her. She appeared to regard him as the one listener whomshe had sought; as a confidant who alone could understand her. His giftfor listening was in full play as he relaxed and settled back in hischair, shading his eyes with his hand lest he should seem to stare. Forin his eagerness he would not miss any one of her varied signals ofemotion.She was as vivid as he knew that she would be, her narration flashes ofimpression in clear detail. Her being seemed transparent to its depthsand her moods through the last week to run past him in review. Hemarvelled at times at her military knowledge; again at her impartiality.She was neither for the Browns nor the Grays; she was simply tellingwhat she had seen. She passed by some horrors; on others she dwelt withfearless emphasis."Then the hand-grenades were thrown!" She put her hands over her eyes."As they fell"--she put her hands over her ears--"oh, the groans!""It was the Browns who started it!" he interjected in defence. "I hadhoped that we should escape that kind of warfare." He was too intent torecall what he had said to the premier about using every known method ofdestruction."And this is only the beginning, isn't it?" she asked piteously,exhausted with her story."Only the beginning!" he agreed.Again brooding wonder appeared in her eyes, while there was wonder inhis eyes--wonder at her."And you remain with your property!" he exclaimed in a burst ofadmiration.Once more she was looking away into the distance; once more he wasstudying her profile. He knew that she had gone through her experiencewithout tears and without a scream. She had been subjected to his finaltest of all merit--war. Courage she had, feminine courage. And he hadoften asked himself what would happen if he, a great man, should evermeet a great woman. He was baffled by the resources of a mind that washeld in detachment under her charm; baffled as to what she was thinkingat that moment, only to find her smiling at him, the wonder in her eyesresolving itself into purpose."You see, I have been very much stirred up," she said halfapologetically. "There are some questions I want to ask--quitepractical, selfish questions. You might call them questions of propertyand mercy. The longer the war lasts the greater will be the loss of lifeand the misery?""Yes, for both sides; and the heavier the expense and the taxes.""If you win, then we shall be under your flag and pay taxes to you?""Yes, naturally.""The Browns do not increase in population; the Grays do rapidly. Theyare a great, powerful, civilized race. They stand for civilization!""Yes, facts and the world's opinion agree," he replied. Puzzled he mightwell be by this peculiar catechism. He could only continue to replyuntil he should see where she was leading."And your victory will mean a new frontier, a new order of internationalrelations and a long peace, you think? Peace--a long peace!"Was there ever a soldier who did not fight for peace? Was there ever acall for more army-corps or guns that was not made in the name of peace?He had his ready argument, spoken with the forcible conviction of anexpert."This war was made for peace--the only kind of peace that there can be,"he said. "My ambition, if any glory comes to me out of this war, is tohave later generations say: 'He brought peace!'"Though the premier, could he have heard this, might have smiled, evengrinned, he would have understood Westerling's unconsciousness ofinconsistency. The chief of staff had set himself a task in victorywhich had no military connection. Without knowing why, he wanted to winascendancy over her mind."The man of action!" exclaimed Marta, her eyes opening very wide, asthey would to let in the light when she heard something new that pleasedher or gave food for thought. "The man of action, who thinks of an idealas a thing not of words but as the end of action!""Exactly!" said Westerling, sensible of another of her gifts. She couldget the essence of a thing in a few words. "When we have won and setanother frontier, the power of our nation will be such in the world thatthe Browns can never afford to attack us," he went on. "Indeed, no twoof the big nations of Europe can afford to make war without our consent.We shall be the arbiters of international dissensions. We shall commandpeace--yes, the peace of force, of fact! If it could be won in any otherway I should not be here on this veranda in command of an army ofinvasion. That was my idea--for that I planned." He was making up forhaving overshot himself in his confession that he had brought on the waras a final step for his ambition."You mean that you can gain peace by propaganda and education only whenhuman nature has so changed that we can have law and order and housesare safe from burglary and pedestrians from pickpockets withoutpolicemen? Is that it?" she asked."Yes, yes! You have it! You have found the wheat in the chaff.""Perhaps because I have been seeing something of human nature--the humannature of both the Browns and the Grays at war. I have seen the Brownsthrowing hand-grenades and the Grays in wanton disorder in ourdining-room directly they were out of touch with their officers!" shesaid sadly, as one who hates to accept disillusionment but must in theface of logic.Westerling made no reply except to nod, for a movement on her partpreoccupied him. She leaned forward, as she had when she had told him hewould become chief of staff, her hands clasped over her knee, her eyesburning with a question. It was the attitude of the prophecy. But withthe prophecy she had been a little mystical; the fire in her eyes hadprecipitated an idea. Now it forged another question."And you think that you will win?" she asked. "You think that you willwin?" she repeated with the slow emphasis which demands a carefulanswer.The deliberateness of his reply was in keeping with her mood. He wasdetached; he was a referee."Yes, I know that we shall. Numbers make it so, though there be nochoice of skill between the two sides."His tone had the confidence of the flow of a mighty river in itsdestination on its way to the sea. There was nothing in it of prayer, ofhope, of desperation, as there had been in Lanstron's "We shall win!"spoken to her in the arbor at their last interview. She drew forwardslightly in her chair. Her eyes seemed much larger and nearer to him.They were sweeping him up and down as if she were seeing the slim figureof Lanstron in contrast to Westerling's sturdiness; as if she weremeasuring the might of the five millions behind him and the threemillions behind Lanstron. She let go a half-whispered "Yes!" whichseemed to reflect the conclusion gained from the power of his presence."Then my mother's and my own interests are with you--the interests ofpeace are with you!" she declared.She did not appear to see the sudden, uncontrolled gleam of victory inhis eyes; for now she was looking fixedly at the point where Hugo hadstood. By this time it had become a habit for Westerling to waitsilently for her to come out of her abstractions. To disturb one mightmake it unproductive."Then if I want to help the cause of peace I should help the Grays!"The exclamation was more to herself than to him. He was silent. Thisgirl in a veranda chair desiring to aid him and his five millionbayonets and four thousand guns! Quixote and the windmills--but it wasamazing; it was fine! The golden glow of the sunset was running in hisveins in a paean of personal triumph. The profile turned ever so little.Now it was looking at the point where Dellarme had lain dying.Westerling noted the smile playing on the lips. It had the quality of asmile over a task completed--Dellarme's smile. She started; she wastrembling all over in the resistance of some impulse--some impulse thatgradually gained headway and at last broke its bonds."For I can help--I can help!" she cried out, turning to him in wildindecision which seemed to plead for guidance. "It's so terrible--yet ifit would hasten peace--I--I know much of the Browns' plan of defence! Iknow where they are strong in the first line and--and one place wherethey are weak there--and a place where they are weak in the main line!""You do!" Westerling exploded. The plans of the enemy! The plans thatneither Bouchard's saturnine cunning, nor bribes, nor spies couldascertain! It was like the bugle-call to the hunter. But he controlledhimself. "Yes, yes!" He was thoughtful and guarded."Do you think it is right to tell?" Marta gasped half inarticulately."Right? Yes, to hasten the inevitable--to save lives!" declaredWesterling with deliberate assurance."I--I want to see an end of the killing! I--" She sprang to her feet asif about to break away tumultuously, but paused, swaying unsteadily, andpassed her hand across her eyes."We intend a general attack on the first line of defence to-night!" heexclaimed, his supreme thought leaping into words."And you would want the information about the first line to-night if--ifit is to be of service?""Yes, to-night!"Marta brought her hands together in a tight clasp. Her gaze flutteredfor a minute over the tea-table. When she looked up her eyes were calm."It is a big thing, isn't it?" she said. "A thing not to be done in animpulse. I try never to do big things in an impulse. When I see that Iam in danger of it I always say: 'Go by yourself and think for half anhour!' So I must now. In a little while I will let you know mydecision."Without further formality she started across the lawn to the terracesteps. Westerling watched her sharply, passing along the path of thesecond terrace, pacing slowly, head bent, until she was out of sight.Then he stood for a time getting a grip on his own emotions before hewent into the house.XXXIIIIN FELLER'S PLACEWhat am I? What have I done? What am I about to do? shot as forkedshadows over the hot lava-flow of Malta's impulse. The vitality thatWesterling had felt by suggestion from a still profile rejoiced in aquickening of pace directly she was out of sight of the veranda. All thethinking she had done that afternoon had been in pictures; some saying,some cry, some groan, or some smile went with every picture.Coming to the arbor she slowed down for a step or two, arrested by therecollection of her last meeting with Lanstron. There it was that shehad scored him for making her an accomplice of trickery. She saw histwitching hand, and the misery in his eyes and the cadence of his wordscame as clearly as notes from a violin in a silent chamber to her ears.She nodded in affirmation; she shook her head in negation; she frowned;she laughed strangely, and hurried on.The sitting-room of the tower was empty to other eyes but not to hers.In imagination she saw Feller standing by the table in the dejection ofhis heart-break when he faced her and Lanstron, his secret disclosed;and the appeal was more potent in memory than it had been at the time.She went on into the bedroom, which had been formerly the tool-room. Onthe threshold of the steps into the darkness she glanced back, to seeFeller's face transfixed as it had been when he discovered the presenceof interlopers--transfixed in fighting rage.The lantern was in the corner at hand. Only yesterday, in want ofoccupation, as she thought, she had cleaned the chimney and trimmed thewick. It seemed as if Lanny's fingers were lighting it now; as if hewere leading the way as he had on her first visit to the telephone.After her hastening steps had carried her along the tunnel to thetelephone, she set down the lantern and pressed the spring that openedthe panel door. Another moment and she would be embarked on her greatadventure in the finality of action. That little ear-piece became aspectre of conscience. She drew back convulsively and her hands flew toher face; she was a rocking shadow in the thin, reddish light of thelantern.Conscious mind had torn off the mask from subconscious mind, revealingthe true nature of the change that war had wrought in her. She who hadresented Feller's part--what a part she had been playing! Every word,every shade of expression, every telling pause of abstraction afterWesterling confessed that he had made war for his own ends had beensubtly prompted by a purpose whose actuality terrified her.Her hypocrisy, she realized, was as black as the wall of darkness beyondthe lantern's gleam. All her pictures became a whirling involution ofextravaganza and all the speeches of the characters of the scenes a kindof wail. Then this demoralization passed, as a nightmare passes, withWesterling's boast again in her ears. She was seeing Hugo Mallin;hearing him announce his principles in sight of the spot where Dellarmehad died:"I love my country.... But I know that other men love theirs.... Menshould be brave for their convictions.... The Browns are fighting fortheir homes.... They are fighting, as I should want to fight, againstmurder and burglary.... I will fight with my face to the white posts,but not with my back to them."She was seeing the faces of her children; she was hearing them repeat:"But I shall not let a burglar drive me from my house. If an enemy triesto take my land I shall appeal to his sense of justice and reason withhim; but if he then persists I shall fight for my home."When war's principles, enacted by men, were based on sinister trickerycalled strategy and tactics, should not women, using such weapons asthey had, also fight for their homes? Marta's hands swept down from hereyes; she was on fire with resolution.Forty miles away a bell in Lanstron's bedroom and at his desk rangsimultaneously. At the time he and Partow were seated facing each otheracross a map on the table of the room where they worked together. Nopersuasion of the young vice-chief, no edict of the doctors, could makethe old chief take exercise or shorten his hours."I know. I know myself!" he said. "I know my duty. And you are learning,my boy, learning!"Every day the flabby cheeks grew pastier and the pouches under theeyebrows heavier. But there was no dimming of the eagle flashes of theeyes, no weakening of the will. Last night Lanstron had turned as whiteas chalk when Partow staggered on rising from the table, the veins onhis temples knotted blue whip-cords. Yet after a few hours' sleep hereappeared with firm step, fresh for the fray.The paraphernalia around these two was the same as that aroundWesterling. Only the atmosphere of the staff was different. It had aquality of sober and buoyant alertness and fatality of determinationrather than rigid confidence. Otherwise, there was the same medley oftypewriters and telegraph instruments, the same types of busy officersand clerks that occupied the Galland house. To them, at least, war hadbrought no surprises. Its routine was as they had anticipated it therein the big division headquarters building, dissociated from the actualexperience of the intimate emotions of the front. Each man wasperforming the part set for him. No man knew much of any other man'spart. Partow alone knew all, and Lanstron was trying to grasp all andpraying that Partow's old body should still feed his mind with energy.Lanstron was thinner and paler, a new and glittering intensity in hiseyes.A messenger had just brought in two despatches from the telegraph room.One was from the taciturn press bureau of the Grays which flashed intothe Browns' headquarters from a neutral country at the same time that itflashed around the world to illumine bulletin-boards in every languageof civilization. Day after day the Grays had announced the occupation offresh positions. This was the only news that they had permittedegress--the news which read like the march of victory to the eager worldof the press, hastening to quick conclusions. To-day came the officialword that Westerling had established his headquarters on conqueredterritory. Proof, this, that five could drive back three; that the weakcould not resist the strong!"Hm-m--indeed!" exclaimed Partow, lifting his brow into massive,corrugated wrinkles. "It may affect the stock market, but not theresult."The other despatch was also out of the land of the Grays, but not byWesterling's consent or knowledge. By devious ways it had broken throughthe censorship of the frontier in cunning cipher. It told of artilleryconcentrations three days old; it told only what the aeroplanes hadalready seen; it told what the Grays had done but nothing of what theyintended to do.When word of Feller's defection came, Lanstron realized for the firsttime by Partow's manner that the old chief of staff, with all hisdeprecation of the telephone scheme as chimerical, had grounded a hopeon it."There was the chance that we might know--so vital to the defence--whatthey were going to do before and not after the attack," he said.Yet the story of how Feller yielded to the temptation of the automatichad made the nostrils of the old war-horse quiver with a dramaticbreath, and instead of the command of a battery of guns, which Lanstronhad promised, the chief made it a battalion. He had drawn down his browswhen he heard that Marta had asked that the wire be left intact; he hadshot a shrewd, questioning glance at Lanstron and then beat a tattoo onthe table and half grinned as he grumbled under his breath:"She is afraid of being lonesome! No harm done!" A week had passed sincethe Grays had taken the Galland house, and still no word from Marta. Thering of the bell brought Lanstron to his feet with a startled, boyishbound."Very springy, that tendon of Achilles!" muttered Partow. "And, my boy,take care, take care!" he called suddenly in his sonorous voice, as vastand billowy as his body. "Take care! She might unwittingly repeatsomething you said--and hold on!" He was amazingly light and vigorous onhis feet as he rose and hurried after Lanstron with the quick, shortsteps of active adiposity. "She may have seen or heard something.Ask--ask what is the spirit of the staff, of the soldiers who havefought? What is the truth about their losses? What--" He broke off atthe door of Lanstron's bedroom. Lanstron had flung aside a bathrobe thatcovered a panel door in the closet and already had the receiver in hishand. "But you know what to ask!" concluded Partow. A flush ofembarrassment crept into the pasty cheeks and a sparkle into his fineold eyes as he withdrew to acquit himself of being an eavesdropper.It was Marta's voice and yet not Marta's, this voice that beat innervous waves over the wire."Lanny--yes, I, Lanny! You were right. Westerling planned to make wardeliberately to satisfy his ambition. He told me so. The first generalattack on the first line of defence is to-night. Westerling says so!"She had to pause for breath. "And, Lanny, I want to know some positionof the Browns which is weak--not actually weak, maybe, but some positionwhere the Grays expect terrible resistance and will not find it--whereyou will let them in!""In the name of--Marta! Marta, what--""I am going to fight for the Browns--for my home!"In the sheer satisfaction of explaining herself to herself, of voicingher sentiments, she sent the pictures which had wrought the changemoving across the screen before Lanstron's amazed vision. There was noroom for interruption on his part, no question or need of one. The wireseemed to quiver with the militant tension of her spirit. It was Martaaflame who was talking at the other end; not aflame for him, but with apurpose that revealed all the latent strength of her personality anddaring."Yes, the only way is to fight for your home," she concluded."Otherwise, the world would be to the bully and the heads of saints andphilosophers and teachers would be egg-shells under his bludgeon.""It seems," said Lanstron, "that this is almost like my own view."He was sorry before the words were fairly out of his mouth that he hadtaken that tack. It was asking her to back down abruptly from her oldprinciples, which only the weak proselyte will do readily; and she wasnot a proselyte at all, to her conception."No, no!" She etched her reply into his mind with acid, "My professionis peace; it is not war. I am caught with my back to the wall. If theBrowns lose, the Gray flag floats over my home. As Westerling says,everybody must take orders from the Grays then. Oh, the mockery of hisrepairing the damage done to our house and grounds! Let him repair thedamage done to fathers and mothers by bringing their sons sacrificed tothe ambition for conquest back to life! Oh, I got the whole of himreflected in the mirror of himself this afternoon when he wascomfortably taking tea, and in no danger, and sending men to death!"There Lanstron winced over a characterization that might apply to him.He could think of only one thing that would ever heal the wound. Perhapsthe chance for it would come some day."Yes," she went on, "sitting there so comfortably and serenely anddeciding that a man who was ready to die for his convictions must beshot for cowardice! My views are like Hugo Mallin's and my back isagainst the wall. But to the work, Lanny! I have a half-hour in which tomake up my mind"--she laughed curiously as she repeated the phrase--"inwhich to make up my mind." Briefly she recounted what about: "I want togive him positive information of a weak point that can be taken easily.""But, Marta--Marta--have you considered what a terrible risk--what--" heprotested, the chief of intelligence now submerged in the man."No more than for Feller. I sent Feller away and I am taking his place.How is he? Did he get his guns?""Yes, not a battery, but a battalion--a major's command--and the ironcross, too!""Splendid! Oh, I'd like to see him in uniform directing their fire! Howhappy he must be! But, are you going to do your part? Are you going togive me the information?""I shall have to ask Partow. It's a pretty big thing.""Yes--only that is not all my plan, my little plan. After they havetaken the first line of defence--and they will get it, won't they?""Yes, we shall yield in the end, yield rather than suffer too greatlosses there that will weaken the defence on the main line.""Then I want to know where it is that you want Westerling to attack onthe main line, so that we can get him to attack there. That--that willhelp, won't it?""Yes.""Of course, all the while I shall be getting news from him--when I haveproven my loyalty and have his complete confidence--and I'll telephoneit to you. I am sure I can get something worth while with you to directme; don't you think so, Lanny?"She put the question as simply as if she were asking if she might sew ona button for him. It had the charm of an intimate fellowship of purpose.It appeared free of the least realization of the magnitude of herundertaking. Didn't Mrs. Galland believe that blood would tell? Andhadn't the old premier, her grandfather, said: "You can afford to befussed about little things but never about big things"?"I'll hold the wire, Lanny. Ask Partow!" she concluded. Of the two shewas the steadier."Well?" said Partow, looking up at the sound of Lanstron's step. Then hehalf raised himself from his chair at sight of a Lanstron with eyes in adaze of brilliancy; a Lanstron with his maimed hand twitching in anoutstretched gesture; a Lanstron in the dilemma of being at the sametime lover and chief of intelligence. Should he let her make thesacrifice of everything that he held to be sacred to a woman's delicacy?Should he not return to the telephone and tell her that he would notpermit her to play such a part? Partow's voice cut in on hisdemoralization with the sharpness of a blade."Well, what, man, what?" he demanded. He feared that the girl might bedead. Anything that could upset Lanstron in this fashion struck a chordof sympathy and apprehension.Lanstron advanced to the table, pressed his hands on the edge, and, nowmaster of himself, began an account of Marta's offer. Partow's formlessarms lay inert on the table, his soft, pudgy fingers outspread on themap and his bulk settled deep in the chair, while his eagle eyes wereseeing through Lanstron, through a mountain range, into the eyes of awoman and a general on the veranda of an enemy's headquarters. The planmeant giving, giving in the hope of receiving much in return. Would heget the return?"A woman was the ideal one for the task we intrusted to Feller," hemused, "a gentlewoman, big enough, adroit enough, with her soul in thework as no paid woman's could be! There seemed no such one in theworld!""But to let her do it!" gasped Lanstron."It is her suggestion, not yours? She offers herself? She wants nopersuasion?" Partow asked sharply."Entirely her suggestion," said Lanstron. "She offers herself for hercountry--for the cause for which our soldiers will give their lives bythe thousands. It is a time of sacrifice."Partow raised his arms. They were not formless as he brought them downwith sledge-hammer force to the table."Your tendon of Achilles? My boy, she is your sword-arm!" His sturdyforefinger ran along the line of frontier under his eye with littlestaccato leaps. "Eh?" he chuckled significantly, finger poised."Let them up the Bordir road and on to redoubts 36 and 37, you mean?"asked Lanstron."You have it! The position looks important, but so well do we command itthat it is not really vital. Yes, the Bordir road is her bait forWesterling!" Partow waved his hand as if the affair were settled."But," interjected Lanstron, "we have also to decide on the point of themain defence which she is to make Westerling think is weak.""Hm-m!" grumbled Partow. "That is not necessary to start with. We cangive that to her later over the telephone, can't we, eh?""She asked for it now.""Why?" demanded Partow with one of his shrewd, piercing looks."She did not say, but I can guess," explained Lanstron. "She must putall her cards on the table; she must tell Westerling all she knows atonce. If she tells him piecemeal it might lead to the supposition thatshe still had some means of communication with the Browns.""Of course, of course!" Partow spatted the flat of his hand resoundinglyon the map. "As I decided the first time I met her, she has a head, andwhen a woman has a head for that sort of thing there is no beating her.Well--" he was looking straight into Lanstron's eyes, "well, I think weknow the point where we could draw them in on the main line, eh?""Up the apron of the approach from the Engadir valley. We yield theadvance redoubts on either side.""Meanwhile, we have massed heavily behind the redoubt. We retake theadvance redoubts in a counter-attack and--" Partow brought his fist intohis palm with a smack."Yes, if we could do that! If we could get them to expend their attackthere!" put in Lanstron very excitedly for him."We must! She shall help!" Partow was on his feet. He had reached acrossthe table and seized Lanstron's shoulders in a powerful if flesh-paddedgrip. Then he turned Lanstron around toward the door of his bedroom andgave him a mighty slap of affection. "My boy, the brightest hope ofvictory we have is holding the wire for you. Tell her that a bearded oldbehemoth, who can kneel as gracefully as a rheumatic rhinoceros, is onboth knees at her feet, kissing her hands and trying his best, in thename of mercy, to keep from breaking into verse of his own composition."Back at the telephone, Lanstron, in the fervor of the cheer and theenthusiasm that had transported his chief, gave Marta Partow's message."You, Marta, are our brightest hope of victory!""Yes?" The monosyllable was detached, dismal, labored. "A woman can bethat!" she exclaimed in an uncertain tone, which grew into thedistraction of clipped words and broken sentences. "A womanplay-acting--a woman acting the most revolting hypocrisy--influencesthe issue between two nations! Her deceit deals in the lives of sonsprecious to fathers and mothers, the fate of frontiers, of institutions!Think of it! Think of machines costing countless millions--machines offlesh and blood, with their destinies shaped by one little bit of lyinginformation! Think of the folly of any civilization that stakes itstriumphs on such a gamble! Am I not right? Isn't it true? Isn't it?""Yes, yes, Marta! But--I--" If she were weakening it was not his placeto try to strengthen her purpose."I was thinking, only thinking!" she murmured reflectively. "That's notthe thing now!" she added with sudden force. "Partow gave you thepositions?"He described the Bordir position. She repeated the description after himwith a stoical matter-of-factness to make sure that she had itcorrectly."I must actually know in order to be convincing," she said. "Now that ofthe main line."He did not include in the description of Engadir any reference to theBrowns' plan of a crushing counter-attack. But as she was repeatingthis, her calm tone broke into an outcry of horror, as the nature ofwhat he was inadvertently concealing flashed into her mind. She wasseeing another picture of imagination, with all the hideous detail ofrealism drawn from her week's experiences."That column of Grays will go forward cheering with victory, led on,tricked on--and then they will find themselves in a shambles. No goingforward, no going back through the cross-fire! Is that it?""Yes, something like that, though not exactly a cross-fire--not unlessthe enemy has poorer generals than we think.""But that will be the object and the effect--wholesale slaughter?""Yes!" assented Lanstron honestly."And a woman whose greatest happiness and pride was in teaching therighteousness and the beauty of peace to children--her lie will sendthem to death!" she moaned. "I shall be a party to murder!""No more than Westerling! No more than any general! No--" But he pausedin his argument. Conviction must come to her from within, not fromwithout. He stood graven and wordless, while she was tortured in thehell of her mind's creation.She was hearing the cry in the night of the Gray soldier who had fallenfrom the dirigible in the first day's fighting; the agonized groans ofthe men under the wall of the terrace when the hand-grenades spatteredhuman flesh as if it were jelly. But there was Dellarme smiling; therewas Hugo Mallin saying that he would fight for his own home; there wasStransky, who had thrown the hand-grenade, bringing in an exhausted oldman on his back from under fire; there was Feller as he ralliedDellarme's men; and--and there was Lanny waiting at the other end of thewire--and a burglar should not take her home."Men must have the courage of their convictions!" Hugo had said. Herswere all for peace. But there was not peace. There could not be peaceuntil the war demon had had his fill of killing and one side had to cryfor mercy. Which side should that be? That was the only question."It will the sooner end fighting, won't it, Lanny?" she asked in asmall, tense voice."Yes.""And the only real end that means real peace is to prove that the weakcan hold back the strong from their threshold?""Yes."Even now Westerling might be on the veranda, perhaps waiting for newsthat would enable him to crush the weak; to prove that the law of fivepounds of human flesh against three, and five bayonets against three, isthe law of civilization."Yes, yes, yes!" The constriction was gone from her throat; there was adrum-beat in her soul. "Depend on me, Lanny!" It was Feller's favoritephrase spoken by the one who was to take his place. "Yes, I'm ready tomake any sacrifice now. For what am I? What is one woman compared tosuch a purpose? I don't care what is said of me or what becomes of me ifwe can win! Good-by, Lanny, till I call you up again! And God with us!""God with us!" as Partow had said, over and over The saying had come tobe repeated by hard-headed, agnostic staff-officers, who believed thatthe deity had no relation to the efficiency of gun-fire. The Browninfantrymen even were beginning to mutter it in the midst of action.XXXIVTHREE VOICESWaiting on the path of the second terrace for Westerling to come, Martarealized the full meaning of her task. Day in and day out she was tohave suspense at her elbow and the horror of hypocrisy on herconscience, the while keeping her wits nicely balanced. She must feelher part and at the same time she must be sufficiently conscious thatshe was placing a part not to let any impulse of aversion betray her.The tea-table scene had been a rehearsal; coming was a _premiere_ beforethe ghostly, still faces across the bent glare of the footlights. Noready-made lines, hers She must create them. Every word must be theright word and spoken in the right way, all for the deception of oneman.When she saw Westerling appear on the veranda and start over the lawnshe felt dizzy and uncertain of her capabilities. In the gathering duskhe seemed of giant stature, too masterful to be outwitted by anytrickery she might devise. She wondered if she would be able toarticulate a word; if she would not turn and flee."I have considered all that you said for my guidance and I havedecided," she began.Marta heard her own voice with the relief of a singer in a debut who,with knees shaking, finds that her notes are true. She was lookingdirectly at Westerling in profound seriousness. Though knees shook, lipsand chin could aid eyes in revealing the painful fatigue of a battlethat had raged in the mind of a woman who went away for half an hour tothink for herself."I have concluded," she went on, "that it is an occasion for thesacrifice of private ethics to a great purpose, the sooner to end theslaughter.""All true!" whispered an inner voice. Its tone was Lanny's, in the olddays of their comradeship. It gave her strength. All true!"Yes, an end--a speedy end!" said Westerling with a fine, inflexibleemphasis. "That is your prayer and mine and the prayer of all lovers ofhumanity.""He is not thinking of humanity, but of individual victory!" whisperedanother voice, which had the mellow tone of Hugo Mallin's deliberatewisdom."It is little that I know, but such as it is you shall have it," shebegan, conscious of his guarded scrutiny. When she told him of Bordir,the weak point in the first line of the Browns' defence, she noted nochange in his steady look; but with the mention of Engadir in the mainline she detected a gleam in his eyes that had the merciless delight ofa cutting edge of steel. "I have made my sacrifice to some purpose? Theinformation is worth something to you?" she asked wistfully."Yes, yes! Yes, it promises that way," he replied thoughtfully.Quietly he began a considerate catechism. Soon she was subtlyunderstanding that her answers lacked the convincing details that hesought. She longed to avert her eyes from his for an instant, but sheknew that this would be fatal. She felt the force of him directed inprofessional channels, free of all personal relations, beating as astrong light on her bare statements. How could a woman ever have learnedtwo such vital secrets? How could it happen that two such criticalpoints as Bordir and Engadir should go undefended? No tactician, noengineer but would have realized their strategic importance. Did sheknow what she was saying? How did she get her knowledge? These, sheunderstood, were the real questions that underlay Westerling's politeindirection."Invention! Quick, quick! How did you find out? Quick and naturally andobviously--pure invention; no half-way business!" whispered stillanother voice, the voice of that most facile of story-builders, Feller,this time."But I have not told you the sources of my information! Isn't that likea woman!" she exclaimed. "You see, it did not concern me at all at thetime I heard it. I didn't even realize its importance and I didn't hearmuch," she proceeded, her introduction giving time for improvisation."You see, Partow was inspecting the premises with Colonel Lanstron. Mymother had known Partow in her younger days when my grandfather waspremier. We had them both to luncheon.""Yes?" put in Westerling, betraying his eagerness. Partow and Lanstron!Then her source was one of authority, not the gossip of subalterns!"And it occurs to me now that, even while he was our guest," sheinterjected in sudden indignation--"that even while he was our guestPartow was planning to make our grounds a redoubt!""Bully! Very feminine and convincing!" whispered the voice of Feller."After luncheon I remember Partow saying, 'We are going to have a lookat the crops,' and they went for a walk out to the knoll where thefighting began.""Yes! When was this?" Westerling asked keenly."Only about six weeks ago," answered Marta."That's it! That's splendid! If you'd said a year ago there would havebeen time enough in the meanwhile to fortify!" whispered the voice ofFeller encouragingly. "You're going fine! Keep it up!""Later, I came upon them unexpectedly after they had returned," Martawent on. "They were sitting there on that seat concealed by theshrubbery. I was on the terrace steps unobserved and I couldn't helpoverhearing them. Their voices grew louder with the interest of theirdiscussion. I caught something about appropriations and aeroplanes andBordir and Engadir, and saw that Lanstron was pleading with his chief.He wanted a sum appropriated for fortifications to be applied tobuilding planes and dirigibles. Finally, Partow consented, and I recallhis exact words: 'They're shockingly archaically defended, especiallyEngadir,' he said, 'but they can wait until we get furtherappropriations in the fall.'" She was so far under the spell of her owninvention that she believed the reality of her words, reflected in herwide-open eyes which seemed to have nothing to hide."That is all," she exclaimed with a shudder--"all my eavesdropping, allmy breach of confidence! If--if it--" and her voice trembled with theintensity of the one purpose that was shining with the light of truththrough the murk of her deception--"it will only help to end theslaughter!" She held out her hand convulsively in parting as if shewould leave the rest with him."I think it will," he said soberly. "I think it will prove that you havedone a great service," he repeated as he caught both her hands, whichwere cold from her ordeal. His own were warm with the strong beating ofhis heart stirred by the promise of what he had just heard. But he didnot prolong the grasp. He was as eager to be away to his work as she tobe alone. "I think it will. You will know in the morning," he added.His steps were sturdier than ever in the power of five against three ashe started back to the house. When he reached the veranda, Bouchard, thesaturnine chief of intelligence, appeared in the doorway of thedining-room: or, rather, reappeared, for he had been standing therethroughout the interview of Westerling and Marta, whose heads were justvisible, above the terrace wall, to his hawk eyes."A little promenade in the open and my mind made up," said Westerling,clapping Bouchard on the shoulder."Something about an attack to-night?" asked Bouchard."You guess right. Call the others."Five minutes later he was seated at the head of the dining-room tablewith his chiefs around him waiting for their chairman to speak. He askedsome categorical questions almost perfunctorily, and the answer to eachwas, "Ready!" with, in some instances, a qualification--thequalification made by regimental and brigade commanders that, thoughthey could take the position in front of them, the cost would be heavy.Yes, all were willing and ready for the first general assault of thewar, but they wanted to state the costs as a matter of professionalself-defence.Westerling could pose when it served his purpose. Now he rose and, goingto one of the wall maps, indicated a point with his forefinger."If we get that we have the most vital position, haven't we?"Some uttered a word of assent; some only nodded. A glance or two ofcuriosity was exchanged. Why should the chief of staff ask so elementarya question? Westerling was not unconscious of the glances or of theirmeaning. They gave dramatic value to his next remark."We are going to mass for our main attack in front at Bordir!""But," exclaimed four or five officers at once, "that is the heart ofthe position! That is--""I believe it is weak--that it will fall, and to-night!""You have information, then, information that I have not?" askedBouchard."No more than you," replied Westerling. "Not as much if you haveanything new.""Nothing!" admitted Bouchard wryly. He lowered his head underWesterling's penetrating look in the consciousness of failure."I am going on a conviction--on putting two and two together!"Westerling announced. "I am going on my experience as a soldier, as achief of staff. If I am wrong, I take the responsibility. If I amright, Bordir will be ours before morning. It is settled!""If you are right, then," exclaimed Turcas--"well, then it's geniusor--" He did not finish the sentence. He had been about to saycoincidence; while Westerling knew that if he were right all the risingscepticism in certain quarters, owing to the delay in his programme,would be silenced. His prestige would be unassailable.XXXVMRS. GALLAND INSISTS"You have been in the tunnel again!" said Mrs. Galland with an emphasison "again," when Marta came up the stairs, lantern in hand, aftertelling Lanstron of her interview with Westerling."Again--yes!" Marta replied mechanically. Her mind was empty, burnedout. She had thought herself through with deceit for the day."What interests you so much down there?" Mrs. Galland pursued softly.Marta realized that she had to deal with a fresh dilemma. She could notbe making frequent visits to the telephone without her mother'sknowledge; and, as yet, Mrs. Galland knew nothing of the part originallyplanned for Feller, let alone any inkling of her daughter's part."I didn't know but it would be a good place to hide our plate and othertreasures," said Marta, offering rather methodically the first inventionthat came to mind as she threw open-the reflector of the lantern andturned down the wick. She was ashamed of the excuse. It warned her howeasy it was becoming for her to lie--yes, lie was the word."Don't blow out the light, please," said Mrs. Galland. "I should like tosee for myself if the tunnel is a good hiding-place for the plate.""It's too damp for you down there--it's--" Marta blew out the flame witha sudden gust of breath and bolted across the room and into her chamber,closing the door and taking the lantern with her. In utter fatigue shedropped on the bed. Then came a gentle, prolonged knocking on the door."You forgot to leave the lantern," called Mrs. Galland. "I have come toget it, if you please."Marta did not answer. Her head had sunk forward; her hands, bearing theweight of her body, were resting on her knees. All she could think wasthat one more lie would break the camel's back."Marta, please mayn't I come in?" rose the gentle voice on the otherside of the door. "Marta, don't you hear me? I asked if I might comein.""It's too childish and silly to remain silent any longer," thoughtMarta. Tired nerves revived spasmodically under another call to action."Yes, certainly, mother--yes, do!" she said in a forced, metallic tone.Mrs. Galland entered to find her daughter before the mirror brushing herhair with hectic vigor. She did not take up the lantern, which Marta hadleft in the middle of the floor, but seated herself. Her nicedeliberation in smoothing out a wrinkle of her skirt over her kneesindicated that she meant to stay a while. She folded her plump, whitehands; a faint touch of color came into her round, pink cheeks; a traceof a smile knitted itself into the corners of her mouth. She was as shehad been--_J'y suis! J'y reste_!--when the captain of engineers hadpleaded with her at the outset of the war to leave the house. In thereflection of the mirror Marta's glance caught hers, which was withoutreproach or complaint, but very resolute."Do you like best to keep it all to yourself, Marta?" Mrs. Gallandinquired solicitously."What? Keep what?" asked Marta crossly."Even if you have been all the way around the world, it might be easierif you allowed me to help you a little," pursued Mrs. Galland."Help! Help about what?" said Marta.That reply, as Marta knew now as an expert in deceit, was a mistake. Shewas hedging and petulant when she ought to have whirled around gayly andkissed her mother on the cheek, while laughing at such solemnity over atrip of exploration through the tunnel. Mrs. Galland had caught herprevaricating. Not since Marta was a little girl of seven had she"fibbed" to her mother; and on that memorable and ethically instructiveoccasion her mother had regarded her in this same calm fashion."At all events," said Mrs. Galland, "I could help you a little if youwould let me comb your hair. You are combing in a most unsystematic way,I must say. Systematic, gentle combing is very good for headaches and--"There was a twinkle in Mrs. Galland's eye that was not exactly humor; apersistent twinkle that seemed to shine out of every part of the mirror.Her curiosity had come to stay; there was no escaping it. Marta broughther brush down with a bang on the bureau, only to be disgusted with thisshow of temper which the persistent twinkle had not missed. Her nextimpulse, unanalyzed because it was one of the oldest and simplest ofimpulses, made her spin round and drop on her knees at her mother'sfeet, which was just what had happened when she had started to brave outthe last lie--the childhood lie.Her head buried in her mother's lap, she was sobbing. It was many yearssince Mrs. Galland had known Marta to sob and she was glad that Martahad not forgotten how. She believed in the value of the law of overflow.When Marta looked up with eyes still moist, it was with the joyoussatisfaction that begins a confession. Not once during the recital didthe smile fade from Mrs. Galland's lips. She was too well fortified forany kind of a shock to exhibit surprise."You see, I could not tell you--I--" Marta concluded, still uncertainwhat conclusion lay behind her mother's attitude."Of course you could not," said Mrs. Galland. "As grandfather--myfather, the premier--said; a man action cannot stop to explaineverything he does. He must strike while the iron is hot. If you hadstopped to discuss every step you would not have gone far--Yes, I shouldhave argued and protested. It was best that I, being as I am--that Ishould not have been told--not until now.""And I must go on!" added Marta."Of course you must!" replied Mrs. Galland. "You must for the sake ofthe Browns--the flag your father and grandfather served. They would nothave approved of petty deceit, but anything for the cause, anysacrifices, any immolation of self and personal sensibilities. Yes, yourfather would have been happy, though he had no son, to know that hisdaughter might do such a service. And we must tell Minna," she added."Minna! You think so? Every added link may mean weakness.""But Minna will see you going and coming from the tunnel, too. She isfor the Browns with all her heart. They are her people and, besides,"Mrs. Galland smiled rather broadly, "that giant Stransky is with theBrowns!" So Minna was told."I'd like to kiss your skirt, Miss Galland!" exclaimed Minna inadmiration."Better kiss me!" said Marta, throwing her arms around the girl. "Wemust stand together and think together in any emergency."Soon after dark the attack began. Flashes of bursting shells and flashesfrom gun mouths and glowing sheets of flame from rifles made uglyrevelry, while the beams of search-lights swept hither and thither. Thiskept up till shortly after midnight, when it died down and, where hell'sconcert had raged, silent darkness shrouded the hills. Marta knew thatBordir was taken without having to ask Lanstron or wait for confirmationfrom Westerling.She was seated in the recess of the arbor the next morning, when sheheard the approach of those regular, powerful steps whose character hadbecome as distinct to her as those of a member of her own family. FiveAgainst three! five against three! they were saying to her; while downthe pass road and the castle road ran the stream of wounded from lastnight's slaughter.Posted in the drawing-room of the Galland house were the congratulationsof the premier to Westerling, who had come from the atmosphere of astaff that accorded to him a military insight far above the analysis ofordinary standards. But he was too clever a man to vaunt his triumph. Heknew how to carry his honors. He accepted success as his due, in amatter-of-course manner that must inspire confidence in further success."You were right," he said to Marta easily, pleasantly. "We did it--wedid it--we took Bordir with a loss of only twenty thousand men!"_Only_ twenty thousand! Her revulsion at the bald statement was relievedby the memory of Lanny's word over the telephone after breakfast thatthe Browns had lost only five thousand. Four to one was a wide ratio,she was thinking."Then the end--then peace is so much the nearer?" she asked."Very much nearer!" he answered earnestly, as he dropped on the benchbeside her.He stretched his arms out on the back of the seat and the relaxedattitude, unusual with him, brought into relief a new trait of which shehad been hitherto oblivious. The conqueror had become simply acompanionable man. Though he was not sitting close to her, yet, as hiseyes met hers, she had a desire to move away which she knew would beunwise to gratify. She was conscious of a certain softening charm, amagnetism that she had sometimes felt in the days when she first knewhim. She realized, too, that then the charm had not been mixed with theindescribable, intimate quality that it held now."In the midst of congratulations after the position was taken lastnight," he declared, "I confess that I was thinking less of successthan of its source." He bent on her a look that was warm with gratitude.She lowered her lashes before it; before gratitude that made her partappear in a fresh angle of misery."There seems to be a kind of fatality about our relations," he went on."I lay awake pondering it last night." His tone held more thangratitude. It had the elation of discovery."Look out! Look out, now!" Not only the voices of Lanny and Feller andHugo warned her, but also those of her mother and Minna."He is going to make it harder than I ever guessed!" echoed her ownthought, in a flutter of confusion."Yes, it was strange our meeting on the frontier in peace and then inwar!" she exclaimed at random. The sound of the remark struck her as toosubdued; as expectant, when her purpose was one of careless deprecation."I have met a great many women, as you may have imagined," he proceeded."They passed in review. They were simply women, witty and frail or dulland beautiful, and one meant no more to me than another. Nothing meantanything to me except my profession. But I never forgot you. You plantedsomething in mind: a memory of real companionship.""Yes, I made the prophecy that came true!" she put in. This ought tobring him back to himself and his ambitions, she thought."Yes!" he exclaimed, his body stiffening free of the back of the seat."You realized what was in me. You foresaw the power which was to bemine. The fate that first brought us together made me look you up in thecapital. Now it brings us together here on this bench after all that haspassed in the last twenty-four hours."She realized that he had drawn perceptibly nearer. She wanted to riseand cry out: "Don't do this! Be the chief of staff, the conqueror,crushing the earth with the tread of five against three!" It was theconqueror whom she wanted to trick, not a man whose earnestness waspainting her deceit blacker. Far from rising, she made no movement atall; only looked at her hands and allowed him to go on, conscious of theforce of a personality that mastered men and armies now warm andappealing in the full tide of another purpose."The victory that I was thinking of last night was not the taking ofBordir. It was finer than any victory in war. It was selfish--not forarmy and country, but born of a human weakness triumphant; a humanweakness of which my career had robbed me," he continued. "It gave me ajoy that even the occupation of the Browns' capital could not give. Ihad come as an invader and I had won your confidence.""In a cause!" she interrupted hurriedly, wildly, to stop him from goingfurther, only to find that her intonation was such that it was drawinghim on."That fatality seemed to be working itself out to the soldier so mucholder than yourself in renewed youth, in another form of ambition. Ihoped that there was more than the cause that led you to trust me. Ihoped--"Was he testing her? Was he playing a part of his own to make certainthat she was not playing one? She looked up swiftly for answer. Therewas no gainsaying what she saw in his eyes. It was beating into herswith the power of an overwhelming masculine passion and a maturity ofintellect as his egoism admitted a comrade to its throne. Such is everthe way of the man in the forties when the clock strikes for him. Butwho could know better the craft of courtship than one of Westerling'sexperience? He was fighting for victory; to gratify a desire."I did not expect this--I--" The words escaped tumultuously andchokingly.She heard all the voices in chorus: "Look out! Look out!" And then thevoice of Feller alone, insinuating, with a sinister mischievousness:"What more could you ask? Now that you have him, hold him! For God andcountry--for our dear Brown land!"Hold a man who was making love to her by the tricks of the courtesan!But what kind of love? He was bending so close to her that she felt hisbreath on her cheek burning hot, and she was sickeningly conscious thathe was looking her over in that point-by-point manner which she had feltacross the tea-table at the hotel. This horrible thing in his glance shehad sometimes seen in strangers on her travels, and it had made herthink that she was wise to carry a little revolver. She wanted to strikehim."Confess! Confess!" called all her own self-respect. "Make an end toyour abasement!""Confession, after the Browns have given up Bordir! Confession thatmakes Lanny, not Westerling, your dupe!" came the reply, which mighthave been telegraphed into her mind from the high, white forehead ofPartow bending over his maps. "Confession, betraying the cause of theright against the wrong; the three to the conquering five! No! You arein the things. You may not retreat now."For a few seconds only the duel of argument thundered in hertemples--seconds in which her lips were parted and quivering and hereyes dilated with an agitation which the man at her side could interpretas he pleased. A prompting devil--a devil roused by that thing in hiseyes--urging a finesse in double-dealing which only devils understand,made her lips hypnotically turn in a smile, her eyes soften, and senther hand out to Westerling in a trance-like gesture. For an instant itrested on his arm with telling pressure, though she felt it burn withshame at the point of contact."We must not think of that now," she said. "We must think of nothingpersonal; of nothing but your work until your work is done!"The prompting devil had not permitted a false note in her voice. Hervery pallor, in fixity of idea, served her purpose. Westerling drew adeep breath that seemed to expand his whole being with greaterappreciation of her. Yet that harried hunger, the hunger of a beast, wasstill in his glance."This is like you--like what I want you to be!" he said. "You areright." He caught her hand, enclosing it entirely in his grip, and shewas sensible, in a kind of dazed horror, of the thrill of his strength."Nothing can stop us! Numbers will win! Hard fighting in the mercy of aquick end!" he declared with his old rigidity of five against threewhich was welcome to her. "Then," he added--"and then--""Then!" she repeated, averting her glance. "Then--" There the devilended the sentence and she withdrew her hand and felt the relief of oneescaping suffocation, to find that he had realized that anything furtherduring that interview would be banality and was rising to go."I don't feel decent!" she thought. "Society turned on Minna for a humanweakness--but I--I'm not a human being! I am one of the pawns of themachine of war!"Walking slowly with lowered head as she left the arbor, she almost raninto Bouchard, who apologized with the single word "Pardon!" as helifted his cap in overdone courtesy, which his stolid brevity made themore conspicuous."Miss Galland, you seem lost in abstraction," he said in suddenloquacity. "I am almost on the point of accusing you of being a poet.""Accusing!" she replied. "Then you must think that I would write badpoetry.""On the contrary, I should say excellent--using the sonnet form," hereturned."I might make a counter accusation, only that yours would be the epicform," answered Marta. "For you, too, seem fond of rambling."There was a veiled challenge in the hawk eyes, which she met withcommonplace politeness in hers, before he again lifted his cap andproceeded on his way.XXXVIMARKING TIMEFor the next two weeks Marta's role resolved itself into a kind ofroutine. Their cramped quarters became spacious to the three women inthe intimacy of the common secret shared by them under the very nose ofthe staff. With little Clarissa Eileen, they formed the only femininesociety in the neighborhood. On sunshiny days Mrs. Galland was usuallyto be found in her favorite chair outside the tower door; and here Minnaset the urn on a table at four-thirty as in the old days.No member of the staff was more frequently present at Marta's teas thanBouchard, who was developing his social instinct late in life by sittingin the background and allowing others to do the talking while he watchedand listened. In his hearing, Marta's attitude toward the progress ofthe war was sympathetic but never interrogatory, while she sharedattention with Clarissa Eileen, who was in danger of becoming spoiled byofficers who had children of their own at home. After the reports ofkilled and wounded, which came with such appalling regularity, it was arelief to hear of the day's casualties among Clarissa's dolls. The chiefof transportation and supply rode her on his shoulder; the chief oftactics played hide-and-seek with her; the chief engineer built her adoll house of stones with his own hands; and the chief medical officerwas as concerned when she caught a cold as if the health of the armywere at stake."We mustn't get too set up over all this attention, Clarissa Eileen, myrival," said Marta to the child. "You are the only little girl and I amthe only big girl within reach. If there were lots of others it wouldbe different."She had occasional glimpses of Hugo Mallin on his crutches, keeping inthe vicinity of the shrubbery that screened the stable from the house.How Marta longed to talk with him! But he was always attended by asoldier, and under the rigorous discipline that held all her impulsessubservient to her purpose she passed by him without a word lest shecompromise her position.Bouchard was losing flesh; his eyes were sinking deeper under a heavierfrown. His duty being to get information, he was gaining none. His dutybeing to keep the Grays' secrets, there was a leak somewhere in his owndepartment. He quizzed subordinates; he made abrupt transfers, to noavail.Meanwhile, the Grays were taking the approaches to the main line ofdefence, which had been thought relatively immaterial but had been foundshrewdly placed and their vulnerability overestimated. The thunders ofbatteries hammering them became a routine of existence, like the passingof trains to one living near a railroad. The guns went on while tea wasbeing served; they ushered in dawn and darkness; they were going whensleep came to those whom they later awakened with a start. Fights asdesperate as the one around the house became features of this period,which was only a warming-up practice for the war demon before the orgyof the impending assault on the main line.Marta began to realize the immensity of the chess-board and of theforces engaged in more than the bare statement of numbers and distances.If a first attack on a position failed, the wires from the Galland houserepeated their orders to concentrate more guns and attack again. In theend the Browns always yielded, but grudgingly, calculatingly, neverbeing taken by surprise. The few of them who fell prisoners said, "Godwith us! We shall win in the end!" and answered no questions. Graduallythe Gray army began to feel that it was battling with a mystery whichwas fighting under cover, falling back under cover--a tenacious,watchful mystery that sent sprays of death into every finger of fleshthat the Grays thrust forward in assault."Another position taken. Our advance continues," was the only news thatWesterling gave to the army, his people, and the world, which forgot itssports and murders and divorce cases in following the progress of thefirst great European war for two generations. He made no mention of thecosts; his casualty lists were secret. The Gray hosts were sweepingforward as a slow, irresistible tide; this by Partow's own admission. Heannounced the loss of a position as promptly as the Grays its taking. Hepublished a daily list of casualties so meagre in contrast to their ownthat the Grays thought it false; he made known the names of the killedand wounded to their relatives. Yet the seeming candor of his pressbureau included no straw of information of military value to the enemy.Westerling never went to tea at the Gallands' with the other officers,for it was part of his cultivation of greatness to keep aloof from hissubordinates. His meetings with Marta happened casually when he went outinto the garden. Only once had he made any reference to the "And then"of their interview in the arbor."I am winning battles for _you_!" he had exclaimed with that thing inhis eyes which she loathed.To her it was equivalent to saying that she had tricked him into sendingmen to be killed in order to please her. She despised herself for theway he confided in her; yet she had to go on keeping his confidence,returning a tender glance with one that held out hope. She learned notto shudder when he spoke of a loss of "only ten thousand." In order torally herself when she grew faint-hearted to her task, she learned topicture the lines of his face hard-set with five-against-threebrutality, while in comfort he ordered multitudes to death, and, incontrast, to recall the smile of Dellarme, who asked his soldiers toundergo no risk that he would not share. And after every success hewould remark that he was so much nearer Engadir, that position of themain line of defence whose weakness she had revealed."Your Engadir!" he came to say. "Then we shall again profit by yourinformation; that is, unless they have fortified since you received it.""They haven't. They had already fortified!" she thought. She was alwaysseeing the mockery of his words in the light of her own knowledge andher own part, which never quite escaped her consciousness. One chamberof her mind was acting for him; a second chamber was perfectly awarethat the other was acting."One position more--the Twin Boulder Redoubt, it is called," heannounced at last. "We shall not press hard in front. We shall drive inmasses on either side and storm the flanks."This she was telephoning to Lanstron a few minutes later and having, inreturn, all the news of the Browns. The sheer fascination of knowingwhat both sides were doing exerted its spell in keeping her to her part."They've lost four hundred thousand men now, Lanny," she said."And we only a hundred thousand. We're whittling them down," answeredLanstron."Whittling them down! What a ghastly expression!" she gasped. "You areas bad as Westerling and I am worse than either of you! I--I announcedthe four hundred thousand as if they were a score--a score in a game inour favor. I am helping, Lanny? All my sacrifice isn't for nothing?" sheasked for the hundredth time."Immeasurably. You have saved us many lives!" he replied."And cost them many?" she asked."Yes, Marta, no doubt," he admitted; "but no more than they would havelost in the end. It is only the mounting up of their casualties thatcan end the war. Thus the lesson must be taught.""And I can be of most help when the attack on the main defence isbegun?""Yes.""And when Westerling finds that my information is false aboutEngadir--then--"She had never put the question to him in this way before. What wouldWesterling do if he found her out?"My God, Marta!" he exclaimed. "If I'd had any sense I would havethought of that in the beginning and torn out the 'phone! I've been mad,mad with the one thought of the nation--inhuman in my greedy patriotism.I will not let you go any further!"It was a new thing for her to be rallying him; yet this she did as thestrange effect of his protest on the abnormal sensibilities that heracting had developed."Thinking of me--little me!" she called back. "Of one person's comfortwhen hundreds of thousands of other women are in terror; when thedestiny of millions is at stake! Lanny, you are in a blue funk!" and shewas laughing forcedly and hectically. "I'm going on--going on like onein a trance who can't stop if he would. It's all right, Lanny. Iundertook the task myself. I must see it through!"After she had hung up the receiver her buoyancy vanished. She leanedagainst the wall of the tunnel weakly. Yes, what if she were found out?She was thinking of the possibility seriously for the first time. Yet,for only a moment did she dwell upon it before she dismissed it insudden reaction."No matter what they do to me or what becomes of me!" she thought. "I'ma lost soul, anyway. The thing is to serve as long as I can--and then Idon't care!"XXXVIITHUMBS DOWN FOR BOUCHARDHaggard and at bay, Bouchard faced the circle of frowns around thepolished expanse of that precious heirloom, the dining-room table of theGallands. The dreaded reckoning of the apprehensions which kept himrestlessly awake at night had come at the next staff council after thefall of the Twin Boulder Redoubt. With the last approach to the mainline of defence cleared, one chapter of the war was finished. But theofficers did not manifest the elation that the occasion called for,which is not saying that they were discouraged. They had no doubt thateventually the Grays would dictate peace in the Browns' capital. Exactlystated, their mood was one of repressed professional irritation. Notuntil the third attempt was Twin Boulder Redoubt taken. As far asresults were concerned, the nicely planned first assault might have beena stroke of strategy by the Browns to drive the Grays into an impassablefire zone."The trouble is we are not informed!" exclaimed Turcas, opening his thinlips even less than usual, but twisting them in a significant manner ashe gave his words a rasping emphasis. The others hastened to follow hislead with equal candor."Exactly. We have no reports of their artillery strength, which we hadgreatly underestimated," said the chief of artillery."Our maps of their forts could not be less correct if revealed to us forpurposes of deceit. Again and again we have thought that we had themsurprised, only to be surprised ourselves. In short, they know what weare doing and we don't know what they are doing!" said the tacticalexpert.There the chief of the aerostatic division took the defensive."They certainly don't learn our plans with their planes and dirigibles!"he declared energetically."Hardly, when we never see them over our lines.""The Browns are acting on the defensive in the air as well as on theearth!""But our own planes and dirigibles bring little news," said Turcas. "Imean, those that return," he added pungently."And few do return. My men are not wanting in courage!" replied thechief aerostatic officer. "Immediately we get over the Brown lines theBrowns, who keep cruising to and fro, are on us like hawks. They riskanything to bring us down. When we descend low we strike the fire oftheir high-angle guns, which are distributed the length of the frontier.I believe both their aerial fleet and their high-angle artillery weregreatly underestimated. Finally, I cannot reduce my force too much inscouting or they might rake the offensive.""Another case of not being informed!" concluded Turcas, returning grimlyto his point.He looked at Bouchard, and every one began looking at Bouchard. If theGray tacticians had been outplayed by their opponents, if their lossesfor the ground gained exceeded calculations, then it was good to have ascapegoat for their professional mistakes. Bouchard was Westerling'schoice for chief of intelligence. His blind loyalty was pleasing to hissuperior, who, hitherto, had promptly silenced any suggestion ofcriticism by repeating that the defensive always appeared to theoffensive to be better informed than itself. But this time Westerlinglet the conversation run on without a word of excuse for his favorite.Each fresh reproach from the staff, whose opinion was the only god heknew, was a dagger thrust to Bouchard. At night he had lain awakeworrying about the leak; by day he had sought to trace it, only to findevery clew leading back to the staff. Now he was as confused in hisshame as a sensitive schoolboy. Vaguely, in his distress, he heardWesterling asking a question, while he saw all those eyes staring athim."What information have we about Engadir?""I believe it to be strongly fortified!" stammered Bouchard."You believe! You have no information?" pursued Westerling."No, sir," replied Bouchard. "Nothing--nothing new!""We do seem to get little information," said Westerling, looking hardand long at Bouchard in silence--the combined silence of the wholestaff.This public reproof could have but one meaning. He should soon receive anote which would thank him politely for his services, in the stereotypedphrases always used for the purpose, before announcing his transfer to aless responsible post."Very little, sir!" Bouchard replied doggedly."There is that we had from one of our aviators whose machine came downin a smash just as he got over our infantry positions on his return,"said the chief aerostatic officer. "He was in a dying condition when wepicked him up, and, as he was speaking with the last breaths in hisbody, naturally his account of what he had seen was somewhat incoherent.It would be of use, however, if we had plans of the forts that wouldenable us to check off his report intelligently.""Yet, what evidence have we that Partow or Lanstron has done more thanto make a fortunate guess or show military insight?" Westerling asked."There is the case of my own belief that Bordir was weak, which provedcorrect.""Last night we got a written telegraphic staff message from the body ofa dead officer of the Browns found in the Twin Boulder Redoubt," saidthe vice-chief, "which showed that in an hour after our plans weretransmitted to our own troops for the first attack they were known tothe enemy.""That looks like a leak!" exclaimed Westerling, "a leak, Bouchard, doyou hear?" He was frowning and his lips were drawn and his cheeksmottled with red in a way not pleasant to see.Stiffening in his chair, a flash of desperation in his eye, Bouchard'sbony, long hand gripped the table edge. Every one felt that a sensationwas coming."Yes, I have known that there was a leak!" he said with hoarse, painfuldeliberation. "I have sent out every possible tracer. I have followed upevery sort of clew I have transferred a dozen men. I have left nothingundone!""With no result?" persisted Westerling impatiently"Yes, always the same result: That the leak is here in this house--herein the grand headquarters of the army under our very noses. I know it isnot the telegraphers or the clerks. It is a member of the staff!""Have you gone out of your head?" demanded Westerling. "Whatstaff-officer? How does he get the information to the enemy? Name thepersons you suspect here and now! Explain, if you want to be consideredsane!"Here was the blackest accusation that could be made against an officer!The chosen men of the staff, tested through many grades before theyreached the inner circle of cabinet secrecy, lost the composure of acouncil. All were leaning forward toward Bouchard breathless for hisanswer."There are three women on the grounds," said Bouchard. "I have beenagainst their staying from the first. I----."He got no further. His words were drowned by the outburst of one of theyounger members of the staff, who had either to laugh or choke at thepicture of this deep-eyed, spectral sort of man, known as a woman-hater,in his revelation of the farcical source of his suspicions."Why not include Clarissa Eileen?" some one asked, Starting a chorus ofsatirical exclamations."How do they get through the line?""Yes, past a wall of bayonets?""When not even a soldier in uniform is allowed to move away from hiscommand without a pass?""By wireless?""Perhaps by telepathy!""Unless," said the chief of the aerostatic division, grinning, "Bouchardlends them the use of our own wires through the capital and around bythe neutral countries across the Brown frontier!""But the correct plans and location of their forts and the numbers oftheir heavy guns and of their planes and dirigibles--your failure tohave this information is not the result of any leak from our staff sincethe war began," said Turcas in his dry, penetrating voice, clearing theair of the smoke of scattered explosions.All were staring at Bouchard again. What answer had he to this? He wasin the box, the evidence stated by the prosecutor. Let him speak!He was fairly beside himself in a paroxysm of rage and struck at the airwith his clenched fist."---- ---- Lanstron!" he cried."There's no purpose in that. He can't hear you!" said Turcas, dryly asever."He might, through the leak," said the chief aerostatic officer, whoconsidered that many of his gallant subordinates had lost their livesthrough Bouchard's inefficiency. "Perhaps Clarissa Eileen has alreadytelepathically wigwagged it to him."To lose your temper at a staff council is most unbecoming. Turcas wouldhave kept his if hit in the back by a fool automobilist. Westerling hadnow recovered his. He was again the superman in command."It is for you and not for us to locate the leak; yes, for you!" hesaid. "That is all on the subject for the present," he added in a toneof mixed pity and contempt, which left Bouchard freed from the stare ofhis colleagues and in the miserable company of his humiliation.All on the subject for the present! When it was taken up again hissuccessor would be in charge. He, the indefatigable, the over-intense,with his mediaeval partisan fervor, who loathed in secret machines likeTurcas, was the first man of the staff to go for incompetency."And Engadir is the key-point," Westerling was saying."Yes," agreed Turcas."So we concentrate to break through there," Westerling continued, "whilewe engage the whole line fiercely enough to make the enemy uncertainwhere the crucial attack is to be made.""But, general, if there is any place that is naturally strong, that--"Turcas began."The one place where they are confident that we won't attack!"Westerling interrupted. He resented the staff's professional respect forTurcas. After a silence and a survey of the faces around, he added withsententious effect: "And I was right about Bordir!"To this argument there could be no answer. The one stroke of generalshipby the Grays, who, otherwise, had succeeded alone through repeated massattacks, had been Westerling's hypothesis that had gained Bordir in asingle assault."Engadir it is, then!" said Turcas with the loyalty of the subordinatewho makes a superior's conviction his own, the better to carry it out.Hazily, Bouchard had heard the talk, while he was looking at Westerlingand seeing him, not at the head of the council table, but in the arborin eager appeal to Marta."I shall find out! I shall find out!" was drumming in his temples whenthe council rose; and, without a word or a backward glance, he was thefirst to leave the room.XXXVIIIHUNTING GHOSTSIn his search for the medium of the leak to the enemy Bouchard hadstudied every detail of the Galland premises and also of the ruins ofthe castle, with the exception of one feature mentioned in the regularstaff records, prepared before the war, in the course of their minutedescription of the architecture of buildings which were accessible tothe spies of the Grays. The tunnel to the dungeons could be reached onlythrough the private quarters of the Gallands.When he came out onto the veranda from the staff council a glimpse ofMrs. Galland walking in the garden told him that one of the guardianswho stood between him and the satisfaction of his desperate curiositywas absent. He started for the tower and found the door open and thesitting-room empty. In his impatience he had one foot across thethreshold before a prompting sense of respect for form made him pause.After all, this was a private residence. There being no bell, he rapped,and was glad that it was Minna and not Marta who appeared. He watchedher intently for the effect of his abrupt announcement as he exclaimed:"I want to go into the tunnel under the castle!"There was no mistaking her shock and alarm. Her lips remained parted ina letter O as a sweep of breath escaped. Yet, in the very process ofrecovering her scattered faculties, her feminine quickness noted atriumphant gleam in his eye. She knew that her manner had givenconviction to his suspicions. She knew that she alone stood between himand his finding Marta talking to Brown headquarters. As she was in astate of astonishment, why, astonishment was her cue. She appearedpositively speechless from it except for the emission of anotherhorrified gasp. Time! time! She must hold him until Marta left thetelephone."What an idea! That musty, horrible, damp tunnel!" she exclaimed,shuddering. "I never think of it without thinking of ghosts!""I am looking for ghosts," replied Bouchard with saturnine emphasis."Oh, don't say that!" cried Minna distractedly. "Sometimes at night Ihear their chains clanking and their groans and cries for water," shecontinued, playing the superstitious and stupid maid servant. "That is,I think I do. Miss Galland says I don't.""Does she go into the tunnel?" asked Bouchard."Yes, she's been in to show me that there were no ghosts," repliedMinna. "But not the whole way--not into the dungeons. I believe she gotfrightened herself, though she wouldn't admit it. I know there areghosts! She needn't tell me! Don't you believe there are?" she askedsolemnly, with dropped jaw."I'm going to find out!" he said, taking a step forward.But Minna, just inside the doorway, did not move to allow him to enter."Oh, I'm so glad!" she exclaimed. "Then we'll know the truth. But no!"and she turned wild with protest. "No, no! I know there are! It'sdangerous, sir! You'd never come out alive! Unseen hands would seize youand draw you down and strangle you--those terrible spirits of the darkages!"Her hands uplifted, fingers stretched apart in terror, lace white withfear, Minna's distress was real--very real, indeed!--while she listenedimpatiently for Marta's step in the adjoining room."Good heavens!" exclaimed Bouchard in disgust. "I didn't know suchsuperstition existed in this day.""I didn't, sir, until the groans and the clanking of the chains kept meawake," replied Minna."Have you a lantern?" asked Bouchard in exasperation."A lantern?" repeated Minna blankly. Time! time! She must gain time!"Yes, you gawk, a lantern!""Certainly; you'll need one," said Minna--"a big one! Go and fetch a bigarmy one--and some soldiers to fight the ghosts. But what are soldiersagainst ghosts? Oh, sir, I don't like to think of you going at all.Please, sir, don't, for the sake of your life!"There Bouchard frowned heavily and his hawk eyes flashed in command anddecision."Enough of this farce! A lamp, a candle will do. Come, get me oneimmediately!"Just as she was at her wits' end and it seemed as if there were nothingleft to do but to scream and fall in a faint in front of Bouchard, herear caught the welcome sound which told her that Marta had returned fromthe tunnel."Yes, sir. Won't you come in, sir? Of course, sir," she said, standingaside. "Won't you be seated, sir?""Good day, Colonel Bouchard!" called Marta, appearing in the doorway."He wants to go into the dungeons to see the ghosts!" Minna exclaimed ina return of horror before Bouchard had time to say a word, while shescrewed up the side of her face away from him suggestively to Marta."Those terrible ghosts! I'm afraid for him. Like a man, he may go rightinto the dungeons, even if you didn't dare to, Miss Galland.""I wish he would!" Marta joined in eagerly. "That might cure you of yoursilly imaginings, Minna. She actually thinks, Colonel Bouchard, that shehears them groan and moan and even shriek. Didn't you say they shriekedas well as groaned and moaned once about 3 A.M.?" she asked jocularly."A ghost must be hard put to it when he shrieks," observed Bouchard,glaring from one to the other."It's all very well for you to make fun of me because you have theadvantage of an education," said Minna to Marta, "but youyourself--you--""Yes, I did hear what sounded like moaning voices," admitted Martarather sheepishly. "But of course it was imagination. Now we have a manwith nerve enough to go into the dungeons, we'll lay this ridiculouspsychological bugaboo at once; that is, if you have the nerve!" Shearched her brows in challenging scrutiny of Bouchard, while her eyestwinkled at the prospect of adventure. "I thought I had, myself, butbefore I got to the dungeons the clammy air wilted it and I was rubbingmy eyes to keep from seeing all kinds of apparitions."She puzzled Bouchard, she was so facile, so ready, so many-sided. Butthe more she puzzled him the stronger became his conviction of herguilt. He guessed that all this talk was only a prelude to some trick tokeep him out of the tunnel. Poor at speech at best, slightly fussed byher candid good humor and teasing, he hesitated as to his next remark.He was going to be short with her in stating that he would go into thetunnel immediately, when she took the words out of his mouth."This way, please. I'm all impatience. I only wish that you hadsuggested it before."As they passed out of the room Minna leaned against the wall, exhaustedand wonder-struck."Miss Galland is beyond me!" she thought. "Does she think those hawkeyes will miss that little button of the panel door?""We'll need a lantern," said Marta as she took up the one she had beenusing from a corner of the tool room; while Bouchard, slowly turning hishead like some automaton, was examining every detail of floor and wall,spades, hoes, and weeders, for a hidden significance. The lantern wasstill hot, and Marta's finger smarted with a burn, but she did nottwitch. She was so keyed up that she felt capable of walking overred-hot coals, while she joked about ghosts. "There!" she exclaimed,after the lantern was lighted. "This is going to be great sport. Ghosthunting--think of that! We might have made a ghost party Too bad wedidn't think of it in time. Yes, it's a pity to be so exclusive aboutit. Even now we might send for General Westerling and some of the otherstaff-officers."She paused and looked at Bouchard questioningly, perhaps challengingly;at least, he thought challengingly. He had half a mind to concur. Couldanything be better than to have Westerling present if suspicions provedcorrect? But no. She wanted Westerling and that was the best reason whyhe should not be present. Yet there was no sign of chicane in thebrimming fun of her eyes that went with the suggestion. Bouchard'ssearch for the proper words of dissent left him rather confused and at adisadvantage. With sympathetic quickness she seemed to guess histhoughts, and in a way that he found all the more exasperating."No, no! We're too impatient! We can't wait, can we?" she exclaimed."Let's go. Let's get the ghosts single-handed, you and I. If we winwe'll demand a specially large bronze cross to be struck for us.""Yes," he agreed with an affectation of humor that made him feelludicrous. He always felt ludicrous when he tried to be humorous."Come on!" said Marta, going to the stairway.He extended his hand to take the lantern with an "If you please!""No. When we approach the enemy I'll let you lead," she replied,refusing the offer. "I'll be only too glad then; but these stairs arevery tricky if you don't know them. Keep watch!" she warned him as shestarted to descend, picking her way slowly.Once in the tunnel she held the lantern a little back of her in herright hand, which threw a shadow to the left on the side of the paneldoor. She was walking very fast, too fast to please Bouchard. In theswinging rays he could not fly-speck the surroundings with the care thathe desired. Yet how could he ask her to slacken her pace? This she didof her own accord before they had gone far."Isn't it damp and deathlike? Think of it!" she exclaimed. "No ray ofsunlight has been in here since the tunnel was dug--no, not even then;for probably it was dug after the castle was built. Think of the storiesthese walls could tell after the silence of centuries! Think of theprisoners driven along at the point of the halberd to slow death in thedungeons! You feel their spirits in the cold, clammy air." Her elocutionwas excellent, as her voice sank to an awed whisper, impressing evenBouchard with a certain uncanniness. Her steps became slow, as witheffort, while he was not missing a square inch of the top, bottom, orsides of the tunnel. "But I'll not--I'll not this time, when I have asoldier with me. For once I'll go to the end!" she cried with forcedcourage, suddenly starting forward at a half run that sent the lantern'srays lurching and dancing in a way that confused the hawk eyes. Then herburst of strength seemed to give out in collapse and she dropped againstthe wall for support, her back covering the panel door."I can't! I'm just foolishly, weakly feminine!" she whispered brokenly."According to reason there aren't any ghosts, I know. But it gets on mynerves too much-my imaginings!" She held out the lantern with atrembling hand. "I will wait here. You go on in!" she begged. "Please doand show me what a fool I am! Show that it is all a woman'shysteria--for we are all hysterical, aren't we? Go into every dungeon,please!"She did seem on the verge of hysteria, quivering as die was from head tofoot. But Bouchard, holding the lantern and staring at her, his eyesunearthly lustrous in the yellow rays, hesitated to agree to the requestbecause it was hers. Marta was not so near hysteria that she did notdivine his thought."Has it got on your nerves, too?" she inquired. "Are you, too, afraid?""No, I'm not afraid!" replied Bouchard irritably. "But aren't you afraidto be left alone in the dark? I'll take you back to the sitting-room andyou can wait there," he added with a show of gallantry, which sheimproved on with a flattering if scared smile."I'm not afraid with you between me and the dungeons," she said. "I'llhold my ground. Don't think me altogether a craven.""Very well," was all that he could say. "I came to see the dungeons, andI'll see them!"After the lantern flame grew fainter and finally disappeared around abend, Marta emitted a peculiar, squeaky little laugh. It sounded to heras if her own ghost--the ghost of her former self--were laughing insatire. There was a devilish, mischievous joy in battling to outwitBouchard more than in her deceit of Westerling. Satire,yes--needle-pointed, acid-tipped! Melodrama done in burlesque, too. Inthe name of the noble art of war, a bit of fooling about ghosts in atunnel might influence the fate of armies that were the last word inmodern equipment. And men played at killing with a grand front ofmartial dignity, when such a little thing could turn the balance ofslaughter! The ghosts in the dungeons seemed about as real as anything,except the childishness of adult humanity in organized mass. She laughedagain, this time very softly, as she moved away from the panel door afew steps farther along the wall toward the entrance and again leanedback for support.She had to wait a half-hour before she saw a yellow flame reappear andheard the dully echoing steps of Bouchard approaching. That tinypush-button on the panel, of the color of stone, was in the shadow ofher figure against the lantern's rays, which gave a glazed and hauntedeffect to Bouchard's eyes, rolling as he studied the walls and ceilingand floor of the tunnel in final baffled and desperate inquiry."Did you see anything? Did you go into all the dungeons?" Marta calledto him.Bouchard did not answer. Perhaps he was too full of disgust for words.Marta, however, had plenty of words in her impatience for knowledge."If there were you must have caught them with a quick strangle-hold. Or,did you see one and not dare to go on? Tell me! tell me!" she insistedwhen he stopped before her, his expression a strange mixture of defianceand dissatisfaction while he was searching the wall around her figure.Before his eye had any inclination to look as far away from her as thebutton she stepped free of the wall and laid her hand on Bouchard's arm."I can't wait! I've nearly perished of suspense!" she cried. "I'm justdying to know what you found. Please tell me!"Meanwhile, she was looking into his eyes, which were eagerly devouringthe spot that her figure had hidden. He saw nothing but bare stone.Marta slipped her hand behind her and began brushing her back."My gown must be a sight!" she exclaimed. "But I do believe you saw aghost and that he struck you speechless!""No!" exploded Bouchard. "No, I saw nothing!""Nothing!" she repeated. She half turned to go. He passed by her withthe lantern, while she kept to the side of the wall which held thebutton, covering it with her shadow successfully. "Nothing! No bones, noskulls--not even any anklets fastened by chains to the clammy, wetstones?""Yes, just an ordinary set of Middle Age dungeons and some staples inthe walls!" he grumbled.This was no news to her as, with Minna for company, she had explored allthe underground passages."Wonderful! I suppose a little courage will always lay ghosts!" Sheeven found it difficult to conceal a note of triumph in her tone, forthe button was now well behind them. "It's all right, Minna; therearen't any ghosts!" she called as they entered the sitting-room. AndMinna, in the kitchen, covered her mouth lest she should scream for joy."Thank you!" said Bouchard grudgingly as Marta saw him to the door."On the contrary, thank you! It was such fun--if I hadn't been soscared," replied Marta, and their gaze held each other fast in achallenge, hers beaming good nature and his saturnine in its rebuff anda hound-like tenacity of purpose, saying plainly that his suspicionswere not yet laid.When Bouchard returned to his desk he guessed the contents of the noteawaiting him, but he took a long time to read its stereotypedexpressions in transferring him to perfunctory duty well to the rear ofthe army. Then he pulled himself together and, leaden-hearted, settleddown to arrange routine details for his departure, while the rest of thestaff was immersed in the activity of the preparations for the attack onEngadir. He knew that he could not sleep if he lay down. So he spent thenight at work. In the morning his successor, a young man whom he himselfhad chosen and trained, Colonel Bellini, appeared, and the fallen manreceived the rising man with forced official courtesy."In my own defence and for your aid," he said, "I show you a copy ofwhat I have just written to General Westerling."A brief note it was, in farewell, beginning with conventional thanks forWesterling's confidence in the past."I am punished for being right," it concluded. "It is my belief thatMiss Galland sends news to the enemy and that she draws it from youwithout your consciousness of the fact. I tell you honestly. Do what youwill with me."It took more courage than any act of his life for the loyal Bouchard todare such candor to a superior. Seeing the patchy, yellow, bloodlessface drawn in stiff lines and the abysmal stare of the deep-set eyes intheir bony recesses, Bellini was swept with a wave of sympathy."Thank you, Bouchard. You've been very fine!" said Bellini as he graspedBouchard's hand, which was icy cold."My duty--my duty, in the hope that we shall kill two Browns for everyGray who has fallen--that we shall yet see them starved and besieged andcrying for mercy in their capital," replied Bouchard. He saluted with adismal, urgent formality and stalked out of the room with the tread ofthe ghost of Hamlet's father.The strange impression that this farewell left with Bellini stilllingered when, a few moments later, Westerling summoned him. Not alonethe diffidence of a new member of the staff going into the Presenceaccounted for the stir in his temples, as he waited till some paperswere signed before he had Westerling's attention. Then Westerling pickedup Bouchard's note and shook his head sadly."Poor Bouchard! You can see for yourself," and he handed the note toBellini. "I should have realized earlier that it was a case for thedoctor and not for reprimand. Mad! Poor Bouchard! He hadn't the abilityor the resiliency of mind for his task, as I hope you have, colonel.""I hope so, sir," replied Bellini."I've no doubt you have," said Westerling. "You are my choice!"XXXIXA CHANGE OF PLANThat day and the next Westerling had no time fix strolling in thegarden. His only exercise was a few periods of pacing on the veranda.Turcas, as tirelessly industrious as ever, developed an increasinglyquiet insistence to leave the responsibility of decisions abouteverything of importance to a chief who was becoming increasinglyarbitrary. The attack on Engadir being the jewel of Westerling's ownplanning, he was disinclined to risk success by delegating authority,which also meant sharing the glory of victory.Bouchard's note, though officially dismissed as a matter of pathology,would not accept dismissal privately. In flashes of distinctness itrecurred to him between reports of the progress of preparations anddirections as to dispositions. At dusk of the second day, when all theguns and troops had their places for the final movement under cover ofdarkness and he rose from his desk, the thing that had edged its wayinto a crowded mind took possession of the premises that strategy andtactics had vacated. It passed under the same analysis as his work. Hisoverweening pride, so sensitive to the suspicion of a conviction that hehad been fooled, put his relations with Marta in logical review.He had fallen in love in the midst of war. This fact was something thathis egoism must resent. Any woman who had struck such a response in himas she had must have great depths. Had she depths that he had notfathomed? He recalled her sudden change of attitude toward war, herconversion to the cause of the Grays, and her charm in this as in alltheir relations.Was it conceivable that the change was not due to a personal feeling forhim? Was her charm a charm with a purpose? Had he, the chief of staff,been beguiled into making a woman his confidant in military secrets?Just what had he told her? He could not recollect anything definite andrecollection was the more difficult because he could not call to mind asingle pertinent military question that she had ever asked him. Suchinformation as he might have imparted had been incidental to theirtalks.He had enveloped her in glamour; his most preciously trained mentalqualities lapsed in her presence. It was time that she was regardedimpersonally, as a woman, by the critical eye of the chief of staff. Acool and intense impatience possessed him to study her in the light Ofhis new scepticism, when, turning the path of the first terrace, he sawher watching the sunset over the crest of the range.She was standing quite still, a slim, soft shadow between him and thelight, which gilded her figure and quarter profile. Did she expect him?he wondered. Was she posing at that instant for his benefit? And theanswer, could he have searched her secret brain, was, Yes--yes, if theconscious and the subconscious mind are to be considered as oneresponsible intelligence. He usually came at that hour. But he had notcome last night. They had not met since Bouchard's ghost hunt.There was no firing near by; only desultory artillery practice in thedistance. She heard the familiar crunch of five against three on thegravel. She knew that he had stopped at the turn of the path, and shewas certain that he was looking at her! But she did not make theslightest movement. The golden light continued to caress her profile.Then, crunch, crunch, rather slowly, the five against three drew nearer.The delay had been welcome; it had been to her a moment's respite to gether breath before entering the lists. When she turned, her face in theshadow, the glow of the sunset seemed to remain in her eyes, otherwisewithout expression, yet able to detect something unusual under externalsas they exchanged commonplaces of greeting."Well, there's a change in our official family. We have lostBouchard--transferred to another post!" said Westerling.Marta noted that, though he gave the news a casual turn, his scrutinysharpened."Is that so? I can't say that my mother and I shall be sorry," sheremarked. "He was always glaring at us as if he wished us out of hissight. Indeed, if he had his way, I think he would have made usprisoners of war. Wasn't he a woman-hater?" she concluded, half inirritation, half in amusement."He had that reputation," said Westerling. "What do you think led to hisdeparture?" he continued."I confess I cannot guess!" said Marta, with a look at the sunset glowas if she resented the loss of a minute of it."There has been a leak of information to the Browns!" he announced."There has! And he was intelligence officer, wasn't he?" she asked,turning to Westerling, her curiosity apparently roused as a matter ofcourtesy to his own interest in the subject."Who do you think he accused? Why, _you_," he added, with a peculiarlaugh.She noted the peculiarity of the laugh discriminatingly."Oh!" Her eyes opened wide in wonder--only wonder, at first. Then, ascomprehension took the place of wonder, they grew sympathetic. "Thatexplains!" she exclaimed. "His hateful glances were those of delusion.He was going mad, you mean?""Yes," said Westerling, "that--that would explain it!""I have been told that when people go mad they always ascribe everyinjury done to them to the person who happens to have excited theirdislike," she mused."Which seems to have been the case here," Westerling assented. He didnot know what else to say."It was the strain of war, wasn't it?" Marta proceeded thoughtfully. "Inotice that all the staff-officers are showing it; that is," she addedon second thought, quite literally, as she regarded him for an instantof silence, "all except you. You remain the same, calm and decisive."There she looked away with a flutter of her lashes, as if she wereshamed at having allowed herself to be caught in open admiration of him."Look! The last effulgence of rose!" she went on hurriedly about thesunset. "Why shouldn't we think of the sky as heaven, as Nirvana? Whatbetter immortality than to be absorbed into that?""None!" he agreed, but he was looking at her rather than at the sky. Hispride was recovering its natural confidence in the infallibility of hisjudgment of human beings. He was seeing his suspicions as ridiculousenough to convict him of a brain as disordered as Bouchard's.Marta was thinking that she had been skating on very thin ice and thatshe must go on skating till she broke through. There was an exhilarationabout it that she could not resist: the exhilaration of risk and thecontrol of her faculties, prompted by a purpose hypnotically compelling.Both were silent, she watching the sky, he in anticipation and suspense.The rose went violet and the shadows over the range deepened."The guns and the troops wait. With darkness the music begins!" he saidslowly, with a sort of stern fervor."The music--the music! He calls it music!" ran through Marta's mindmockingly, but she did not open her lips."According to my plan--and your plan!" he added."My plan--my plan!" she thought. Her plan that was to send men into ashambles!"They wait, ready, every detail arranged," he continued proudly.The violet melted into an inky blue; silence, vast, heavy,prevailed--silence where the millions lay on their arms. Even the gunsin the distance had ceased their echoing rumble. He felt the power ofher presence and of the moment. It was she who had given the informationthat had enabled him to confound the scepticism of the staff by the easytaking of Bordir. Through her he might repeat Bordir in a larger way atEngadir, proving his theories of frontal attack. His courage ofinitiative would shine out against the background of his staff'sscepticism as a light to the world's imagination. The first great man inforty years; the genius of the new system of tactics to meet the demandsof a new age as Napoleon had met those of his, Grant of his, and VonMoltke of his! Engadir taken, and his place on Valhalla would be secure.The very silence with its taut expectancy was of his planning. Alonewith her he waited for the thunders of his planning that were to breakit. The sky merged into the shadows of the landscape that spread andthickened into blackness. Out of the drawn curtains of night broke anugly flash and farther up the slope spread the explosive circle of lightof a bursting shell."The signal!" he exclaimed.Right and left the blasts spread along the Gray lines and right andleft, on the instant, the Browns sent their blasts in reply. Countlesstongues of flame seemed to burst from countless craters, and the rangeto rock in a torment of crashes. In the intervening space between theugly, savage gusts from the Gray gun mouths, which sent their shellsfrom the midst of exploding Brown shells, swept the beams of the Brownsearch-lights, their rays lost like sunlight in the vortex of an openfurnace door."Splendid! splendid!" exclaimed Westerling, in a sweep of emotion at thesight that had been born of his command. "Five thousand guns on ourside alone! The world has never seen the equal of this!""Five thousand guns!" Marta was thinking. What wouldn't their cost havebought in books, in gardens, and in playgrounds! Every shot the price ofa year's schooling for a child!"You see, we are pounding them along the whole frontier quiteimpartially, so they shall not know where we are going to press home theattack!" he continued."But they do know! I've told them!" shot the burning arrow of mockerythrough Marta's brain."Their search-lights are watching for the infantry--and we shall pressthe infantry forward, too," he added; "everywhere we make a show offight!"Then it occurred vividly to her, as a sudden discovery in the midst ofthe blinding display, that this was not a kind of chaos like that of thebeginning of the world, not nature's own elemental debauch, but menfiring guns and men waiting for the charge under that spray ofdeath-dealing missiles."Splendid! splendid!" he repeated.Marta looked away from the range to his face, very distinct in thegarish illumination. It was the face of a maestro of war seeing all hisrehearsals and all his labors come true in symphonic gratification tothe eye and ear; the face of a man of trained mind, the product ofcivilization, with the elation of a party leader on the floor of aparliament in a crisis."Soon, now!" said Westerling, and looked at his watch.Shortly, in the direction of Engadir, to the rear of the steady flashesbroke forth line after line of flashes as the long-range batteries,which so far had been silent, joined their mightier voices to thechorus, making a continuous leaping burst of explosions over the Brownpositions, which were the real object of the attack."The moment I've lived for!" exclaimed Westerling. "Our infantry isstarting up the apron of Engadir! We held back the fire of the heavyguns concentrated for the purpose of supporting the men with anoutburst. Three hundred heavy guns pouring in their shells on a space oftwo acres! We're tearing their redoubts to pieces! They can't see tofire! They can't live under it! They're in the crater of a volcano! Whenour infantry is on the edge of the wreckage the guns cease. Our infantrycrowd in--crowd into the house that Partow built. He'll find thatnumbers count; that the power of modern gun-fire will open the way forinfantry in masses to take and hold vital tactical positions!And--no--no, their fire in reply is not as strong as I expected.""Because they are letting you in! It will be strong enough in dueseason!" thought Marta in the uncontrollable triumph of antagonism. Fiveagainst three was in his tone and in every line of his features."It's hard for a soldier to leave a sight like this, but the real newswill be awaiting me at my desk," he concluded, adding, as he turnedaway: "It's fireworks worth seeing, and if you remain here I will returnto tell you the results."She had no thought of going. That arc of dreadful lightnings held herwith ghastly fascination. Suddenly all the guns ceased. Faintly in thedistance she heard a tumult of human voices in the high notes of asavage cheer; the rattling din of rifles; the purring of automatics; andthen, except for the firefly flashes of scattered shots around Engadir,silence and darkness. But she knew that chaos would soon be loosedagain--chaos and murder, which were the product of her own chicanery.The Grays would find themselves in the trap of Partow's and Lanny'splanning.Turning her back to the range for the moment, she saw the twinkle of thelights of the town and the threads of light of the wagon-trains and thesweep of the lights of the railroad trains on the plain; while in theforeground every window of the house was ablaze, like some factory on abusy night shift. She could hear the click of the telegraph instrumentsalready reporting the details of the action as cheerfully asBrobdingnagian crickets in their peaceful surroundings. Then out of theshadows Westerling reappeared."The apron of Engadir is ours!" he called. "Thanks to you!" he addedwith pointed emphasis. Back in the house he had received congratulationswith a nod, as if success were a matter of course. Before her,exultation unbent stiffness, and he was hoarsely triumphant and eager."It's plain sailing now," he went on. "A break in the main line! We haveonly to drive home the wedge, and then--and then!" he concluded.She felt him close, his breath on her cheek."Peace!" she hastened to say, drawing back instinctively.And then! The irony of the words in the light of her knowledge waspointed by a terrific renewal of the thunders and the flashes far up onthe range, and she could not resist rejoicing in her heart."That's the Browns!" exclaimed Westerling in surprise.The volume of fire increased. With the rest of the frontier in darkness,the Engadir section was an isolated blaze. In its light she saw hisfeatures, without alarm but hardening in dogged intensity."They've awakened to what they have lost! They have been rushing upreserves and are making a counter-attack. We must hold what we havegained, no matter what the cost!"His last sentence was spoken over his shoulder as he started for thehouse.Thus more fire called for more fire; more murder for more murder, shethought. Her mind was projected into the thick of the battle. She saw apanic of Grays caught in their triumph; of wounded men writhing andcrawling over their dead comrades, their position shown to the marksmenby a search-light's glare. The dead grew thicker; their glassy eyes werestaring at her in reproach. She heard the hoarse and straining voicesof the Browns in their "God with us!" through the din of automatics. Mensnuggled for cover amidst torn flesh and red-tinged mud in the trenches,and other men trampled them in fiendish risk of life to take more lives.Without changing her position, hardly turning her head, she watcheduntil the firing began to lessen rapidly. Then she breathed, "Engadirmust be ours again!" and realized that she was weak and faint. Suspensehad sapped her strength. She sought a seat in the arbor, where thenervous force of other thoughts revived her. What would Westerling saywhen he found that her information had led his men into a trap--whenstaff scepticism was proven right and he a false prophet?From the house came the confused sound of voices in puzzling chorus. Itwas not a cheer. It had the quality of a rapid fire of jubilantexclamation as a piece of news was passed from lip to lip. Then sheheard that step which she knew so well. Sensitive ears noted that ittouched the gravel with unusual energy and quickness, which she thoughtmust be due to vexation over the repulse. She rose to face him,summoning back the spirit of the actress."This is better yet! I came to tell you that the counter-attack failed!"he said as he saw her appear from the shelter of the arbor.She wondered if she were going to fall. But the post of the trellis waswithin reach. She caught hold of it to steady herself. Failed! All heracting had served only to make such a trap for the Browns as Lanny hadplanned for the Grays! She was grateful for the darkness that hid herface, which was incapable of any expression now but blank despair.Westerling's figure loomed very large to her as she regained herself-possession--large, dominant, unconquerable in the suggestion offive against three. And felicitations were due! She drew away from thepost, swaying and trembling, nerves and body not yet under command ofmind. She could not force her tongue to so false a sentiment ascongratulation."The killing--it must have been terrible!" her mind at last made herexclaim to cover her tardiness of response to his mood."You thought of that--as you should--as I do!" he said.He took her hands in his, pulsing warm with the flowing red of hisstrength. She let them remain lifelessly, as if she had not the will totake them away, the instinct of her part again dominant. To him this wasanother victory, and it was discovery--the discovery of melting weaknessin her for the first time, which magnified his sense of masculine power.He tightened his grip slightly and she shuddered."You are tired!" he said, and it hurt her that he could be soconsiderate."The killing--to end that! It's that I want!" she breathed miserably."And the end is near!" he said. "Yes, now, thanks to you!"Thanks to her! And she must listen and submit to his touch!"The engineers and material were ready to go in," he continued. "Beforemorning, as I had planned, we shall be so well fortified in the positionthat nothing can budge us. This success so strengthens my power with thestaff and the premier that I need not wait on Fabian tactics. I amsupreme. I shall make the most of the demoralization of this blow to theenemy. I shall not wait on slow approaches in the hope of saving life.To-morrow I shall attack and keep on attacking till all the main line isours.""Now you are playing your real part, the conqueror!" she thought gladly."Your kind of peace is the ruin of another people; the peace of ahelpless enemy. That is better"--better for her conscience. Unwittingly,she allowed her hands to remain in his. In the paralysis of despair shewas unconscious that she had hands. She felt that she could endureanything to retrieve the error into which she had been the means ofleading the Browns. And the killing--it would not stop, she knew. No,the Browns would not yield until they were decimated."We have the numbers to spare. Numbers shall press home--home to termsin their capital!" Westerling's voice grew husky as he proceeded, harshas orders to soldiers who hesitated in face of fire. "After that--afterthat"--the tone changed from harshness to desire, which was still thedesire of possession--"the fruits of peace, a triumph that I want you toshare!" He was drawing her toward him with an impulse of the force ofthis desire, when she broke free with an abrupt, struggling pull."Not that! Not that! Your work is not yet done!" she cried.He made a move as if to persist, then fell back with a gesture ofunderstanding."Right! Hold me to it!" he exclaimed resolutely. "Hold me to thebargain! So a woman worth while should hold a man worth while.""Yes!" she managed to say, and turned to go in a sudden impetus ofenergy. His egoism might ascribe her precipitancy to a fear ofsuccumbing to the tenderness which he thought that she felt for him,when her one wish was to be free of him; her one rallying andtempestuous purpose of the moment to reach the telephone.Mrs. Galland and Minna saw her ghostlike as she passed through theliving-room, their startled questions unheeded. Could it be true thatshe had betrayed every decent attribute of a woman in vain? Why had thecounter-attack failed? Because Westerling had been too strong, tooclever, for old Partow? Because God was still with the heaviestbattalions? Half running, half stumbling, the light of the lanternbobbing and trembling weirdly, she hastened through the tunnel. Usuallythe time from taking the receiver down till Lanny replied was only ahalf minute. Now she waited what seemed many minutes without response.Had the connection been broken? To make sure that her impatience was nottricking her she began to count off the seconds. Then she heardLanstron's voice, broken and hoarse:"Marta, Marta, he is dead! Partow is dead!"Recovering himself, Lanstron told the story of Partow's going, which wasin keeping with his life and his prayers. As the doctor put it, thelight of his mind, turned on full voltage to the last, went out withouta flicker. Through the day he had attended to the dispositions forreceiving the Grays' attack, enlivening routine as usual with flashes ofhumor and reflection ranging beyond the details in hand. An hour or sobefore dark he had reached across the table and laid his big, soft palmon the back of Lanstron's hand. He was thinking aloud, a habit of his,in Lanstron's company, when an idea requiring gestation came to him."My boy, it is not fatal if we lose the apron of Engadir. The defencesbehind it are very strong.""No, not fatal," Lanstron agreed. "But it's very important.""And Westerling will think it fatal. Yes, I understand his character.Yes--yes; and if our counter-attack should fail, then Miss Galland'sposition would be secure. Hm-m-m--those whom the gods woulddestroy--hm-m-m. Westerling will be convinced that repeated,overwhelming attacks will gain our main line. Instead of usingengineering approaches, he will throw his battalions, masses uponmasses, against our works until his strength is spent. It would bebaiting the bull. A risk--a risk--but, my boy, I am going to--"Partow's head, which was bent in thought, dropped with a jerk. Aconvulsion shook him and he fell forward onto the map, his brave oldheart in its last flutter, and Lanstron was alone in the silent roomwith the dead and his responsibility."The order that I knew he was about to speak, Marta, I gave for him,"Lanstron concluded. "It seemed to me an inspiration--his lastinspiration--to make the counter-attack a feint.""And you're acting chief of staff, Lanny? You against Westerling?""Yes."XLWITH FRACASSE'S MENWe have heard nothing of Jacob Pilzer, the butcher's son, and Peterkin,the valet's son, and others of Fracasse's company of the 128th of theGrays since Hugo Mallin threw down his rifle when they were firing onscattered Brown soldiers in retreat.It was in one of the minor actions of the step-by-step advance after thetaking of the Galland house that the judge's son received officialnotice of a holiday in the form of a nickel pellet from the Browns whichmade a clean, straight hole the size of a lead pencil through his fleshand then went singing on its way without deflection, as if it liked togive respites from travail to tired soldiers."Grazed the ribs--no arteries!" remarked the examining surgeon. "You'llbe well in a month.""We'll hold the war for you!" called the banker's son cheerily after thestill figure on the stretcher."And you'll get gruel and custards, maybe," said the barber's son. "Ilike custards."Once the judge's son had thought that nothing could be so grand as to bewounded fighting for one's country. He had in mind then, as the objectof his boyish admiration, a young officer returned from a littlecampaign against the blacks in Africa, when, the casualties being fewand the scene distant and picturesque, all heroes with scars had anaspect of romantic exclusiveness. But there was no more distinction nowin being wounded than in catching cold. Truly, colonial wars were theonly satisfactory kind.The judge's son found himself one of many men on cots in long rows inthe former barracks of the Browns near La Tir. Daily bulletins told thepatients the names of the positions taken and daily they heard of freshbatches of wounded arriving, which were not mentioned on thebulletin-board."We continue to win," said the doctors and nurses invariably in answerto all questions. "General Westerling announces that everything is goingas planned.""You must know that speech well!" observed the judge's son to the nurseof his section.Her lips twitched in a kind of smile."Letter-perfect!" she replied "It's official."In two weeks, so fast had the puncture from the aseptic little pellet ofcivilized warfare healed under civilization's medical treatment, thejudge's son was up and about, though very weak. But the rules strictlyconfined his promenades to the barracks yard. There might be news comingdown the traffic-gorged castle road out of the region where the gunssounded that convalescents were not intended to hear. For news couldtravel in other ways than by bulletin-boards; and the judge's son,merely watching the faces of medical officers, guessed that it wasdepressing. But after the first attack on Engadir their faces lighted.The very thrill of victory seemed to be in the air."It's in the main line of defence!" called the doctor on his morningrounds of the cots. "They've made Westerling a field-marshal. He'soutwitted the Browns! In a few days now we'll have the range!"How staggering was the cost he was not to realize till later, when theambulance stewards kept repeating:"More to come!"A newcomer, who took the place of a man who had died on the cot next tothe judge's son, had been in the fight. He was still ether-sick and weakfrom the amputation of his right arm, with a dazed, glassy, and far-awaylook in his eyes, as if everything in the world was strange anduncertain."The fearful flashes--the explosions--the gusts of steel in the air!"he whispered.The next night Westerling followed up his supposed advantage at Engadiras he had planned, and there was no sleep for the thunders and the lightof the explosions through the barracks-room windows."I can see what is happening and feel--and feel!" said the man who hadbeen at Engadir.In the morning the bulletin announced that more positions were taken,with very heavy losses--to the enemy. But the news that travelledunofficially from tongue to tongue down the castle road and spoke in thefaces of doctors and nurses said, "And to us!" plainly enough, even ifthe judge's son had not heard a doctor remark:"It's awful--inconceivable! Not a hospital tent in this division isunoccupied. Most of the houses in town are full, and we're preparing foranother grand attack!"Now for two days the guns kept up their roar."Making ready for the infantry to go in," ran the talk around thebarracks yard.After the infantry had gone in and the result was known, the doctor onhis morning round said to the judge's son:"You're pretty pale yet, but you'll do. We must make room for a bigcrowd that is coming and the orders are to get every man who is in anycondition to fight to the front.""And if I get another hole in me you'll patch me up again?""Get any number and we'll patch you up if they're in the right place,"was the answer. "But be careful about that detail."Soon the judge's son was with a score of convalescents who were marcheddown to the town, where they formed in column with other detachments."Not with that cough!" exclaimed a doctor as they were about to start,ordering a man out of line. "You'd never get to the front. You'd onlyhave to be brought back in an ambulance."An enlightening march this for the judge's son from hospital totrenches, moving with a tide of loaded commissariat wagons and emptyambulances and passing a tide of loaded ambulances and emptycommissariat wagons. A like scene was on every road to the front; a likescene on every vista of landscape along any part of the frontier. Alltrees and bushes and walls and buildings that would give cover to theenemy the Browns had razed. On every point of rising ground were thetrenches and redoubts that the Browns had yielded after their purpose ofmaking the Grays earn their way by trenches of their own had beenserved. The fields were trampled by the feet of infantry, cut by gunwheels, ploughed by shells, and sown with the conical nickel pelletsfrom rifles and the round lead bullets of shrapnel. An escarpment ofrock, where the road-bed was slashed into a hillside in a sharp turn,struck by the concentrated fire of automatics, appeared to have beenbeaten by thousands of sharp-headed hammers, leaving a pile of chips anddust.The traffic of the main roads spread into branch roads which ended inthe ganglia of supply depots, all kept in touch by the network of wiresfocussing through different headquarters to Westerling. In thisconquered territory with its face of desolation there were no fightingmen except reserves or convalescents on their way to the front. All therest were wounded or dead or occupied in the routine of supply andintelligence. The organization which had been drilled through twogenerations of peace for this emergency exhibited the signs of pressure.Eyes that met when commands were given and received were dull from wantof sleep or hectically bright as a hypochondriac's. Voices spoke in agrim, tired monotone, broken by sudden flashes of irritation oreruptions of anger. Features were drawn like those of rowers against atide. The very proportions of the ghastly harvest after the last, theheaviest of all, of the attacks brought spasms of nausea to men alreadyhardened to blood and death. If the officers of the staffs in theirofficial conspiracy of silence would not talk, the privates and thewounded would. The judge's son, observing, listening, thinking, wasgathering a story to tell his comrades of Company B of the 128th.That night he and his comrade convalescents slept in the open. Theirbodies were huddled close together under their blankets for warmth,while aching limbs twitched from the fatigue of the march. The morningshowed that others had coughs which should have kept them from thefront."Four or five cases of pneumonia due in that lot!" a doctor remarked toa hospital-corps sergeant. "Put them in empties right away."After this announcement other coughs developed. Amusing, these sudden,purposeful efforts should one happen to think of them in that way. Butno one did."No you don't, you malingerers!" said the doctor sharply. "I've been atthis business long enough to know a real cough."Now the judge's son and a dozen others were separated from the rest oftheir companions and started over a hill. From the top they had a broadview. Across a strip of valley lay the main rise to the heights of therange. Along the summit nothing warlike was visible except the irregularlandscape against the horizon. There the enemy rested in hisfortifications. The slopes, as far as the judge's son could see oneither hand, were like the warrens of an overpopulated rabbit world inhiding. Here was the army of the Grays in its redoubts and trenches Athousand times as many men as were ever at work on the Panama Canal hadbeen digging their way forward--digging regardless of union hours;digging to save their own lives and to take lives. And the nearer theycame to the top of the range the deeper they had to dig and the slowertheir progress.As the little group of convalescents descended into a valley a burstingshell from the Browns scattered its fragments over the earth near by."They drop one occasionally, though they don't expect to get more than aman or two by chance, which is hardly worth the cost of the charge,"some one explained. "You see that they must know just what our positionsare from their understanding of our army's organization, and the purposeis to bother us about bringing up supplies and reserves. Start acommissariat train or a company in close order across, and--whew! Theair screams!"Once on the other side of the valley, and the maze of zigzags andparallels leading into the warrens was simplified by signs indicatingthe location of regiments. At length the judge's son found himself inthe home cave of his own tribe. His comrades were resting at thenoon-hour, their backs against the wall of their shell-proof. In thefaint light their faces were as gray as the dust on the dirty uniformsthat hung on their gaunt bodies. Dust was caked in the seams aroundtheir eyes; their cheeks were covered with dusty beards. Their greetingof the returned absentee was that of men who had passed through a strainthat left existence untouched by the spring of average sensations."Did you get the custards?" asked the barber's son in a squeaky voice."No, but I got a jelly once--only once!""Snob!" said the barber's son."Jelly! I could eat a hogshead of jelly and still be empty! What I wantis fresh meat!" growled Pilzer, the butcher's son."A hogshead of jelly might be good to bathe in!" said the banker's son."I haven't had a bath for a month.""I have. I turned my underclothes inside out!" said the barber's son. Hewas aiming to take Hugo's place as humorist, in the confidence of onesprung from a talkative family.Scanning the faces, the judge's son found many new ones--those of theolder reservists--while many of the faces of barrack days were missing."Whom have we lost?" he asked.The answer, given with dull matter-of-factness, revealed that, of thegroup that had talked so light-heartedly of war six weeks before, onlylittle Peterkin, the valet's son, and Pilzer, the butcher's son, and thebarber's and the banker's sons survived. They were sitting in a row,from the instinct that makes old associates keep together even thoughthey continually quarrel. The striking thing was that Peterkin lookedthe most cheerful and well-kept of the four. As the proud possessor of apair of scissors, he had trimmed a surprisingly heavy beard Van Dyckfashion, which emphasized his peaked features and a certainconsciousness of superiority; while the barber's son sported only a fewscraggly hairs. The scant, reddish product of Pilzer's cheeks, leavingbare the liver patch, only accentuated its repulsiveness and a savageryin his voice and look which was no longer latent under the conventionaldiscipline of every-day existence. The company had not been in the firstEngadir assault, but, being near the Engadir position, had sufferedheavily in support."You were in the big attack night before last?" asked the judge's son."We started in," said Peterkin, "but Captain Fracasse brought us back,"he added in a way that implied that only orders had kept him from goingon.Peterkin, the trembling little Peterkin of the baptismal charge acrossthe line of white posts, had been the first out of the redoubt on to theglacis in that abortive effort, living up to the bronze cross on hisbreast. He was one of the half dozen out of the score that had startedto return alive. The psychology of war had transformed his gallantry; ithad passed from simulation to reality, thanks to his establishedconviction that he led a charmed life. Little Peterkin, always pale butnever getting paler, was ready to lead any forlorn hope. A superstitiousnature, which, at the outset of the war, had convinced him that he mustbe killed in the first charge, now, as the result of his survival, gavehim all the faith of Eugene Aronson that the bullet would never be madethat could kill him."Was the attack general all along the front?" some one asked. "Wecouldn't tell. All we knew was the hell around us.""Yes," answered the judge's son."Did we accomplish anything?""A few minor positions, I believe.""But we will win!" said Peterkin. "The colonel said so.""And the news--what is the news?" demanded the barber's son. "Youneedn't be afraid," he added. "The officers are on the other side of theredoubt. They get sick of the sight of us and we of them and this istheir recess and ours from the eternal digging.""Yes, the news from home!""Yes, from home! We don't even get letters any more. They've shut offall the mails.""I met a man from our town," said the judge's son. "He said that afterthat story was published in the press about Hugo's damning patriotismand hurrahing for the Browns--it was fearfully exaggerated--his oldfather and mother shut themselves up in the house and would not showtheir faces for shame. But his sweetheart, however much her parentsstormed, refused to renounce him. She held her head high and said thatthe more they abused him the more she loved him, and she knew he coulddo nothing wrong.""Hugo was not a patriot. It takes red blood to make a patriot!" saidPeterkin. In the pride of heroism and prestige, he was becoming anoracular enunciator of commonplaces from the lips of his superiors."The absence of any word from the front only increases the suspense ofthe people. They do not know whether their sons and brothers andhusbands are living or dead," continued the judge's son."Up to a week ago they let us write," said Pilzer, "though they wouldn'tlet us say anything except that we were well.""That was because it might give information to the enemy," saidPeterkin."As if I didn't know that!" grumbled Pilzer. "The enemy seems to bealways ready for us, anyway," he added."The chief of staff stopped the letters because he said that mothers whoreceived none took it for granted that their sons were dead," explainedthe judge's son. "Besides, he asserts that casualties are not heavy andasks for patience in the name of patriotism.""The--!" exclaimed Pilzer, referring to Westerling. He who had set outto be an officers' favorite had become bitter against all officers, highand low.Peterkin was speechlessly aghast. The others said nothing. They wereused to Pilzer's oaths and obscenity, with a growing inclination toprofanity on their own part. Besides, they rather agreed with his viewof the chief of staff."Did you see many dead and wounded?" asked a very tired voice, that ofone of the older reservists who was emaciated, with a complexion likeblue mould."How can I tell you what I saw? Ought I to tell you?""When you've had to wipe a piece of brains out of your eye, as Ihave--it was warm and jelly-like," said Pilzer, "you ain't as squeamishas Hugo Mallin. I wonder they don't give him a bronze cross!""Bronze crosses are given for bravery in action," said Peterkin in hisnew-fashioned parrot way since he had become great. "You should not doanything to affect the spirit of corps.""The boy wonder from the butler's pantry! Our dear, natty littlebuttons! Bullets glide off him!" snarled Pilzer, who had set out to wina bronze cross, only to see it won by a pygmy."Did you see many dead and wounded?" persisted the very tired voice ofthe old reservist."Yes, yes--and every kind of destruction!" answered the judge's son."And--I kept thinking of Hugo Mallin.""I'm glad they didn't shoot Hugo," said the very tired voice. "I'm sorryfor his old father and mother. I'm a father myself.""I certainly had a good farewell kick at him!" declared Pilzer. "Lean onyourself!" he added, giving a shove to the old reservist who was nexthim."I saw men who had ceased to be human. That reminds me, Pilzer," thejudge's son went on, "I saw one wounded man, lying beside another, turnand strike him, and he said: 'I had to hit somebody or something!' And Iheard a wounded man who was waiting in line before the surgeon's tablesay: 'There's others hurt worse than me. I can wait.' I heard menbegging the doctors to put them out of their misery. I saw two dead menwith their hands clasped as they were when they died. Then there werethe men who went mad. One had to be held by force. He kept crying withdemoniacal laughs: 'I want to go back and kill--kill! Let's all kill,kill, kill!' Another insisted on dancing, despite a bandaged leg. 'Look,look at the little red spots!' he was saying. 'You must step on oneevery time; if you don't, the automatic will get you!' Another declaredthat he had been through hell and insisted that he would live forevernow. Another was an artist, a landscape-painter, who had lost hiseyesight. He was seeing beautiful landscapes, and the nurses had tostrap him to his cot to keep him from struggling to his feet and tryingto use an imaginary brush on imaginary canvases. He died seeingbeautiful landscapes."A pretty dreary sight, too, was the field of the dead, as I called it.As the bodies were brought in they were laid in long rows, until therewas no more room without moving a supply depot. So there was nothing todo but begin to pile them two deep. A service-corps man took off eachman's metal identification tag and tossed it into an ammunition box. Onebox was already full and a second half full. Chink-chink-chink--tags ofthe rich man's son and the poor man's son, the doctor of philosophy andthe illiterate; chink-chink-chink--a life each time. They'll take thetags to the staff office and tired clerks will find the names that gowith the numbers.""You cannot make an omelet without breaking eggs," said Peterkin,quoting high authority. "Some have to be killed.""The last I heard from home my wife and one of the children were sickand my employer had gone bankrupt," broke in the very tired voice ratherirrelevantly."Yes, my father's last letter was pretty blue about business," said thebanker's son. He was looking at his dirty hands. The odor of clothesunlaundered for weeks, in which the men had slept, tortured hissensitive nostrils. "A millionaire and filthy as swine in a sty!" heexclaimed. "Digging like a navvy in order to get admission to theabattoir!""Were there any reserves coming our way?" asked the barber's son."Yes, masses.""Perhaps they will relieve us and we'll go into the reserves for awhile," suggested the very tired voice."No fear!" growled Pilzer."They have called out the old men, the fellows of forty-five to fifty,who were supposed to be out of it for good," said the judge's son."Westerling says they are to guard prisoners and property when we crossthe range and start on the march to the Browns' capital. Then all theother men can be on the firing-line and force the war to a mercifullyquick end with a minimum loss. I saw numbers of them just arriving at LaTir, footsore and limping.""I know. Mine's been indoor work, making paints," said the very tiredvoice. "When you've had long hours in the shop and had to sit up latewith sick babies, you aren't fit for marching. And I think I've gotlead-poisoning.""Whew!" The judge's son put his hand over his nose as a breeze sprang upfrom the direction of the Brown lines."I thought we got them all," said the barber's son."Must have missed one that was buried by a shell and another shell musthave dug him up!" muttered Pilzer, glaring at the barber's son. "It'snot nice on people with ladylike nostrils. James, get the _eau decologne_ and draw his bath for our plutocrat!""You see, something had to be done about the dead between the redoubts,"explained the barber's son, "though the officers on both sides wereagainst it.""Naturally. It afforded opportunities for observation," put in Peterkin,repeating the colonel's words."But finally it was agreed to let a dozen from either side go outwithout arms," the barber's son concluded."I heard there was great complaint from the women," went on the judge'sson. "Women aren't like what they were in the last war. They want toknow what has become of their men-folk. They have been gathering incrowds and making trouble for the police. One of the old reservists wastelling me of talk of an army of women marching to the front to learnthe truth of the situation.""If you don't stop leaning on me I'll give you a punch you'll remember!"exclaimed Pilzer as he rammed his elbow into the old reservist's ribs."I beg pardon! It was because I am tired and sort of blank-minded," theold reservist explained."You brute!" snapped the banker's son to Pilzer."Mallin thrashed you once and I've done it once. On my word, I've amind to again!""No, you don't! No, you can't! And this time your boxing tricks will doyou no good. I'll finish you!"The two had sprung to their feet with hectic energy: Pilzer's liverpatch a mottled purple in the midst of his curly red beard, his headlowered in front of his short, thick neck as before a spring, and thebanker's son, lighter and quicker, awaiting the attack. Some of theothers half rose, while the rest looked on in curiosity mixed withindifference."I'll call the captain!" piped Peterkin.The judge's son stopped Peterkin and put a hand on either of theadversaries' shoulders."Can't we get enough fighting from the Browns without fighting eachother?" he asked.The banker's son and Pilzer dropped back in their places, in thereaction of men who had spent their strength in defiance."The thick of it last night, I heard, was still at Engadir, whereWesterling is determined to break through," the judge's son proceeded."At one point they sent in a regiment with a regiment covering it fromthe rear, and the fellows ahead were told that they wouldn't be allowedto come back alive--just what occurred at Port Arthur, you know--so theyhad better take the position.""What happened?" asked the very tired voice."Those who reached the enemy's works alive were taken prisoner."Further talk was interrupted by a volume of voices singing, which seemedto issue from a cellar not far away. It had the swell of a hymn ofresolute purpose."The Browns' song--something new since you were with us," explained thebarber's son to the judge's son."Yes, their whole line sung it in the silence of dawn following lastnight's repulse," said the banker's son. "Notice the hammer beat to itand then the earth rumble, like pounding nails in a coffin box andrattling the earth on top of the box after it is lowered.""Yes, and I get the words," said the judge's son, who knew the languageof the Browns: "'God with us, not to take what is theirs, but to keepwhat is ours! God with us!'""They say some private--Stransky, I believe his name is--composed thewords from a saying of Partow, their chief of staff, and it spread," putin the very tired voice."As it would at a time of high pressure like this, when all humanity'snerves form an electric circuit," said the judge's son. "'God with us!'What a power they put into that!""But God is with us, not with them!" put in Peterkin earnestly. "Let'shave our song to answer them," he added, striking up the tune.So they sung the song they had sung as they started off to the war--asong about camping in the squares of the Browns' capital and dining inthe Browns' government palace; a hurrahing, marchy song, but withoutexactly the snap in keeping with its character."The trouble is that they lie at the mouths of their burrows and get usnaked to their fire," said the banker's son. "We have to take theirpositions--they don't try to take ours.""But we must go on! We can't give up now!" said the barber's son."Yes, we must go on!" agreed some of the others stubbornly."Yes, yes," came faintly from the very tired voice."We shall win! The aggressive always wins!" declared Peterkin.Then the redoubt shook with an explosion and their eyes were blindedwith dust."I thought it was about time!" said the barber's son."Yes, the--!" snarled Pilzer.The shell had struck some distance away from where they sat, and as thedust settled they heard the news of the result:"One fellow had his arm broken and another had his head crushed.""It'll keep us from working on the mine while we mend the breach," saidthe barber's son.While the judge's son was telling the news, the colonel of the 128th andCaptain Fracasse were eating their biscuits together and makingoccasional remarks rather than holding a conversation."Well, Westerling is a field-marshal," said the colonel."Yes, he's got something out of it!""The men seem to be losing their spirit--there's no doubt of it!"exclaimed the colonel, more aloud to himself than to Fracasse, after awhile."No wonder!" replied Fracasse. Martinet though he was, he spoke ingrumbling loyalty to his soldiers. "What kind of spirit is there indoing the work of navvies? Spirit! No soldiers ever fought better--ininvasion, at least. Look at our losses! Spirit! Westerling drives us in.He thinks we can climb Niagara Falls! He--""Stop! You're talking like an anarchist!" snapped the colonel. "How canthe men have spirit when you feel that way?""I shall continue to obey orders and do my duty, sir!" replied Fracasse."And they will, too, or I'll know the reason why."There was a silence, but at length the colonel exploded:"I suppose Westerling knows what he is doing!""Still, we must go on! We must win!""Yes, the offensive always wins in the end. We must go on!""And once we have the range--yes, once we've won one vitalposition--the men will recover their enthusiasm and be crying: 'On tothe capital!'""Right! We were forgetting history. We were forgetting the volatility ofhuman nature."XLIWITH FELLER AND STRANSKYFar up on a peak among the birds and aeroplanes, in a roofed,shell-proof chamber, with a telephone orderly at his side, a powerfulpair of field-glasses and range-finders at his elbow, and a telescopebefore his eye, Gustave Feller, one-time gardener and now acting colonelof artillery, watched the burst of shells over the enemy's lines. Whileother men had grown lean on war, he had taken on enough flesh to fillout the wrinkles around eyes that shone with an artist's enjoyment ofhis work. Down under cover of the ridge were his guns, the keys of theinstrument that he played by calls over the wire. Their barking was asymphony to his ears; errors of orchestration were errors in aim. Hetalked as he watched, his lively features reflective of his impressions."Oh, pretty! Right into their tummies! Right in the nose! La, la, la!But that's off--and so's that! Tell Battery C they're fifty yards over.Oh, beady-eyed gods and shiny little fishes--two smacks in the samespot! Humph! Tell Battery C that the trouble with that gun is wornrifling; that's why it's going short. Elevate it for another hundredyards--but it ought not to wear out so soon. I'd like to kick the makeror the inspector. The fellows in B 21 will accuse us of inattention.It's time to drop a shell on them to show we're perfectly impartial inour favors. La, la, la! Oh, what a pretty smack! Congratulations!"B 21 was the position of Fracasse's company and the pretty smack theone that broke one man's arm and crushed another's head.       *       *       *       *       *The "God with us!" song was singularly suited to the great, bull voiceof its composer, born to the red and become Captain Stransky in the redbusiness of war. It was he who led the thunder of its verses not farfrom where Peterkin led the song of the Grays."I certainly like that song," said Stransky. Well he might. It had madehim famous throughout the nation. "There's Jehovah and brimstone in it.Now we'll have our own.""Our own" was also of Stransky's composition and about Dellarme; forStransky, child of the highways and byways, of dark, tragic alleys andsunny fields, had music in him, the music of the people. The skin on hishigh cheek-bones was drawn tighter than before, further exaggerating thesize of his nose, and the deeper set of his eyes gave their cross a moremarked character. He carried on the spirit of Dellarme in the company inhis own fashion. The survivors among his men were as lean and dirty asFracasse's, but, never having expected to reach the enemy's capital, warhad brought few illusions. They had known sleepless vigils, but not muchdigging since they had fallen back on the main line into thefortifications which, with all resources at command, the engineers hadbuilt before the war. And the Browns still held the range! The principalfortifications of Engadir and every other vital point of the main linewas theirs. All that the enemy had gained in his latest attack were afew minor positions."But we're always losing positions!" complained one of the men. "Littleby little they are getting possession.""They say the offensive always wins," said another."Five against three! They count on numbers," said Lieutenant TomFragini."There you go, Tom! Any other pessimists or anarchists want to beheard?" called out Stransky. "Just how long, at the present rate, willit take them to get the whole range? There's a limit to the number ofeven five millions.""Yes, but if they ever break through in one place and get their gunsup--""As you've said before, Tom!""As we want to keep saying--as we want to keep fighting our damnedest tomake sure they won't," Tom explained."Yes, that's it!" declared a chorus."That's it, no matter what we pay!" declared Stransky. "We're not goingback there except in hearses!" He swung his hand in a semicircle towardthe distant hills, gold and purple in their dying foliage under theautumn sunlight.Then the telephone in the redoubt brought some news. The staff begged toinform the army that the enemy's casualties in the last three days hadbeen two hundred thousand! Immediately everybody was talking at once inStransky's parliament, as he sometimes called that company of which hewas, in the final analysis, unlimited monarch."How do they know?""Do you think it's fake?""That sums up to pretty near a million!""My God! Think of it--a million!""We're whittling them down!""It doesn't make any difference whether Partow or Lanstron is chief ofstaff!""They're paying!""Paying for our fellows that they've killed! Paying for being in thewrong!""Let's have the song again! Come on!""Yes, the song! The song!""No; hold on!" cried Tom. "Not because men are killed!""That's right, that's right!" said Stransky. "After all, they're ourbrothers." It was the first time since he had undergone thetransformation which the war had wrought in him that he had mentionedany of his world-brotherhood ideas. "I still believe in that. We'refighting for that!" he concluded.With the ready change of subject of soldiers who have been long incompany, they were soon talking about other things--things thatconcerned the living."Say, wouldn't I like a real bath--an altogether!""And plenty of soap all over!""A welter of lather from head to foot and blowing bubbles from betweenmy lips!""And to shave off this beard!""Think of the beards that are going when the war is over!""Not if you can't grow any more than John!""I'm not fighting out of ambush like you!" replied John. "I haven't gota place for the birds to nest!""I'm going to trim mine down gradually," said another; "first animperial and mustache with mutton choppers; then mow my cheeks; then agreat, sweeping mustache; then a dandy little mustache; then--""Mow is the word! Don't inflict a barber!""And, after the bath, clean underclothes, and, oh, me!--a home dinner!""Stop with your home dinners! That's barred. Army biscuits!""Yes, we all prefer army biscuits!""We wouldn't touch a home dinner!"Stransky, his eyes drawing inward in their characteristic slant, waswell pleased with his company, and the scattered exclamatory badinagekept on until it was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. Partow andLanstron, understanding their machine as human in its elements, hadchosen that the army should hear from home."How's this!" exclaimed one man, reading from a newspaper. "They'regoing to put up a statue of Partow in the capital! It's to show him ashe died, dropped forward on the map, and in front of his desk a field ofbayonets. On one face of the base will be his name. Two of the otherfaces will have 'God with us!' and 'Not for theirs, but for ours!' Thelegend on the fourth face the war is to decide.""Victory! Victory!" cried those who had listened to the announcement."My mother says just what yours says, Tom. I needn't come home unless wewin.""The girl I'm going to marry said that, too!""If we go back with the Gray army at our heels we shall strike a worsefire than if we stick!"Stransky was thinking that they had to do more than hold the Grays.Before he should see his girl they had to take back the lost territory.He carried two pictures of Minna in his mind: one when she had struckhim in the face as he had tried to kiss her and the other as he saidgood-by at the kitchen door. There was not much encouragement in either."But when she gets better acquainted with me there's no telling!" hekept thinking. "I was fighting out of cussedness at first. Now I'mfighting for her and to keep what is ours!"XLIITHE RAM"I've learned that the greatest, most desperate attack of all iscoming," Marta told Lanstron. "But I don't know at what point. I seeWesterling only when he comes into the garden, and he does not come sofrequently of late."Very sweet and very harrowing to him was the intimacy of theirconspiracy over that underground wire. With the prolongation of thestrain, he feared for her. He understood how she suffered. Sometimes hefelt that the Marta of their holiday comradeship was dead and it was theimpersonal spirit of a great purpose that brought him information andinspiration. Her voice was taut, without inflection, as if in pain,occasionally breaking into a dry sob, only to become even more tautafter a silence."I don't--I can't urge you to any further sacrifice," Lanstron replied."You have endured enough.""But it will help? It will be of vital service?""Yes, tremendously vital.""I will try to learn more when I see him," she continued. "But it cannotbe done by questioning. A single question might be fatal. The thing mustcome in a burst of confidence. That's the horrible part of it, the--"There was a dry sob over the wire as the voice broke and then went onsteadily: "But I'm game! I'm game!"In the closet off the Galland library, where the long-distance telephonewas installed, Westerling was talking with the premier in the Graycapital."Your total casualties are eight hundred thousand! That is terrific,Westerling!" the premier was saying."Only two hundred thousand of those are dead!" replied Westerling. "Manywith only slight wounds are already returning to the front. Terrific, doyou say? Two hundred thousand in five millions is one man out of everytwenty-five. That wouldn't have worried Frederick the Great or Napoleonmuch. Eight hundred thousand is one out of six. The trouble is that suchvast armies have never been engaged before. You must consider thepercentages, not the totals.""Yet, eight hundred thousand! If the public knew!" exclaimed thepremier."The public does not know!" said Westerling."They guess. They realize that we stopped the soldiers' letters becausethey told bad news. The situation is serious.""Why not give the public something else to think about?" Westerlingdemanded."I've tried. It doesn't work. The murmurs increase. I repeat, my fearsof a rising of the women are well grounded. There is mutiny in the air.I feel it through the columns of the press, though they are censored.I--""Then, soon I'll give the public something to think about, myself!"Westerling broke in. "The dead will be forgotten. The wounded will beproud of their wounds and their fathers and mothers triumphant when ourarmy descends the other side of the range and starts on its march to theBrowns' capital.""But you have not yet taken a single fortress!" persisted the premier."And the Browns report that they have lost only three hundred thousandmen.""Lanstron is lying!" retorted Westerling hotly. "But no matter. We havetaken positions with every attack and kept crowding in closer. I asknothing better than that the Browns remain on the defensive, leavinginitiative to us. We have developed their weak points. The resoluteoffensive always wins. I know where I am going to attack; they do not. Ishall not give them time to reinforce the defence at our chosen point. Ihave still plenty of live soldiers left. I shall go in with men enoughthis time to win and to hold.""The army is yours, Westerling," concluded the premier. "I admire yourstolidity of purpose. You have my confidence. I shall wait and hold thesituation at home the best I can. We go into the hall of fame or intothe gutter together, you and I!"For a while after he had hung up the receiver Westerling's head drooped,his muscles relaxed, giving mind and body a release from tension. Buthis spine was as stiff as ever as he left the closet, and he was evensmiling to give the impression that the news from the capital wasfavorable. When the telegraphers' jaws had dropped as the reports ofcasualties came in, when discouragement lengthened the faces around himand whispered in the very breezes from the fields of the dead, he hadautomatically maintained his confident mien. Any sign of weakening wouldbe ruinous in its effect on his subordinates. The citadel of his egoismmust remain unassailable. He must be the optimist, the front of Jove,for all.When he called his chiefs of divisions it was hardly for a staffcouncil. Stunned by the losses and repulses, loyally industrious, theiropinions unasked, they listened to his whirlwind of orders withoutcomment--all except Turcas."If they are apprised of our plan and are able to concentrate moreartillery than our guns can silence, the losses will be demoralizing,"he observed.Westerling threw up his head, frowning down the objection."Suppose they amount to half the forces that we send in!" he exclaimed."Isn't the position, which means the pass and the range, worth it?""Yes, if we both take and hold it; not if we fail," replied Turcas,quite unaffected by Westerling's manner."Failure is not in my lexicon!" Westerling shot back. "For great gainsthere must be great risks.""We prepare for the movement, Your Excellency," answered Turcas.It was a steel harness of his own will that Westerling wore, withoutadmitting that it galled him, and he laid it off only in Marta'spresence. With her, his growing sense of isolation had the relief ofcompanionship. She became a kind of mirror of his egoism and ambitions.He liked to have her think of him as a great man unruffled among weakermen. In the quiet and seclusion of the garden, involuntarily as one whohas no confidant speaks to himself, reserving fortitude for his partbefore the staff, while she, under the spell of her purpose, silently,with serene and wistfully listening eyes, played hers, he outlined howthe final and telling blow was to be struck."We must and we shall win!" he kept repeating.       *       *       *       *       *Through a rubber disk held to his ear in the closet of his bedroom avoice, tremulous with nervous fatigue, was giving Lanstron news that allhis aircraft and cavalry and spies could not have gained; news worthmore than a score of regiments; news fresh from the lips of the chief ofstaff of the enemy. The attack was to be made at the right of Engadir,its centre breaking from the redoubt manned by Fracasse's men."Marta, you genius!" Lanstron cried. "You are the real general! You--""Not that, please!" she broke in. "I'm as foul and depraved as a dealerin subtle poisons in the Middle Ages! Oh, the shame of it, while I lookinto his eyes and feign admiration, feign everything which will draw outhis plans! I can never forget the sight of him as he told me how two orthree or four hundred thousand men were to be crowded into a ram, as hecalled it--a ram of human flesh!--and guns enough in support, he said,to tear any redoubts to pieces; guns enough to make their shells asthick as the bullets from an automatic!""We'll meet ram with ram! We'll have some guns, too!" exclaimedLanstron. "We'll send as heavy a shell fire at their infantry as theysend into our redoubts.""Yes; oh, yes!" she replied. "Westerling couldn't say it any better!What difference is there between you? Each at his desk is saying: 'Thisregiment will die here; that regiment will die there!' I bring you wordof one human ram going to destruction in order that you may send anotherto destroy and be destroyed! And I'm worse than you. I am the go-betweenin the conspiracy of universal murder, sleeping in a good bed everynight, in no danger--when I can sleep; but I can't. I go mad fromthinking of my part, keying myself up deliriously to each fresh deceit!"With every sentence her voice broke and it seemed that she would not beable to utter another. Yet she kept on in the alternation of taut,pitiful monotone and dry, coughing sobs."How have I ever been able to go as far as I have? How did I get throughthis last scene? When it seems as if I were about to collapse, somethingsupports me. When the thing grows too horrible and I am about to cry outto Westerling that I am false, I hear his boast that he made the war asa last step in his ambition. And there is Dellarme's smile rising beforeme. He died so finely in defence of our garden! When my brain goes numband I can't think what to say, can't act, Feller appears, prompting withready word and facile change of expression, and I have my wits again. Igo on! I go on!"A racking sob, now, and silence; then, in the sudden effort of one whomust change the subject to hold his sanity, she asked:"How is Feller? Is he doing well?""Yes.""At least I have brought him happiness. Sometimes I think that is aboutall the good I have accomplished--I, his successor in carrying out yourplans! Oh, I'm burned out, Lanny! I'm ashes. It doesn't seem that I canever be sane or clean and human again. In order to forget I should haveto find a new life, like Feller. Each morning when I look in the mirrorI expect to see my hair turned white, like his."Lanstron felt her suffering as if it were his own. He had let hispatriotic passion overwhelm every other consideration. He had allowedher to be a spy; he had sacrificed her sensibilities along with thebattalions he had sent into battle. She was right: he was only theinhuman head of a machine. And she and Feller--they were human. Destinyplaying in the crux of war's inconsistencies had formed a bond betweenthem."But, go on, Lanny. Play your part as you see it--as Westerling sees hisand Feller his and I mine," she said. "That is the only logic clear tome; only I can't play any more. I haven't the strength.""Yes, I shall go on, Marta," he replied, "but you must not. Your work isover, and perhaps this last service may bring a quick end and savecountless lives.""Don't. It's too like Westerling! It has become too trite!" sheprotested. "The end! If I really were helping toward that and to savelives and our country to its people, what would my private feelingsmatter' My honor, my soul--what would anything matter? For that, anysacrifice. I'm only one human being--a weak, lunatic sort of one, justnow!""Marta, don't suffer so! You are overwrought. You--""I can say all that for you, Lanny," she interrupted with the faintestlaugh. "I've said it so many times to myself. Perhaps when I call you upagain I shall not be so hysterical. Tell Feller how I have played hispart, and, in the midst of all your responsibilities, remember to givehim a chance."Lanstron was not thinking of war or war's combination when he hung upthe receiver."Yes, it is Gustave!" he thought. "I understand!" It was some momentsbefore he returned to the staff room, and then he had mastered hisemotion. He was the soldier again.       *       *       *       *       *"They are clearing the wires for the chief of staff to speak to you,sir," announced the telephone aide in Feller's eyrie artillery lookout.Feller received the word with his clucking "La, la, la!" and hummed atune while the connection was being made. He had not spoken with Lannysince his own promotion to a colonelcy and Partow's death."My ear-drums split for joy at hearing your voice again!" Feller cried."A regiment of guns for yours truly! You've made me the happiest man inthe world. And haven't I smacked the Grays in the tummy, not to mentionin the nose and on the shins! Well, I should say so! La, la, la!""You certainly have, you bully old boy!" said Lanstron. "Miss Gallandsends her congratulations and regards.""Eh, what? Her regards to me! The telephone still continues to work? Ourown original trunk-tunnel private line? Eh? Tell me; tell me, quick!""Yes, she has performed the greatest service of the war--better than youcould have done it, Gustave!""Whee-ee! Why not? Of course! I'm not surprised. She's the greatestwoman in the world, I tell you, and I know! And she sends her regards toher old gardener? Think of that! If trouble never comes singly, whyshouldn't joys come in a pour? Oh, it she could see me now, so cosey uphere among the birds, chucking shells about as cheerily as if I weretossing roses to the ladies in a ballroom!""She wants you to have every chance," said Lanstron."She asks that for me!"The peculiar intimate fervor of the exclamation sprang from a Feller inan officer's uniform who could now move in Marta's world. Lanstronhurried on to explain the nature of the next attack."If we repulse them we are going to throw in a ram of our own," he said."We're going to take the aggressive for the moment. It is the only surepolicy for successful defence.""Right! Now you're talking. We learned that principle at school, didn'twe?""And that means a bigger chance for you, Gustave. We are bringing upreserve artillery and making new dispositions. I am going to give youcharge of the field-guns. But the chief of artillery will tell you aboutyour work.""This is heaven, Lanny! How am I ever going to--""There, no thanks, Gustave. You are the man. It is a time when onlyefficiency must be considered.""Then I have made good! Then I've been worthy of my opportunity! I'drather be a good gunner than a king. I'll eat this new work and smack mylips for more. Tell Miss Galland that every shell that hits the mark isa thought from the old gardener for her. Six weeks ago trimmingrose-bushes and now--this is life! La, la, la! There's been romance anddestiny in the whole business for us both, Lanny. And you--you areacting chief of staff! I forgot to congratulate you, Your Excellency.Your Excellency! Think of that! But it's no surprise to me. Didn't we goto school together? How could any one ever go to school with me and notbe a great man? And I'm wearing a flower in my buttonhole! La, la, la!"All that night and day before the night set for the attack, while theguns were being emplaced and the infantry formed in a gray carpetbehind the slopes, a chill, misty rain fell, which the devout of theGrays might say proved that God was with them rather than with theBrowns; for it screened their movements from the Brown lookouts. Thejudge's son and Peterkin and others of Fracasse's company had finishedtheir mine; the fuses were laid. There was no dry place for a seat intheir flooded redoubt and they had to stand, eating cold rations andshivering in their filthy, wet clothes. The whole army was drenched; thewhole army shivered.If only the air did not clear when darkness fell! The last thing thestaff of the Grays wanted was to see a star in the sky. Had theybelieved in prayer they would have gone on their knees for a black fog,unaware that all that they would hide had been made known to the Brownsthrough Marta almost from the hour that the preparations for the attackwere begun.With darkness, the rain ceased; but the mist remained a thick mantleover the landscape, impenetrable to the watchful search-lights of theBrowns, which never stopped playing from sunset to dawn. The gray carpetof the reserves that were to form Westerling's ram moved over theslopes, dipping and rising with the convolutions of the earth, with noword spoken except the repeated whispered warnings of silence from theofficers. Sweeping on up toward the redoubts, it found that parallelsand trenches had been filled to give footing for the swifter impulse ofthe tide, once it was started for the heights.A flash from Fracasse's pocket lamp showed faces pasty white and eyes ofstaring glassiness. Fracasse's face and the colonel's were alsowhite--white with the rigidity of carved marble, carved with a set frownof determination. Fracasse was going in with his company and the colonelwith his regiment. It was their duty. Both realized the nature of therisk; and, worse, each knew that the men realized it. In another age,when education was not so common and unthinking, unforeseeing passioncould be aroused in ignorant minds, a stimulant on an empty stomachmight have made them animals, oblivious to danger. They were about tooffer their lives to pave the way for others to reach the works thatnone of them, probably, would ever reach. For the like of this, ingathering the enemy's spears to his breast, a saga had risen around onenational hero. But Fracasse's veterans were only the shivering units ofthe millions; the part of the machine that happened to be the first tostrike another machine in collision. Such was the end of all thetraining, the marching, the drilling in the gallant business of arms,with no more romance or glory than beeves going to the slaughter."You'll be the first out into the glacis, the first into the enemy'sredoubt," said the colonel, forcing a tone of good, old-fashioned"up-guards-and-at-'em" vigor, as he touched the bronze cross onPeterkin's breast with his forefinger.Little Peterkin, always pale but not so pale now as his comrades,flushed at the distinction."Yes, sir!" and he saluted.In his eyes was the exaltation of his simple-minded faith. He did notthink too much. What more could kings and conquerors ask than such asoldier as the valet's son, secure in the belief that his charmed lifewould bring him through the assault unharmed?"My God! I can't!" exclaimed the banker's son. "I've suffered enough.There's life and wealth and all that it gives waiting for me at home!I'm young--I can't!"There was a rustle of bodies in a restless movement of drawn breaths atcommon thought taking form, desperately fraught with alarm to Fracasse."You will!" Fracasse said, thrusting his revolver muzzle against theribs of the banker's son. "If you don't, I'll shoot you dead, or you'llbe trampled to death by the rush from the rear!"The wedge point may not strike back at the hammer that drives it. Closepacked behind Fracasse's company was a seemingly limitless mass ofsoldiery, palpitant with their short breaths, a steamy, sickening odorrising from their water-soaked clothes. Here were men so wet, so tired,so nerve-worn that they did not care when death came; men who wanted tocurse and strike out against their fate; men who wanted to turn inflight, their natural impulse held down by the bonds of discipline andthat pride of fellowship which is shamed to confess to a shiver alongthe spine. Some saw pictures of home, of sweethearts; some saw nothing.Some were in a coma of merciless suspense that grew more and moreunendurable, until it seemed that anything to break it would be welcome.Occasionally came a sob from a man gone hysterical under the strain, amoan of mental misery; and once a laugh, a strange, hiccoughy, deliriouslaugh, a strident attempt at the wit that keeps up courage; and fromPilzer, the butcher's son, a string of oaths mixed with brimstone andobscenity. After each outbreak an automatic, irritable whisper forsilence came from an officer. Legs and arms, bodies and souls and brainsin a nauseating press! Humanity reckoned by the pound, high-priced frombreeding and rearing and training; yet very cheap.Hearts thumped and watches ticked off the time, until suddenly theheavens were racked by the prologue of the guns. Child's play thatbaptism of shell fire in the first charge of the war beside laterthunders; and these, in turn, mild beside this terrific outburst, withall the artillery concentrated to support the ram in a sudden blast. Thepassing projectiles formed the continuous scream and roar of somemany-toned siren that penetrated the flesh as well as the ears with itssound. Orders could not have been heard if given. There was no need fororders. Fracasse, counting off the minutes between him and eternity onhis watch face by his flash-light, saw that ten had passed. Then hisfinger that pressed a button, his brain that spoke to his hand, werethose of an automaton acting by time release. He exploded the mine. Thiswas the signal for the charge; for all the legs of the ram to move.XLIIIJOVE'S ISOLATIONAn hour or so before the attack the telegraph instruments in the Gallandhouse had become pregnantly silent. There were no more orders to give;no more reports to come from the troops in position until the assaultwas made. Officers of supply ceased to transmit routine matters over thewire, while they strained their eyes toward the range. Officers of thestaff moved about restlessly, glancing at their watches and going to thewindows frequently to see if the mist still held.No one entered the library where Westerling was seated alone withnothing to do. His suspense was that of the mothers who longed for newsof their sons at the front; his helplessness that of a man in a hospitallobby waiting on the result of an operation whose success or failurewill save or wreck his career. The physical desire of movement, theconflict with something in his own mind, drove him out of doors."I want to blow my lungs in the fresh air! Call me if I am needed. Ishall be in the garden," he told his aide; and he thought that his voicesounded calm and natural, as became Jove in a crisis that unnervedlesser men. "Though I fancy it is the other chief of staff who will havethe work to do this evening, eh?" he added, forcing one of the smileswhich had been the magnetic servant of his personal force in his rise topower."Yes, Your Excellency," said the aide.Westerling was rather pleased with the fact that he could still smile;pleased with the loyalty of this young officer when, day by day, therest of the staff had grown colder and more mechanical in the attitudethat completed his isolation. Walking vigorously along the path towardthe tower, the exercise of his muscles, the feel of the cool, moist airon his face, brought back some of the buoyancy of spirit that he craved.A woman's figure, with a cape thrown over the shoulders and the headbare, loomed out of the mist."I couldn't stay in--not to-night," Marta said, as Westerling drew near."I had to see. It's only a quarter of an hour now, isn't it?""The Browns may sing 'God with us,' but He seems to have been with theGrays," Westerling answered. "Our whole movement was perfectly screenedby the heavy weather.""But they know--they know every detail that you have told me!" ran hermocking, scarifying thought. "And this will be the most terrible attackof all?" she asked faintly."Yes, such a concentration of men and guns as never were driven againstany position--an irresistible force," he said. "Irresistible!" herepeated with a heavy emphasis."But if the Browns did know where you were going to attack?" she askedabsently and still more faintly. "The sacrifice of lives then would beall the greater?""Yes, we should have to pay a higher price, but still we should beirresistible--irresistible!" he answered.Ghastly faces were staring at her, their lips moving in death toexcoriate her. It was not too late to tell him the truth; not too lateto stop the attack. Her head had sunk; she trembled and swayed and akind of moan escaped her. She seemed utterly frail and so distraughtthat Westerling, in an impulse of protection, laid his hands on herrelaxed shoulders. She could feel the pressure of each finger growingfirmer in its power, while a certain eloquence possessed him in defianceof his apprehensions."Our cause is at stake to-night," he declared, "yours and mine! We mustwin, you and I! It is our destiny!""You and I!" repeated Marta. "Why you and I?"It seemed very strange to be thinking of any two persons when hundredsof thousands were awaiting the signal for the death prepared by him. Hemistook the character of her thought in the obsession of his egoism."What do lives mean?" he cried with a sudden desperation, his grip ofher shoulders tightening. "It is the law of nature for man to fight.Unless he fights he goes to seed. One trouble with our army is that itwas soft from the want of war. It is the law of nature for the fittestto survive! Other sons will be born to take the place of those who dieto-night. There will be all the more room for those who live. Victorywill create new opportunities. What is a million out of the billions onthe face of the earth? Those who lead alone count--those who dwell inthe atmosphere of the peaks, as we do!" The pressure of his strong handsin the unconscious emphasis of his passion became painful; but she didnot protest or try to draw away, thinking of his hold in no personalsense but as a part of his self-revelation. "All--all is at stakethere!" he continued, staring toward the range. "It's the Rubicon! Ihave put my career on to-night's cast! Victory means that the world willbe at our feet--honor, position, power greater than that of any othertwo human beings! Do you realize what that means--the honor and thepower that will be ours? I shall have directed the greatest army theworld has ever known to victory!""And defeat means--what does defeat mean?" she asked narrowly, calmly;and the pointed question released her shoulders from the vise.What had been a shadow in his thoughts became a live monster, strikinghim with the force of a blow. He forgot Marta. Yes, what would defeatmean to _him_? Sheer human nature broke through the bonds of mentaldiscipline weakened by sleepless nights. Convulsively his head droppedas he covered his face."Defeat! Fail! That I should fail!" he moaned.Then it was that she saw him in the reality of his littleness, whichshe had divined; this would-be conqueror. She saw him as his intimatesoften see the great man without his front of Jove. Don't we know thatNapoleon had moments of privacy when he whined and threatened suicide?She wondered if Lanny, too, were like that--if it were not the nature ofall conquerors who could not have their way. It seemed to her thatWesterling was beneath the humblest private in his army--beneath eventhat fellow with the liver patch on his cheek who had broken thechandelier in the sport of brutal passion. All sense of her own part wassubmerged in the sight of a chief of staff exhibiting no more stoicismthan a petulant, spoiled schoolboy.While his head was still bent the artillery began its crashing thundersand the sky became light with flashes. His hands stretched out towardthe range, clenched and pulsing with defiance and command."Go in! Go in, as I told you!" he cried. "Stay in, alive or dead! Staytill I tell you to come out! Stay! I can't do any more! You must do itnow!""Then this may be truly the end," thought Marta, "if the assault fails."And silently she prayed that it would fail; while the flashes lightedWesterling's set features, imploring success.No commander was a more prodigal employer of spies than Napoleon. Did heor any other conqueror ever acknowledge a success due to the despisedoutcasts who brought him information? No. The brilliance ofcombinations, the stroke of genius of the swift march and the decisiveblow in flank, the splendid charges--these always win in the historian'snarrative and public imagination. Think of any place in the frieze ofthe statue of the great leader for that hypocrite, that poor devil indisguise, whose news made the victory possible!"Good generalship is easy if you know what the enemy is going to do,"Lanstron remarked to a member of the staff council who said somethingcomplimentary to him. Compliments from subordinates to superiors had notreceived Partow's favor and, therefore, not Lanstron's. Eccentric oldPartow had once disparaged the Napoleonic idea as a fetich which hadnothing to do with modern military efficiency, and he had added that ifNapoleon were alive to-day nobody would be so prompt to see it asNapoleon himself. If he did not, and tried to incarnate the idea of thetime by making himself the supreme genius of war, he would fail, becauseability was too nearly universal and the age too big for anotherColossus.Through Marta's information every detail of Westerling's plan outlineditself to the trained minds of the Brown staff. Amazement at theirdependence on an underground wire and a woman's word for shaping vastaffairs was not reflected in any scepticism or hesitation as to themethod of meeting the assault.The fortifications that had sheltered the Brown infantry, includingStransky's men of the 53d, would be the object of the artillery firewhich was to support the Gray charge. Well Lanstron knew that nofortifications could withstand the gusts of shells to be concentrated onsuch a small target. The defenders could not see to fire for the dust.Their rifles would be knocked out of their hands by the concussions.They must be crushed or imprisoned by the destruction of the very wallsthat had been their protection. So they were withdrawn to other redoubtsin the rear, where a line of automatics placed under their rifles werein pointblank range of their old position which the Grays' shells wouldtear to pieces.Back of them was a brown carpet of waiting soldiery of as close a pileas Westerling's carpet of gray. The rain-drenched Brown engineers dug asfast as the enemy's. Lanstron massed artillery against massedartillery. For every Gray gun he had more than one Brown gun. The Graysmight excel by ratio of five to three in human avoirdupois, but awilling Brown government had been generous with funds. Money will buyguns and skill will man them. Battery back of battery in literal tiers,small calibres in front and heavy calibres in the rear, with rangesfixed to given points--more guns than ever fired on a single positionbefore--were to pour their exploding projectiles not into redoubts butinto the human wedge.In the Browns' headquarters, as in the Grays', telegraph instrumentswere silent after the preparations were over. Here, also, officerswalked about restlessly, glancing at their watches. They, too, were gladthat the mist continued. It meant no wind. When the telegraph did speakit was with another message from some aerostatic officer, saying, "Stillfavorable," which was taken at once to Lanstron, who was with the staffchiefs around the big table. They nodded at the news and smiled to oneanother; and some who had been pacing sat down and others rose to beginpacing afresh."We could have emplaced two lines of automatics, one above the other!"exclaimed the chief of artillery."But that would have given too much of a climb for the infantry in goingin--delayed the rush," said Lanstron."If they should stick--if we couldn't drive them back!" exclaimed thevice-chief of staff."I don't think they will!" said Lanstron.To the others he seemed as cool as ever, even when his maimed hand wastwitching in his pocket. But now, suddenly, his eyes starting as at ahorror, he trembled passionately, his head dropping forward, as if hewould collapse."Oh, the murder of it--the murder!" he breathed."But they brought it on! Not for theirs, but for ours!" said thevice-chief of staff, laying his hand on Lanstron's shoulder."And we sit here while they go in!" Lanstron added. "There's a kind ofinjustice about that which I can't get over. Not one of us here has beenunder fire!"Even the minute of the attack they knew; and just before midnight theywere standing at the window looking out into the night, while thevice-chief held his watch in hand. In the hush the faint sound of adirigible's propeller high up in the heavens, muffled by the fog, wasdrowned by the Gray guns opening fire.       *       *       *       *       *Before the mine exploded, by the light of the shell bursts breakingtheir vast prisms from central spheres of flame for miles, with thequick sequence of a moving-picture flicker, Fracasse's men could see oneanother's faces, spectral and stiff and pasty white, with teeth gleamingwhere jaws had dropped, some eyes half closed by the blinding flashesand some opened wide as if the lids were paralyzed. Faces and faces! Asea of faces stretching away down the slope--faces in a trance.Up over the breastworks, over rocks and splintered timbers, Peterkin andthe judge's son and their comrades clambered. When they moved they wereas a myriad-legged creature, brain numbed, without any sensation exceptthat of rapids going over a fall. Those in front could not falter, beingpushed on by the pressure of those in the rear. For a few steps theywere under no fire. The scream of their own shells breaking in infernalpandemonium in front seemed to be a power as irresistible as the rear ofthe wedge in driving them on.Then sounds more hideous than the flight of projectiles broke about themwith the abruptness of lightnings held in the hollow of the Almighty'shand and suddenly released. The Browns' guns had opened fire. Explosionswere even swifter in sequence than the flashes that revealed the starkfaces. Dust and stones and flying fragments of flesh filled the air. Menwent down in positive paralysis of faculties by the terrific crashes.Sections of the ram were blown to pieces by the burst of a shrapnelshoulder high; other sections were lifted heavenward by a shell burst inthe earth.Peterkin fell with a piece of jagged steel embedded in his brain. He hadgone from the quick to the dead so swiftly that he never knew that hischarm had failed. The same explosion got Fracasse, sword in hand, andanother buried him where he lay. The banker's son went a little farther;the barber's son still farther. Men who were alive hardly realized life,so mixed were life and death. Infernal imagination goes faint; itswildest similes grow feeble and banal before such a consummation ofhell.But the tide keeps on; the torn gaps of the ram are filled by therushing legs from the rear. Officers urge and lead. Such are the orders;such is the duty prescribed; such is human bravery even in these dayswhen life is sweeter to more men in the joys of mind and body than everbefore. Precision, organization, solidarity in this charge such as thedays of the "death-or-glory" boys never knew! Over the bodies ofPeterkin and the barber's and the banker's sons, plunging through shellcraters, stumbling, staggering, cut by swaths and torn by eddies of reddestruction in their ranks, the tide proceeded, until its hosts wereoftener treading on flesh than on soil. And all they knew was to keepon--keep on, bayonet in hand, till they reached the redoubt, and therethey were to stay, alive or dead.In that pulsating, fierce light, while the ground under their feettrembled with the concussions, Westerling's face was as clear to Martaas if he were staring in at a furnace door. The lines of breeding and ofrestrained authority which gave it distinction had faded. It had theeager ferocity of the hunt. His short, tense exclamations explained thestages of progress of the attack as revealed to his sight."It cannot fail! No! Impossible! Look at the speed of our gun-fire! ButI judge that we have not been able to silence as many of their guns aswe ought to--they're using shell into our close order. But all the gunsin creation shall not stop us! I have men enough this time--enough,enough, enough! There! Our shorter-range guns have ceased firing! Thatshows we are in the redoubts. The longer-range guns continue. They arefiring beyond the redoubt against any counter-attack, if the Browns tryto recover what they have lost. But every minute brings anotherbattalion into place. Engineers and guns will follow. The war is as goodas won!"He caught at Marta's hand, but she drew away; and her start of revulsionat his touch was almost coincident with a start on his part for anotherreason. A huge shadow shot at railway-train speed over their heads.Something very like fear flashed into his expression."One of our dirigibles!" he exclaimed. "I confess it came so near thatit gave me a sort of shock, too.""Only a shadow with no death in it," she said. "And there is death inevery flash there on the range. General Westerling, have you ever beenunder fire?" she asked suddenly.He had scarcely heard the question. He took a step forward, with headraised and shading his eyes."Not ours! One of theirs!" he exclaimed. "Theirs--and any number oftheirs!"Driving toward the volcano's centre were many Brown dirigibles, slowingdown as they approached. Greater eruptions than any from shells rosefrom the earth as they passed."So that's what they've had their dirigibles in reserve for--for thelast desperate defence!" he said. "The defence that can never win! Nottheir dirigibles--not any power known to man can stop my men. I havesent in so many that enough must survive. But where are _our_dirigibles? A few are up--why don't they close in? And our guns--whydon't they fire at a target before their eyes as big as a house? Therethey go, and they got one!"--as a circle of flame brighter than theillumination of other explosions broke in the sky. "And one of ours isclosing in! Look, both have blown up as they collided! That shows thattwo can play at the game! But what a swarm they have--more than we knew!Bouchard's intelligence at fault again! However, if they try to stop ourfortifying the redoubt our guns will care for them. That clever trick ofLanstron's may have cost us a few extra casualties, but it will notchange the result. It's time we had details over the wire," heconcluded, turning back to the house rather precipitately. "Then theremay be work for me."       *       *       *       *       *"After hell, more hell, and then still more hell!" was the way thatStransky expressed his thought when the engineers had taken the place ofthe 53d of the Browns in the redoubt. They put their mines andconnections deep enough not to be disturbed by shell fire. After thesurvivors in the van of the Grays' charge, spent of breath, reachedtheir goal and threw themselves down, the earth under them, as the mineexploded, split and heaved heavenward. But those in the rear, slapped inthe face by the concussion, kept on, driven by the pressure of the massat their backs, and, in turn, plunged forward on their stomachs in theseams and furrows of the mine's havoc. The mass thickened as the floodof bodies and legs banked up, in keeping with Westerling's plan to have"enough to hold."Now the automatics and the rifles from the redoubt to which the Brownshad fallen back opened fire. So close together were thesebullet-machines that the orbit of each one's swing made a spray of onlya few yards' breadth over the old redoubt, where the Browns' gun-firehad not for a moment ceased its persistent shelling, with increasinglylarge and solid targets of flesh for their practice. The thing for thesetargets to do, they knew, was to intrench and begin to return theinfantry and automatics' fire. Desperately, with the last effort ofcourage, they rose in the attempt--rose into playing hose streams ofbullets whose close hiss was a steady undertone between shell bursts. Inthe garish, jumping light brave officers impulsively stood up to heartentheir commands in their work, and dropped with half-uttered urgings,threats, and oaths on their lips.The bullets from the automatics missing one mark were certain to findanother, perhaps four or five in a row, such was their velocity andpower of penetration. Where shells made gaps and tore holes in the humanmass, the automatics cut with the regularity of the driven teeth of acomb. The men who escaped all the forms of slaughter and staggered on tothe ruins of the redoubt, pressed their weight on top of those in thecraters or hugged behind the pyramids of debris, and even madebreastworks from the bodies of the dead. The more that banked up, themore fruitless the efforts of the officers to restore order in thefrantic medley of shell screams and explosions at a time when a minuteseemed an age.Meanwhile, between them--this banked-up force at the charge's end--andthe Brown redoubt with its automatics, the Gray gunners were making azone of shell bursts in order to give the soldiers time to make theirhold of the ground they had gained secure. Through this zone Stranskyand his men were to lead the Browns in a counter-attack.At the very height of the Gray charge, when all the reserves were in,dark objects fell out of the heavens, and where they dropped earth andflesh were mingled in the maceration. Like some giant reptile with itsvertebrae breaking, gouged and torn and pinioned, the charge stopped, inwrithing, throbbing confusion. Those on the outer circle of explosionswere thrown against their fellows, who surged back in another directionfrom an explosion in the opposite quarter. From the rear the pressureweakened; the human hammer was no longer driving the ram. Blinded by thelightnings and dust, dizzy from concussions and noise, too blank ofmind to be sane or insane, the atoms of the bulk of the charge innatural instinct turned from their goal and toward the place whence theyhad come, with death from all sides still buffeting them. Staggeringly,at first, they went, for want of initiative in their paralysis; thenrapidly, as the law of self-preservation asserted itself in wildimpulse.As sheep driven over a precipice they had advanced; as men they fled.There was no longer any command, no longer any cohesion, except of legsstruggling in and out over the uneven footing of dead and wounded, whilethey felt another pressure, that of the mass of the Browns in pursuit.Of all those of Fracasse's company whom we know, only the judge's sonand Jacob Pilzer were alive. Stained with blood and dust, his teethshowing in a grimace of mocking hate of all humankind, Pilzer's savageryran free of the restraint of discipline and civilized convention.Striking right and left, he forced his way out of the region of shellfire and still kept on. Clubbing his rifle, he struck down one officerwho tried to detain him; but another officer, quicker than he, put arevolver bullet through his head.       *       *       *       *       *Westerling, who had buried his face in his hands in Marta's presence atthe thought of failure, must keep the pose of his position before thestaff. With chin drawn in and shoulders squared in a sort of petrifiedmilitary habit, he received the feverish news that grew worse with eachbrief bulletin. He, the chief of staff; he, Hedworth Westerling, thesuperman, must be a rock in the flood of alarm. When he heard that hishuman ram was in recoil he declared that the repulse had beenexaggerated--repulses always were. With word that a heavy counter-attackwas turning the retreat into an ungovernable rout, he broke into astorm. He was not beaten; he could not be beaten."Let our guns cut a few swaths in the mob!" he cried. "That will stopthem from running and bring them back to a sense of duty to theircountry."The irritating titter of the bell in the closet off the library onlyincreased his defiance of facts beyond control. He went to the longdistance with a reply to the premier's inquiry ready to his lips."We got into the enemy's works but had to fall back temporarily," hesaid."Temporarily! What do you mean?" demanded the premier."I mean that we have only begun to attack!" declared Westerling. Heliked that sentence. It sounded like the shibboleth of a great leader ina crisis. "I shall assault again to-morrow night.""Then your losses were not heavy?""No, not relatively. To-morrow night we press home the advantage wegained to-night.""But you have been so confident each time. You still think that--""That I mean to win! There is no stopping half-way.""Well, I'll still try to hold the situation here," replied the premier."But keep me informed."Drugged by his desperate stubbornness, Westerling was believing in hisstar again when he returned to the library. All the greater his successfor being won against scepticism and fears! He summoned his chiefs ofdivisions, who came with the news that the Browns had taken the veryredoubt from which the head of the Gray charge had started; but therethey had stopped."Of course! Of course they stopped!" exclaimed Westerling. "They are notmad. A few are not going to throw themselves against superiornumbers--our superior numbers beaten by our own panic! Lanstron is not afool. You'll find the Browns back in their old position, working likebeavers to make new defences in the morning. Meanwhile, we'll get thatmob of ours into shape and find out what made them lose their nerve.To-morrow night we shall have as many more behind them. We are going toattack again!"The staff exchanged glances of amazement, and Turcas, his dry voicecrackling like parchment, exclaimed:"Attack again? At the same point?""Yes--the one place to attack!" said Westerling. "The rest of our linehas abundant reserves; a needless number for anything but the offensive.We'll leave enough to hold and draw off the rest to Engadir at once.""But their dirigibles! A surprising number of them are over our lines,"Bellini, the chief of intelligence, had the temerity to say."You will send our planes and dirigibles to bring down theirs!"Westerling commanded."I have--every last one; but they outnumber us!" persisted Bellini."Even in retreat they can see. The air has cleared so that considerablebodies of troops in motion will be readily discernible from highaltitudes. The reason for our failure last night was that they knew ourplan of attack.""They knew! They knew, after all our precautions! There is still a leak!You--"Westerling raised his clenched hand threateningly at the chief ofintelligence, his cheeks purple with rage, his eyes bloodshot. ButBellini, with his boyish, small face and round head set close to hisshoulders, remained undisturbedly exact."Yes, there is a leak, and from the staff," he answered. "Until I havefound it this army ought to suspend any aggressive--""I was not asking advice!" interrupted Westerling."But, I repeat, the leak is not necessary to disclose this new movementthat you plan. Their air craft will disclose it," Bellini concluded. Hehad done his duty and had nothing more to say."Dirigibles do not win battles!" Westerling announced. "They are won bygetting infantry in possession of positions and holding them. No matterif we don't surprise the enemy. Haven't the Browns held their line withinferior numbers? If they have, we can hold the rest of ours. That givesus overwhelming forces at Engadir.""You take all responsibility?" asked Turcas."I do!" said Westerling firmly. "And we will waste no more time. Thepremier supports me. I have decided. We will set the troops in motion."With fierce energy he set to work detaching units of artillery andinfantry from every part of the line and starting them toward Engadir."This means an improvised organization; it breaks up the machine," saidthe tactical expert to Turcas when they were alone."Yes," replied Turcas. "He wanted no advice from us when he was takingcounsel of desperation. If he succeeds, success will retrieve all therest of his errors. We may have a stroke of luck in our favor."       *       *       *       *       *In the headquarters of the Browns, junior officers and clerks reportedthe words of each bulletin with the relief of men who breathed freelyagain. The chiefs of divisions who were with Lanstron alternately satdown and paced the floor, their restlessness now that of a happiness toodeeply thrilling to be expressed by hilarity. Each fresh detail onlyconfirmed the completeness of the repulse as that memorable night in theaffairs of the two nations slowly wore on. Shortly before three, whenthe firing had died down after the Brown pursuit had stopped, a wirelessfrom a dirigible flying over the frontier came, telling of bodies ofGray troops and guns on the march. Soon planes and other dirigiblesflying over other positions were sending in word of the same tenor. Thechiefs drew around the table and looked into one another's eyes in thesignificance of a common thought."It cannot be a retreat!" said the vice-chief."Hardly. That is inconceivable of Westerling at this time," Lanstronreplied. "The bull charges when wounded. It is clear that he means tomake another attack. These troops on the march across country areisolated from any immediate service."It was Lanstron's way to be suggestive; to let ideas develop in counciland orders follow as out of council."The chance!" exclaimed some one."The chance!" others said in the same breath. "The God-given chance fora quick blow! The chance! We attack! We attack!"It was the most natural conception to a military tactician, though anyman who made it his own might have builded a reputation on it if he knewhow to get the ear of the press. Their faces were close to Lanstron asthey leaned toward him eagerly. He seemed not to see them but to belooking at Partow's chair. In imagination Partow was there in thelife--Partow with the dome forehead, the pendulous cheeks, the shrewd,kindly eyes. A daring risk, this! What would Partow say? Lanstron alwaysasked himself this in a crisis: What would Partow say?"Well, my boy, why are you hesitating?" Partow demanded. "I don't knowthat I'd have taken my long holiday and left you in charge if I'dthought you'd be losing your nerve as you are this minute. Wasn't itpart of my plan--my dream--that plan I gave you to read in the vaults,to strike if a chance, this very chance, were to come? Hurry up! Secondscount!""Yes, a chance to end the killing for good and all!" said Lanstron,coming abruptly out of his silence. "We'll take it and strike hard."The staff bent over the map, Lanstron's finger flying from point topoint, while ready expert answers to his questions were at his elbow andthe wires sang out directions that made a drenched and shiveringsoldiery Who had been yielding and holding and never advancing grow warmwith the thought of springing from the mire of trenches to charge theenemy. And one, Gustave Feller, in command of a brigade offield-guns--the mobile guns that could go forward rumbling to thehorses' trot--saw his dearly beloved batteries swing into a road in themoonlight."La, la, la! The worm will turn!" he clucked. "It's a merry, gamblingold world and I'm right fond of it--so full of the unexpected for theGrays! That lead horse is a little lame, but he'll last the nightthrough. Lots of lame things will! Who knows? Maybe we'll be cleaningthe mud off our boots on the white posts of the frontier to-morrow! Awhole brigade mine! I live! You old brick, Lanny! This time we are goingto spank the enemy on the part of his anatomy where spanks areconventionally given. La, la, la!"       *       *       *       *       *If not his own pain, the moans, the gasps, the appeals for water, theconvulsive shivers from cold, and the demoniacal giggles from a soldiergone insane in medley around him would have kept the judge's son awake.After he had fallen, struck by he knew not what, and consciousness hadreturned, came the surging charge of the Browns in the counter-attack,with throaty cries and threshing tread. He was able to turn over on hisface and cover the back of his head with his hands, as a slightprotection from steps that found footing on his body instead of on theearth. After that he had understood vaguely that a newcomer on the fieldof the fallen needed help with a first aid, and he had found his knifeand slit a sleeve and applied a bandage to check the bleeding of anartery. Before dawn broke the sky was all alight again with afar-reaching gun-fire--that of the Brown advance--throwing the scene ofslaughter into spectral relief, which became more real and terrible inthe undramatic light of day.Thick, ghastly thick, the dead and wounded; and the faces--faces halfburied, faces black with congealed blood, faces staring straight up atthe sky, faces with eyes popping where necks had been twisted! Near bywas the distorted metal work of a dirigible, with the bodies of itscrew burned beyond recognition, and farther away were other dirigiblewrecks. A wounded Gray, who had not the strength to do it himself,begged some one to lift a corpse off his body. A Gray and a Brown werelocked in a wrestling embrace in which a shrapnel burst had surprisedthem. Piles of dead and wounded had been scattered and torn by a shellwhich found only dead and wounded for destruction at the point of itsexplosion. The living were crawling out from under the shields they hadmade of corpses in shell craters, and searching for water in thecanteens and biscuits in the haversacks of the dead. One Gray who wascompletely entombed except his head remarked that he was all right ifsome one would dig him out. At his side showed the legs of a man who hadbeen buried face downward. Ribs of the wounded broken in; features ofthe dead mashed by the heels of the Brown countercharge! With every turnof his glance his surroundings grew more intimate in details of horrorto the judge's son. On the earth, saturated with rivulets and littlelakes of blood, gleamed the lead shrapnel bullets and the brighter,nickelled rifle-bullets and the barrels of rifles dropped from the handsof the fallen."I'd have bled to death if you hadn't put on that bandage. You saved mylife!" whispered the man next to the judge's son, who was Tom Fragini."Did I? Did I?" exclaimed the judge's son. "Well, that's something.""It certainly is to me," replied Tom, holding out his hand, and thusthey shook hands, this Gray and this Brown. "Maybe some time, when thewar's over, I can thank you in more than words.""More than words! Perhaps you can do that now. You--you haven't acigarette, old fellow?" asked the judge's son. "I haven't smoked forthree days.""Yes, only I roll mine," said Tom."So do I mine," said the judge's son."But with a game hand I--""Oh, I've the hands. It's my leg that's been mashed up," said thejudge's son. "Labor and capital!" he added cheerily as he dropped thecosmopolitan tobacco on the cosmopolitan wafer of rice-paper.They smoked and smiled at each other in the glow of that better passionwhen wounds have let out the poison of conflict, while the doctors andthe hospital-corps men began their attention to the critical cases andon down the slopes the mills of war were grinding out more dead andwounded."At the hospital where I was interne before the war we were trying tosave a crippled boy the use of his leg," remarked a reserve surgeon."Half a dozen surgeons held consultations over that boy--yes, just forone leg. And now look at this!"XLIVTURNING THE TABLES"I shall take a little nap. There will be plenty to do later," saidWesterling, after the last telegram detaching the reserves forconcentration had gone.Yes, he would rest while the troops were in motion. The staff should seethat he was still the same self-contained commander whose every facultywas the trained servant of his will. His efforts at sleep resulted in anumbing brain torture, which so desensitized it to outward impressionsthat his faithful personal aide entering the room at dawn had to touchhim on the shoulder to arouse attention."There's nothing like being able to order yourself to sleep, whateverthe crisis," he said. But suddenly he winced as if a blast of bulletshad crashed through a window-pane and buried themselves in the wallbeside his bed. "What is that?" he gasped "What?" With appallingdistinctness he heard a cannonade that seemed as wide-spread as thehorizon."I was to tell you that the enemy has been attacking along the wholefront," the aide explained."Attacking! The Browns attacking!" Westerling exclaimed as he gatheredhis wits. "Well, so much the worse for them. I rather expected theywould," he added.Then through the door which the aide had left open the division chiefs,led by Turcas, filed in. To Westerling they seemed like a procession ofghosts. The features of one were the features of all, graven with theweariness of the machine's treadmill. Their harness held them up. Amoving platform under their feet kept their legs moving. They groupedaround the great man's desk silently, Turcas, his lips a half-openedseam, his voice that of crinkling parchment, acting as spokesman."The enemy seized his advantage," he said, "when he found that ourreserves were on the march, out of touch with the wire to headquarters."Westerling forced a smile which he wanted to be a knowing smile."Exactly! Of course their guns are making a lot of noise," he said. "Itseems strange to you, no doubt, that they and not we should beattacking. Excellent! Let them have a turn at paying the costs of theoffensive. Let them thrash their battalions to pieces. We want themexhausted when we go in to-night.""However, we had not prepared our positions for the defensive,"continued that very literal parchment voice. "They began an assault onour left flank first and we've just had word that they have turned it.""Probably a false report. Probably they have taken an outpost. Order acounter-attack!" exclaimed Westerling."Nor is that the worst of it," said the vice-chief. "They are pressingat other well-chosen points. They threaten to pierce our centre.""Our centre!" gibed Westerling. "You do need rest. Our centre, where wehave the column of last night's attack still concentrated! If anythingwould convince me that I have to fight this war-alone--I--" Westerlingchoked in irritation."Yes. The ground is such that it is a tactically safe and advantageousmove for Lanstron to make. He strikes at the vitals of our machine.""But what about the remainder of the force that made the charge? Whatabout all our guns concentrated in front of Engadir?""I was coming to that. The rout of the assaulting column was much worsethan we had supposed. Those who are strong enough cannot be got toreform. Many were so exhausted that they dropped in their tracks. Ourguns are at this moment in retreat--or being captured by the rush of theBrowns' infantry. Your Excellency, the crisis is sudden, incredible.""Our wire service has broken down. We cannot communicate with many ofour division commanders," put in Bellini, the chief of intelligence."Yes, our organization, so dependent on communication, is in danger ofdisruption," concluded Turcas. "To avoid disorder, we think it best toretreat across the plain to our own range."At the word "retreat" Westerling sprang to his feet, his cheeks purple,the veins of his neck and temples sculptured as he took a threateningstep toward the group, which fell back before the physical rage of theman, all except the vice-chief, his mouth a thin, ashy line, who heldhis own."You cowards!" Westerling thundered. "Retreat when we have five millionsto their three!""We have not that odds now," replied the parchment voice. "All their menare engaged. They have caught us at a disadvantage, unable to use ournumbers except in detail in trying to hold on in face of--""I tell you we cannot retreat!" Westerling interrupted. "That is theend. I know what you do not know. I am in touch with the government.Yes, I know--"This brought fresh alarm into faces which had become set in grimstoicism by many alarms. If the people were in ignorance of the lossesand the army in ignorance of the nation's feeling, the officers of thestaff were no less in ignorance of what passed over the long-distancewire between the chief of staff and the premier."I know what is best--I alone!" Westerling continued, driving home hispoint. "Tell our commanders to hold. Neither general nor man is tobudge. They are to stick to the death. Any one who does not I shallhold up to public shame as a poltroon. Who knows but Lanstron's attackmay be a council of desperation? The Browns may be worse off than weare. Hold, hold! If are are tired, they are tired. Frequently it takesonly an ounce more of resolution to turn the tide of battle. Hold, hold!To-morrow will tell a different story! We are going to win yet! Yes, weare going to win!""It is for you to decide, Your Excellency," said Turcas, slowly andprecisely. "You take the responsibility.""I take the responsibility. I am in command!" replied Westerling inunflinching pose."Yes, Your Excellency."And they filed out of the room, leaving him to his isolation.A little later, when Francois came in unannounced, bringing coffee, hefound his master with face buried in hands. Westerling was on the pointof striking the valet in anger at the discovery, but instead attempted ayawn to deceive him."I fell asleep; there's so little to worry about, Francois," heexplained."Yes, Your Excellency. There is no need of worrying as long as you arein command," said Francois; and Westerling gulped at the coffee andchewed at a piece of roll, which was so dry in his mouth and so hard toswallow that he gave up the attempt.After Marta had learned, over the telephone, from Lanstron of thecertain repulse of the Gray assault, fatigue--sheer physical fatiguesuch as made soldiers drop dead in slumber on the earth, their packsstill on their backs--overcame her. Her work was done. The demands ofnature overwhelmed her faculties. She slept with a nervous twitching ofher muscles, a restless tossing of her lithe body, until hammers beganbeating on her temples, beating, beating with the sound of shellbursts, as if to warn her that punishment for her share in the killingwas to be the eternal concussion of battle in her ears. At length sherealized that the cannonading was real.Hastening out-of-doors, as her glance swept toward the range she sawbursts of shrapnel smoke from the guns of the Browns nearer than sincethe fighting had begun on the main line, and these were directed atbodies of infantry that were in confused retreat down the slopes, whileall traffic on the pass road was moving toward the rear. Impelled by anew apprehension she hurried to the tunnel. Lanstron answered herpromptly in a voice that had a ring of relief and joy in place of thetension that had characterized it since the outbreak of the war."Thanks to you, Marta!" he cried. "Everything goes back to you--thanksto you came this chance to attack, and we are succeeding at every point!You are the general, you the maker of victories!""Yes, the general of still more killing!" she cried in indignation. "Whyhave you gone on with the slaughter? I did not help you for this. Why?"No reply came. She poured out more questions, and still no reply. Shepressed the button and tried again, but she might as well have beentalking over a dead wire.       *       *       *       *       *Though the morning was chill, Mrs. Galland, in a heavy coat, was seatedoutside the tower door, beatifically calm and smiling; for she wouldmiss rejoicing over no detail of the spectacle. The battle's sounds weresweet music--symphony of retribution. Oh, if her husband and her fathercould only be with her to see the ancient enemy in flight! Her cheekswere rosy with the happy thrumming of her heart; a delirious beat was inher temples. She wanted to sing and cheer and give thanks to theAlmighty. The advancing bursts of billowy shrapnel down the slopes werea heavenly nimbus to her eyes. She breathed a silent blessing on amanoeuvring Brown dirigible. They were coming! The soldiers of herpeople were coming to take back their own from the robber hosts andrestore her hearth to her. Soon she would be seated on the verandawatching the folds of her flag floating over La Tir."Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it like some good story?" she said to Marta."Yes, like a miracle--and there has been a Galland in every war of theBrowns and you were in this!"Having no son, she had given her daughter in sacrifice on the altar ofher country's gods, who had answered with victory. Her old-fashionedpatriotism, true to the "all-is-fair-in-war" precept, delighted in thehour of success in every trick of Marta's double-dealing, though inprivate life she could have been guilty of no deceit."Marta, Marta, I shall never tease you again about your advanced ideasor about journeying all the way around the world without a chaperon.Your father and my father would have approved!" She squeezed Marta'shands and pressed them to her cheek. Marta smiled absently."Yes, mother," she said, but in such a fashion that Mrs. Galland wasreminded again that Marta had always been peculiar. Probably it wasbecause she was peculiar that she had been able to outwit the head of anarmy."Oh, that mighty Westerling who was going to conquer the whole world!How does he feel now?" mused Mrs. Galland "Westerling and his boastedpower of five against three!"For the Grays were barbarians to her and the Browns a people of asuperior civilization, a superior aristocracy, a superior professionaland farming and laboring class. There was nothing about the Browns toMrs. Galland that was not superior. War, that ancient popular test ofsuperiority in art, civilization, morals, scholarship, the grace ofwoman and the manliness of man, had proved her point in the high court,permitting of no appeal.One man alone against the tide--rather, the man who has seen a tiderise at his orders now finding all its sweep against him--Westerling,accustomed to have millions of men move at his command, found himself,one man out of the millions, still and helpless while they moved oftheir own impulses.As news of positions lost came in, he could only grimly repeat, "Hold!Tell them to hold!" fruitlessly, like adjurations to the wind to ceaseblowing. The bell of the long distance kept ringing unheeded, until atlast his aide came to say that the premier must speak either to him orto the vice-chief. Westerling staggered to his feet and with lurchingsteps went into the closet. There he sank down on the chair in a heap,staring at the telephone mouthpiece. Again the bell rang. Clenching hishands in a rocking effort, he was able to stiffen his spine once more ashe took down the receiver. To admit defeat to the premier--no, he wasnot ready for that yet."The truth is out!" said the premier without any break in his voice andwith the fatalism of one who never allows himself to blink a fact."Telegraphers at the front who got out of touch with the staff werestill in touch with the capital. Once the reports began to come, theypoured in--decimation of the attacking column, panic and retreat inother portions of the line--chaos!""It's a lie!" Westerling declared vehemently."The news has reached the press," the premier proceeded. "Editions arealready in the streets.""What! Where is your censorship?" gasped Westerling."It is helpless, a straw protesting against a current," the premierreplied. "A censorship goes back to physical force, as every law does inthe end--to the police and the army; and all, these days, finally topublic opinion. After weeks of secrecy, of reported successes, whennobody really knew what was happening, this sudden disillusioningannouncement of the truth has sent the public mad.""It is your business to control the public!" complained Westerling."With what, now? With a speech or a lullaby? As well could you stop theretreat with your naked hands. My business to control the public, yes,but not unless you win victories. I gave you the soldiers. We havenothing but police here, and I tell you that the public is in a mobrage--the whole public, bankers and business and professional menincluded. I have just ordered the stock exchange and all banks closed.""There's a cure for mobs!" cried Westerling. "Let the police fire a fewvolleys and they'll behave.""Would that stop the retreat of the army? We must sue for peace.""Sue for peace! Sue for peace when we have five millions against theirthree!""It seems so, as the three millions are winning!" said the premier."Sue for peace because women go hysterical? Do you suppose that theBrowns will listen now when they think they have the advantage? Leavepeace to me! Give me forty-eight hours more! I have told our troops tohold and they will hold. I don't mistake cowardly telegraphers' rumorsfor facts--""Pardon me a moment," the premier interrupted. "I must answer a localcall." So astute a man of affairs as he knew that Westerling's voice,storming, breaking, tightening with effort at control, confirmed allreports of disaster. "In fact, the crockery is broken--for you and forme!" said the premier when he spoke again. His life had been a gambleand the gamble had turned against him in playing for a great prize.There was an admirable stoicism in the way he announced the news he hadreceived from the local call: "The chief of police calls me up to saythat the uprising is too vast for him to hold. There isn't any mutiny,but his men simply have become a part of public opinion. A mob of womenand children is starting for the palace to ask me what I have done withtheir husbands, brothers, sons, and fathers. They won't have to break into find me. I'm very tired. I'm ready. I shall face them from thebalcony. Yes, Westerling, you and I have achieved a place in history,and they're far more bitter toward you than me. However, you don't haveto come back.""No, I don't have to go back! No, I was not to go back if I failed!"said Westerling dizzily.Again defiance rose strong as the one tangible thought, born of hisruling passion. It was inconceivable that so vast an ambition shouldfail. Failure! He defied it! He burst into the main staff room, wherethe tired officers regarded him with a glare, or momentary, wearywonder, and continued packing up their papers for departure. He went oninto the telegraphers' room. Some of the operators were packing theirinstruments."The news? What is the news?" Westerling asked hoarsely.An operator who was still at the key, without even half rising let alonesaluting, glanced up from the cavernous sockets of eyes unawed by thechief of staff's presence."All that comes in is bad," he said. "Where we get none because thewires are down we know it's worse. We've been licked."He went on sending a message, wholly oblivious of Westerling, whostumbled back into the staff room and paused inarticulate before Turcas."The army is going--resisting by units, but going. It has made its ownorders!" Turcas said. The other division chiefs nodded in agreement."Your Excellency, we are doing our best," added the vice-chief, holdingthe door for Westerling to return to his own office. "The nation is notbeaten. Given breathing time for reorganization, the army will settledown to the defensive on our own range. There the enemy may try ourcostly tactics against the precision and power of modern arms, if theychoose. No, the nation is not beaten."The nation! Westerling was not thinking of the nation."You--" he began, looking around from face to face.Not one showed any sign of softening or deference, and, his mind ablank, he withdrew, driven back to his isolation by an inflexibleostracism. The world had come to an end. Public opinion wasmaster--master of his own staff. He sank down before his desk, staring,just staring; hearing the roar of battle which was drawing nearer;staring at the staff orderlies, who came in to take down the wall maps,and at his aide packing up the papers and leaving him in a room bare ofall the appurtenances of his position, with little idea in his coma ofdespair of the hour or even that time was passing. Finally, some onetouched him on the shoulder. He looked up to see his aide at his elbowsaluting and Francois, his valet, standing by with an overcoat."We must go, Your Excellency," said the aide."Go?" asked Westerling dazedly."Yes, the staff has already gone to a new headquarters."The announcement was the needle prick that once more aroused him to asense of his situation. He rose and struck his fist on the desk in apulsing outbreak of energy and stubbornness."But I stay! I stay!" he cried. "The enemy is not near. He can't be!""Very near, general. You can see for yourself, said the aide."I will!" Westerling replied. "I will see how the conspiracy of thestaff has made ruin of my plans!"Again something of his old manner returned; something of the stoic'sfatalism flashed in his eye. He shook his head to Francois, refusing toslip his arms into the sleeves of the coat which Francois dropped on tohis shoulders."Yes, I will see for myself!" he repeated, as he led the way out to theveranda. "I'll see what goblin scared my pusillanimous staff and robbedme of victory!"       *       *       *       *       *Every cry of triumph in war is paid for by a cry of pain. On one side,anguish of heart; on the other, inexpressible ecstasy. The Gray staffwere oblivious of fatigue in the glum, overpowering necessity ofrestoring the organization of the Gray army for a second stand. TheBrown staff were oblivious of fatigue in the exhilaration of victory.Had a picture of the sight which the judge's son had witnessed at dawnin the path of the attack and the counter-attack been thrown on the wallof the big lobby room of the Brown headquarters, there might have beenless exultation on the part of the junior officers of the staff gatheredthere. They were not seeing or thinking of the dead. They were seeingonly brown-headed pins pushing gray-headed pins out of the way on themap, as the symbol of an attack become a pursuit and of better thantheir dreams come true--the symbol of security for altar fires and raceand nation. They were of the living, in the mightiest thrill that asoldier may know.No doubt now! No more suspense! Labor and sacrifice rewarded! Ferventthanks to the Almighty were mingled with whistled snatches of weddingmarches and popular songs. An aide taking a message to the wirepreferred leaping over a chair to going around it. A subaltern and acolonel danced together. Victory, victory, victory out of the burr ofautomatics, the pounding of artillery, the popping roar of rifles!Victory out of the mire of trenches after brain-aching strain! Victoryfor you and for me and for sweethearts and wives and children! Aren't weall Browns, orderly and captain, boyish lieutenant and gray-hairedgeneral? A taciturn martinet of a major hugged a telegrapher to whom hehad never spoken a single unofficial word. Hadn't the telegraphers,those silent men who were the tongue of the army, received the goodnews and passed it on? Some officers who could be spared from duty wentto their quarters, where they dropped like falling logs on their beds.To them, after their spell of rejoicing, victory meant sleep for thefirst time in weeks without forked lightnings of apprehension stabbingtheir sub-consciousness.Fellowship was in the victory, the fellowship which, developed underPartow, who believed that Napoleons and Colossi and gods in the car andall such gentlemen belonged to an archaic farce-comedy, had grown underLanstron. "The staff reports," began the messages that awakened a world,retiring with the idea that the Browns were grimly holding thedefensive, to the news that three millions had outgeneralled anddefeated five.In the inner room, whose opening door gave glimpses of Lanstron and thedivision chiefs, a magic of secret council which the juniors could notquite understand had wrought the wonder. Lanstron had not forgotten thedead. He could see them; he could see everything that happened. Had notPartow said to him: "Don't just read reports. Visualize men and events.Be the artillery, be the infantry, be the wounded--live and think intheir places. In this way only can you really know your work!"His elation when he saw his plans going right was that of the instrumentof Partow's training and Marta's service. He pressed the hands of themen around him; his voice caught in his gratitude and his breaths werevery short at times, like those of a spent, happy runner at the goal.Feeding on victory and growing greedy of more, his division chiefs werediscussing how to press the war till the Grays sued for peace; and hewas silent in the midst of their talk, which was interrupted by theringing of the tunnel telephone. When he came out of his bedroom,Lanstron's distress was so evident that those who were seated arose andthe others drew near in inquiry and sympathy. It seemed to them that thechief of staff, the head of the machine, who had left the room hadreturned an individual."The connection was broken while we were speaking!" he said blankly."That means it must have been cut by the enemy--that the enemy knows ofits existence!""Perhaps not. Perhaps an accident--a chance shot," said the vice-chief."No, I'm sure not," Lanstron replied. "I am sure that it was cutdeliberately and not by her.""The 53d Regiment is going forward in that direction--the same regimentthat defended the house--and it can't go any faster than it is going,"the vice-chief continued, rather incoherently. He and the others no lessfelt the news as a personal blow. Though absent in person, Marta hadbecome in spirit an intimate of their hopes and councils."She is helpless--in their power!" Lanstron said. "There is no tellingwhat they might do to her in the rage of their discovery. I must go toher! I am going to the front!"The announcement started a storm of protest."But you are the chief of staff! You cannot leave the staff!""You've no right to expose yourself!""A chance shell or bullet--""You do not seem to realize what this victory means to you. You might bekilled at the very moment of triumph.""I haven't had any triumph. But if I had, could there be a better time?"Lanstron asked with a half-bantering smile."You couldn't reach there before the 53d Regiment anyway!" declared thevice-chief, having in mind the fact that the staff was fifteen miles tothe rear, where it could be at the wire focus. "You will find the roadsblocked with the advance. You'll have to ride, you can't go all the wayin a car.""Terrible hardship!" replied Lanstron. "Still, I'm going. Things arewell in hand. I can keep in touch by the wire as I proceed. If I get outof touch then you," with a nod to the vice-chief, "know as well as I howto meet any sudden emergency. Yes, you all know how to act--we're soused to working together. The staff will follow as soon as the Gallandhouse is taken. We shall make our headquarters there. I'm free now. Ican be my own man for a little while--I can be human!"A certain awe of him and of his position, born of the prestige ofvictory, hushed further protest. Who if not he had the right to go wherehe pleased in the Brown lines now? They noted the eagerness in his eyes,the eagerness of one off the leash, shot with a suspense which was notfor the fate of the army, as he left headquarters.       *       *       *       *       *A young officer of the Grays who was with a signal-corps section, tryingto keep a brigade headquarters in touch with the staff during theretreat, two or three miles from the Galland house, had seen what lookedlike an insulated telephone wire at the bottom of a crater in the earthmade by the explosion of a heavy shell. The instructions to allsubordinates from the chief of intelligence to look for the source ofthe leak in information to the Browns made him quick to see a clew inanything unusual. He jumped down into the crater and not only found hispains rewarded, but that the wire was intact and ran underground ineither direction. Who had laid it? Not the Grays. Why was it there? Hecalled for one of his men to bring a buzzer, and it was the work oflittle more than a minute to cut the wire and make an attachment. Thenhe heard a woman's voice talking to "Lanny." Who was Lanny? He waitedtill he had heard enough to know that it was none other than Lanstron,the chief of staff of the Browns, and the woman must be a spy. Anorderly despatched to the chief of intelligence with the news returnedwith the order:"Drop everything and report to me in person at once.""For this I have made my sacrifice!" Marta thought. "The killing goes onby Lanny's orders, not by Westerling's, this time."Leaving her mother to enjoy the prospect, a slow-moving figure,trance-like, she went along the first terrace path to a point near theveranda where the whole sweep of landscape with its panorama of retreatmagnetized her senses. Like the gray of lava, the Gray soldiery waserupting from the range; in columns, still under the control ofofficers, keeping to the defiles; in swarms and batches, under thecontrol of nothing but their own emotions. Mostly they were huggingcover, from instinct if not from direction, but some relied on straightlines of flight and speed of foot for escape. Coursing aeroplanes wereplaying a new part. Their wireless was informing the Brown gunners wherethe masses were thickest. This way and that the Brown artillery firedrove retreating bodies, prodding them in the back with the fearfulshepherdry of their shells. Officers' swords flashed in the faces of thebolters or in holding rear-guards to their work. Officers and orderlieswere galloping hither and thither with messages, in want of wires.Commanders had been told to hold, but how and where to hold? They sawneighboring regiments and brigades going and they had to go. Themachine, the complicated modern war machine, was broken; the machine,with its nerves of intelligence cut, became a thing of disconnectedparts, each part working out its own salvation. Authority ceased to bethat of the bureau and army lists. It was that of units racked byhardship, acting on the hour's demand.Gorged was the pass road, overflowing with the struggling tumult of menand vehicles. Self-preservation breaking the bonds of discipline was inthe ascendant, and it sought the highway, even as water keeps to theriver bed. Like specks on the laboring tide was the white of bandages.An ambulance trying to cut out to one side was overturned. The franticchauffeur and hospital-corps orderly were working to extricate thewounded from their painful position. A gun was overturned against theambulance. A melee of horses and men was forming at the foot of thegarden gate in front of the narrowing bounds of the road into the town,as a stream banks up before a jam of driftwood. The struggle for rightof way became increasingly wild; the dam of men, horses, and wagonsgrew. A Brown dirigible was descending toward the great target; but oncloser view its commander forbore, the humane impulse outweighing thedesire for retribution for colleagues in camp and mess who had gone downin a holocaust in the aerial battles of the night.Thus far the flight had seemed in the face of an unseen pursuer, likethat of an army fleeing from some power visible to itself but not toMarta. Now she began to observe the flashes of rifles from the creststhat the rear-guards of the Grays were deserting; then the rush of theBrown skirmish line to close quarters. Her glance pausing long on nodetail, so active the landscape with its swarms and tumult, returned tothe scene in front of the house. A Gray field-battery, cutting out toone side of the road, knocking over flimsier vehicles and wounded whogot in the way, careening, its drivers cursing and officers shouting,galloped out in the open field and unlimbered to support a regiment ofinfantry that was hastily intrenching as a point to steady theretreating masses on its front and protect them in their flight whenthey had passed.Marta saw how desperately the gunners worked; she could feel theirfatigue. Nature had sunk in her heart a partisanship for the under dog.She who had stood for the three against five, now stood for the shaken,bewildered five in the cockpit under the fire of the three. Hersympathies went out to every beaten, weary Gray soldier. What was thedifference between a Gray and a Brown? Weren't they both made of fleshand bone and blood and nerves?Under the awful spell of the panorama, she did not see Westerling, whohad stopped only a few feet distant with his aide and his valet, nor didhe notice her as the tumult glazed his eyes. He was as an artist wholooks on the ribbons of the canvas of his painting, or the sculptor onthe fragments of his statue. Worse still, with no faith to give himfortitude except the materialistic, he saw the altar of his god ofmilitary efficiency in ruins. He who had not allowed the word retreat toenter his lexicon now saw a rout. He had laughed at reserve armies inlast night's feverish defiance, at Turcas's advocacy of a slower andsurer method of attack. In those hours of smiting at a wall with hisfists and forehead, in denial of all the truth so clear to averagemilitary logic, if he had only given a few conventional directions allthis disorder would have been avoided. His army could have fallen backin orderly fashion to their own range. The machine out of order, he hadattempted no repair; he had allowed it to thrash itself to pieces.The splinters of its debris--steel splinters--were lacerating his brain.He had a sense that madness was coming and some instinct ofself-preservation made the whole scene grow misty, as he tried toresolve it out of existence in the desire for some one object which wasnot his guns and his men in demoralization. A bit of pink caught hiseye--the pink of a dress, a little girl's dress, down there at the edgeof the garden by the road, at the same moment that some guns of theBrowns, in a new position, opened on an inviting target. Over her headwas a crack and a blue tongue of smoke whipped out of nothing; while ashower of shrapnel bullets made spurts of dust around her. She startedto run toward the terrace steps and another burst made her run in theopposite direction, while she looked about in a paralysis of fear andthen threw herself on her face."My God! That little girl--there--there!" Westerling exclaimeddistractedly."Clarissa! Clarissa!" cried Marta, seeing the child for the first time.She started precipitately to the rescue, but a hand on her arm arrestedher and she turned to see Hugo Mallin bound past her down the slope.Still remaining on the premises under guard while Westerling hadneglected to dispose of the case, he had the run of the grounds thatmorning while the staff was feverishly preparing for departure.Marta watched him leaping from terrace to terrace. Before he had reachedClarissa worse than shrapnel bursts happened. The spatter of thefragments and bullets falling on either side of the road whipped theedges of the struggling human jam inward. In the midst of this apercussion shell struck, bursting on contact with the road and spreadingits own grist of death and the stones of the road in a fan-shaped,mowing swath. Legs and bodies were thrown out as if driven centrifugallyby a powerful breath, with Hugo lost in the smoke and dust of theweaving mass. He came out of it bearing Clarissa in his arms, up theterrace steps. To Marta, this was an isolated deed of saving life, ofmercy in the midst of merciless slaughter; a parallel to that ofStransky bringing in Grandfather Fragini pickaback."Big fireworks!" said Clarissa Eileen as Hugo set her down in front ofMarta, whose heart was in her eyes speaking its gratitude.The artillery's maceration of the human jam suddenly ceased; perhapsbecause the gunners had seen the Red Cross flag which a doctor had thepresence of mind to wave. Westerling turned from a sight worse to himthan the killing--that of the flowing retreat along the road pressingfrantically over the dead and wounded in growing disorder for the coverof the town, and found himself face to face with the mask-like featuresof that malingerer who had told him on the veranda that the Grays couldnot win. Gall flooded his brain. In Hugo he recognized something kindredto the spirit that had set his army at flight, something tangible andpersonified; and through a mist of rage he saw Hugo smiling--smiling ashe had at times at the veranda court--and saluting him as a superiorofficer."Now I am going to fight," said Hugo, "if they try to cross the whiteposts; to fight with all the skill and courage I can command. But nottill then. They are still in their own country and we are not in ours.Then they, in the wrong, will attack and we, in the right, willdefend--and, God with us, we shall win."Thus a second time he had given to the prayer of Marta's children thelife of action. She could imagine how steadfastly and exaltedly he wouldface the invader."Thank you, Miss Galland," he said. "And say good-by to your mother andMinna for me."He was gone, without waiting for any reply, this stranger whom her parthad not permitted to know well. A thousand words striving for utterancechoked her as she watched him pass out of sight. Westerling wasregarding her with a stare which fixed itself first on one thing andthen on another in dull misery. Near by were Bellini, the chief ofintelligence, and a subaltern who had arrived only a minute before. Thesubaltern was dust-covered. He seemed to have come in from a hard ride.Both were watching Marta, as if waiting for her to speak. She metWesterling's look steadily, her eyes dark and still and in his thereflection of the vague realization of more than he had guessed in herrelations with Hugo."Well," she breathed to Westerling, "the war goes on!""That's it! That's the voice!" exclaimed the subaltern in an explosionof recognition.A short, sharp laugh of irony broke from Bellini; the laugh of onewhose suspicions are confirmed in the mixture of the sublime and theridiculous. Marta looked around at the interruption, alert, on guard."You seem amused," she remarked curiously."No, but you must have been," replied Bellini hoarsely. "Early thismorning, not far from the castle, this young officer found in the cratermade by a ten-inch shell a wire that ran in a conduit underground. Thewire was intact. He tapped it. He heard a voice thanking some one forher part in the victory, and it seems that the woman's voice thatanswered is yours, Miss Galland. So, General Westerling, the leak ininformation was over this wire from our staff into the Browns'headquarters, as Bouchard believed and as I came to believe."So long had Marta expected this moment of exposure that it brought noshock. Her spirit had undergone many subtle rehearsals for the occasion."Yes, that is true," she heard herself saying, a little distantly, butvery quietly and naturally.Westerling fell back as from a blow in the face. His breath came hard atfirst, like one being strangled. Then it sank deep in his chest and hiseyes were bloodshot, as a bull's in his final effort against thematador. He raised a quivering, clenched fist and took a step nearerher.But far from flinching, Marta seemed to be greeting the blow, as if sheadmitted his right to strike. She was without any sign of triumph andwith every sign of relief. Lying was at an end. She could be truthful."Do you recall what I said in the reception-room at the hotel?" sheasked.The question sent a flash into a hidden chamber of his mind. Now theonly thing he could remember of that interview was the one remark whichhitherto he had never included in his recollection of it."You said I could not win." He drew out the words painfully."And I pleaded with your selfishness--the only appeal to be made toyou," she continued, "to prevent war, which you could have done. Whenyou said that you brought on this war to gratify your ambition, I choseto be one of the weapons of war; I chose, when driven to the wall, to betrue to that part of my children's oath that made an exception of theburglar, the highwayman, and the invader. In war you use deceit andtreachery, under the pleasanter names of tactics and strategy, to drawmen to their death in traps, in order to increase the amount of yourkilling. It was strategy, tactics, manoeuvres--give it any fine wordyou please--that hideous and shameless part which I played. With fire Ifought fire. I fought for civilization, for my home, with the only meansI had against the wickedness of a victory of conquest--the precedent ofit in this age--a victory which should glorify such trickery as youpractised on your people.""I should like to shoot you dead!" cried Bellini."No doubt. I like your honesty in saying so," said Marta. "Why not? Thebusiness of war is murder; and as I have engaged in it I can claim noexception. And why shouldn't women engage in it? Why should they beexcepted from the sport when they pay so many of the costs? It's easy todie and easy to kill. The part you force on women is much harder. Bykilling me you admit me to full equality.""You--you--" But Bellini had no adequate word for her, and his angersoftened into a kind of admiration of her, of envy, perhaps, that he hadhad no such adjutant. It hardened again as he looked Westerling up anddown, before turning to leave without a salute or even a direct word."And you let me make love to you!" Westerling said in a dazed, gropingmonotone to Marta.Such a wreck was he of his former self that she found it amazing thatshe could not pity him. Yet she might have pitied him had he plungedinto the fight; had he tried to rally one of the broken regiments; hadhe been able to forget himself."Rather, you made love to yourself through me," she answered, notharshly, not even emphatically, but merely as a statement of passionlessfact. "If you dared to endure what you ordered others to endure for thesake of your ambition; if--"She was interrupted by a sharp zip in the air. Westerling dodged andlooked about wildly."What is that?" he asked. "What?"Five or six zips followed like a charge of wasps flying at a speed thatmade them invisible. Marta felt a brush of air past her cheek andWesterling went chalky white. It was the first time he had been underfire. But these bullets were only strays. No more came."Come, general, let us be going!" urged the aide, touching his chief onthe arm."Yes, yes!" said Westerling hurriedly.Francois, who had picked up the coat that had fallen from Westerling'sshoulders with his start at the buzzing, held it while his master thrusthis hands through the sleeves."And this is wiser," said the aide, unfastening the detachable insigniaof rank from the shoulders of the greatcoat. "It's wiser, too, that wewalk," he added."Walk? But my car!" exclaimed Westerling petulantly."I'm afraid that the car could not get through the press in the town,"was the reply. "Walking is safer."The absence in him of that quality which is the soldier's real glory,the picture of this deserted leader, this god of a machine who had beencrushed by his machine, his very lack of stoicism or courage--all thissuddenly appealed to Marta's quick sympathies. They had once drunk teatogether."Oh, it was not personal! I did not think of myself as a person or ofyou as one--only of principles and of thousands of others--to end thekilling--to save our country to its people! Oh, I'm sorry and,personally, I'm horrible--horrible!" she called after him in a broken,quavering gust of words which he heard confusedly in tragic mockery.He made no answer; he did not even look around. Head bowed and hardlyseeing the path, he permitted the aide to choose the way, which layacross the boundary of the Galland estate.They had passed the stumps of the linden-trees and were in the vacantlot on the other side, when something white fluttered toward him,rustled by the breeze that carried it, and lay still almost at his feet.He saw his own picture on the front page of a newspaper, with thecaption, "His Excellency, Field-Marshal Hedworth Westerling, Chief ofStaff of Our Victorious Army." He stared at the picture and the picturestared at him as if they knew not each other. A racking shudder sweptthrough him. He turned his face with a kind of resolution, appealing inits starkness, toward the battle and his glance rested on the batteryand the shattered regiment of infantry in the fields opposite theGalland gate, under a canopy of shrapnel smoke, bravely holding theirground."I should be there. That is the place for me!" he exclaimed with a traceof his old forcefulness.The aide's lips parted as if to speak in protest, but they closed insilence, while a glance of deep human understanding, dissolving thebarriers of caste, passed between him and the valet, eloquent of theirapproval and their loyal readiness to share the fate of their fallenchief.The canopy of shrapnel smoke grew thicker; the infantry began to break."But, no!" said Westerling. "The place for a chief of staff is at hisheadquarters."XLVTHE RETREATMarta remained where Westerling had left her, rooted to the ground bythe monstrous spell of the developing panorama of seemingly limitlessmovement. With each passing minute there must be a hundred acts ofheroism which, if isolated in the glare of a day's news, would make thepublic thrill. At the outset of the war she had seen the Browns, as partof a preconceived plan, in cohesive rear-guard resistance, with everydetail of personal bravery a utilized factor of organized purpose. Nowshe saw defence, inchoate and fragmentary, each part acting for itself,all deeds of personal bravery lost in a swirl of disorganization. Thatwas the pity of it, the helplessness of engineers and of levers when themachine was broken; the warning of it to those who undertake warlightly.The Browns' rifle flashes kept on steadily weaving their way down theslopes, their reserves pressing close on the heels of the skirmishers ingreedy swarms. A heavy column of Brown infantry was swinging in towardthe myriad-legged, writhing gray caterpillar on the pass road and manyfield-batteries were trotting along a parallel road. Their plandeveloped suddenly when a swath of gun-fire was laid across the passroad at the mouth of the defile, as much as to say: "Here we make a gateof death!" At the same time the head of the Brown infantry columnflashed its bayonets over the crest of a hill toward the point where theshells were bursting. These men minded not the desperate, scatteredrifle-fire into their ranks. Before their eyes was the prize of a panicthat grew with their approach. Kinks were out of legs stiffened by longwatches. The hot breath of pursuit was in their nostrils, the fever ofvictory in their blood.In the defile, the impulse of one Gray straggler, who shook ahandkerchief aloft in fatalistic submission to the inevitable, becamethe impulse of all. Soon a thousand white signals of surrender wereblossoming. As the firing abruptly ceased, Marta heard the faint roar ofthe mighty huzzas of the hunters over the size of their bag.In the area visible to Marta was the strife of forces larger than thelargest that Napoleon ever led in battle; as large as fought thedecisive battle in the last war of the Grays. But here was only asection of the raging whole from frontier end to frontier end. Theimmensity of it! All the young manhood of a nation employed! Martaceased to see any particular incident of the scene. All was confused ina red mist--red as blood. She, the one being in that landscape who was adetached observer, felt herself condemned to watch the war go onforever.An edge of the curtain of mist lifted. Sight and mind and soulconcentrated on the nearest horror. She saw the whirlpool at the foot ofthe garden, horses and men in a straggle among dead and wounded, whichhad grown fiercer now that the portion of the retreat that had not beencut off in the defile pressed forward the more madly. She had thought ofherself as ashes; as an immovable creature of flayed nerves, incapableof raising her hand to change the march of events. But the misery thatshe saw intimately, almost within stone's throw of her door, broke thespell with its appeal. The hectic energy of battle speeded her steps inthe blessed oblivion of action.Some doctors of different regiments thrown together in the havoc ofremnants of many organizations, with the help of hospital-corps men,were trying to extricate the wounded from among the dead. They heard awoman's voice and saw a woman's face. They did not wonder at herpresence, for there was nothing left in the world for them to wonder at.Had an imp from hell or an angel from heaven appeared, or a shower ofdiamonds fallen from the sky, they would not have been surprised. Theirduty was clear; there was work of their kind to do, endless work. Unitsof the broken machine, in the instinct of their calling they struggledwith the duty nearest at hand."What do you need? What can I do?" Marta asked."Rest, shelter, safety for these poor fellows," answered one of thedoctors."There is the house--our house!" said Marta."My God! Aren't you men?" bellowed an officer. "Get away from the road!Come out here! Form line! You--you; I mean you!""You who can walk--you who aren't hurt, you cowards, give us a hand withthe wounded!" shouted another doctor.The soldiers were deaf to commands, but they heard a feminine voiceabove the oaths and groans and heavy breathing and rustle of pressingbodies and thrusting arms; a feminine voice, clear and steadying in thatorgy of male ferocity. It was like a chemical precipitate clearing muddywater. Their wild glances saw a woman's features in exaltation and inher eyes something as definite as the fire of command. She was shamingthem for their unmanliness; shaming their panic--the foolish panic at atheatre exit--and giving orders as if that were her part and theirs wasto obey; a woman to soldiers, the weak sex to the strong. They did obey,under the spell of the amazing fact of her presence, in the relief ofhaving some simple human purpose to cling to.After the work was begun they needed no urging to carry the wounded upthe terrace steps; and men who had knocked down and trampled on thewounded were gentle with them now, under the guidance of betterimpulses. How could they falter directed by a woman unmindful ofoccasional shells and bullet whistles? They begged her to go back tothe house; this was no place for her.But Marta did not want safety. Danger was sweet; it was expiation. Shewas helping, actually helping; that was enough. She envied the peacefuldead--they had no nightmares--as she aided the doctors in separating thebodies that were still breathing from those that were not; and shesteeled herself against every ghastly sight save one, that of a manlying with his legs pinned under a wagon body. His jaw had been shotaway. Slowly he was bleeding to death, but he did not realize it. Herealized nothing in his delirium except the nature of his wound. He wasdipping his finger in the cavity and, dab by dab, writing "Kill me!" onthe wagon body. It sent reeling waves of red before her eyes. Then ashell burst near her and a doctor cried out:"She's hit!"But Marta did not hear him. She heard only the dreadful crack of thesplitting shrapnel jacket. She had a sense of falling, and that was all.The next that she knew she was in a long chair on the veranda and thevague shadows bending over her gradually identified themselves as hermother and Minna."I remember when you were telling of the last war that you didn't swoonat the sight of the wounded, mother," Marta whispered."But I was not wounded," replied Mrs Galland.Marta ceased to be only a consciousness swimming in a haze. With thereturn of her faculties, she noticed that both her mother and Minna werelooking significantly at her forearm; so she looked at it, too. It wasbandaged."A cut from a shrapnel fragment," said a doctor. "Not deep," he added."Do I get an iron cross?" she asked, smiling faintly. It was ratherpleasant to be alive."All the crosses--iron and bronze and silver and gold!" he replied."You forgot platinum," she said almost playfully, as she found nerves,muscles, and bones intact after that drop over a precipice into a blackchasm. It was like the Marta of the days before she had undertaken toreform all creation, her mother was thinking. "Did I help any?" sheasked seriously."Well, I should say so!" declared the doctor. "I should say so!" herepeated. "You did the whole business down there by the gate.""Yes, the whole business! I brought it all on--all! I--" She flung awild gesture at the landscape and then buried her face in her hands."Yes, I did the whole business I--I played, smiled, lied! That awfulsight--and he might not have been writing 'kill me' if I--"The doctor grasped her shoulders to keep her from rising. He spoke thefirst soothing words that came to mind. There was another shudder, aneffort at control, and her hands dropped and she was looking up with adull steadiness."I'm not going mad!" she exclaimed. "What happened to--to that man whowas pleading for death? Did any one who had been engaged in killing menwho wanted to live kill the one who wanted to die?""The shell burst that wounded you finished him," said the doctor."Which, of course, was quite according to the tenets of civilization,which wouldn't have allowed it to be done as an open act of mercy!" saidMarta. "But that is only satire. It is of no service," she added, risingto a sitting posture to look around.The struggle by the gate was over. All the uninjured had made good theirescape. A Red Cross flag floated above the wounded and the debris ofoverturned wagons. Brown skirmishers were descending the near-by slopesand crossing the path of the cavalry charge. Signal-corps men werespinning out their wires. A regiment of guns were being emplaced behinda foot-hill. A returning Brown dirigible swept over the town. Allfiring except occasional scattered shots had ceased in the immediatevicinity, though in the distance could be heard the snarl of the firmerresistance that the Grays were making at some other point. The Gallandhouse, for the time being, was isolated--in possession of neither side."Isn't there something else I can do to help with the wounded?" Martaasked. She longed for action in order to escape her thoughts."You've had a terrible shock--when you are stronger," said the doctor."When you have had something to eat and drink," observed the practicalMinna authoritatively.Marta would not have the food brought to her. She insisted that she wasstrong enough to accompany Minna to the tower. While Minna urgedmouthfuls down Marta's dry throat as she sat outside the door of thesitting-room with her mother a number of weary, dust-streaked faces,with feverish energy in their eyes, peered over the hedge that boundedthe garden on the side toward the pass. These scout skirmishers ofStransky's men of the 53d Regiment of the Browns made beckoning gesturesas to a crowd, before they sprang over the hedge and ran swiftly,watchfully, toward the linden stumps, closely followed by theircomrades. Soon the whole garden was overrun by the lean, businesslikefellows, their glances all ferret-like to the front."Look, Minna!" exclaimed Marta. "The giant who carried the old man inpickaback the first night of the war!""Yes, the bold impudence of him!" said Minna. "As if there was nothingthat could stand in his way and what he wanted he would have!"But Minna was flushing as she spoke. The flush dissipated and she drewup her chin when Stransky, looking around, recognized her with a merry,confident wave of his hand."See, he's a captain and he wears an iron cross!" said Marta asStransky hastened toward them."He acts like it!" assented Minna grudgingly.Eager, leviathan, his cap doffed with a sweeping gesture as he made alow bow, Stransky was the very spirit of retributive victory returningto claim the ground that he had lost."Well, this is like getting home again!" he cried."So I see!" said Minna equivocally.Stransky drew his eyes together, sighting them on the bridge of his nosethoughtfully at this dubious reception."I came back for the chance to kiss a good woman's hand," he observedwith a profound awkwardness and looking at Minna's hand. "Your hand!" headded, the cast in his eyes straightening as he looked directly at herappealingly.She extended her finger-tips and he pressed his lips to them. Then shedrew back a step, a trifle pale, her eyes sad and questioning, more thanever Madonna-like, and curled her arm around little Clarissa Eileen, whohad stolen to her mother's side."What is that?" asked Clarissa Eileen, pointing to the cross onStransky's breast."That," observed Stransky deliberately, "is a little piece of metal thatI got for an inspiration of manhood. It doesn't cost the price of aday's rations, but it's one of the things which money can't buy--notyet--in this commercial age. One of those institutions of barbarism thatwe anarchists call government gave it to me, and I'll never part withit!""Because he was a brave soldier, Clarissa," explained Marta in simplerterms. "Because he was ready to die for his country.""And for your mother!" put in Stransky, seizing Clarissa in his greathands and lifting her lightly to the level of his face. "Oh, I've gotstories," he said to her, "a soldier-man's stories, to tell you, younglady, one of these days--and such stories!"He crossed his eyes over his big nose in a fashion that made Clarissaclap her hands and burst into a peal of laughter."You're an awfully funny man!" she declared as Stransky set her down."So your mother thinks," said Stransky, blinking at Minna, who hadindulged in a smile which his remark promptly ironed out.This irrepressible soldier, given so much as an inch, would be demandinga province. But erasing a smile is not destroying the fact of it.Stransky took heart for the charge on seeing a breach in the enemy'slines."Yes, I was fighting for you!" he burst out to Minna. "When the otherfellows were reading letters from their sweethearts I was imaginingletters from you. I even wrote out some and posted them from one pocketto another, in place of the regular mails.""What did you say in those letters?" asked Marta."Why, you're big and awkward and cross-eyed, Stransky, but you've a waywith you, and maybe--""Humph!" sniffed Minna."I kept seeing the way you looked when you belted me one in the face,"he went on unabashed to Minna, "and knocked any anarchism out of me thatwas left after the shell burst. I kept seeing your face in my lastglimpse when the Grays made me run for it from your kitchen door beforeI had half a chance for the oration crying for voice. You were in mydreams! You were in battle with me!""This sounds like a disordered mind," observed Minna. "I've heard mentalk that way before.""Oh, I have talked that way to other women myself!" said Stransky."Yes," said Minna bitterly. His candor was rather unexpected."I have talked to others in passing on the high road," he continued."But never after a woman had struck me in the face. That blow sankdeep--deep--deep as what Lanstron said when I revolted on the march. Isay it to you with this"--he touched the cross--"on my breast. And I'mnot going to give you up. It's a big world. There's room in it for aplace for you after the war is over and I'm going to make the place.Yes, I've found myself. I've found how to lead men. My home isn't to bein the hedgerows any more. It's to be where you are. You and I, whomsociety gave a kick, will make society give us a place!" He was eloquentin his strength; eloquent in the fire of resolution blazing from hiseyes. "And I'll be back again," he concluded. "You can't shake me. I'llcamp on your door-step. But now I've got to look after my company.Good-by till I'm back--back to stay! Good-by, little daughter!" he addedwith a wave of his hand to Clarissa as he turned to go. "Maybe we shallhave our own automobile some day. It's no stranger than what's beenhappening to me since the war began.""If you don't marry him, Minna, I'll--I'll--" Mrs. Galland could notfind words for the fearful thing that she would do."Marry him! I have only met him three times for about three minutes eachtime!" protested Minna. She was as rosy as a girl and in her confusionshe busied herself retying the ribbon on Clarissa Eileen's hair. "Hecalled you little daughter!" she said softly to the child as shewithdrew into the tower."I am glad we didn't send Minna away when misfortune befell her," saidMrs. Galland. "You were right about that, Marta, with your new ideas.What a treasure she has been!"Marta was scarcely hearing her mother; certainly not finding any creditfor herself in the remark. She was thinking what a simple, what aglorious thing was a love such as Stransky's and Minna's: the mating ofa man and a woman whose brains were not oversensitized by toocomplicated mentality; of a man and a woman direct and sincere,primarily and clearly a man and a woman. Such happiness could never befor her now; for her who had let a man make love to her for his ownundoing.The skirmishers having halted beyond the linden stumps, the reserveswere stacking their rifles and dropping to rest in the garden. The sightof the uniforms of the deliverers, of her own people, stirred Mrs.Galland to unwonted activity. She moved here and there among them withsmiles of mothering pride. She told them how brave they were; how herhusband had been a colonel of Hussars in the last war. They must betired and hungry. She hurried in to Minna, and together they emptied thelarder of everything, even to the lumps of sugar, which were impartiallybestowed.But Marta remained in the chair by the doorway of the tower, weak andlistless. She was weary of the sight of uniforms and bayonets. In thedreary opaqueness of her mind flickered one tiny, bright light asthrough a blanket; that she herself had been in danger. She had beenunder fire. She had not merely sent men to death; she had been indeath's company.Now her lashes were closed; again they opened slightly as her gaze rovedthe semicircle of the horizon. A mounted officer and his orderlygalloping across the fields to the pass road caught her desultoryattention and held it, for they formed the most impetuous object on thelandscape. When the officer alighted at the foot of the garden andtossed his reins to the orderly, she detected something familiar abouthim. He leaped the garden wall at a bound and, half running, came towardthe tower. Not until he lifted his cap and waved it did she associatethis lithe, dapper artillerist with a stooped old gardener in blueblouse and torn straw hat who had once shuffled among the flowers at herservice."Hello! Hello!" he shouted in clarion greeting at sight of her. "Hello,my successor!"Only in the whiteness of his hair was he like the old Feller. His tone,the boyish sparkle of his black eyes, those full, expressive lipsplaying over the brilliant teeth, his easy grace, his quick and tellinggestures--they were of the Feller of cadet days. Something in his lookas he stopped in front of her startled Marta. Suddenly he bent over anddrew down his face, with dropping underlip."I'm deaf--stone deaf, if you please!" he wheezed in senile fashion.She had to laugh and he laughed, too, with the ringing tone of youththat made him seem younger than his years."Not a gardener--a colonel of artillery, in the uniform, under the flagagain, thanks to you!" he cried. "An officer once more!""I'm glad!" she exclaimed. Here was one thing more to the credit of war."Thanks to you, instead of being shot as a spy--thanks to you!" Morethan the emotion of the brimming gratitude of his heart shone throughhis mobile features."It was your choice; you improved it. You fulfilled a faith that I hadin you," she said."Faith in me! That is the finest tribute of all--better than this,better than this!" He touched the iron cross on his coat as Stransky hadto Minna."And I took your place," said Marta with a dull, slow emphasis.Yes, he did owe much to her, she was thinking. In his place she hadlied; his part she had played in shame and no future act, she felt,could ever expiate it. The teacher of peace, she had become the partisanof war in wicked cunning.He guessed nothing of what lay behind her words. He had forgotten herchildren's school."And did my work better than I could! You are wonderful, wonderful!" Hewas aglow with admiration, with awe, with adoration.She smiled faintly, bitterly, while he burst into a flood of talk."I was back with the guns you had given me when I heard that you weretaking my place. Then I thought, can I be worthy of this--of what youhave done for me, giving me back my own world, your world? I vowed Iwould be worthy--worthy of you. Heavens! How I made the gunsplay--bang-bang-bang!" He cupped his bands over his eyes as an imaginaryrange-finder, sweeping the field. "Oh, they are beautiful guns, thesenew models! With a battalion I won a regiment. I asked Lanny to tellyou; did he?""Yes, and also of the iron cross.""A fine bit of metal, the cross, and they have not been giving them toopromiscuously, either," said Feller. "But they're not gun-metal! That isthe real metal. It was my guns that closed the gate to the pass," hewent on, swept by the flood of enthusiasm. "I didn't open fire till Icould concentrate so as to make a solidly locked gate. I tell you, theguns are the thing! You ought to have seen that retreat curl up onitself. And where the shells struck on the hard road--phew! They liftedthe Grays upward to meet shrapnel pounding them from the sky! We couldhave torn the whole Column to pieces if they hadn't surrendered. What abag of rifles and guns and stores is going to our capital! Oh, ourfriends the Grays were a little too fast! They didn't know what the gunsmeant in defence. The guns--they are back to their old place of glory!They rule!""Was it your guns that fired into the melee there by the gate?" Martaasked."Yes. I saw that soft target early. They put up a Red Cross flag atfirst, but I soon realized that it wasn't any dressing station; onlystragglers; only the kind that run away without orders. So I let themhave it, for that's the law of war, and the way they would give it to usand did, more than once. But I took care that no shots were fired at thehouse, though if it had not been your house I'd have sent a shell or twoon the chance that some of the Gray staff might still be there. Then,after the surrender, I kept spanking that lot with intermittent shellstill I was sure the Red Cross flag was justified.""The fire was very accurate, as I happen to know, for it wounded me,"said Marta.So intent had he been in talking to his audience, to her eyes, that nowfor the first time he noticed the bandage on her forearm. Hisimpressionable features were as struck with alarm and horror at sight ofthe tiny red spot as if she had been in danger of immediate death."You--you were down by the road?" he gasped. "My guns were firing atyou? Why--how?""Helping with the wounded.""The Gray wounded?""Yes.""Of course, you would--with any wounded!" he cried. "Splendid! Like you!It is not bad? It does not pain you?"He bent over the red spot, his lips very near it and twitching, all hisvolatile force melting into solicitude and his voice taut, as if hehimself were suffering the anguish of a dozen wounds."Only a scratch. Don't worry about it!" she assured him soothingly, witha peculiar smile.Now he made a gesture of amazement, catching at another thought thatdarted as a shooting star across his mind."Wonderful--wounded! Wonderful! Was there ever such a woman?" he cried."No, I knew from the first there never was. The minute the way was clearand I could be spared from my guns I came to you--to you! This time Icome not as a deaf, cringing, watery-eyed old gardener"--for an instanthe was the gardener--"but as one of your world, to which I was bred,"and his shoulders, rising, filled out his uniform in the grace of thecommander of men in action. "Destiny has played with us. It sent a spyto your garden. It put you in my place. A strange service, ours--yes,destiny is in it!""Yes," she breathed painfully, his suggestion striking deep.She was staring at the ground, her face very still. Yes, it was he whohad started the train of circumstances that had left her with a memorymore tragic than the one that had whitened his hair. His memory wasalready erased. What could ever erase hers? He had begun anew. How couldshe ever begin anew? The fact of this man talking of everything asdestiny--of the slaughter, the misery, as destiny--was the worst mockeryof all. Yet he was true to himself. His enjoyed facility of fervidexpression, his boyishness, his gift of making the lived moment thegreatest of his life, was the very gift she had craved to make herforget her yesterdays. Only faintly did she hear his next outburst,until he came to the end."I come with the question which I had sealed in my lonely heart," he wassaying, "while I lived a lie and trimmed rose-bushes and hung on yourwords. You saved me. I fought for you. You were in my eyes, in myangers, in my brain as I directed the fire of my guns. 'She will bepleased to hear that I am a colonel!' I kept thinking. I love you! Ilove you!"Marta started up from her chair, her eyes moist and open wide, amazed,but growing kind and troubled. Had she been guilty of giving him hope?Was there something in her that had led him on, a shame that camenatural to her since she had let Westerling proceed with his love? Herguilt in Feller's case was worse than in Westerling's. A thousandWesterlings were not worth one Feller. And he had been near her, near asa comrade, in imagination, with his ready suggestions of how to play herpart in its most exacting moments! While he stood, the picture of theeager, impatient lover trembling for an answer that seemed to meanheaven or perdition for him, the kindness that went with the trouble inher eyes warmed to fondness, as she laid her fingers on his shoulder."You would want me to love you, wouldn't you?" she asked gently. "And ifI cannot? Yes, if I can neither act nor play at love, so real must lovebe to me?"He turned miserable, with eyes seeming to sink into his head, and bodyto wilt in the dejection of that pitiful, hopeless attitude when hissecret had been discovered in the tower sitting-room."Act! Act!" he murmured."Yes." Her fingers exercised the faintest pressure on his shoulder."Your true love, your one enduring love, is the guns. All other lovescome and go. To-morrow, if not, next day, in this big, throbbing world,with your future assured, as you lived other great moments you wouldlook back on this moment as another part that you had acted--and sobeautifully acted.""Act! Act!" he repeated, like one who is coming to grip with facts.For a period he stared at the ground before he reached for the hand onhis shoulder, which he pressed in both of his, looking soberly into hereyes. He smiled; smiled apparently at a memory, let her hand drop, andraised his own hands, palms out, in a gesture of good-humoredcomprehension."You know me!" he exclaimed. "But I did it well, didn't I?" he asked,after a pause."Beautifully. I repeat, it was convincingly real," she replied, laughingin relief."If I hadn't, it would have been most disappointing after all myrehearsals," he went on. "Yes, you know me! Why, I might have beenwanting to break the engagement in a week because I was beginning otherrehearsals!" He laughed, too, as if relishing the prospect. "Yes, Iact--act always, except with the guns. They alone are real!" he burstout in joyous fury. "We are going on, I and my guns, on to the bestyet--on in the pursuit! Nothing can stop us! We shall hit the Grays sofast and hard that they can never get their machine in order again. Godbless you! Everything that is fine in me will always think finely ofyou! You and Lanny--two fixed stars for me!""Truly!" She was radiant. "Truly?" she asked wistfully."Yes, yes--a yes as real as the guns!""Then it helps! Oh, how it helps!" she murmured almost inaudibly."Good-by! God bless you!" he cried as he started to go, adding over hisshoulder merrily: "I'll send you a picture post-card from the Grays'capital of my guns parked in the palace square."She watched him leap the garden wall as lightly as he had come andgallop away, an impersonation of the gay, adventurous spirit of war,counting death and wounds and hardship as the delights of the gamble.Yes, he would follow the Grays, throwing shells in the irresponsible joyof tossing confetti in a carnival. Pursuit! Was Feller's the sentimentof the army? Were the Browns not to stop at the frontier? Were they tochange their song to, "Now we have ours we shall take some of theirs"?The thought was fresh fuel to the live coals that still remained underthe ashes.A brigade commander and some of his staff-officers near by formed agroup with faces intent around an operator who was attaching hisinstrument to a field-wire that had just been reeled over the hedge.Marta moved toward them, but paused on hearing an outburst of jubilantexclamations:"A hundred thousand prisoners!""And five hundred guns!""We're closing in on their frontier all along the line!""It's incredible!""But the word is official--it's right!"From mouth to mouth--a hundred thousand prisoners, five hundredguns--the news was passed in the garden. Eyes dull with fatigue beganflashing as the soldiers broke into a cheer that was not led, a cheerunlike any Marta had heard before. It had the high notes of men who wereweary, of a terrible exultation, of spirit stronger than tired legs andas yet unsatisfied. Other exclamations from both officers and menexpressed a hunger whetted by the taste of one day's victory."We'll go on!""We'll make peace in their capital!""And with an indemnity that will stagger the world!""Nothing is impossible with Lanstron. How he has worked it out--baitedthem to their own destruction!""A frontier of our own choosing!""On the next range. We will keep all that stretch of plain there!""And the river, too!""They shall pay--pay for attacking us!"Pay, pay for the drudgery, the sleepless nights, the dead and thewounded--for our dead and wounded! No matter about theirs! The officerswere too intent in their elation to observe a young woman, standingquite still, her lips a thin line and a deep blaze in her eyes as shelooked this way and that at the field of faces, seeking somedissentient, some partisan of the right. She was seeing the truth now;the cold truth, the old truth to which she had been untrue when she tookFeller's place. There could be no choice of sides in war unless youbelieved in war. One who fought for peace must take up arms against allarmies. Her part as a spy appeared to her clad in a new kind of shame:the desertion of her principles.Nor did the officers observe a man of thirty-five, wearing the cords ofthe staff and a general's stars, coming around the corner of the house.Marta's feverish, roving glance had noted him directly he was in sight.His face seemed to be in keeping with the other faces, in the ardor of ahunt unfinished; hand in blouse pocket, his bearing a little too easy tobe conventionally military--the same Lanny.She was dimly conscious of surprise not to find him changed, perhapsbecause he was unaccompanied by a retinue or any other symbol of hispower. He might have been coming to call on a Sunday afternoon. In thatfirst glimpse it was difficult to think of him as the commander of anarmy. But that he was, she must not forget. She was shaken andtrembling; and a mist rose before her, so that she did not see himclearly when, with a gesture of relief, he saw her."Lanstron!" exclaimed an officer in the first explosive breath ofamazement on recognizing him; then added: "His Excellency, the chief ofstaff!"But the one word, Lanstron, had been enough to thrill all the officersinto silence and ramrod salutes. Marta noted the deference of theirglances as they covertly looked him over. On what meat had our Caesar fedthat he had grown so great? This was the man who had pleaded with her toallow a spy in her garden; for whom she herself had turned spy.To-morrow his name would be in the head-lines of every newspaper in theworld. His portrait would become as familiar to the eyes of the world asthat of the best-advertised of kings. He was the conqueror whosecommonplace sayings would be the sparks of genius because the gamble ofwar had gone his way. He had grown so great by sending shells into thestricken eddy at the foot of the garden and driving punishing columnsagainst the retreating masses in the defile. The god in the car and ofthe machine, with his quiet manner, his intellectual features; thisone-time friend, more subtle in pursuit of the same ambitions than theblind egoism of Westerling! These officers and men and all officers andmen and herself were pawns of his plans and his will. Yes, even herself.Had he stopped with the repulse of the enemy? No. Would he stop now? No.Her disillusion was complete. She knew the truth; she felt it as steelstiffening against him and against every softer impulse of her own."I wanted a glimpse of the front as well as the rear," Lanstronremarked in explanation of his presence to the general of brigade as hepassed on toward Marta, who was thinking that she, at least, was not inawe of him; she, at least, saw clearly and truly his part."Marta! Marta!"Lanstron's voice was tremulous, as if he were in awe of her, while hedrank in the fact that she was there before him at arms' length, safe,alive. She did not offer her hand in greeting. She was incapable of anymovement, such was her emotion; and he, too, was held in a spell, as thereality of her, after all that had passed, filled his eyes. He waitedfor her to speak, but she was silent."Marta--that bandage! You have been hurt?" he exclaimed.Unlike Feller, he had not been so obsessed with a purpose as to be blindto externals. Her hostile mood was quick to recall that no smallestdetail of anything under his sight ever escaped him. This was his kindof strength--the strength that had wrecked Westerling as a fine,intellectual process. He could act, too. In the tone of the question,"You've been hurt?" without tragic emphasis, was a twitching, throbbingundercurrent of horror, which set the hand hidden in the pocket of hisblouse quivering. Why care if she were hurt? Why not think about thehundreds of thousands of others who were wounded. Why not care for thatpoor fellow whose ghastly wound kept staring at her as he wrote "Killme!" on the wagon body?"It's the fashion to be wounded," she said, eyebrows lifted and lasheslowered, with a nervous smile. "I played Florence Nightingale, thenatural woman's part, I believe. We should never protest; only nurse thevictims of war. After helping to send men to death I went under firemyself, and--and that helped."She could be kind to Feller but not to Lanstron. He was not a child. Hewas Lanny, who, as she thought of him now, did nothing except bycalculation."Yes, that would help," he agreed, wincing as from a knife thrust.Her old taunt: sending men to death and taking no risk himself! She sawthat he winced; she realized that she had stayed words that were aboutto come in a flood. Then she seemed to see him through new lenses. Heappeared drawn and pale and old, as if he, too, had become ashes;anything but the conqueror. Her feelings grew contradictory. Why allthis fencing? How weak, how silly! She had much to say to him--a lastappeal to make. Her throat held a dry lump. She was marshalling herthoughts to begin when the brittle silence was broken by a rumbling ofvoices, a stirring of feet, and a cheer."Lanstron! Lanstron! Hurrah for Lanstron!"The soldiers in the garden did not bother with any "Your Excellency, thechief of staff" formula when word had been passed of his presence. Martalooked around to see their tempestuous enthusiasm as they tossed theircaps in the air and sent up their spontaneous tribute from the depths oftheir lungs. Conqueror and hero to the living, but the dead could notspeak, whispered some fiend in her heart.Lanstron uncovered to the demonstration impulsively, when theconventional military acknowledgment would have been a salute. He alwayslooked more like the real Lanny to her with his forehead bare. Itcompleted the ensemble of his sensitive features. She saw that he wasblinking almost boyishly at the compliment and noted the littledeprecatory shake of his head, as much as to say that they were making amistake."Thank you!" he called, and the cheeriness of his voice, she thought,expressed his real self; the delight of victory and the glowinganticipation of further victories."Thank _you_!" called a private with a big voice."Yes, thank _you_!" repeated some of the officers in quick appreciationof a compliment as real as human courage."We're going to put your headquarters in the Grays' capital!" cried thesoldier with the big voice.Another cheer rose at the suggestion."You will follow the staff?" Lanstron called in sudden intensity."Yes, yes, yes!" they shouted. "Yes, yes; follow you!""You think our staff led you wisely?" he continued distinctly, slowly,and very soberly. "You think we can continue to do so? You trust us? Youtrust our judgment?""Yes, yes, yes!""Thank you!" he said with a long-drawn, happy breath."Thank _you_!" they shouted.He stood smiling for a moment in reply to their smiles; then, stillsmiling, but in a different way, he said to Marta:"As you say, that helps!" with a nod toward the bandage on her forearmand hurriedly turned away.She saw him involuntarily clutch the wrist above the pocket of hisblouse to still the twitching; but beyond that there was no further signof emotion as he went to the telephone. She had been about to cry outher protest against the continuance of the war in the name of humanity,of justice, of every bit of regard he had ever had for her. When he wasthrough talking she should go to him in appeal--yes, on her knees, ifneed be, before all the officers and soldiers--to stop the killing; butinstantly he was through he started toward the pass road, not by thepath to the steps, but by leaping from terrace to terrace and waving hishand gayly to the soldiers as he went. The officers stared at the sightof a chief of staff breaking away from his communications in thisunceremonious fashion. They saw him secure a horse from a group ofcavalry officers on the road and gallop away.Marta having been the object of Lanstron's attention now became theobject of theirs. It was good to see a woman, a woman of the Browns,after their period of separation from feminine society. She foundherself holding an impromptu reception. She heard some other selfanswering their polite questions; while a fear, a new kind of fear, wastaking hold of her real self; a fear inexplicable, insidiously growing.Lanstron was still in the officers' minds after his strange appearanceand stranger departure. They began to talk of him, and Marta listened."He said something about being a free man now!""Yes, he looked as eager as a terrier after rats.""He knows what he is doing. He sees so far ahead of what we are thinkingthat it's useless to guess his object. We'll understand when it's done.""How little side he has! So perfectly simple. He hardly seems to realizethe immensity of his success. In fact, none of us realizes it; it's tooenormous, overwhelming, sudden!""And no nerves!""No nerves, did you say? There you are wrong. Did you see that handtwitching in his pocket? Of course, you've heard about the hand? Why,he's a bundle of nerve-wires held in control; a man of the age; masterof his own machine, therefore, able to master the machine of an army."Of course, they guessed nothing of Marta's part in his success. The verythings they were saying about him built up a figure of the type whosecharacter she had keenly resented a few minutes before."But, Miss Galland, you seem to know him far better than we. This is notnews to you," remarked the brigade commander."Yes, I saw the accident of his first flight when his hand was injured,"she said, and winced with horror. Never had the picture of him as herose from the wreck appeared so distinct. She could see every detail ofhis looks; feel his twinges of pain while he smiled. Was the revelationthe more vivid because it had not once occurred to her since the warbegan? It shut out the presence of the officers; she no longer heardwhat they were saying. Black fear was enveloping her. Vaguely sheunderstood that they were looking away at something. She heard the roarof artillery not far distant and followed their gaze toward the knollwhere Dellarme's men had received their baptism of fire, now under acanopy of shrapnel smoke."That's about their last stand in the tangent, their last snarl on oursoil," remarked the brigade commander."And we're raining shells on it!" said his aide. "With our glasses we'llbe able to watch the infantry go in.""Yes, very well.""We're all used to how it feels, now we'll see how it looks at adistance," piped one of the soldiers.Not until he had shouted to them did they notice a divisionstaff-officer who had come up from the road. He had a piece ofastounding news to impart before he mentioned official business."What do you think of this?" he cried. "Nothing could stop him!Lanstron--yes, Lanstron has gone into that charge with the AfricanBraves!"In these days, when units of a vast army in the same uniform, drilled inthe same way, had become interchangeable parts of a machine, the AfricanBraves still kept regimental fame. They had guarded the stretches of hotsand in one of the desert African colonies of the Browns; and they hadserved in the jungle in the region of Bodlapoo, which, by the way, wasnominally the cause of the war. They had fought Mohammedan fanatics andblack savages. It did not matter much to them when they died; now aswell as ever. If they had mothers or sisters they were the secrets ofeach man's heart. The scapegrace youth, the stranded man of thirty whowould forget his past, the born adventurer, the renegade come acropper, the gentleman who had gambled, the remittance man whoseremittance had stopped, the peasant's son who had run away from home,criminals and dreamers, some minor poets, some fairly good actors,scholarly fellows who chanted the "Odyssey," and both oath-ripping andtaciturn, quiet-mannered fellows who could neither read nor write founda home in the African Braves' muster-roll. Their spirit of corps had adervish fatalism. They had begged to have a share in the war and Partowhad consented. In the night after their long journey, while Westerling'sram was getting its death-blow, they had detrained and started for thefront. But the Grays were going as fast as the Braves, and they had beenunable to get into action."Wait for us! We want to be in it!" cried their impatience. "We'll showyou how they fight in Africa! Way for us!""Give them a chance!" said Lanstron.This order a general of corps repeated to a general of division, whorepeated it to a general of brigade."Give them a chance! Give them a chance!"Reserves along the route of their advance knew them at a glance by theiruniform, their Indian tan, and their jaunty swagger and gave a cheer asthey passed. They touched the chord of romance in the hearts ofofficers, who regarded them as an archaic survival which sentimentpermitted in an isolated instance in Africa, where it excellentlyserved. And officers looked at one another and shook their headsknowingly, out of the drear, hard experience in spade approaches, whenthey thought of that brilliant uniform as a target and of frontiertactics against massed infantry and gun-fire."Once will be enough," said the cynical. "There won't be many left totell the tale!"And the African Braves knew how the army felt. They had a reputation outof Africa to sustain, this band of exotics among the millions ofhome-trained comrades. They didn't quite believe in all this machinebusiness. Down the slopes with their veteran stride, loose-limbed andrhythmic, they went, past the line of the Galland house, with nofighting in sight. What if they had to return to Africa without firing ashot? The lugubrious prospect saddened them. They felt that a battleshould be ordered on their account."You will take that regiment's place and it will fall back for support,while you storm the knoll beyond!" said the brigade commander, a twinklein his eye."Is it much of a job, do you think?" asked the colonel of the Braves.He had two fingers' length of service colors on his blouse. Lean he wasand bony-jawed, with deep-set eyes. He loved every mother's son of theBraves, from illiterate to the chanter of the "Odyssey"; from peasant'sson to penniless nobleman, and thought any one of his privates rathersuperior to a home brigade commander."A pretty good deal. I think the Grays'll make a snappy resistance,"said the brigade commander honestly. "The way we feel them out, they'regetting back their wind, and for the first time we'll be fighting themup-hill. Yes, there's a sting in a retreating army's tail when it getsover its demoralization.""Good!" observed the colonel as if he had a sweet taste in his mouth."And if you find it too stiff," the brigade commander went on, "why,I've seasoned veterans back of you who will press in to your support.""Veterans, you say, and seasoned? I have some of my own, too! Thank you!Thank you most kindly!" said the colonel, saluting stiffly, with a twistto the corner of his mouth. "When we need their help it will be to buryour dead," he added. "Can we do it alone? Will we?"He passed these inquiries along the line, which rose to the suggestionwith different kinds of oaths and jests and grins and grim whistles. Thescholar suddenly transferred his affections from the Greeks' phalanx tothe Roman legions and began with the first verse of Virgil's "AEneid." Healways made the change when action was near. "The Greeks for poetry andthe Romans for war!" he declared, and could argue his company to sleepif anybody disputed him."I want to be in one fight. I haven't been under fire in the whole war,"Lanstron explained to the colonel, who understood precisely the feeling."Lanstron is with us! The chief of staff is watching us!" ran thewhisper from flank to flank of the Braves. It was not wonderful to themthat he should be there. This complicated business of running a war overa telephone was not in the ken of their calculations. The colonel waswith them, so all the generals ought to be. "We'll show Lanstron!"determined the Braves. "We'll show him how we fight in Africa!""With the first rush you go to the bottom of the valley; with thesecond, take the knoll!" Such were the colonel's simple tactics. "Butstop on the top of the knoll. Though we'd like to take the capital thisafternoon, it's against orders."Lanstron, dropping into place in the line, felt as if he were about torenew his youth. He had the elation of his early aeroplane flights, whenhe was likely to be hung on a church steeple. Now he was not sending mento death; he was having his personal fling. It was all very simplebeside sitting at a desk with battle raging in the distance. He dodgedat the first bullet that whistled near his head and looked rathersheepishly at the man next him, who was grinning."Lots of fellows do that with the first one, no matter how many timesthey've been under fire," said the comrade. "But if they do it with thesecond one--" He dropped the corners of his mouth with a significancethat required no further comment to express his views on that kind of asoldier."I shan't!" said Lanstron; and he kept his word."I knew by the cut of your jib you wouldn't!" observed the Brave,speaking not to the chief of staff but to the man. What were chiefs ofstaff to him? Everybody on the firing-line was simply another Brave.Lanstron liked the compliment. It pleased him better than those endowinghim with military genius. It was free of rank and etiquette andselfishness.Of such stuff were the Braves as Caesar's veterans who walloped theBelgae, the adventurous ruffians of Cortez, the swashbucklers who foughtin Flanders, the followers of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and the regulars ofthe American Indian campaigns. When they rose to the charge with a yell,in a wave of scarlet and blue, flashing with brass buttons, their silkenflag rippling in the front rank, they made a picture to please theromantic taste. Here on the brown background of the commonplace threemillions of moderns was a patch of the color and glamour thatstory-tellers, poets, artists, and moving-picture men would choose asthe theme of real military glory.Intoxication of all the senses, of muscles and nerves, with themesmerism of movement and burning desire which calls the imagination ofyouth to arms! The supreme moment of fury and splendid rush, whichbecomes the recollection to the survivor to be told from the knee tofuture generations in a way to make small boys love to play withsoldiers! These men knew nothing except that they had legs and thatahead was a goal. Oaths and laughter were mingled in their souls; theenergy of a delirium sped their steps. They were so many human missilesfired by an impulse, with too much initial velocity to stop at thebottom of the valley as the colonel had directed. Lord, no! Let's havethe thing over with, bit in teeth! The common instinct of the living,who neither saw nor thought of those who fell, swept them up the slope.Every man who survived was the whole regiment in himself; its pride, itsgallantry, its inheritance in his keeping."Fiends of hell and angels of heaven! We're here and we did it alone!"gasped the winded, ragged line that reached the crest."I thought they would!" said the brigade commander, who had watched thecharge through his glasses from an eminence. "But at what a cost! It waslucky for them that it was only a rear-guard resistance. However, itcertainly thrills the imagination and it will be a good thing for Brownprestige in Africa.""Why?" Marta heard the officers around her asking after theirexclamations of amazement at the news that Lanstron was going in thecharge. "Why should the chief of staff risk his life in this fashion?"Marta knew. All her taunts about sending others to death from his officechair, uttered as the fugitive sarcasm of a mood, recurred in themerciless hammer-beat of recollection. For a moment she was aghast,speechless. Then the officers, occupied with the startling news, heard avoice, wrenched from a dry throat in anguish, saying:"The telephone! Try to reach him! Tell him he must not!""We can hardly say 'must not' to a chief of staff," said the generalautomatically."Tell him I ask him not to! Try to reach him--try--you can try!""Yes, yes! Certainly!" exclaimed the general, turning to the telephoneoperator.He had seen now what the younger men had seen at a glance. They wererecalling Lanstron's relief at seeing her; how he had passed them by tospeak to her; the intensity of the two in their almost wordless meeting.Her bloodless lips, the imploring passion in her eyes, her quiveringimpatience told the rest."Division headquarters!" called the operator. "They're getting brigadeheadquarters," he added while he waited in silence. "Brigadeheadquarters says the Braves have no wire. It's too late. The charge isstarting.""So it is!" cried one of the subalterns. "Look! Look!"Marta looked toward the rising ground this side of the knoll in time tosee bayonets flash in the waning afternoon sunlight and disappear asthey descended the slope."There! They're up on the other slope without stopping!" exclaimed thegeneral. "Quick! Don't you want to see?" He offered his glasses toMarta."No, I can see well enough," she murmured, though the landscape wasmoving before her eyes in giddy waves."The madness of it! The whole slope is peppered with the fallen!""What a cost! Magnificent, but not war. Carrying their flag in the goodold way, right at the front!""Heavens! I hope they do it!""The flag's down!""Another man has it--it's up!""Now--now--splendid! They're in!""So they are! And the flag, too!""Yes, what's left are in!""And Lanstron was there--in that!""What if--""Yes, the chief of staff, the head of the army, in an affair like that!""The mind of the army--the mind that was to direct our advance!""When all the honors of the world are his!"Their words were acid-tipped needles knitting back and forth throughMarta's brain. Was Lanny one of those black specks that peppered theslope? Was he? Was he?"Telephone and--and see if Lanny is--is killed!" she begged.She knew not how she uttered that monstrous word killed. But utter itshe did in its naked terror. Now she knew a simpler feeling than that ofthe grand sympathy of the dreamer with the horrors of war as a whole.She knew the dumb, helpless suspense of the womenfolk remaining at homewatching for the casualty lists that Westerling had suppressed. Whatmattered policies of statesmen and generals, propagandas and tactics, tothem? The concern of each wife or sweetheart was with one--one of themillions who was greater to the wife or the sweetheart than all themillions. Marta was not thinking of sending thousands to death. Had shesent _him_ to death? The agony of waiting, waiting there among thesestrangers, waiting for that little instrument at the end of a wire tosay whether or not he were alive, became insupportable."I'll go--I'll go out there where he is!" she said incoherently, stilllooking toward the knoll with glazed eyes. She thought she was walkingfast as she started for the garden gate, but really she was goingslowly, stumblingly."I think you had better stop her if you can," said the general to hisaide.The aide overtook her at the gate."We shall know about His Excellency before you can find out foryourself," he said; and, young himself, he could put the sympathy ofyouth with romance into his tone. "You might miss the road, even misshim, when he was without a scratch, and be for hours in ignorance," heexplained. "In a few minutes we ought to have word."Marta sank down weakly on the tongue of a wagon, overturned against thegarden wall in the melee of the retreat, and leaned her shoulder on thewheel for support."If the women of the Grays waited four weeks," she said with an effortat stoicism, "then I ought to be able to wait a few minutes.""Depend on me. I'll bring news as soon as there is any," the aideconcluded, and, seeing that she wished to be alone, he left her.For the first time she had real oblivion from the memory of her deceitof Westerling, the oblivion of drear, heart-pulling suspense. All thegood times, the sweetly companionable times, she and Lanny had hadtogether; all his flashes of courtship, his outburst in their lastinterview in the arbor, when she had told him that if she found that shewanted to come to him she would come in a flame, passed in review underthe hard light of her petty ironies and sarcasms, which had the falsering of coquetry to her now, genuine as they had been at the time.Through her varying moods she had really loved him, and the thing thathad slumbered in her became the drier fuel for the flame--perhaps toolate.Her thought, her feeling was as if he were not chief of staff, but aprivate soldier, and she were not a woman who had girdled the world andpuckered her brow over the solution of problems, but a provincial girlwho had never been outside her village--his sweetheart. All questions ofthe army following up its victory, of his responsibilities and her fearsthat he would go on with conquest, faded into the fact of life--hislife, as the most precious thing in the world to her. For him, yes, forhim she had played the spy, as that village girl would for her lover,thinking of warm embraces; for him she had kept steady under the strain.Without him--what then? It seemed that the fatality that had let himescape miraculously from the aeroplane accident, made him chief ofstaff, and brought him victory, might well choose to ring down thecurtain of destiny for him in the charge that drove the last foot of theinvader off the soil of the Browns.... A voice was calling.... She heardit hazily, with a sudden access of giddy fear, before it became acheerful, clarion cry that seemed to be repeating a message that hadalready been spoken without her understanding it."He's safe, safe, safe, Miss Galland! He was not hit! He is on his wayback and ought to be here very soon!"She heard herself saying "Thank you!" But that was not for some time.The aide was already gone. He had had his thanks in the effect of thenews, which made him think that a chief of staff should not receivecongratulations for victory alone.Lanny would return through the garden. She remained leaning against thewagon body, still faint from happiness, waiting for him. She was drawingdeeper and longer breaths that were velvety with the glow of sunshine. Aflame, the flame that Lanny had desired, of many gentle yet passionatetongues, leaping hither and thither in glad freedom, was in possessionof her being. When his figure appeared out of the darkness the flameswept her to her feet and toward him. Though he might reject her heshould know that she loved him; this glad thing, after all the shame shehad endured, she could confess triumphantly.But she stopped short under the whip of conscience. Where was hercourage? Where her sense of duty? What right had she, who had playedsuch a horrible part, to think of self? There were other sweetheartswith lovers alive who might be dead on the morrow if war continued. Theflame sank to a live coal in her secret heart. Another passion possessedher as she seized Lanstron's hand in both her own."Lanny, listen! Not the sound of a shot--for the first time since thewar began! Oh, the blessed silence! It's peace, peace--isn't it to bepeace?" As they ascended the steps she was pouring out a flood ofbroken, feverish sentences which permitted of no interruption. "You kepton fighting to-day, but you won't to-morrow, will you? It isn't I whoplead--it's the women, more women than there are men in the army, whowant you to stop now! Can't you hear them? Can't you see them?"In the fervor of appeal, before she realized his purpose, they were onthe veranda and at the door of the dining-room, where the Brown staffwas gathered around the table."I still rely on you to help me, Marta!" he whispered as he stood to oneside for her to enter.XLVITHE LAST SHOT"Miss Galland!"Blinking as she came out of the darkness into the bright light, with alock of her dew-sprinkled dark hair free and brushing her flushed cheek,Marta saw the division chiefs of the Browns, after their start whenLanstron spoke her name, all stand at the salute, looking at her ratherthan at him. The reality in the flesh of the woman who had been acomrade in service, sacrificing her sensibilities for their cause,appealed to them as a true likeness of their conceptions of her. Intheir eyes she might read the finest thing that can pass from man's towoman's or from man's to man's. These were the strong men of her peoplewho had driven the burglar from her house with the sword of justice.Their tribute had the steadfast loyalty of soldiers who were craving todo anything in the world that she might ask, whether to go on theirknees to her or to kill dragons for her."I may come in?" she asked."Who if not you is entitled to the privilege of the staff council?"exclaimed the vice-chief.The others did not propose to let him do all the honors. Each murmuredwords of welcome on his own account."We are here, thanks to you!""And, thanks to you, our flag will float over the Gray range!"She must be tired, was their next thought. Four or five of them hurriedto place a chair for her, the vice-chief winning over his rivals, morethrough the exercise of the rights of rank than by any superioralacrity."You are appointed actual chief of staff and a field-marshal!" said thevice-chief to Lanstron. "The premier says that every honor the nationcan bestow is yours. The capital is mad. The crowds are crying: 'On tothe Gray capital!' To-morrow is to be a public holiday and they arecalling it Lanstron Day. The thing was so sudden that the speculatorswho depressed our securities in the world's markets have got theirdue--ruin! And we ought to get an indemnity that will pay the cost ofthe war."Seated at one side, Marta could watch all that passed, herselfunobserved. She noted a touch of color come to Lanstron's cheeks as hemade a little shrug of protest."It never rains but it pours!" he said. "We were all just as able andloyal yesterday as to-day when we find ourselves heroic. We owe ourvictory to Partow's plans, to the staff's industry, the spirit of thepeople and the army, and--" He threw a happy smile toward Marta."Perhaps it ought to be Galland Day rather than Lanstron Day," remarkedthe vice-chief. "The crowds at the capital when they know her part mightcheer her more frenziedly than you, general.""No, no--please, no!" Marta was hectic in alarm and protest."Your secret is ours! It's in the family!" the vice-chief hastened toassure her. Where could a secret be safe if not in the keeping of anarmy staff?"That was almost like teasing!" she exclaimed with a laugh of relief."We're all in pretty good humor," remarked the vice-chief. He seemed tohave a pleasant taste in his mouth that would last him for life.Then Marta saw their faces grow businesslike and keen, as they gatheredaround the table, with Lanstron at the head. They were oblivious of herpresence, immured in a man's world of war."Your orders were obeyed. We have not passed a single white post yet!"said the vice-chief impatiently. "As the Grays never expected to takethe defensive, their fortresses are inferior. Every hour we wait meansmore time for them to fortify, more time to recover from theirdemoralization. Our dirigibles having command of the air--we had awireless from one reporting all clear half-way to the Gray capital--why,we shall know their concentrations while they are ignorant of ours. It'sthe nation's great opportunity to gain enough provinces to even thebalance of population with the Grays. With the unremitting offensive,blow on blow, using the spirit of our men to drive in mass attacks atthe right points, the Gray range is ours!"Marta scanned the faces of the staff for some sign of dissent only tofind nothing but the ardor of victory calling for more victory, whichreflected the feeling of the coursing crowds in the capital. ThoughLanny wished to stop the war, he was only a chip on the crest of a wave.Public opinion, which had made him an idol, would discard him as soon ashe ceased to be a hero in the likeness of its desires. She saw him aloofas the others, in preoccupation, bent over the map outlining the plan ofattack that they had worked out while awaiting their chief's return fromthe charge. He was taking a paper from his pocket and looking from oneto another of his colleagues studiously; and she was conscious of thatdetermination in his smile which she had first seen when he rose fromthe wreck of his plane."This is from Partow: a message for you and the nation!" he announced,as he spread a few thin, typewritten pages out on the table. "I wasunder promise never to reveal its contents unless our army drove theGrays back across the frontier. The original is in the staff vaults. Ihave carried this copy with me."At the mention in an arresting tone of that name of the dead chief, towhich the day's events had given the prestige of one of the heroes ofold, there was grave attention."I think we have practically agreed that the two individuals who wereinvaluable to our cause were Partow and Miss Galland," Lanstron remarkedtentatively. He waited for a reply. It was apparent that he was laying afoundation before he went any further."Certainly!" said the vice-chief."And you!" put in another officer, which brought a chorus of assent."No, not I--only these two!" Lanstron replied. "Or, I, too, if youprefer. It little matters. The thing is that I am under a promise toboth, which I shall respect. He organized and labored for the samepurpose that she played the spy. When we sent the troops forward in acounter-attack and pursuit to clear our soil of the Grays; when Istopped them at the frontier--both were according to Partow's plan. Hehad a plan and a dream, this wonderful old man who made us all seemprimary pupils in the art of war."Could this be that terrible Partow, a stroke of whose pencil had madethe Galland house an inferno? Marta wondered as Lanstron read hismessage--the message out of the real heart of the man, throbbing withthe power of his great brain. His plan was to hold the Grays tostalemate; to force them to desist after they had battered theirbattalions to pieces against the Brown fortifications. His dream was thething that had happened--that an opportunity would come to pursue abroken machine in a bold stroke of the offensive."I would want to be a hero of our people for only one aim, to be able tostop our army at the frontier," he had written. "Then they might driveme forth heaped with obloquy, if they chose. I should like to see theGrays demoralized, beaten, ready to sue for peace, the better to provemy point that we should ask only for what is ours and that our strengthwas only for the purpose of holding what is ours. Then we should lay upno legacy of revenge in their hearts. They could never have cause toattack again. Civilization would have advanced another step."Lanstron continued to read to the amazed staff, for Partow's message hadlooked far into the future. Then there was a P.S., written after the warhad begun, on the evening of the day that Marta had gone from tea on theveranda with Westerling to the telephone, in the impulse of her newpurpose."I begin to believe in that dream," he wrote. "I begin to believe thatthe chance for the offensive will come, now that my colleague, MissGalland, in the name of peace has turned practical. There is nothinglike mixing a little practice in your dreams while the world is stillwell this side of Utopia, as the head on my old behemoth of a body wellknows. She had the right idea with her school. The oath so completelyexpressed my ideas--the result of all my thinking--that I had a twingeof literary jealousy. My boy, if you do reach the frontier, in pursuitof a broken army, and you do not keep faith with my dream and with herideals, then you will get a lesson that will last you forever at thefoot of the Gray range. But I do not think so badly as that of you or ofmy judgment of men.""Lanny! Lanny!"The dignity of a staff council could not restrain Marta. Her emotionmust have action. She sprang to his side and seized his hand, herexultation mixed with penitence over the why she had wronged him andPartow. Their self-contained purpose had been the same as hers and theyhad worked with a soldier's fortitude, while she had worked with whimsand impulses. She bent over him with gratitude and praise and a plea forforgiveness in her eyes, submerging the thing which he sought in them.He flushed boyishly in happy embarrassment, incapable of words for aninstant; and silently the staff looked on."And I agree with Partow," Lanstron went on, "that we cannot take therange. The Grays still have numbers equal to ours. It is they, now, whowill be singing 'God with us!' with their backs against the wall. WithPartow's goes my own appeal to the army and the nation; and I shall keepfaith with Partow, with Miss Galland, and with my own ideas, if thegovernment orders the army to advance, by resigning as chief ofstaff--my work finished."Westerling and his aide and valet, inquiring their way as strangers,found the new staff headquarters of the Grays established in an armybuilding, where Bouchard had been assigned to trivial duties, back ofthe Gray range. As their former chief entered a room in the disorder ofmaps and packing-cases, the staff-officers rose from their work to standat salute like stone images, in respect to a field-marshal's rank. Therewas no word of greeting but a telling silence before Turcas spoke. Hisvoice had lost its parchment crinkle and become natural. The blue veinson his bulging temples were a little more pronounced, his thin featuresa little more pinched, but otherwise he was unchanged and he seemedequal to another strain as heavy as the one he had undergone."We have a new government, a new premier," he said. "The old premier waskilled by a shot from a crowd that he was addressing from the balcony ofthe palace. After this, the capital became quieter. As we get in touchwith the divisions, we find the army in better shape than we had fearedit would be. There is a recovery of spirit, owing to our being on ourown soil.""Yes," replied Westerling, drowning in their stares and grasping at astraw. "Only a panic, as I said. If--" his voice rising hoarsely andcatching in rage."We have a new government, a new premier!" Turcas repeated, with firm,methodical politeness. Westerling looking from one face to another withfilmy eyes, lowered them before Bouchard. "There's a room ready for YourExcellency up-stairs," Turcas continued. "The orderly will show you theway."Now Westerling grasped the fact that he was no longer chief of staff. Hedrew himself up in a desperate attempt at dignity; the staff salutedagain, and, uncertainly, he followed the orderly, with the aide andvalet still in loyal attendance.Meanwhile, the aerial scouts of the Grays were puzzled by a moving cloudon the landscape several miles away. It filled the highway andoverflowed into the fields, without military form: women and men ofevery age except the fighting age, marching together in a sinistermilitancy of purpose."Bring the children, too!" cried the leaders. "They've more right to beheard than any of us."From such a nucleus it seemed that the whole population of the landmight be set in motion by a common passion. Neither the coming ofdarkness nor a chill rain kept recruits from village and farmhouse fromdropping their tasks and leaving meals unfinished to swell the ranks.What Westerling had called the bovine public with a parrot's head hadbecome a lion."There's no use of giving any orders, to stop this flood," said anofficer who had ridden fast to warn the Gray staff. "The police simplywatch it go by. Soldiers ready to lay down their lives to hold the rangegive it Godspeed when they learn what it wants. Both are citizens beforethey are soldiers or policemen. The thing is as elemental as anearthquake or a tidal wave.""Public opinion! Unanimous public opinion! Nothing can stop that!"exclaimed Turcas in dry fatalism. "You will inform His Excellency," hesaid to Westerling's aide, "that they are coming for him--all the peopleare coming, and we are powerless. And--" Even Turcas's calmness failedhim and his voice caught in a convulsive swallow."I--I understand!" the aide said thickly, and went up-stairs.He had suffered worse than in seeing his chief beaten; but even indisillusion he was loyal. He was back immediately, and paused at thefoot of the stairs stonily, in the attitude of one who listens forsomething; while the tramp of thousands of feet came pressing in uponall sides.As one great, high-pitched voice, the crowd shouted its mercilessdemand; and eyes eager with the hunt as those of soldiers in pursuitgleamed through the windows out of the darkness. Bouchard, hawk-eyed,stern, was standing by the street door. His mediaeval spirit revolted atthe thought of any kind of a mob. For such demonstrations he had asingle simple prescription--cold lead."We cannot strike the overwhelming spirit which we would forge into thenation's defence," said Turcas.The door was flung open and Bouchard drew back abruptly at the sight; hedrew back in fear of his own nature. If any one should so much as layhands on him when he was in uniform, a sword thrust would resent theinsult to his officer's honor; and even he did not want to strikegrandfathers and children and mothers.Two figures were in the doorway: a heavy-set market woman with a fringeof down on her lip and a cadaverous, tidily dressed old man, who mighthave been a superannuated schoolmaster, with a bronze cross won in thewar of forty years ago on his breast and his eyes burning with theyouthful fire of Grandfather Fragini's."They got the premier in the capital. We've come for Westerling! We wantto know what he did with our sons! We want to know why he was beaten!"cried the market woman."Yes," said the veteran. "We want him to explain his lies. Why did hekeep the truth from us? We were ready to fight, but not to be treatedlike babies. This is the twentieth century!""We want Westerling! Tell Westerling to come out!" rose the impatientshouts behind the two figures in the doorway."You are sure that he has one?" whispered Turcas to Westerling's aide."Yes," was the choking answer--"yes. It is better than that"--with aglance toward the mob. "I left my own on the table.""We can't save him! We shall have to let them--"Turcas's voice was drowned by a great roar of cries, with no word except"Westerling" distinguishable, that pierced every crack of the house. Awave of movement starting from the rear drove the veteran and the marketwoman and a dozen others through the doorway toward the stairs. Then thesound of a shot was heard overhead."The man you seek is dead!" said Turcas, stepping in front of the crowd,his features unrelenting in authority. "Now, go back to your work andleave us to ours.""I understand, sir," said the veteran. "We've no argument with you.""Yes!" agreed the market woman. "But if you ever leave this range alivewe shall have one. So, you stay!"Looking at the bronze cross on the veteran's faded coat, the staffsaluted; for the cross, though it were hung on rag's, wherever it wentwas entitled by custom to the salute of officers and "present arms" bysentries.As news of the shot travelled among the people the cries dropped intolong-drawn breaths of thirst satiated. Their mission was fulfilled. Thetramp of their feet as they dispersed homeward mingled with the urgingof officers to weary men and the rumbling of wagons and guns and thesound of pick and spade on the range, where torches flickered over theheads of the working parties. But no other shot after the one heard fromWesterling's room was fired. The Grays were at grip with the fact ofdisaster. An angry, wounded animal that had failed of its kill wasfacing around at the mouth of its lair for its own life."We're tired--we're all tired; but keep up--keep up!" urged theofficers. "We have a new chief of staff and there will be no morepurposeless sacrifices. It's their turn at the charge; ours to hold.We'll give them some of the medicine they've been giving us. God withus! Our backs against the wall!"After Lanstron's announcement to the Brown staff of his decision not tocross the frontier, there was a restless movement in the chairs aroundthe table, and the grimaces on most of the faces were those with which apractical man regards a Utopian proposal. The vice-chief was drumming onthe table edge and looking steadily at a point in front of his fingers.If Lanstron resigned he became chief."Partow might have this dream before he won, but would he now?" askedthe vice-chief. "No. He would go on!""Yes," said another officer. "The world will ridicule the suggestion;our people will overwhelm us with their anger. The Grays will take itfor a sign of weakness.""Not if we put the situation rightly to them," answered Lanstron. "Notif we go to them as brave adversary to brave adversary, in a fairspirit.""We can--we shall take the range!" the vice-chief went on in a burst ofrigid conviction when he saw that opinion was with him. "Nothing canstop this army now!" He struck the table edge with his fist, hisshoulders stiffening."Please--please, don't!" implored Marta softly. "It sounds so likeWesterling!"The vice-chief started as if he had received a sharp pin-prick. Hisshoulders unconsciously relaxed. He began a fresh study of a certainpoint on the table top. Lanstron, looking first at one and then atanother, spoke again, his words as measured as they ever had been inmilitary discussion and eloquent. He began outlining his own messagewhich would go with Partow's to the premier, to the nation, to everyregiment of the Browns, to the Grays, to the world. He set forth why theBrowns, after tasting the courage of the Grays, should realize that theycould not take their range. Partow had not taught him to put himself inother men's places in vain. The boy who had kept up his friendship withengine-drivers after he was an officer knew how to sink the plummet intohuman emotions. He reminded the Brown soldiers that there had been aprovidential answer to the call of "God with us!" he reminded the peopleof the lives that would be lost to no end but to engender hatred; hebegged the army and the people not to break faith with that principle of"Not for theirs, but for ours," which had been their strength."I should like you all to sign it--to make it simply the old form of'the staff has the honor to report,'" he said finally.There was a hush as he finished--the hush of a deep impression when oneman waits for another to speak. All were looking at him except thevice-chief, who was still staring at the table as if he had heardnothing. Yet every word was etched on his mind. The man whose name wasthe symbol of victory to the soldiers, who would be more than ever ahero as the news of his charge with the African Braves travelled alongthe lines, would go on record to his soldiers as saying that they couldnot take the Gray range. This was a handicap that the vice-chief did notcare to accept; and he knew how to turn a phrase as well as to make asoldierly decision. He looked up smilingly to Marta."I have decided that I had rather not be a Westerling, Miss Galland," hesaid. "We'll make it unanimous. And you," he burst out to Lanstron--"youlegatee of old Partow; I've always said that he was the biggest man ofour time. He has proved it by catching the spirit of our time andincarnating it."Vaguely, in the whirl of her joy, Marta heard the chorus of assent asthe officers sprang to their feet in the elation of being at one withtheir chief again. Lanstron caught her arm, fearing that she was goingto fall, but a burning question rose in her mind to steady her."Then my shame--my sending men to slaughter--my sacrifice was not invain?" she exclaimed.Misery crept into her eyes; she seemed to be seeing some horror thatwould always haunt her. These businesslike men of the council weretouched by a fresh understanding of her and of the reason for hersuccess, which had demanded something more than human art--somethingpure and fine and fearless underneath art. They sought to win one morevictory that should kill her memory of what she had done."Miss Galland," said the vice-chief, "Westerling's fate, whatever it is,would have been the same. He could never have taken our range. He wouldhave only more lives to answer for, and Partow's dream could not havecome true.""You think that--you--all of you?" she asked."All! All!" they said together."Yes, but for you the losses on both sides would have beengreater--hundreds of thousands greater," concluded the vice-chief. "Andto-night I think you helped me to see right; you struck a light in mymind when I was about to forget the law of service.""You see, then, you did hasten the end, Marta," said Lanstron."Yes, I do see, Lanny!" she whispered. She was weak now, with no spur toher energy except her happiness as she leaned on his arm. Then he feltan impulsive pressure as she looked up at him. "The law of service, asyou say!" she said, turning to the vice-chief. "Isn't that the finestlaw of all? Couldn't I help you with the appeal? Perhaps I might put init a thought to reach the women. They are a part of public opinion""I was going to suggest it, but you seemed so weary that I hadn't theheart," said Lanstron."Just the thing--the mothers, wives, and sweethearts!" declared thevice-chief."I'm not a bit tired now!" Marta assured them brightly. "I'm fresh forthe fight again.""Another thing," added Lanstron, "we ought to have the backing of thecorps and division commanders.""Precisely," agreed the vice-chief. "We want to make sure of this thing.We'd look silly if the old premier ordered the army on and left us highand dry; and it would mean certain disaster. Shall I get them on thetelephone?""Yes," said Lanstron.It was long after midnight when the collaborative composition of thatfamous despatch was finished."Now I'm really tired, Lanny," said Marta as she arose from the table."I can think only of prayers--joyful little prayers of thanks rising tothe stars."She slipped her arm through his. As they moved toward the door thechiefs of divisions, keeping to the etiquette that best expressed theirsoldierly respect, saluted her."If this were told, few would believe it; nor would they believe manyother things in the inner history of armies which are forever heldsecret," thought the vice-chief.Outside, the stars were twinkling to acknowledge those little prayers ofthanks, and the night was sweet and peaceful, while the army slept.XLVIITHE PEACE OF WISDOMThe sea of people packed in the great square of the Brown capital made aroar like the thunder of waves against a breakwater at sight of a whitespot on a background of gray stone, which was the head of an eminentstatesman."It looks as if our government would last the week out," the premierchuckled as he returned to his colleagues at the cabinet table.As yet only the brief bulletins whose publication in the newspapers hadaroused the public to a frenzy had been received. The cabinet, as eagerfor details as the press, had remained up, awaiting a fuller officialaccount."We have a long communication in preparation," the staff hadtelegraphed. "Meanwhile, the following is submitted.""Good Heavens! It's not from the army! It's from the grave!" exclaimedthe premier as he read the first paragraphs of Partow's message. "Of allthe concealed dynamite ever!" he gasped as he grasped the full meaningof the document, that piece of news, as staggering as the victoryitself, that had lain in the staff vaults for years. "Well, we needn'tgive it out to the press; at least, not until after matureconsideration," he declared when they had reached the end of Partow'sappeal. "Now we'll hear what the staff has to say for itself aftergratifying the wish of a dead man," he added as a messenger gave himanother sheet."The staff, in loyalty to its dead leader who made victory possible,and in loyalty to the principles of defence for which the army fought,begs to say to the nation--"It was four o'clock in the morning when this despatch concluded with "Weheartily agree with the foregoing," and the cabinet read the names ofall the general staff and the corps and division commanders. Coursingcrowds in the streets were still shouting hoarsely and sometimesdrunkenly: "On to the Gray capital! Nothing can stop us now!" Thepremier tried to imagine what a sea of faces in the great square wouldlook like in a rage. He was between the people in a passion forretribution and a headless army that was supposed to charge across thefrontier at dawn."The thing is sheer madness!" he cried. "It's insubordination! I'll haveit suppressed! The army must go on to gratify public demand. I'll showthe staff that they are not in the saddle. They'll obey orders!"He tried to get Lanstron on the long distance."Sorry, but the chief has retired," answered the officer on dutysleepily. "In fact, all the rest of the staff have, with orders thatthey are not to be disturbed before ten.""Tell them that the premier, the head of the government, theircommander, is speaking!""Yes, sir. But the staff were up all last night and most of to-night,not to mention a pretty busy day. When they had finished their report toyou, sir, they were utterly done up. Yes, the orders not to disturb themare quite positive, and as a junior I could not do so except by theirorders as superiors. The chief, before retiring, however, repeated tome, in case any inquiry came from you, sir, that there was nothing hecould add to the staff's message to the nation and the army. It is to begiven to the soldiers the first thing in the morning, and he will letyou know how they regard it.""Confound these machine minds that spring their surprises as fullyexecuted plans!" exclaimed the premier."It's true--Par tow and the staff have covered everything--met everyargument. There is nothing more for them to say," said the foreignminister."But what about the indemnity?" demanded the finance minister. He wasthinking of victory in the form of piles of gold in the treasury.This question, too, was answered."War has never brought prosperity," Partow had written. "Its purpose isto destroy, and destruction can never be construction. The conclusion ofa war has often assured a period of peace; and peace gave the impetus ofprosperity attributed to war. A man is strong in what he achieves, notthrough the gifts he receives or the goods he steals. Indemnity will notraise another blade of wheat in our land. To take it from a beaten manwill foster in him the desire to beat his adversary in turn and recoverthe amount and more. Then we shall have the apprehension of war alwaysin the air, and soon another war and more destruction. Remove the dangerof a European cataclysm, and any sum extorted from the Grays becomespaltry beside the wealth that peace will create. An indemnity makes thepurpose of the courage of the Grays in their assaults and of the Brownsin their resistance that of the burglar and the looter. There is nomoney value to a human life when it is your own; and our soldiers gavetheir lives. Do not cheapen their service.""Considering the part that we played at The Hague," observed the foreignminister, "it would be rather inconsistent for us not to--""There is only one thing to do. Lanstron has got us!" replied thepremier. "We must jump in at the head of the procession and receive themud or the bouquets, as it happens."With Partow's and the staff's appeals went an equally earnest one fromthe premier and his cabinet. Naturally, the noisy element of the citieswas the first to find words. It shouted in rising anger that Lanstronhad betrayed the nation. Army officers whom Partow had retired forleisurely habits said that he and Lanstron had struck at their owncalling. But the average man and woman, in a daze from the shock of theappeals after a night's celebration, were reading and wondering andasking their neighbors' opinions. If not in Partow's then in the staff'smessage they found the mirror that set their own ethical professionsstaring at them.Before they had made up their minds the correspondents at the front hadset the wires singing to the evening editions; for Lanstron had directedthat they be given the ran of the army's lines at daybreak. They told ofsoldiers awakening after the debauch of yesterday's fighting, normal andrested, glowing with the security of possession of the frontier andresponding to their leaders' sentiment; of officers of the type favoredby Partow who would bring the industry that commands respect to anycalling, taking Lanstron's views as worthy of their profession; of thatirrepressible poet laureate of the soldiers, Captain Stransky, I.C.(iron cross), breaking forth in a new song to an old tune, expressinghis brotherhood ideas in a "We-have-ours-let-them-keep-theirs" chorusthat was spreading from regiment to regiment.This left the retired officers to grumble in their coiners that war wasno longer a gentleman's vocation, and silenced the protests of theirnatural ally in the business of making war, the noisy element, whichpromptly adapted itself to a new fashion in the relation of nations.Again the great square was packed and again a wave-like roar of cheersgreeted the white speck of an eminent statesman's head. All the ideasthat had been fomenting in the minds of a people for a generation becamea living force of action to break through the precedents born ofprovincial passion with a new precedent; for the power of public opinioncan be as swift in its revolutions as decisive victories at arms. Theworld at large, after rubbing its forehead and readjusting itseye-glasses and clearing its throat, exclaimed:"Why not? Isn't that what we have all been thinking and desiring? Onlynobody knew how or where to begin."The premier of the Browns found himself talking over the long distanceto the premier of the Grays in as neighborly a fashion as if they hadadjoining estates and were arranging a matter of community interest."You have been so fine in waiving an indemnity," said the premier of theGrays, "that Turcas suggests we pay for all the damage done to propertyon your side by our invasion. I'm sure our people will rise to thesuggestion. Their mood has overwhelmed every preconceived notion ofmine. In place of the old suspicion that a Brown could do nothing exceptwith a selfish motive is the desire to be as fair as the Browns. And thepractical way the people look at it makes me think that it will beenduring.""I think so, for the same reason," responded the premier of the Browns."They say it is good business. It means prosperity and progress for bothcountries.""After all, a soldier comes out the hero of the great peace movement,"concluded the premier of the Grays. "A soldier took the tricks with ourown cards. Old Partow was the greatest statesman of us all.""No doubt of that!" agreed the premier of the Browns. "It's a sentimentto which every premier of ours who ever tried to down him would havereadily subscribed!"The every-day statesman smiles when he sees the people smile and growsangry when they grow angry. Now and then appears an inscrutable geniuswho finds out what is brewing in their brains and brings it to a head.He is the epoch maker. Such an one was that little Corsican, who gave astagnant pool the storm it needed, until he became overfed and mistookhis ambition for a continuation of his youthful prescience.       *       *       *       *       *Marta had yet to bear the shock of Westerling's death. After learningthe manner of it she went to her room, where she spent a haunted,sleepless night. The morning found her still tortured by hervisualization of the picture of him, irresolute as the mob pressedaround the Gray headquarters."It is as if I had murdered him!" she said. "I let him make love tome--I let my hand remain in his once--but that was all, Lanny. I--Icouldn't have borne any more. Yet that was enough--enough!""But we know now, Marta," Lanstron pleaded, "that the premier of theGrays held Westerling to a compact that he should not return alive if helost. He could not have won, even though you had not helped us againsthim. He would only have lost more lives and brought still greaterindignation on his head. His fate was inevitable--and he was a soldier."But his reasoning only racked her with a shudder."If he had only died fighting!" Marta replied. "He died like a rat in atrap and I--I set the trap!""No, destiny set it!" put in Mrs. Galland.Lanstron dropped down beside Marta's chair."Yes, destiny set it," he said, imploringly."Just as it set your part for you. And, Marta," Mrs. Galland went ongently, with what Marta had once called the wisdom of mothers, "Lannylives and lives for you. Your destiny is life and to make the most oflife, as you always have. Isn't it, Marta?""Yes," she breathed after a pause, in conviction, as she pressed hermother's hands. "Yes, you have a gift of making things simple andclear."Then she looked up to Lanstron and the flame in her eyes, whose leaping,spontaneous passion he already knew, held something of the eternal, asher arms crept around his neck."You are life, Lanny! You are the destiny of to-day and to-morrow!"       *       *       *       *       *Though it was very late autumn now, such was the warmth of the sun that,with a wrap, Mrs. Galland was sitting on the veranda. She wascontent--too content to go to town. As she had said to Marta, no doubtit would be a wonderful sight, but she had never cared for publiccelebrations since she had lost her husband. She could get all the joysof peace she wanted looking at the garden and the landscape; and it didnot matter at all now if Marta were twenty-seven, or even if she werethirty or thirty odd.For the last week the people of La Tir had been returning to theirhomes, and with the early morning those from the country districts hadcome swarming in for the great day. Faintly she heard the cheers of thecrowds pouring toward the frontier--cheers for the Gray premier andcheers for Lanstron and for Turcas as they gathered for a purpose whichlooked further ahead than the mere ratification of the very simple termsof peace that left the white posts where they were before the war."I would rather meet you here than on your range," said Lanstron toTurcas."You certainly find me in a more genial frame of mind than you wouldhave if you had met me there. And I am very delighted that things haveturned out as they have," replied Turcas. As soldiers of a common typeof efficiency, who understood each other, they might exchange ideas.Marta in the family carriage, surrounded by her children, looked on.Hugo Mallin, who had suggested getting acquainted with the Browns in acommon manoeuvre, witnessed his dream come true in miniature. Hissturdy sweetheart had become a heroine of the home town since thenewspapers had published the whole story of her lover's insubordination,and how he had stood at the white posts rallying stragglers, whichappealed to the sentiment of the moment. People pointed her out as anexample of the loyalty of conviction. His father and mother, far fromhiding their faces in shame, carried their heads high in parentaldistinction.There was nothing unfamiliar to the student of human nature incampaigns, which many historians overlook, so keen are they to get theirdates and circumstantial details correct, in the way that the Gray andthe Brown veterans fraternized in groups, crossing and recrossing thefrontier line as they labored with each other's tongues. This frequentlycomes with peace, when the adversaries have been of the same metal andstandards of civilization. The new thing was the theme of their talk.They had little to say of the campaign itself. They drew the curtain onthe horrors for purposes of personal glory and raised it only to point alesson that should prevent another war. No, they would never try killingagain. That sort of business was buried as securely as Westerling'sambition. Partow's name kept recurring; one of the paragraphs of hismessage, showing how clearly he had foreseen the effect on sentiment,was frequently quoted:"We have had war's test; who wants it repeated? We have kept peace withforce between these two brave, high-spirited peoples; why not have thepeace of wisdom? Former sacrifices of blood have been for the glory ofvictory of one country over another. Why not consider this one asacrifice in common for the glory of a victory in common? If the leadersof the great nations that boast their civilization cannot find a way toa permanent understanding among themselves, while they stand for thepeace of the world, then the very civilization which produced theresolute, intelligent courage and the arms and organization that we haveseen in being is a failure. Surely, the brains that directed these greatarmies ought to be equal to some practical plan. Meet the conditions ofinternational distrust, if you will, by establishing a neutral zone tenmiles broad along the frontier free of all defences. Let the Grays guardfive miles of it on the Brown side and the Browns five miles on the Grayside, as insurance against surprise or the ambitions of demagogues. Whatan example for those other nations beyond Europe, as yet lacking yourorganization and progress, whom you must aid and direct! What a returnto you in both moral and commercial profit! Keep armed, in reason; keepstrong, but only as an international police force."       *       *       *       *       *The keen air had given Mrs. Galland the best appetite she had had formonths. She was beginning to fear a late luncheon, when Marta appearedat the garden gate with the man whose legions had followed in thefootsteps of other winning armies through the pass. He was happier thanthe old baron, when plundering was at its best, or the Roman commanderwith Rome cheering him. Mrs. Galland's smile had the bliss of familyparadise regained as she watched them in a swinging hand-clasp coming upthe terrace steps. The picture they made might have seemed effeminate tothe baron. Yet we are not so sure of that. Marta had always insistedthat he was perfectly human, too, according to his lights. Possibly theRoman commander swung hands with a Roman girl as soon as he could getaway from the crowd around his triumphal car."Mother, it's a shame that you missed it!" Marta called. "Why, there areso many great things in the air that it makes me feel a conservative!They're actually discussing disarmament and an international peace pactfor twenty years," she continued, "that nothing can break. Partow'sstatue in our capital is to have not victory, but peace on the fourthface of the plinth. They're even talking of putting up a statue to himin the Gray capital. Why not? The Grays have a statue of one of ourgreat poets and we of one of their great scientists. And, to be aspolite as they, we propose to honor one of their old generals who wasalmost as generous in victory as Partow. What a session of the schoolnext Sunday! We're going to have the children from both La Tir and SouthLa Tir!... The only trouble is that if Lanny keeps on giving Partow allthe credit for the good work he will succeed in making everybody thinkthat every time he winked after Partow's death it was according toPartow's directions for the conduct of the war!""Then I shall have the more time for you," replied Lanstron, who, beinga real soldier of his time, did not care for hero worship. It wasentirely contrary to Partow's teachings.***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LAST SHOT********** This file should be named 13738.txt or 13738.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/3/7/3/13738Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It is theirduty to reconnoiter and ascertain the strength of the enemy and to carrythe orders of the commander. For this service great speed is of theutmost importance. As all nations have increased the speed of their warships during the last few years, it has become necessary to build fasterdispatch boats. Although our new vessels of this class, Blitz, Pfeil,Greif, Jagd, and Wacht, fulfill the requirements, still greater speedwas deemed requisite, and steps were taken for the construction of theMeteor, which was launched at Kiel in 1890. This vessel is 262 ft. long,31 ft. wide, and has a draught of 13 ft., and a displacement of 950tons. There are two independent engines, each of which develops 2,500h.p., making a total of 5,000 h.p.; and each engine drives a screw. Whenboth engines are running with their full power, the Meteor has a speedof 24 knots (over 271/2 miles) an hour, which is equal to the speed of afreight train.[1] As the resistance of the water increases greatly withan increase in the speed of the vessel, the engines of the Meteor arevery large in comparison with the size of the vessel. The largestarmored vessel in the navy, the Konig Wilhelm, for example, has adisplacement of 9,557 tons, and its engines develop 8,000 h.p., drivingthe vessel at a rate of 14 knots an hour; that is, 0.84 h.p. to each tonof displacement, while in the Meteor there is 5.26 h.p. to each ton ofdisplacement. The Meteor has a crew of 90 men, and an armament of eightlight guns, and has no rigging; only one mast for signaling. Steam poweris used for raising the anchor, removing the ashes from the engine room,and for distilling water. The vessel is lighted with electricity, and isalso provided with electrical apparatus for search lights.--_IllustrirteZeitung_.[Footnote 1: This, we believe, is the fastest vessel of the kindafloat.--ED. S.A.][Illustration: THE NEW GERMAN DISPATCH BOAT METEOR.]       *       *       *       *       *THE RAISING OF THE ULUNDA.Shortly after the recovery of the Ulunda, below described, the NorthAmerican and West Indian squadron of the Royal Navy visited Halifax,Nova Scotia. The simple and novel means adopted for raising the shipattracted considerable attention among the officers of the fleet, and byway of stimulating the studies of the junior officers in this branch oftheir duties, a prize was offered for the best essay on the subject, tobe competed for by the midshipmen of the various ships. The essays wereadjudicated upon by Captain W.G. Stopford, of the flag ship--H.M.S.Bellerophon--and the first prize was awarded to the following paper,written by Mr. A. Gordon Smith, of H.M.S. Canada. The article needs noapology, but it is only just, says the _Engineer_, to mention the factthat the writer is not yet eighteen years of age.The steamship Ulunda, on the remarkable raising and recovery of whichthis paper is written, is an iron screw ship of 1,161 tons, until latelybelonging to the Furness line. It is a sister ship to the Damara, of thesame company, and was built and engined by Alex. Stephens, shipbuilderand engineer, at Glasgow, being fitted with compound vertical engines,of 200 nominal horse power, having two cylinders of 33 inches and 66inches diameter respectively, which are capable of sixty-fiverevolutions per minute, and give a speed of twelve knots an hour.For supplying steam to the engines there are two return-tube boilers,each having three furnaces, and there is also a donkey boiler, which isused in harbor for working the four steam winches on deck.She is divided into seven watertight compartments by athwartshipbulkheads. The foremost one is the usual collision bulkhead. Betweenthis and the foremost engine room bulkhead are Nos. 1 and 2 holds,separated by a watertight bulkhead. Abaft the after engine room are twomore holds, divided in the same manner as the forward ones, and asternis another compartment, in which all stores are kept. Coal bunkers forma protection for the engines and boilers. Fore and aft the ship, as lowdown as possible, are a number of ballast tanks, which can be filledwith or emptied of water as occasion requires to alter the trim of theship. Extending over all holds there is a strong iron lower deck, about8 feet below the upper deck, which is pierced with a hatch over eachhold immediately under a corresponding hatch in the upper deck, forstowing and unstowing cargo.[Illustration]In the engine room there are six steam pumps, two of them bilge pumps,worked by the main crossheads, for clearing the engine room of water.For pumping out the ballast tanks there are two more, which have theirown independent engines. The remaining two are for various purposes.Besides these there are several hand pumps on the upper deck.Having been built in 1885, the Ulunda is almost a new ship, and has beenused principally as a cargo steamer, though she is provided also with asaloon and staterooms for a few passengers. She was on her way from St.John, New Brunswick, to Halifax, when during a thick fog she struck onCowl Ledge, a reef between Bryer and Long Islands, on the southwestcoast of Nova Scotia, about half a mile from the shore. The cause of thedisaster was probably one of the strong tide eddies which exist in theBay of Fundy, and which had set her in toward the shore. It was calm atthe time, and she was making seven knots an hour; and, being close tothe shore, leads should have been going in the chains. Had thisprecaution been taken, very probably she would have been able to stop oranchor in time to avert this catastrophe. There was no cargo on board,it being intended to ship one at Halifax for London.When ashore on this reef she was sold by public auction at Halifax, andfell to a syndicate of private individuals for L440. These gentlemen atonce decided to raise her if possible, transport her into dock, andrepair her. They commissioned Captain Kelly, of the Princess Beatrice, aship then in harbor, to visit her and see what could be done for thatpurpose. He went with a hired crew to Annapolis, and from thenceproceeded to the steamer by means of a tug, a distance of about fortymiles. When they arrived they found the Ulunda with her head to sea, andher stern in only 2 ft. of water at low tide, with a list of 30 deg. toport and her foremast broken short off. At high tide the water flowedover the upper deck. On examination, the engine room was found full ofwater, which did not rise and fall with the tide, showing that it hadbeen filled at high tide through its skylight. No. 3 hold was also full,but had a slight leak, which was shown by the water falling slowly atlow tide and rising in the same manner at high water. The other threeholds were hopelessly leaky.Upon investigation, it was decided to pump out the engine roomcompartment and No. 3 hold, and to make the iron lower deck watertightover the remaining holds. For this purpose three powerful pumps, withthe necessary boilers, were obtained from Halifax, sent by rail toAnnapolis, and then shipped on board a tug, from which they were hoistedinto the Ulunda by means of the derricks on the mainmast. These werecentrifugal pumps, capable of discharging 2,000 gallons a minute each.One was placed in the engine room, another with its suction in No. 3hold, and when these two compartments were pumped dry, it was found thatin No. 3 hold the leak was easily kept under, while in the engine roomthere was no leak at all. The third pump was not used.[Illustration]In the two foremost holds 2,000 large casks were then placed, and allthe hatches over the leaky holds--Nos. 1, 2, and 4--were battened down,and made airtight with felt, pitch, tow, etc. A small hole was then madein Nos. 1 and 2 hatches, about 2 ft. square. When the tide had sunk itsfarthest, these two holes were closed and made perfectly airtight, inthe same manner as the hatches had been.Before this took place the whole of the lower deck over the badlydamaged holds had been prevented from bursting up by means of woodenshores, which were placed in rows about 4 ft. apart, and wedged firmlyinto position. The wood for the shores was obtained from Annapolis, andthe casks from St. John. The ship went ashore on August 26, 1890. Thiswork was commenced on September 8, and completed ten days afterward.The labor of repairing her could only be carried out at low tide, andonly then with the greatest difficulty, as the decks were very slipperywith weeds, etc., and inclined at an angle of 30 deg. Everything wasready for floating her off at high tide on the 18th, and the hatcheswere closed up on that day.She was raised off the rocks by the water rising and compressing the airin the two foremost holds, assisted by the buoyancy of the engine roomand No. 3 compartments. At high water the bow was afloat, but she wasaground by the stern. When, however, she was taken in tow by three tugs,she slowly slid down the reef and floated into deep water. One tug wasplaced on each bow, and the third was ahead. In this state she was towedinto West Port, a distance of four miles, and there beached on asheltered stretch of sand.The casks performed no part in floating the ship off, but were onlythere in case the great pressure of air should cause the escape of someof it, in which event all the space underneath the lower deck would soonhave been occupied with water instead of air. These casks would then, ofcourse, have served to displace a large amount of this water, and sokeep her afloat. Luckily the deck did not leak, and the barrels werethus not instrumental in the raising.When beached the hatches were taken off, the casks removed, and a falsedeck was built about 7 ft. below the lower deck, and about 10 ft. abovethe keel. This was used as the bottom of the ship to take her round toHalifax, and was built in the following manner: A kind of iron platform,about 2 ft. wide, runs along the sides of the holds in the Ulunda forstrengthening purposes, braced at intervals of 15 ft. by iron beamsacross the ship.On this was built the wooden deck. Beams for this deck were constructedof three 3 in. planks, and were laid down on the iron platform about 31/2ft. apart, and firmly wedged into the ship's side. On these beams alayer of 3 in. planks was placed in a fore-and-aft direction and naileddown; on this were three layers of felt, and on this again more plankswere laid down in the same direction as before.The whole deck was then carefully calked and the sides made watertightwith Portland cement. This deck only extended to the engine roombulkhead through the two foremost holds. It was prevented from burstingup by the pressure on the bottom of it, by means of shores, in the samemanner as the iron deck had been served before. Shores were, therefore,connecting the three decks--the upper deck, lower deck, and woodendeck--this being done to equalize the pressure on the _extempore_ deckand the two permanent decks, and thus gain additional strength.No deck was built in either of the after compartments, inasmuch as No. 3hold was kept clear of water as before by its pump, and in No. 4 thedeck was not necessary. To have built one there, as in the two foremostones, although it would have given a little more reserve of buoyancy tothe ship, would have raised the stern higher than the bows, and so wouldhave increased the upward pressure on the wooden deck, and thus haveincreased the liability to burst up. For the same reason, when raisingthe ship off the rocks, no compressed air was used in the after hold tolift the ship. The anchors and cables were in both cases transferredaft, for the same purpose, namely, to diminish the upward pressureforward. In the case of the wooden deck leaking, 200 of the same caskswere placed between it and the lower deck in the foremost hold to retainsome of the buoyancy of the forepart, which would otherwise be lost. Nodecks were built in the compartment before the collision bulkhead, asvery little buoyancy was lost by that space being full of water, and allthat was there was confined to that compartment by the bulkhead and theiron lower deck.While all these foregoing arrangements were being made for the exclusionof water from the inside of the ship, the engineers and firemen wereemployed clearing the engine room of some fifty tons of coal which hadbeen washed from the open bunkers into the machinery by the sea, whenthe engine room was full and the ship on the reef. The greatestdifficulty was experienced in digging out and excavating the enginesfrom the coal and dirt, and still greater was the labor of cleaning allthe mechanism and putting everything once more in an efficient steamingcondition. But all was finished soon after the decks had been completed,and on October 12 she was ready for sea. On the following day she wasfloated off and started on her perilous voyage to Halifax, using her ownengines, and making about five and a half knots an hour. Her steam pumpswere by this time all ready for service to assist the big ones on deckin an emergency. She anchored once on her way round, at Shelburne, onthe coast of Nova Scotia, arriving at Halifax at 1 p.m. on October 17.The trip round was a very anxious time for all hands, more especiallywhen they were overtaken by a fresh gale in the Atlantic, for theforward deck was very liable to be burst up with the increased pressureon it caused by the pitching of the ship; also the rudder was entirelyunable to bear any strain on it, because the lower part of the rudderpost was unconnected with the stern post, part of the stern framingwhich connects the two having been broken off. Any heavy sea wastherefore likely to carry away the rudder altogether, or the sameaccident might happen if the helm was put down too hard, rendering theship unmanageable.She was placed in dry dock as soon as she arrived at Halifax, and it wasnot until then that the full extent of the damages, caused by thepounding on the rocks, could be fully realized. The first 20 feet of thekeel had been torn completely out, and about 30 feet from the sternthere was an immense hole, with the thick plates torn and bent likepaper, the framing and stanchions being twisted into all sorts of shapesalmost beyond recognition. Under the foremast the bottom of the ship wasbent up in the form of an arch, having been raised 4 feet above itsnatural position, with an immense hole punctured on the starboard side,besides several smaller ones. Also the aftermost 20 feet of keel wastorn and jagged, with several small holes in the skin, and the lowerportion of the stern framing was broken off, leaving the rudder post tohang down unsupported at its extremity. It would strike one on lookingat these gaping wounds that it would be nearly impossible to place theUlunda in an efficient condition again, but the work of renewing thedamaged plates is being carried out at a great rate, and in threemonths' time it is hoped that all the repairs necessary will becompleted and the ship once more doing her duty. She has already costher owners some 10,000, and 40,000 are estimated to cover all futurerepairs.The foremast was snapped off in a somewhat novel manner. She was pivotedon the rocks by her bows, and at high tide, the day after she struck, abreeze sprang up and turned her round; the tide sinking again, the wholeweight of the ship came on the bottom of the ship where she was thentouching, namely, just on the spot where the foremost was stepped, andright astern, leaving the center portion of the ship unsupported. Thiscaused the foremast to rise, and it being held down by wire rigging, itsnapped in several places, at the same time tearing up the shrouds fromthe deck. This accounts also for the arch-like bulge in the bottom atthat spot and for the damages astern; also for the fact that CaptainKelly discovered the ship with her head to sea.Another incident happened when the ship was just rising off the rocks,which nearly resulted in a catastrophe. When the ship was just beginningto lift, the leak in No. 3 compartment was found to be gaining on itspump. A diver was at once sent down to ascertain the cause, and he foundthat a small hole, about 6 inches square, had been punctured in theskin, which until then had been kept tight by the rock that had causedit. It was necessary to close this leak at once. An iron bolt, which wasscrewed for a nut at one end, was obtained and passed through a strongpiece of wood about 2 feet square. The inside of this board wascushioned with canvas and oakum, and it was taken down outside the shipby the diver and placed over the hole, with the feathered end of thebolt sticking through the hole; the diver was then sent down inside thehold, and with a nut set up the whole cushion until the flow of waterwas stopped. The leak was thus stopped which had threatened thearrangements for floating the ship with failure.It has been seen that the method of raising the Ulunda was very simple.She was floated off by the rising tide. If there had been only a smallinstead of an 18 foot rise, some other mode would have to have beenadopted. No attempt was made to stop any of the leaks, except the onejust stated, but a deck above the lacerations was made water-tight, andthis, together with the sides of the ship hanging down, formed a kind ofdiving bell, the pressure of air in which, caused by the water outside,acting on this deck, being the principal means of buoying up the ship,assisted by the buoyancy of the two water-tight compartments. The deckafterward built was only necessary for the safety of the ship, she beingable to float without it; but it would have been suicidal to trust theship on the Atlantic in the state she was in when raised, since with anyswell on, the compressed air would escape and its place be taken bywater, the buoyancy necessary for keeping her afloat being thus lost.It only remains to be said that the risks run in steaming around toHalifax by herself were, as it was, very great, and had the wind and seabeen less favorable, the undertaking would probably have proved adisastrous failure.       *       *       *       *       *THE THERMIC MOTOR OF THE FUTURE?Up to recent years there was no reason for putting the question thatforms the title of this article, for it was admitted by all that theconversion of thermic energy, or heat produced by the combustion ofcoal, into mechanical energy or work could no longer be effectedeconomically except by having recourse to steam. In ordinary language,and even to manufacturers, steam engine was the equivalent of thermicmotor, and it would not have occurred to any one to use anything elsebut steam to effect the transformation.The progress that has been made during the last twenty years in thethermatic study and construction of gas motors (without speaking of hotair motors) has shown that the use of steam is not absolutelyindispensable for the production of work, and it has demonstrated that,as regards dynamic product, the gas motor preserves the advantage,although the relatively high price of the illuminating gas employed inthe production of the motive power generally renders the use of thiscombustible more costly than steam, especially for high powers.The economic truth of twenty years ago, when gas motors absorbed 1,500liters per horse hour and exceeded with difficulty an effective power offrom 8 to 10 horses, has become less and less certain, when theconsumption has successively descended to 1,200, 1,000, 800 and even to600 liters of gas per horse hour, the power of the motors risinggradually to 25, 50 and 100 horses with a motor having a single cylinderof a diameter of 57 centimeters.[Illustration: FIG. 1.--CORLISS ENGINE AND BOILER OF 100 INDICATEDH.P.--ELEVATION AND PLAN.A, cylinder; B, condenser; C, boiler; R, feed water heater; D, chimney.]But these results did not suffice, and it was desired to do better stillby dispensing with the use of high priced illuminating gas. An endeavorwas made to obviate the difficulty by manufacturing a special gas forthe motive power, as steam is produced for the same object, bydistilling coal, carbureting air, producing water gas by the Dowsonprocess, and by other equivalent processes.The strides made in this direction were finally crowned with success,and the results obtained in the recent experiments due to Mr. Aime Witz,an undoubted authority in the matter, permit of affirming that now andhereafter, in many circumstances, a gas generator supplying a gas motorwill be able to advantageously dethrone a steam boiler supplying a steamengine of the same power.These conclusions, which tend to nothing less than to limit the reign ofthe steam engine, are confirmed on the one hand by an experiment carriedon for the last two years in the Barataud flour mill of Marseilles,where a 50 h.p. "Simplex" motor has been running day and night forseveral months without stopping, and consuming but about 500 grammes ofEnglish anthracite per effective horse hour, and, on another hand, bysome personal experiments of Mr. Witz's, to which we shall shortlyadvert, and whence there results a sensibly equivalent production for amotor of 100 indicated h.p., corresponding to a power of 75 effectivehorses.Before establishing, with Mr. Witz, a comparison of the two systems inpressure, steam or gas, let us state in a few words in what the latterconsists, the steam engine and the boiler that supplies it being so wellknown that no description is necessary.The Dowson gas generator does not differ essentially from the numerousgenerators devised during recent years for the manufacture of gaseouscombustibles, the use of which is so often convenient. The motor that itsupplies is the most powerful single cylinder one that has hitherto beenconstructed. It is of 100 indicated h.p., and its normal angularvelocity is 100 revolutions per minute. On trial it has yielded 112indicated h.p., and 76.8 effective h.p., corresponding to an organicrendering of 69 per cent. This motor, elaborated by Messrs.Delamare-Bouteville & Malandin, of Rouen, operates by compression and infour periods, according to the Beau de Rochas cycle. We give the aspectof it in Fig. 3. In the first period the mixture of air and gas issucked in, in the second it is compressed, in the third it is ignited,and in the fourth the products of combustion are expelled.[Illustration: FIG. 2.--SIMPLEX MOTOR, DOWSON GENERATOR OF 100 INDICATEDH.P.--ELEVATION AND PLAN.A, cylinder; B, gas conduit; C, rubber pockets; D. gasometer; E,purifier; F, scrubber; G, hydraulic main; H, cooling pipe; I steaminjector; K, steam boiler and superheater; L, gas generator; M, charger;N, discharge of the motor.]Ignition is effected electrically by a series of sparks playing betweentwo platinum points in the slide valve, and this permits of regulatingthe instant of ignition through the edges of the orifices. The angularvelocity is regulated by a Watt's governor, which secures an isochronismof the motion independently of the charge.The setting in motion of so powerful an engine is effected very easilyby means of an arrangement that permits of introducing into thecylinder, while the piston is in the center of the stroke, a mixture ofair and gas whose pressure is sufficient at the arrival to expel theinert products. After this the ignition takes place, and the explosionis sufficient to set the motor in motion.The trials made by Mr. Witz with the motor represented in Fig. 3 gavethe following results, deduced from an experiment of 68 hours. Thefigures relate to one effective horse power, measured with the brakeupon the shaft of the motor.  Consumption of anthracite.              516 grammes.       "       " coke.                     96    "  Consumption of water for the injection    of steam.                               0.487 liters.  Consumption of water for cooling    the cylinder.                          50.0     "  Consumption of oil for lubricating    the cylinder.                           3.74 grammes.  Consumption of grease.                    0.45    "  Consumption of gas reduced to    0 deg. C. and to 760 mm.                2,370    liters.This last figure will appear very high, but the fact must not be lostsight of that it is a question of poor gas, the net cost of which variesbetween one and two centimes per cubic meter, and the calorific power ofwhich is but 1,487 heat units per cubic meter of constant volume, andsupposing the steam condensed. This combustion of 612 grammes ofcombustible per effective horse hour is remarkable, and fully shows whatmay be expected of the gas motor supplied by a gas generator in puttingto profit certain improvements that will hereafter be possible, such,for example, as the lightening of the movable parts of the motor, thebettering of its organic rendering (now quite feeble), the use of betteroils, the reduction of the consumption of water, the superheating of thesteam injected into the gas generator, etc.A well constructed steam engine, carefully kept in repair and as muchimproved as it is possible to make it, would certainly consume twice asmuch coal to produce the same quantity of effective work, say at least1,200 grammes per horse hour. But, as has been objected with reason, itdoes not suffice to compare the figures as to the consumption of fuel inorder to institute a serious comparison between the steam engine and themotor using poor gas.The gas generator requires the use of English anthracite, while a steamboiler is heated with any kind of coal. The prices of unity of weightare therefore very different. Moreover, the gas motor necessitates animmense amount of water for the washing of the gas and the cooling ofthe cylinder, through circulation in the jacket. It is well to keep thisfact in view. On another hand, the lubrification of the cylindersrequires a profusion of oil whose flashing point must be at a very hightemperature, else it would burn at every explosion and fill the cylinderwith coom. Such oil is very costly.Does not the expenditure of oil in large motors largely offset thesaving in coal? And then, gas motors are sold at high prices, as are gasgenerators, and this installation necessarily requires the addition of alarge gasometer, scrubbers, etc. The wear of these apparatus is rapid,and if we take into account the interest and amortization of the capitalengaged, we shall find that the use of steam is still more economical.The obstruction caused by bulky apparatus is another inconvenience, uponwhich it is unnecessary to dwell. In a word, the question is a verycomplex one. We look at but one side of it in occupying ourselves onlywith the coal consumed, and we shall certainly expose those who allowedthemselves to be influenced by the seductive figures of consumption tobitter disappointment.To answer such objections Mr. Aime Witz has established a completeparallel between the two systems, in which he looks at the question froma theoretical and practical and scientific and financial point of view.Considered as a transformation apparatus, a steam motor burning goodCardiff coal in a Galloway boiler with feed water heaters will consume(with a good condensing engine utilizing an expansion of a sixth) from1,100 to 1,250 grammes of coal per effective horse hour, whichcorresponds to a rough coefficient of utilization of 9.7 per cent. A gasgenerator supplying a gas motor burning Swansea anthracite and Noeuxcoke, medium quality, will consume 516 grammes of anthracite and 90 ofcoke to produce 2,370 liters of gas giving 1,487 heat units per cubicmeter. Of the 3,524 heat units furnished to the motor by the 2,370liters of gas, the motor will convert 18 per cent. into disposablemechanical work.With the boiler, the gross rendering of the whole is 7 per cent. Withthe gas generator it reaches 12.7 per cent. From a theoretical point ofview the advantage therefore rests with the gas generator and gas motor.In order to compare the net cost of the units of work, from anindustrial point of view, it is necessary to form estimates ofinstallation, costs of keeping in repair, interest and amortization.Figs. 1 and 2 represent, on the same scale, the installations necessaryin each of these systems. The legends indicate the names of thedifferent apparatus in each installation. The following table showsthat, as regards the surface occupied, the advantage is again with thegas generator and gas motor:                     Steam Engine.      Gas Motor.  Surface covered.       85 sq. m.       72 sq. m.  Surface exposed.       33    "         43    "                        ---             ---  Total surface.        118    "        115    "The estimates of installation formed by Mr. Witz set forth the expenserelative to the capital engaged exactly at the same figure of 32,000francs for a motive power of 75 effective horses. The expenses ofkeeping in repair, interest, etc., summed up, show that the cost per dayof 10 hours is 47.9 francs for the steam engine and 39.6 for the gasmotor, say a saving of 8.3 francs per day, or about 2,500 francs for ayear of 300 days' work.The gas motor, therefore, effects a great saving, while at the same timeoccupying less space, consuming less water and operating just as well.With Mr. Witz we cheerfully admit all the advantages that he so clearlyestablishes with his perfect competency in such matters, but there stillremain two points upon which we wish to be enlightened. Are not thestarting up, the operation and the keeping in repair of a gas generatoractually more complicated and more delicate than the same elements of asteam engine? Does not the poor gas manufactured in a gas generatorpresent, from a hygienic point of view, danger sufficiently great toproscribe the use of such apparatus in many circumstances?Such are the points upon which we should like to be enlightened beforeunreservedly sharing Mr. Witz's enthusiasm, which, however, isjustified, economically speaking, by the magnificent results of theexperiments made by the learned engineer.--_La Nature_.[Illustration: FIG. 3.--GAS MOTOR OF 100 INDICATED HORSE POWER.]       *       *       *       *       *IMPROVED PNEUMATIC HAMMER.We publish illustrations of a Thwaites suspension pneumatic power 1/2 cwt.hammer of a new design, for planishing pipes and plates, for which weare indebted to _Engineering_. As indicated in the perspective view(Fig. 1) the mechanism is supported at the center of a cross girderresting on two cast iron square pillars, box section, each bolted downto the foundations by four 11/4 in. diameter bolts. The measurements ofthese columns and girders are given in Figs. 2 and 3, the former anelevation of the hammer and the latter a plan, partly in section, of thecross girder, while Fig. 4 is a cross section showing the arrangementsfor operating the hammer. In the center is a cast iron guide for workingthe ram, the guide being extended on two sides to receive the disk crankjournals, 2 in. in diameter by 31/2 in. long. The disk cranks areconnected to a hollow steel ram by a connecting rod. The ram is dividedinside into two compartments, each having a phosphor bronze air piston.These are connected together by a steel piston rod, the top air pistonforming a connection for the small end of the connecting rod. Theoutside diameter of the ram is 33/4 in., and the diameter of the airpistons 23/4 in. and 2-7/8 in. respectively. Cottered into the bottom ofthe ram is a steel pallet holder with a dovetail, so that the pallet canbe renewed or exchanged for one of another shape when required. Keyed onto the crankshaft is a flanged pulley 10 in. in diameter by 31/4 in.between flanges. There is also an overhead countershaft with strapshifting arrangement. At the side of one of the columns a hand lever andquadrant are provided, as shown in the perspective view and in Fig. 2,for working an arrangement for tightening the belt when the machine isworking. To this arrangement is connected a powerful brake which stopsthe machine in a few revolutions. It will be seen that the brake isapplied as the belt is slackened for stopping the machine. Forplanishing pipes or tubes a long wrought iron mandrel is providedmounted on two cast iron carriages, each having four flanged wheels forrunning on rails. The hammer is arranged so that tubes 4 feet indiameter can be worked for planishing plates. A pallet is fastened onthe top of one of the mandrel carriages, Figs. 5 to 8 showing thedetails of the carriages. The general dimensions are: Distance betweenpillars, 6 feet; height under girder, 5 feet; height from ground to topof mandrel, 4 feet 13/4 in.; and length of stroke, 5 in. This machine iscapable of delivering 500 blows per minute. The constructors are Messrs.Thwaites Brothers, Limited, Bradford, Yorkshire.[Illustration: FIG. 1.][Illustration: SUSPENSION PNEUMATIC POWER HAMMER.]       *       *       *       *       *SIBLEY COLLEGE LECTURES.--1890-91.BY THE CORNELL UNIVERSITY NON-RESIDENT LECTURERS IN MECHANICALENGINEERING.COMPRESSED AIR PRODUCTION.By WM. L. SAUNDERS, C.E., of New York.I cannot but realize as I stand before you that I would be very muchmore at home were I in your midst. I feel but little older and so verymuch less wise than when I sat in the class room an undergraduate of theUniversity of Pennsylvania, that I trust I may expect you to give methis afternoon, not only your attention, but your sympathy.The present situation is not without suggestions of my own experience. Irecall a lecture in the ordinary course, given by our professor ofmining, whose struggles with the English language were quite asconspicuous as were our efforts to tell what he was driving at. He wasdescribing an ordinary windlass hoist used at the shaft of a mine. Hesaid "There is a windlass at de top of de shaft around which is coiled arope, on de two ends of which is fastened two er--er--_pans_, one ofwhich is a _bucket_ and de oder a _platform_." I mention this because Ishall ask you to attribute my shortcomings in this lecture, not so muchto my lack of familiarity with my native tongue, as to--well, because Iwas not educated at Cornell University.We all know what free air is. You who are privileged to live upon thesebeautiful hills overlooking Ithaca and the lake, doubtless know moreabout free air than we do who are choked in the dusty confines of NewYork City. Compressed air is simply air under pressure. That pressuremay be an active one, as in the case of the piston of an air compressor;or passive, as with the walls of a receiver or transmission pipe. It isusual to define compressed air as air increased in density by pressure,but we know that we may produce compressed air by heat alone. A simpleillustration of this is the pressure which will blow a cork from anempty bottle when that bottle has been placed near the fire. Here wehave pressure, or compressed air, in the bottle produced by heat alone.Having defined compressed air, we must next define heat; for in dealingwith compressed air, we are brought face to face with the complex lawsof Thermodynamics. We cannot produce compressed air without alsoproducing heat, and we cannot use compressed air as a power withoutproducing cold. Based on the material theory of heat, we would say thatwhen we take a certain volume of free air and compress it into a smallerspace, we get an increase in temperature because we have the heat of onevolume occupying less space, but no one at this date accepts thematerial theory of heat. Your distinguished director, ProfessorThurston, in discussing "Steam and its Rivals," in the _Forum_, said:"The science of Thermodynamics teaches that heat and mechanical energyare only different phases of the same thing, the one being the motion ofmolecules, and the other that of masses." This is the accepted theory ofheat. In other words, we do not believe that there is any such _thing_as heat, but that what we call heat is only the sensible effect ofmotion. In the cylinder of an air compressor the energy of the piston isconverted into molecular motion in the air and the result, or theequivalent, is heat. A higher temperature means an increased speed ofvibration, and a lower temperature means that this speed of vibration isreduced. If I hold an open cylinder in my left hand and a piston in myright, and place the piston within the cylinder, I here have a confinedvolume of air at the temperature and the pressure of this room. Theseparticles of air are in motion and produce heat and pressure inproportion to that motion. Now if I press the piston to a point in thecenter of the cylinder, that is, to one-half the stroke, I here decreasethe distance between the cylinder head and the piston just one-half,hence each molecule of air strikes twice as many blows upon the pistonand head in traveling the same distance and the pressure is doubled. Wehave also produced about 116 degrees of heat, because we have expended acertain amount of work upon the air; the air has done no work in return,but we have increased the energy of molecular vibration in the air andthe result is heat.But what of this heat? What harm does it do? If I instantly release thepiston which I hold at one-half stroke it will return to its originalposition, less only a little friction. I have, therefore, recovered all,or nearly all, the power spent in compressing the air. I have simplypressed a spring, and have let it recover. We see what a perfect springcompressed air is. We see the possibility of expending one horse powerof energy upon air and getting almost exactly one horse power in return.Such would be the case provided we used the compressed air power_immediately and at the point where the compression takes place_. Thisis never done, but the heat which has been boxed up[1] in the air islost by radiation, and we have lost power. Let us see to what extentthis takes place.[Footnote 1: I use material terms because they add to simplicity ofexpression and notwithstanding the fact that heat is vibration.]Thirteen cubic feet of free air at normal temperature and barometricpressure weigh about one pound. We have seen that 116 degrees of heathave been liberated at half stroke. The gauge pressure at this pointreaches 24 pounds. According to Mariotte's law, "The temperatureremaining constant, the volume varies inversely as the pressure," weshould have 15 pounds gauge pressure. The difference, 9 pounds,represents the effect of the heat of compression in increasing therelative volume of the air.[Illustration: FIG. 1.: CURVES OF COMPRESSION ILLUSTRATEDIN VOLUMES,PRESSURES, AND TEMPERATURES.]The specific heat of air under constant pressure being 0.238, we have0.238 x 116 = 27.6 heat units produced by compressing one pound orthirteen cubic feet of free air into one-half its volume. 27.6 x 772(Joule's equivalent) = 21,307 foot pounds. We know that 33,000 footpounds is one horse power, and we see how easily about two-thirds of ahorse power in heat units may be produced and lost in compressing onepound of air. I would mention here that exactly this same loss issuffered when compressed air does work in an engine and is expanded downto its original pressure. In other words, _the heat of compression andthe cold of expansion are in degree equal_.Experiments made by M. Regnault and others on the influence of heat onpressures and volumes of gases have enabled us to fix the absolute zeroof temperature as -461 degrees Fahrenheit. This point, 461 degrees belowzero, is the theoretical point at which a volume of air is reduced tonothing. The volume of air at different temperatures is in proportion tothe absolute temperature, and on this basis Box gives us the followingtable:TABLE l.--OF THE VOLUME AND WEIGHT OF DRY AIR AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURESUNDER A CONSTANT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE OF 29.92 INCHES OF MERCURY IN THEBAROMETER (ONE ATMOSPHERE), THE VOLUME AT 32 deg.

--------+-----------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------A cubic foot of free air at a pressure of one atmosphere (equal to 14.7pounds above a vacuum) at a temperature of 60 degrees, when compressedto twenty-five atmospheres, will register 367.5 pounds above a vacuum(352.8 pounds gauge pressure), will occupy a volume of 0.1020 cubicfoot, will have a temperature of 864 degrees, and the total increase oftemperature is 804 degrees.The thermal results of air compression and expansion are shown by theaccompanying diagram.The horizontal and vertical lines are the measures of volumes, pressuresand temperatures. The figures at the top indicate pressures inatmospheres above a vacuum, the corresponding figures at the bottomdenote pressures by the gauge. At the right are volumes from one toone-tenth. At the left are degrees of temperatures from zero to 1,000Fahrenheit. The two curves which begin at the upper left hand corner andextend to the lower right are the lines of compression or expansion.The upper one being the _Adiabatic_ curve, or that which represents thepressure at any point on the stroke with the heat developed bycompression remaining in the air; the lower is the _Isothermal_, or thepressure curve uninfluenced by heat. The three curves which begin at thelower left hand corner and rise to the right are heat curves andrepresent the increase of temperature corresponding with differentpressures and volumes, assuming in one case that the temperature of theair before admission to the compressor is zero, in another sixtydegrees, and in another one hundred degrees.Beginning with the adiabatic curve, we find that for one volume of airwhen compressed without cooling the curve intersects the first verticalline at a point between 0.6 and 0.7 volume, the gauge pressure being14.7 pounds. If we assume that this air was admitted to the compressorat a temperature of zero, it will reach about 100 degrees when the gaugepressure is 14.7 pounds. We find this by following down the first lineintersected by the adiabatic curve to the point where the zero heatcurve intersects this same line, the reading being given in figures tothe left immediately opposite. If the air had been admitted to thecompressor at 60 degrees, it would register about 176 degrees at 14.7pounds gauge pressure. If the air were 100 degrees before compression,it would go up to about 230 degrees at this pressure. Following thisadiabatic curve until it intersects line No. 5, representing a pressureof five atmospheres above a vacuum (58.8 lb. gauge pressure), we seethat the total increase of temperature on the zero heat curve is about270 degrees, for the 60 degree curve it is about 370 degrees, and forthe 100 degree curve it is about 435 degrees. The diagram shows thatwhen a volume of air is compressed adiabatically to 21 atmospheres (294lb. gauge pressure), it will occupy a volume a little more thanone-tenth; the total increase of temperature with an initial temperatureof zero is about 650 degrees; with 60 degrees initial temperature it is800 degrees, and with 100 degrees initial it is 900 degrees. It will beobserved that the zero heat curve is flatter than the others, indicatingthat when free air is admitted to a compressor cold, the relativeincrease of temperature is less than when the air is hot. This points tothe importance of low initial temperature.We have now seen that the economical production of compressed airdepends upon the following conditions:(1) A low initial temperature.(2) Thorough cooling during compression.It has been demonstrated by experiments made in France that the powerrequired to compress moist air is less than that for dry air. A tableshowing the power required to compress moist and dry air has beenprepared from the data of M. Mallard and shows that for five atmospheresthe work expended in compressing one pound of dry air is 58,500 footpounds, while that for moist air is 52,500 foot pounds. In expansionalso moisture in the air adds to the economy, but in both cases thesaving of power is not great enough to compensate for the manydisadvantages due to the presence of water. Mr. Norman Selfe, of theEngineering Association of N.S.W., has compiled a table which shows someimportant theoretical conditions involved in producing compressed air.So much for the theory of compression. We now come to the practicalproduction of compressed air.The first record that we have of the use of an air compressor is atRamsgate Harbor, Kent, in the year 1788. Smeaton invented this "pump"for use in a diving apparatus. In 1851, William Cubitt, at RochesterBridge, and a little later an engineer, Brunel, at Saltash, usedcompressed air for bridge work. But the first notable application ofcompressed air is due to Professor Colladon, of Geneva, whose plans wereadopted at the Mont Cenis tunnel. M. Sommeiller developed the Colladonidea and constructed the compressed air plant illustrated in Fig. 2.[Illustration: FIG. 2.]The Sommeiller compressor was operated as a ram, utilizing a naturalhead of water to force air at 80 pounds pressure into a receiver. Thecolumn of water contained in the long pipe on the side of the hill wasstarted and stopped automatically, by valves controlled by engines. Theweight and momentum of the water forced a volume of air with such shockagainst a discharge valve that it was opened and the air was dischargedinto the tank; the valve was then closed, the water checked; a portionof it was allowed to discharge and the space was filled with air, whichwas in turn forced into the tank. The efficiency of this compressor wasabout 50 per cent.At the St. Gothard tunnel, begun in 1872, Prof. Colladon firstintroduced the injection of water in the form of spray into thecompressor cylinder to absorb the heat of compression.[Illustration: FIG. 3.]Fig. 3 illustrates the air cylinder of the Dubois-Francois type ofcompressor, which was the best in use about the year 1876. Thiscompressor was exhibited at the Centennial Exposition and was adopted byMr. Sutro in the construction of the Sutro tunnel. A characteristicfeature seems to be to get as much water into the cylinder as possible.The water which flooded the bottom of the cylinder arose from thevoluminous injection; this water was pushed into the end of the cylinderand some of it escaped with the air through the discharge valve.An improved pattern of this compressor is shown in Fig. 4.[Illustration: FIG. 4.]These illustrations are interesting from an historical point of view, asindicating the line of thought which early designers of air-compressingmachinery followed. As the necessity for compressed air power grew,inventors turned their attention to the construction of air-compressingengines that would combine _efficiency_ with _light weight_ and _economyof space and cost_. The trade demanded compressors at inaccessiblelocalities, and in many cases it was preferred to sacrifice isothermalresults to simplicity of construction and low cost.It is evident that an air compressor which has the steam cylinder andthe air cylinder on a single straight rod will apply the power in themost direct manner, and will involve the simplest mechanics in theconstruction of its parts. It is evident, however, that this straightline, or direct construction, results in an engine which has thegreatest power at a time when there is no work to perform. At thebeginning of the stroke steam at the boiler pressure is admitted behindthe piston, and, as the air piston at that time is also at the initialpoint in the stroke, it has only free air against it. The two pistonsmove simultaneously, and the resistance in the air cylinder rapidlyincreases as the air is compressed. To get economical results it is, ofcourse, necessary to cut off in the steam cylinder, so that at the endof the stroke, when the steam pressure is low, as indicated by thedotted line (Fig. 5), the air pressure is high, as similarly indicated.The early direct-acting compressor used steam at full pressurethroughout the stroke. The Westinghouse pump, applied to locomotives, isbuilt on this principle, and those who have observed it work haveperhaps noticed that its speed of stroke is not uniform, but that itmoves rapidly at the beginning, gradually reducing its speed, and seemsto labor, until the direction of stroke is reversed. This constructionis admitted to be wasteful, but in some cases, notably that of theWestinghouse pump, economy in steam consumption is sacrificed tolightness and economy of space.[Illustration: FIG. 5.]Many efforts were made to equalize the power and resistance byconstructing the air compressor on the crank shaft principle, puttingthe cranks at various angles, and by angular positions of steam and aircylinders. Several types are shown in Fig. 6.[Illustration: FIG. 6.]Angular positions of the cylinder involve expensive construction andunsteadiness. Experience has conclusively proved that it does not pay tobuild air compressors with vertical cylinders, and moreover we havefound out that there is nothing in the apparent difficulty in equalizingthe strains in a direct-acting engine. It is simply necessary to addenough weight to the moving parts, that is, to the piston, piston rod,fly wheel, etc., to cut off early in the stroke and secure rotativespeed with the most economical results and with the cheapestconstruction. It is obvious that the theoretically perfect aircompressor is a direct-acting one with a conical air cylinder, the baseof the cone being nearest the steam cylinder. This, from a practicalpoint of view, is impossible. Mr. Hill, in referring to the fallacioustendencies of pneumatic engineers to equalize power and resistance inair compressors, says: "The ingenuity of mechanics has been taxed and agreat variety of devices have been employed. It is usual to build on thepattern of presses which do their work in a few inches of the end of thestroke and employ heavy fly wheels, extra strong connections, andprodigious bed plates. Counterpoise weights are also attached to suchmachines; the steam is allowed to follow full stroke, steam cylindersare placed at awkward angles to the air-compressing cylinders and themotion conveyed through yokes, toggles, levers; and many joints andother devices are used, many of which are entire failures, while someare used with questionable engineering skill and very poor results."[Illustration: FIG. 7.]Fig. 7 illustrates the theory of Duplex Air Compressors. The hydraulicpiston or plunger compressor is largely used in Germany and elsewhere onthe Continent of Europe, but the duplex may be said to be the standardtype of European compressor at the present time. It is also largely usedin this country. Fig. 7 shows the four cylinders of a duplex compressorin two positions of the stroke. It will be observed that each steamcylinder has an air cylinder connected directly to the tail rod of itspiston, so that it is a direct-acting machine, except in that thestrains are transmitted through a single fly wheel, which is attached toa crank shaft connecting the engines. In other words, a duplex aircompressor would be identical with a duplex steam engine were it not forthe fact that air cylinders are connected to the steam piston rods. Theresult is, as shown in Fig. 7, that, at that point of the strokeindicated in the top section, the upper right hand steam cylinder,having steam at full pressure behind its piston, is doing work throughthe angle of the crank shaft upon the air in the lower left handcylinder. At this point of the stroke the opposite steam cylinder has areduced steam pressure and is doing little or no work, because theopposite air cylinder is beginning its stroke. Referring now to thelower section, it will be seen that the conditions are reversed. Onecrank has turned the center, and that piston which in the upper sectionwas doing the greatest work is now doing little or nothing, while thelabor of the engine has been transferred to those cylinders which amoment before had been doing no work.There are some advantages in this duplex construction, and somedisadvantages. The crank shafts being set quartering, as is the usualconstruction, the engine may be run at low speed without getting on thecenter. Each half being complete in itself, it is possible to detach theone when only half the capacity is required. The power and resistancebeing equalized through opposite cylinders, large fly wheels are notnecessary. Strange to say, the American practice seems to be to attachenormous fly wheels to duplex air compressors. It is difficult tojustify this apparently useless expense in view of the facts shown inFig. 7. A fly wheel does not furnish power, nor does it add to theeconomy of an engine except in so far as it enables it to cut off earlyin the stroke, and to equalize the power and resistance. In other words,a fly wheel is not a _source_ of power, and in many cases it is only ameans by which we accomplish rotative speed. It takes power to movematter, and assuming that other conditions are equal, every engine thatcarries a fly wheel that is larger than i
