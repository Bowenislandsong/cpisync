ould let me know.""How? At the top of her voice?""You're far too curious, Wally.""Semaphore, of course," drawled Hart. "When are you going to marry thegirl, Jack!""As soon as this infernal business has blown over.""You haven't asked her, I gather?""No.""Tell me when you do, and I'll hie me to London town, though in torridJune. You're unbearable in love.""The lash of your wit cuts deeply sometimes," said Grant quietly."Dash it all, old chap, I was talking at random. Very well. I'll dopenance in sackcloth and ashes by remaining here, and applauding yourpoetic efforts. I'll even help. I'm a dab at sonnets."Meanwhile, Mr. Siddle had regained his poise."I meant nothing offensive to the donor of the beer," he said, tuning hisvoice to an apologetic note. "But I take it Robinson is conductingcertain inquiries, and I imagine that his superiors demand a degree ofcircumspection in such conditions. That is all.""Surely you do not rank with the stupid crowd in its suspicions of Mr.Grant?" said the girl."I'm pleased to think you refuse to class me with the gossip-mongers ofSteynholme, Doris," was the guarded answer.There had been no reference to the murder during tea, which was servedas soon as the chemist came in. The visitor had tabled a copy of acurrent medical journal containing an article on the therapeuticqualities of honey, so the talk was lifted at once into an atmosphere farremoved from crime. Doris was grateful for his tact. When her father wentto the office she brought Mr. Siddle into the garden solely in pursuanceof her promise to the detective, though convinced that there would be nooutcome save a few labored compliments to herself. And now, by accident,as it were, the death of Adelaide Melhuish thrust itself into theirconversation. Perhaps it was her fault."No," she said candidly. "No one who has known you for seven years, Mr.Siddle, could possibly accuse you of spreading scandal.""Seven years! Is it so long since I came to Steynholme? Sometimes, itappears an age, but more often I fancy the calendar must be in error.Why, it seems only the other day that I saw you in a short frock,bowling a hoop.""A tom-boy occupation," laughed Doris. "But dad encouraged that andskipping, as the best possible means of exercise.""He was right. Look how straight and svelte you are! Few, if any, amongour community can have watched your progress to womanhood as closely asI. You see, living opposite, as I do, I kept track of you moreintimately than your other neighbors."Siddle was trimming his sails cleverly. The concluding sentence robbedhis earlier comments of their sentimental import."If we live long enough we may even see each other in the sere and yellowleaf," said Doris flippantly."I would ask no greater happiness," came the quiet reply, and Doris couldhave bitten her tongue for according him that unguarded opening. Suddenlyavailing herself of the advice which the detective, like Hamlet, hadgiven to the players, she gazed musingly at the fair panorama of TheHollies and its gardens, with the two young men seated on the lawn. Bythis time Minnie was staging tea, and the picture looked idyllic enough.Doris saw, out of the tail of her eye, that her companion was watchingher furtively, though apparently absorbed in the scene. He moistened histhin lips with his tongue."As a study in contrasts, that would be hard to beat," he said, after along pause."Contrasts!" she echoed."Well, yes. Even an uncontentious man like myself can hardly fail tocompare Sunday afternoon with Tuesday morning.""Why not Monday night?" she flashed."Monday night, in part, remains a mystery yet to be unveiled. I blotMonday night from my mind. I have no alternative, being on the jurywhich has to arrive at a just verdict. Now, if Fred Elkin were here, hewould foam at the mouth.""Happily, Fred Elkin is _not_ here.""Ah, I am glad, glad, to hear you say that. You don't like him?""I detest him.""He makes out, to put it mildly, that you are great friends.""You will oblige me by contradicting the statement. Or--no. One treatsthat sort of man with contempt.""I agree with you most heartily. I'm sorry I ever mentioned him."Yet Doris was well aware that the chemist had dragged in Elkin by thescruff of the neck, probably for the sake of getting him disposed ofthoroughly and for all time. Rather on the tiptoe of expectation, sheawaited the next move. It was slow in coming, so again she lookedwistfully at the distant tea-drinkers. She found slight difficulty incarrying out this portion of the stage directions. Truth to tell, shewould gleefully have gone and joined them.Siddle was not altogether at ease. The conversation was too spasmodic tosuit his purpose. Though slow of speech he was nimble of brain, and,knowing Doris so well, he had anticipated a livelier duel of wits. In alllikelihood, he cursed the tea-party on the lawn. He had not foreseen thisdrawback. But, being a masterful man, he tackled the situation boldly."I seized the opportunity of a friendly chat with you to-day, Doris," hewent on, leaning over the fence to inhale the scent of a briar rose. "Thestory runs through the village that you and your father dined at TheHollies on Friday evening. Is that true?"Now, Doris had it on reliable authority that Siddle himself had been therunner who spread that story, and the knowledge steeled her heartagainst him."Yes," she said composedly."It was kind and neighborly of you to accept the invitation, but amistake."She turned and faced him. His expression was baffling. She thought shesaw in his sallow, clean-cut features the shadow of a confident smile."You mean that this horrid murder should make some difference in thefriendship between ourselves and Mr. Grant?" she cried."Yes. To you, though to no one else would I speak so plainly, I have nohesitation in saying that Mr. Grant is far, very far, from being clearof responsibility in that matter. Three days from now you willunderstand what I mean. Evidence will be forthcoming which will put himin a most unenviable light. I am not alleging, or even hinting, that hemay be deemed guilty of actual crime. That is for the law to determine.But I do tell you emphatically that his present heedless attitude willgive place to anxiety and dejection. It cannot be otherwise. A somewhatsordid history will be revealed, and his pretense that relations betweenhim and the dead woman ceased three years ago will vanish into thin air.Believe me, Doris, I am actuated by no motive in this matter other thana desire to further your welfare. I cannot bear even to think of yourname being associated, in ever so small degree, with that of a man whomust be hounded out of his own social circle, if no worse fate is instore for him.""Good gracious!" cried Doris, genuinely amazed. "How do you come to knowall this?""I listen to the words of those qualified to speak with knowledge andauthority. I have mixed in varied company this past week, wholly on youraccount. Don't be led away by the mere formalities of the opening day ofthe inquest. The coroner deliberately shut off all real evidence exceptas to the cause of death. On Wednesday the situation will change, and youcannot fail to be shocked by what you hear, because you will be there.""I am given to understand that, even if I am called, my testimony will beof no importance.""Such may be the police view. Mr. Ingerman will press for a verydifferent estimate.""Has he told you that?""Yes.""So, although foreman of the jury, you have not declined to hobnob witha man who is avowedly Mr. Grant's enemy?""I would hobnob with worse people if, by so doing, I might serve you."Grant, "fed up," as he put it to Hart, with watching the _tete a tete_between Doris and the chemist, sprang to his feet and went through apantomime easy enough to follow save for one or two signs. Doris heldboth hands aloft. Well knowing that anything in the nature of apre-arranged code would be gall and wormwood to Siddle, she explainedlaughingly:"Mr. Grant signals that he and Mr. Hart are going for a walk; he wants meto accompany them. But I can't, unfortunately. I promised dad to helpwith the accounts.""If you really mean what you say, my warning would seem to have fallen ondeaf ears."Siddle's voice was well under control, but his eyes glinted dangerously.His state was that of a man torn by passion who nevertheless felt thatany display of the rage possessing him would be fatal to his cause.But, rather unexpectedly, Doris took fire. Siddle's innuendoes andprotestations were sufficiently hard to bear without the added knowledgethat a ridiculous convention denied her the companionship of a man whomshe loved, and who, she was beginning to believe, loved her. She sweptround on Siddle like a wrathful goddess."I have borne with you patiently because of the acquaintance of years,but I shall be glad if this tittle-tattle of malice and ignorance nowceases," she said proudly. "Mr. Grant is my friend, and my father'sfriend. In the first horror of the crime which has besmirched our dearlittle village, we both treated Mr. Grant rather badly. We know betterto-day. Your Ingermans and your Elkins, and the rest of the busybodiesgathered at the inn, may defame him as they choose, or as they dare. Asfor me, I am his loyal comrade, and shall remain so after next Wednesday,or a score of Wednesdays. I am going in now, Mr. Siddle, and shall beengaged during the remainder of the evening. Your shop opens at six, andI am sure you will find some more profitable means of spending the timethan in telling me things I would rather not hear."Siddle caught her arm."Doris," he said fiercely, "you must not leave me without, at least,learning my true motive. I--"The girl wrested herself free from his grip. She realized what wascoming, and forestalled it."I care nothing for your motive," she cried. "You forget yourself!Please go!"She literally ran into the house. The chemist, unless he elected tobehave like a love-sick fool, had no option but to follow, and make hisway to the street by the side door.The only other happening of significance that Sunday was an unheraldedvisit by Winter to the policeman's residence.He popped in after dusk, opening the door without knocking."You in, Robinson?" he inquired."Yes, sir. Will you--""Shan't detain you more than a minute. At the inquest you said that youpersonally untied the rope which bound Miss Melhuish's body. Here are apiece of string and a newspaper. Would you mind showing me what sort ofknot was used?"Robinson was nearly struck dumb, and his fingers fumbled badly, but hemanaged to exhibit two hitches."Ah, thanks," said Winter, and was off in a jiffy.From the window of a darkened room Robinson watched the erect, burlyfigure of the detective until it was merged in the mists of night."Well, I'm--," he exclaimed bitterly."John, what are you swearing about?" demanded his wife from the kitchen."Something I heard to-day," answered her husband. "There was a chap of myname, John P. Robinson, an' he said that down in Judee they didn't knoweverything. And, by gum, he was right. They knew mighty little aboutLondon 'tecs, I'm thinking. But, hold on. Surely--"He bustled into his coat, and hastened to The Hollies. No, neither Mr.Grant nor Mr. Hart had spoken to a soul about the knot. Nor had Bates. Ofcourse, Robinson did not venture to describe Winter. Finally, he put theincident aside as a clear case of thought-reading.CHAPTER XVA MATTER OF HEREDITYShortly before noon on Monday occurred two events destined to assume aparamount importance in the affair which was wringing the withers ofSteynholme. As in the histories of both men and nations, these firststeps in great developments began quietly enough. For one thing, Furneauxreturned to the village. For another, the London telegraphist, whoexpected the day to prove practically a blank, was reading a newspaperwhen the telegraph instrument clicked the local call.Doris was checking and distributing the stock of stamps which had arrivedthat morning; her father was counting mail-bags in a small annex to themain room, the Knoleworth office having acquired a habit of making upshortages by docking the country branches. No member of the publichappened to be present. The girl could have heard what the Morse code wastapping forth had she chosen, but she had trained herself to disregardthe telegraph when occupied on other work.Suddenly, however, the telegraphist's pencil paused."Hello!" he said. "Theodore Siddle! That's the chemist opposite,isn't it!""Yes," said Doris, suspending her calculations at mention of the name."Well, his mother's dead.""Dead?" she echoed vacantly. Somehow, it had never hitherto dawned on herthat the chemist might possess relatives in some part of the country."That's what it says," went on the other. "'Regret inform you your motherdied this morning. Superintendent, Horton Asylum.'""In an asylum, too," said the girl, speaking at random."Yes. Horton is the place for epileptic lunatics, near Epsom, you know.""I didn't know. Does it mean that--that she was an epileptic lunatic?""So I should imagine, from the wording. If a nurse, or a matron, they'dsurely describe her as such.""I suppose we ought not to discuss Mr. Siddle's telegram," said Doris,after a pause."Well, no. But where's the harm? I wouldn't have yelled out the news ifwe three weren't alone. Where's that boy?""Gone to his dinner. Father will take it. By the way, say nothing to himas to the contents. Would you mind calling him?"Doris hurried swiftly to the sitting-room, and thence upstairs. Thetelegraphist explained the absence of a messenger, so Mr. Martindelivered the telegram in person.Crossing the street, he detected a dead bee. He picked it up, horrifiedat the thought that the Isle of Wight disease might have reached Sussex.So it was an absent-minded postmaster who handed the telegram overSiddle's counter, inquiring laconically:"Is there any answer?"Siddle opened the buff envelope, and read. He glanced sharply at Martin."No," he said. "What's wrong with that bee?""I don't know. I have my doubts. When I have a moment to spare I'll putit under the microscope."Siddle examined the telegram again. The handwriting was that beloved ofCivil Service Commissioners. Unquestionably, it was not Doris's. Nosooner had his friend gone off, still intent on the dead insect, thanSiddle followed. He knew that the bee would undergo scientific scrutinyat once, so gave Martin just enough time to dive into the sitting-roombefore entering the post office."Did you receive this telegram a few minutes ago!" he inquired.The young man became severely official."Which telegram?" he said stiffly."This one," and Siddle gave him the written message."Yes," was the answer."Excuse me, but--er--are its contents known to you only?""What do you mean, sir? It would cost me my berth if I divulged a word ofit to anyone.""I'm sorry. Pray don't take offense. I--I'm anxious that my friends,Mr. and Miss Martin, should not hear of it. That is what I reallyhave in mind."The telegraphist cooled down."You may be quite sure that neither they nor any other person inSteynholme will ever see the duplicate," he said confidentially. "I makeup a package containing duplicates each evening, and it is sent toheadquarters. If it will please you, I'll lock the copy now in my desk.""That is exceedingly good of you," said Siddle gratefully. "You, as aLondoner, will understand that such a telegram from--er--Horton is notthe sort of thing one would like to become known even in the mostlimited circle.""You can depend on me, sir."Siddle hastened back to his shop. The telegraphist looked after him."Queer!" he mused. "Miss Doris guessed him at once. Phi-ew, I must becareful! This village contains surprises."Doris, watching from an upper room, saw the visitor, and timed him. Sheimagined he had dispatched an answer. Being a woman, she soughtenlightenment a few minutes later."Mr. Siddle came in," she said tentatively."Yes," said the specialist, smiling. "And I agree with you, Miss Martin.We mustn't talk about telegrams, even among ourselves, unless it isnecessary departmentally."Doris was silenced, but she read the riddle correctly. The chemist wasparticularly anxious that no Steynholme resident should be made aware ofhis mother's death. She wondered why.She was enlightened when Furneaux paid a call about tea-time. She tookhim into the garden. The lawn at The Hollies was empty."Well, you entertained an acquaintance yesterday?" he began."Yes. Am I to tell you what happened?""Not a great deal, I imagine," he said, with a puzzling laugh."No, but I annoyed him, as Mr.----""No names!" broke in the detective hastily. "Names, especially modernones, destroy romance. Even the Georgian method of using initials, orleaving out vowels, lend an air of intrigue to the veriest balderdash.""But no one can overhear us," was the somewhat surprised comment."How true!" said Furneaux. "Pardon me, Miss Martin. Tell the story inyour own way."Doris had a good memory. She was invariably letter-perfect in a playafter a couple of rehearsals, and could prompt others if they faltered.The detective listened in silence while she repeated the conversationbetween Siddle and herself. He took no notes. In fact, he hardly ever didmake any record in a case unless it was essential to prove the exactwords of a suspected person."Good!" he said, when she had finished. "That sounds like thecomplete text.""I don't think I have left out anything of importance--that is, if asingle word of it _is_ important.""Oh, heaps," he assured her. "It's even better than I dared hope. Can youtell me if Siddle's mother is dead yet?"The question found Doris so thoroughly unprepared that she blurted out:"Have you had a telegram, too, then?""No. But Siddle has had one, eh? Don't be vexed. I'm not tricking youinto revealing post office secrets. I knew she was dying, and, when I sawyour father take a message to the chemist's shop I simply made anaccurate guess.... Now, I'm going to scare you, purposely and of maliceaforethought, because I want you to be a good little girl, and obeyorders. Mrs. Siddle, senior, now happily deceased, was an epilepticlunatic of a peculiarly dangerous type. She suffered from what is classedby the doctors as _furor epilepticus_, a form of spasmodic insanity notinconsistent with a high degree of bodily vigor and long periods ofapparently complete mental saneness. Now, if I were not speaking to onewho has shared her father's studies in bee-life, I would not introducethe subject of heredity. But _you_ know, Miss Martin, that such racialcharacteristics are transmitted, or transmissible, I should say, by sexopposites. Thus, an epileptic mother is more likely to give her taint toa son than to a daughter.... Yes, I mean all that, and more," he went on,seeing the look of horror, not unmixed with fear, in Doris's eyes. "Theremust be no more irritating of Siddle, or playing on his feelings--by you,at any rate. Treat him gently. If he insists on making love to you, be asfirm as you like in a non-committal way. I mean, by that, an entireabsence on your part of any suggestion that you are repulsing him becauseof a real or supposed preference for any other man.""Do you want me to believe that he is liable to attack me?" demanded thegirl, her naturally courageous spirit coming to her aid."I do," said Furneaux, speaking with marked earnestness."Yet you ask me to endure his company if he chooses to forcehimself on me?""For a few days.""But it may be a few years?""No. That is not to be thought of. Leave it to me to devise a way.Besides, you need not allow him so many opportunities that the strainwould become unbearable. You are busy, owing to the certain increase ofwork brought about by this murder. Your time will be greatly occupied.But, don't render him morbidly suspicious. For instance, no more dinnersat The Hollies. No more gadding about by night, if you hear weird noiseson the other side of the river. And you must absolutely deny yourself thepleasurable excitement of Mr. Grant's company.""You are carrying a warning to its extreme limit.""Exactly.""And am I to keep this knowledge to myself?""In whom would you confide?""My father, of course.""I know you better," and the detective's voice took on a profoundlyserious note. "Your father would never admit that what he knows to betrue of bees is equally true of humanity. You can trust the police tokeep a pretty sharp eye on Siddle, of course, but the present is astrenuous period, both for us and for people with maniacal tendencies, soaccidents may happen.""You have distressed me immeasurably," said the girl, striving to piercethe mask of that inscrutable face."I meant to," answered Furneaux quietly. "No half measures for me.I've looked up the asylum record of Mrs. Siddle, senior, and it's notnice reading.""There was a Mrs. Siddle, junior, then?""A Mrs. Theodore Siddle, if one adopts the conventional usage. Yes. Shedied last month.""Last month!" gasped Doris, feeling vaguely that she was moving in a mazeof deceit and subterfuge."On May 25th, to be precise. She lived apart from her husband. I havereason to believe she feared him.""Yet--"She hesitated, hardly able to put her jumbled thoughts into words."Yes. That's so," said the detective instantly. "Never mind. It's afairly decent world, taken _en bloc_. I ought to speak with authority. Isee enough of the seamy side of it, goodness knows. Now, forewarned isforearmed. Don't be nervous. Don't take risks. Everything will come rightin time. Remember, I'm not far away in an emergency. Should I chance tobe absent if you need advice, send for Mr. Franklin. You can easilydevise some official excuse, a mislaid letter, or an error in atelegram.""I think I shall feel confident if both of you are near," and the ghostof a smile lit Doris's wan features."We're a marvelous combination," grinned Furneaux, reverting at once tohis normal impishness. "I am all brain; he is all muscle. Such analliance prevails against the ungodly.""Is Mr. Grant in any danger?" inquired Doris suddenly."No."The two looked into each other's eyes. Doris was eager to ask a question,which Furneaux dared her to put. The detective won. She sighed."Very well," she said. "I'm to behave. Am I to regard myself as adecoy duck?""A duck, anyhow."She laughed lightly. Furneaux would vouchsafe no further information, itwould appear. For a girl of nineteen, Doris was uncommonly gifted withclear, analytical reasoning powers.The detective returned to the Hare and Hounds, and went upstairs. He metPeters on the landing."The devil!" he cried."My _dear_ pal!" retorted the journalist."Are you living here?""Why not?""Why not, indeed? Where the eagles are there is the carcase.""Your misquotation is offensive.""It was so intended.""Come and have a drink.""No.""I say 'yes.' You'll thank me on your bended knees afterwards. The SouthAmerican gent is having the time of his life. I've just been to my roomfor _Whitaker's Almanack_, wherewith a certain Don Walter Hart purposesflooring him."Wally Hart had, indeed, succeeded in running to earth the Argentinemagnate, and was giving Winter a most uncomfortable quarter of an hour."Ha!" shouted Hart, when Furneaux came in with Peters. "Here's the pocketmarvel who'll answer any question straight off. What is the staple exportof the Argentine!""How often have you been there?" demanded the detective dryly."Six times.""And you've lived there?" This to Winter."Yes," glowered the big man, fearing the worst."Then the answer is 'fools,'" cackled Furneaux.Wally laughed. He had remembered, just in time, that he had no right toclaim acquaintance with the representative of Scotland Yard, and therewere some farmers present, each of whom had a "likely animal" to offerthe buyer of blood stock."Gad, I think you're right," he said."You wanted me to say 'sheep,' I suppose?""Got it, at once.""As though one valuable horse wasn't worth a thousand sheep.""Just what my friend, Don Manoel Alcorta, of Los Andes ranch, Catamarca,always held," put in Winter, drawing the bow at a venture.Hart cocked an eye at him."Sir," he said, "I would take off my hat, if I wore one in Steynholme, toany man who claims the friendship of Don Manoel Alcorta, a sincerepatriot. I suggest that we crack a bottle to his immortal memory.""My doctor forbids me to touch wine," said Winter mournfully."But these bucolic breeders of browns and bays employ wiser medicos,I'll go bail. Landlord, a quart of the best, and six out, as they sayin London."Six glasses were duly filled with champagne. When it was consumed, Hartbuttonholed Peters."A word with you, scribe," he said. "Good-day, gentlemen. I leave you toyour nags. Treat Mr. Franklin fairly. The friend of Don Manoel Alcortamust be a true man."Winter heaved a sigh of relief when the professional revolutionisthad vanished."He's a funny 'un," commented one of the farmers."A bit touched, I reckon," said another. "Wot's 'e doin' now to theother one?"They looked through the window. The two were standing in the middle ofthe road, and Wally was shaking Peters violently. The argument was not sofierce as it appeared to be. Peters had been commanded to bring bothdetectives to dinner that evening; when he demurred, trying to hedge onthe question of Winter's identity, Hart grabbed him by the shoulder."Do as I tell you," he hissed. "Of course, I know now that the big fellowis the man Grant heard of a week ago. I was an idiot to take himseriously about the Argentine. Bring the pair of 'em, I tell you. We'llmake a night of it.""I'll try," said Peters faintly, "but if you stir up that wine sovigorously I won't answer for the consequences."Winter, wishing devoutly that would-be sellers of horseflesh were not sonumerous in the district, noted the names and addresses of the local men,and promised to write when he could make an appointment. Then he escapedupstairs, whither Furneaux soon followed. Winter had secured an extrabedroom, overlooking the river, which Tomlin had converted into asitting-room. Thus, he held a secure observation post both in front andrear of the hotel."Well, how did she take it!" inquired the Chief Inspector, when he andhis colleague were safe behind a closed door."Sensible girl," said Furneaux. "By the way, Siddle's mother is dead.Telegram came this morning. Things should happen now.""I don't quite see why.""No. You're still muddled after floundering in the mud of South America.What possessed you to let that cheerful idiot, Wally Hart, put you inthe cart?""How could I help it? I was extracting some really helpful facts aboutSiddle and Elkin from Tomlin and the others when a shock-headed whirlwindblew in, and nearly embraced me because I claimed acquaintance with theEl Dorado bar in Buenos Ayres. From that instant I was lost. Like St.Augustine on the gridiron, no sooner was I nicely toasted on one sidethan I was turned on to the other. That grinning penny-a-liner, Peters,too, helped as assistant torturer. Wait till he asks me for a 'pointer'in this or any other case. He sold me a pup to-day, but I'll land himwith a full-sized mastiff.""No, you won't. He's done you a lot of good. You were simply reeking withconceit when I met you this morning. It was 'Siddle this' and 'Siddlethat' until you fairly sickened me. One would have thought I hadn'tcleared the ground for you, left you with all lines open and yourselfunknown to the enemy. Sometimes, you make me tired.""Sorry, Charles," said Winter patronizingly. "I had a bit of luck onSunday, I admit. The chance turn taken by the conversation with Doris,with the result that I was able to occupy a strategic position on thecliff, and hear every word Siddle uttered, was really fortunate. But,isn't that just what men mean when they prate of success? Opportunityknocks once at every man's door, says the old saw. The clever man grabshold instantly. The indolent one, often a mere gabbler, opens his eyesand his mouth weeks afterwards, and cries, 'Dear me! Was that themuch-looked-for opportunity?' Of course, Robinson's by-play with the sackand rope was merely thrown in by the prodigal hand of Fate.""Stop!" yelped Furneaux. "Another platitude, and I'll assault you withthe tongs!"It was the invariable habit of the Big 'Un and Little 'Un to quarrel likecat and dog when the toils were closing in around a suspect. Woe, then,to the malefactor! His was a parlous state."Let's cool down, Charles!" said Winter, opening a leather case, andselecting, with great care, one out of half a dozen precisely similarcigars. "We're pretty sure of our man, but we haven't a scrap of evidenceagainst him. How, or where, to begin ringing him in I haven't thefaintest notion. If only he'd kill Grant we'd get him at once.""But he won't. He trusts to Ingerman playing that part of the game. He'sas artful as a pet fox. I bought soap, and a pound of sal volatile, buthe did up each parcel with sealing-wax.""Sal volatile!" smiled Winter. "I, too, went in for soap, but myimagination would not soar beyond a packet of cotton-wool. It was thelumpiest thing I could think of.""And perfectly useless!" sneered Furneaux. "I must say you do fling thetaxpayers' money about. Now, _my_ little lot will keep the electric bellsin my flat in order for two years.""You forget that constant association with you demands that I shouldfrequently plug my two ears," retorted Winter.Furneaux would surely have thrown back the jest had not a knock on thedoor interrupted him."Who's there? I'm busy," cried Winter."Me-ow!" whined Peters's voice."Oh, it's you, Tom. Come in!"The journalist crept in on tiptoe."Hush! We are not observed," he said. "Wally Hart threatens to choke meif you two don't dine with him and Grant to-night."There was silence for a little while. The detectives looked ateach other."At what time?" said Winter, at last.Peters was astonished, and showed it."Why, I assured him it was absolutely imposs.," he cried."Well, it isn't. In fact, it suits our plans. I want exercise, and shallwalk back from Knoleworth. Furneaux will make his own arrangements. TellGrant that I shall drop in without knocking.""And tell him I shall arrive by parachute," added Furneaux."In case of accidents, and there is a shoot-up, with myself as theunresisting victim, my front name is James," said Peters."The only good point about you," scoffed Winter."You're strong on names to-day," tittered the journalist. "Don ManoelAlcorta was a superb effort as an authority on gee-gees. Wally tells mehis donship is the recognized expert south of the line on seismicdisturbances, and spends his days and nights watching a needle makingscratches on a sensitive plate.""He would be useful here in a day or two," said Winter."Ah, thanks! Is that a tip?""Not for publication. What you must say is that this affair looks likebaffling the shrewdest wits in Scotland Yard.""My very phrase--my own ewe lamb. Pardon. I shouldn't have alludedto sheep.""The only known representative of the Yard in Steynholme is Furneaux,"smiled the Chief Inspector.Furneaux was drumming on a window-pane with his finger-tips."True," he cackled. "Just to prove it, he now informs you that Siddle,finding trade slow, has called on Mr. John Menzies Grant!"CHAPTER XVIFURNEAUX MAKES A SUCCESSFUL BIDThe lawn front of The Hollies was not visible from the upper story of theHare and Hounds owing to a clump of pines which had found foothold on thecliff, but, through the gap formed by the end of the post office garden,the entrance to the house from the Knoleworth road was discernible.Furneaux's dramatic announcement brought the other two to the window. Bythis time Peters, gifted with a nose for news like a well-trainedsetter's for partridges, had begun to associate the quiet-mannered,gentle-spoken chemist with the inner circle of the crime, so waited andwatched with the detectives for Siddle's reappearance.At any rate the visitor must have been admitted, because a long quarterof an hour elapsed before he came in sight again. He walked out slowlyinto the roadway, thrust his hands into his trousers pockets, and glancedto right and left. Then, turning abruptly, he stared at the dwelling hehad just quitted. What this slight but peculiar action signified was nothard to guess. Furneaux, indeed, put it into words."Having warned Grant off Miss Doris Martin, and been cursed for hispains, the foreman of the jury does not trouble to await furtherevidence, but arrives at a true and lawful verdict straight off,"announced the little man."We ought to hear things to-night," said Peters."We?" inquired Winter."Yes. Didn't I make it clear that I shared in the dinner invitation?""No, and I'm--""Don't say it!" pleaded the journalist. "If I fell from grace to-day,remember my unswerving loyalty since the hour we met on the platform atKnoleworth! Haven't I kept close as an oyster? And would anyconsideration on earth move me to publish an accurate and entertainingaccount of the roasting of Chief Inspector Winter by Wally Hart? Thinkwhat I'm sacrificing--a column of the best."Winter bent a weighing look on the speaker. There was treason in thethought, as King James remarked to the barber who tried to prove hisloyalty by pointing out how easily he might cut his majesty's throat anymorning. But Peters maintained the expression of a sphinx, and the bigman relaxed."The conditions are that not a word about this business appears inprint, either now or in the future until we have a criminal in thedock," he said."Accepted," said Peters.Furneaux laughed shrilly, even derisively, but him his colleague treatedwith majestic disdain. Then, the chemist having reentered the village,the group broke up, Peters to search his brains for "copy" which shouldbe readable yet contain no hint of the new trail, Winter to take train toKnoleworth, and Furneaux to tackle Fred Elkin, who, he had ascertainedearlier, would drive home from a neighboring hamlet about five o'clock.Elkin had returned when the detective reached the house, a somewhatpretentious place, half farm, half villa, and altogether horsey. Theentrance hall bristled with fox masks and brushes. A useful collection ofburnished bits and snaffles hung on a side wall. A couple of stuffedbadgers held two wicker stands for sticks and umbrellas, and whips andhunting-crops were ranged on hooks beneath a 12-bore and a rook rifle.A pert maid-servant took Furneaux's card, blanched when she read it, andforgot to close the door of the dining-room. Hence, the detective heardElkin's gruff comments:"What? _That_ chap? Wants to see me? Not more than I want to see him.Show him in."Furneaux, looking very meek and mild, entered an apartment of thecarpet-bag upholstery period. A set of six exceedingly good and raresporting prints caught his eye."Good day," he said, finding Elkin drinking tea, and eating a boiledegg. "You're feeling better, I'm glad to see."Now, no matter how ungracious a man may be, a courteous solicitude as tohis health demands a certain note of civility in return."Yes," he said. "Sit down. Will you join me?""I'll have a cup of tea, with pleasure," said Furneaux."Right-o! Just touch that bell, will you?"The other obeyed, and took a closer look at one of the prints. Yes, thedate was right, 1841, and the stippling admirable."Nice lot of pictures, those," he said cheerfully, when the frightenedmaid, much to her relief, had been told to bring another cup and a freshsupply of toast."Are they?" Elkin had taken them and some kitchen furniture for a baddebt."Yes. Will you sell them?""Well, I haven't thought about it. What'll you give?"Furneaux hesitated."I can't resist anything in the art line that takes my fancy," he said,after a pause of indecision. "What do you say to ten bob each?"Elkin valued the lot at that figure, but Furneaux was a fool, and shouldbe treated as such."Oh, come now!" he cried roguishly. "They're worth more than that."Furneaux reflected again."Three pounds is a good deal for six prints," he murmured, "but, to getit off my mind, I'll spring to guineas.""Make it three-ten and they're yours.""Three guineas is my absolute limit," said Furneaux."Done!" cried Elkin. The original debt was under two pounds, so he hadcleared more than fifty per cent. on the transaction, and was plus anumber of chairs and a table.Furneaux counted out the money, wrote a receipt on a leaf torn from hispocket-book, and stamped it."Sign that," he said, "pocket the cash, send the set to the Hare andHounds for me in a dog-cart now, and the deal is through."Leaving the table, he went and lifted down each picture carefully.Somewhat wonderingly, Elkin rang the bell once more, gave the necessaryinstructions, and the room was cleared of its art. He was quite sure nowthat Furneaux was, as he put it, "dotty." The latter, however, sat andenjoyed his tea as though well pleased with his bargain."And how are things going in the murder at The Hollies?" inquired thehorse-dealer, by way of a polite leading up to the visitor'sunexplained business."Fairly well," said the detective. "My chief difficulty was to convincecertain important people that you didn't kill Miss Melhuish. Once I--""Me!" roared Elkin, his pale blue eyes assuming a fiery tint. "_Me!_""Once I established that fact," went on the other severely, "a realstumbling-block was removed. You see, Elkin, you have behaved throughoutlike a perfect fool, and thus lent a sort of credibility to an otherwiseabsurd notion. Your furious hatred of Mr. Grant, for instance, born of anequally fatuous--or, shall I say? fat-headed--belief that Miss Martinwould marry you for the mere asking, led you into deep waters. It was amistake, too, when you lied to P.C. Robinson as to the time you came homeon that Monday night. You told him you walked straight here from the Hareand Hounds at ten o 'clock. You know you didn't--that it was nearer halfpast eleven when you reached this house. Consider what that discrepancyalone might have meant if Scotland Yard failed to take your measurecorrectly. Then add the fact that the murderer wore the hat, wig, andwhiskers in which you made a guy of yourself while filling the role ofSvengali last winter. Now, I ask you, Elkin, where would you have stoodwith the average British jury when the prosecution established thosethree things: Motive, your jealousy of Grant; time, your unaccounted-fordisappearance during the hour when the crime was committed; and disguise,a clumsy suggestion of Owd Ben's ghost? Really, I have known men broughtto the scaffold on circumstantial evidence little stronger than that.Instead of glaring at me like a cornered rat you ought to drop on yourknees and thank providence, as manifested through the intelligence of the'Yard,' that you are not now in a cell at Knoleworth, ruminating on yourown stupidity, and in no small jeopardy of your life."Many emotions chased each other across Fred Elkin's somewhat mean andcruel face while Furneaux rated him in this extraordinary manner.Surprise, wrath, even fear, had their phases. But, dominating all othersensations, was an overpowering indignation at the implied hopelessnessof his pursuit of Doris Martin.He literally howled an oath at his torturer. Furneaux was shocked."No, no," he protested in a horrified tone. "Don't swear at yourbest friend.""Friend! By--, I'll make you pay for what you've said. There's a lawto stop that sort of thing.""But the law requires witnesses. A slander isn't a slander unless it'suttered to your detriment before a third party. How different would beMr. Grant's action against you! Your well-wishers simply couldn't muzzleyou. Whether before your pot-house cronies or mere strangers, you chargedhim openly with being a murderer. I'm sorry for you, Elkin, if ever youcome before a judge. He'll rattle more than my three guineas out of you.Even now, you don't grasp the extent of your folly. Instead of telling mehow you spent that hour and a half on the night of the crime you have theincredible audacity to threaten me, _me_, the man who has saved you fromjail. One more word, you miserable swab, and I'll let Robinson arrestyou. You'll be set free, of course, when I stage the actual villain, buta few remands of a week each in custody will thin your hot blood. Youwere with Peggy Smith after leaving the Hare and Hounds, making a fool ofan honest girl who thinks you mean to wed her. Yet you blather aboutbeing 'practically engaged' to Doris Martin, a girl who wouldn't let youtie her shoe-lace. You're an impudent pup, Fred, and you know it. But youstock decent tea, so I'll take another cup. If you're wise, you'll take asecond one yourself. It's better for you than whiskey."Elkin, despite all his faults, was endowed with the shrewdnessinseparable from his business, because no man devoid of brains ever yetthrove as a horse-dealer. He smothered his rage, thinking he might learnmore from this strange-mannered detective by seeming complaisance."You're a bit rough on a fellow," he growled sulkily, pouring out thetea."For your good, my boy, solely for your good. Now, own up about Peggy.""Yes. That's right. She'd prove an alibi, so your torn-fool case breaksdown when the flag falls.""Does it? A girl may say anything to save her supposed lover. How willthe twelve good men and true view Doris Martin's evidence on Wednesday?What did _you_ mean, for instance, by your question to the coroner at thefirst hearing?""I thought Grant was guilty, and I think so still," came thesavage retort."A nice juryman you are, I must say! May I trouble you to pass thesugar?""Look here! What are you gettin' at? Damme if I can see through yourgame. What is it?""I didn't want to worry poor Peggy. And her father might set about you ifhe knew the facts, so I'm probably saving you a hiding as well as aperiod in jail. The only reliable witness we had as to events in Tomlin'splace was a commercial traveler, and he is positive that the house closedat ten o'clock. However, that's all right. How do you account for themarvelous improvement in your health? Dr. Foxton cannot understand yourillness. He says you are wiry, and have a strong constitution.""Dr. Foxton jolly near knocked me up," said Elkin. "I took his medicinetill I was sick as a cat.""But you took spirits, too.""That's nothing fresh. Anyhow, I've dropped both, and am picking upevery hour.""Since when?""Since yesterday morning, if you want to know.""I do. I'm most interested. Dr. Foxton doesn't compound his ownprescriptions, does he?""No. I get 'em made up at Siddle's.""Ah. These country chemists often keep drugs in stock till theydeteriorate, or even set up chemical changes. Have you the bottles?""Yes. But what the--""Anything left in them?""The last two are half full. Still--""What a cross-grained chap you are? I buy your pictures, drink your tea,rescue you from a positively dangerous position, warn you againstcarrying any farther a most serious libel, yet you won't let me help youin a matter affecting your health!""Help me? How?""Even you, I suppose, realize that Scotland Yard employs skilledanalysts. Give me your bottles, in strict confidence, of course, and I'lltell you what they really contain. Then you can compare the analyses withthe doctor's prescriptions. The knowledge should be useful, to say theleast. Siddle's reputation needn't suffer, but, unless I am greatlymistaken, you will have the whip hand of him in future."The prospect was alluring. Elkin would enjoy showing up the chemist, whohad treated him rather as a precocious infant of late."By jing!" he cried, "I'm on that. Bet you a quid--But, no. You'dhardly lay against your own opinion. Just wait a tick. I'll bring 'em."Furneaux stared fixedly at the table while his host was absent. Hisconscience was not pricking him with regard to an unmerited slur on thecountry chemists of Great Britain. All is fair in love and the detectionof crime, and he simply had to get hold of those bottles by some daringyet plausible ruse."Now--I wonder!" he muttered, as Elkin's step sounded on the stairs."There you are!" grinned the horse-dealer. "Take a dose of the last one.It'll stir your liver to some tune."Furneaux drew the corks out of both bottles, and sniffed the contents.Then he tasted, with much tongue-smacking."Um!" he said. "Stale laudanum, for a start. I expected as much. Boughtby the gallon and sold by the drop. Is that the dogcart with mypictures?""Yes.""Hail your man. He can give me a lift.""But there's lots of things I want to ask you--""Probably. I'm here to put questions, not to give information. I've gonea long way beyond the official tether already. If you've a grain ofsense, and I think you're not altogether lacking in that respect, you'llkeep a close tongue, and act on the tips thrown out. You'll find pearlsof price among the rubbish-heap of my remarks generally. Good-by. See youon Wednesday."And Furneaux climbed into the cart, holding the pictures so that theywould not rattle, and perhaps loosen the old gilded frames."Drive me to the chemist's" he said to the groom; within fiveminutes, he was explaining his purchase to Siddle, and requesting, asa favor, that the latter should wrap the set of prints in brownpaper, making two parcels, and tying each securely, so that theymight be dispatched by train.Siddle examined one, the first of the series, which depicted theAylesbury Steeplechase."Rather good," he said. "Where did you pick them up?""At Elkin's.""Indeed. What an unexpected place!""That's the only way a poor man can get hold of a decent thing nowadays.The dealers grab everything, and sell them as collections.""Art is not in my line, though anyone can see that these are excellent.""Yes. But you're looking at 'The Start.' Have a peep at this one,'The Finish.' The artist _would_ have his joke. You see that the darkhorse wins.""How did you persuade Elkin to part with them?""By paying him a tempting price, of course. I'm a weak-minded ass insuch matters."The chemist busied himself to oblige the detective, wrapping and tyingthe packages neatly. Furneaux insisted on paying sixpence for the paper,string, and labor. There was quite a friendly argument, but he carriedhis point.The dog-cart then brought him to the station, where he tipped anddismissed the man; a little later, he caught a London-bound train.At half past seven precisely, Winter turned in through theKnoleworth-side gate of The Hollies (there were two, the approach tothe house being semi-circular) and pushed the door open, as it wasstanding ajar.Grant was waiting in the hall, and greeted him pleasantly."Here's a telegram which is meant for you, I fancy," he said.Winter read:"Sorry to spoil your party. Compelled to travel to London. Returningearly to-morrow. F.""That's pretty Fanny's way," smiled the Chief Inspector. "But there'ssomething in the wind, or he would never have hurried off in thisfashion. He tells me that the only pleasant evening he spent inSteynholme was under your roof, Mr. Grant.""Come along in, Don Jaime!" drawled Hart's voice from the "den," whichhad been cleared of its litter, the lawn being deemed somewhat unsuitablefor the purposes of a drawing-room on that occasion. It was overlookedfrom too many quarters."Ah, we meet now under less uneven conditions, Mr. Hart," said Winter."Do you know that Enrico Suarez is in London?"Hart, startled for once in his life, gazed at the detective fixedly."Since when?" he cried."He crossed from Lisbon last week."Hart took a revolver from his hip pocket, and opened it, apparentlymaking sure that it was properly loaded."What's the law in England?" he inquired. "Can I shoot first, or must Iwait till the other fellow has had a pop?"Winter laughed."It's all right," he said. "Suarez is in Holloway, awaiting extradition.But I owed you one for the rise you took out of me to-day."A bell sounded, and Peters came in. He glanced around."Where's Furneaux?" he demanded."Gone to London. Why this keen interest?" said Winter."There's something up. Elkin dropped in at the Hare and Hounds. He wassimply bursting with curiosity, and had to talk to somebody. So hechose me.""He would," was the dry comment."Fact, 'pon me honor. I didn't lead him on an inch. It seems thatFurneaux bought some prints which caught his eye in Elkin's house, andTomlin says that that hexplains hit.""Explains what?""Furneaux's visit to Siddle, and certain bulky parcels brought in andbrought out again.""Queer little duck, Furneaux," said Hart. "Now that my mind is at easeabout the immediate future of the biggest rascal in Venezuela I can takean active part in Steynholme affairs once more. When it's all throughI'll make a novel of it, dashed if I don't, with the postmaster'sdaughter in the three-color process as a frontispiece.""But who will be the villain?" said Peters.Hart waved the negro-head pipe at the other three."Draw lots. I am indifferent," he said.CHAPTER XVIIAN OFFICIAL HOUSEBREAKERNo word bearing on the main topic in these men's minds was said duringdinner. Grant was attentive to his guests, but markedly silent, almostdistrait. Two such talkers as Hart and Peters, however, covered any gapsin this respect. Cigars and pipes were in evidence, and, horrible thoughit may sound in the ears of a _gourmet_, the port was circulating, whenWinter turned and gazed at the small window."Is that where the ghost appears!" he inquired."Yes," said Grant. "You know the whole story, of course?""Furneaux misses nothing, I assure you.""He missed a daylight apparition this afternoon, at any rate. I have nosecrets from my friends, so I may as well tell you--""That Siddle called, and implored you to consider Doris Martin's futureby avoiding her at present," put in the Chief Inspector.Such shocks were losing some of their effect, on the principle that a manhears the burst of the thousandth high-explosive shell with a good dealless trepidation than attended the efforts of the first dozen. Still,Grant gazed at the speaker in profound astonishment."You Scotland Yard men seem to know everything," he said."A mere pretense. Try him on sheep-raising in the Argentine, Jack,"murmured Hart."Wally, this business is developing a very serious side," protestedGrant. Hart stretched a long arm for the port decanter."Come, friend!" he addressed it gravely. "Let us commune! You and Itogether shall mingle joyous memories of"A draught of the Warm South,The true, the blushful Hippocrene.""We read Siddle's visit aright, it would appear," said Winter quietly."Yes. That was his mission, put in a nutshell.""And what did you say?""I told him that, after Wednesday, I would ask Doris Martin to marry me,which is the best answer I can give him and all the world.""Why 'after Wednesday'?""Because I shall know then the full extent of the annoyance whichIngerman can inflict.""Did you give Siddle that reason?""Yes."Winter frowned."You literary gentlemen are all alike," he said vexedly. "You become suchadepts in analyzing human duplicity in your books that you never dreamof trying to be wise as a serpent in your own affairs. The author whowill split legal hairs by way of brightening his work will sign acontract with a publisher that draws tears from his lawyer when a disputearises. Why be so candid with a rank outsider, like Siddle?""I distrust the man. Doris distrusts him, too.""So you take him into your confidence.""No. I merely give him chapter and verse to prove that his interferenceis useless.""Have you engaged a lawyer for Wednesday""No. Why should I? My hands are clean.""But your clothes may suffer if enough mud is slung at you. Wire to thisman in the morning, and mention my name--Winter, of course, notFranklin.""Codlin's your friend, not Short," said Hart. "Sorry. It's a time-wornjape, but it fitted in admirably."The detective scribbled a name and address on a card."I don't think you need worry about Ingerman," he went on, "though it'swell to be prepared. A smart solicitor can stop irrelevant statements,especially if ready for them. But there must be no more of thisheart-opening to all and sundry, Mr. Grant. Siddle is your rival. He,too, wants to marry Miss Martin, and regards you now as the onlystumbling-block.""Siddle! That stick!" gasped Grant."Ridiculous, indeed monstrous," agreed Winter, rather heatedly, "butnevertheless a candidate for the lady's hand."Then he laughed. Peters's keen eyes were watching him, and Wally Hart wasgiving more heed to the conversation than was revealed by a fixed stareat the negro's head in meerschaum."You've bothered me," he went on. "I thought you had more sense. Don'tyou understand that all these bits of gossip reach Ingerman through thefilter of the snug at the Hare and Hounds?""The man's visit was unexpected, and his mission even more so. I justblurted out the facts.""Well, you've rendered the services of a solicitor absolutelyindispensable now."Grant, by no means so clear-headed these days as was his wont, followedthe scent of Winter's red herring like the youngest hound in a pack; butWally Hart and Peters, lookers-on in this chase, harked back to theright line."May I--" they both broke in simultaneously."Place to the fourth estate," bowed Hart solemnly."Thanks," said the journalist. "May I put a question, Winter?""A score, if you like.""Totting up the average of the murder cases in which Furneaux and youhave been engaged, in how many days do you count on spotting your man?""Sometimes we never get him.""Oh, come a bit closer than that.""Generally, given a clear run, with an established motive, we know who heis within eight days.""Wednesday, in effect?""Can't say, this time?""Suppose, as a hypothesis, you are convinced of a man's guilt, but canobtain little or no evidence?""He goes through life a free and independent citizen of this or any othercountry. Arrests on suspicion are not my long suit.""How does one get evidence?" purred Hart. "It isn't scattered broadcastby a clever criminal. And you fellows seem to object to my method, whichhas been the only effectual one so far in this affair.""If you had shot that specter the other night there would have been thedeuce to pay.""But you would now be sure of the murderer?""Why do you assume that?""Like Eugene Aram, he can't keep away from the scene of his crime."Winter felt he was skating on thin ice, so hastened to escape."Detective work is nearly all guessing," he said sententiously, "yet onemust beware of what I may term obvious guessing. If cause and effect wereso closely allied in certain classes of crime my department would ceaseto exist, and the protection of life and property might be left safely tothe ordinary police. By the way, P. C. Robinson has been rather inactiveduring two whole days. That makes me suspicious. What's he up to? Can youthrow a light on him, Peters?"The journalist knew that he was being told peremptorily to cease prying.He kicked Hart under the table."Hi!" yelled Wally. "What's the matter? Strike your matches on your ownshin, not mine.""Peters is announcing that the discussion is now closed," saidWinter firmly."Very well. He needn't emphasize the warning by a hob-nailed boot. Whenmy injured feelings have recovered I'll discourse to you of strange folkand stranger doings on the banks of the Rio de la Plata, and your stockas an Argentine plutocrat will rise one hundred per cent, next timeyou're badgered by a man who knows the country.""Meanwhile, Robinson is hot-foot on the Elkin trail," laughed Peters."His face was a study to-day when the groom supplied details of thepicture-buying.""Furneaux wanted that transaction to be widely known," said Winter. "Hegave every publicity to it.""Did he secure a bargain, I wonder?" said Grant."Oh, I expect so. He doesn't waste his hard-earned money, even forofficial purposes."But Winter was well aware of, and kept to himself one phase of the artdeal, at any rate. Furneaux had persuaded Siddle to fasten two bulkypackages with string!He was shaving next morning when his colleague entered, spruce as ever inattire, but looking rather weary. The little man flung himself at fulllength on Winter's bed."Been up all night," he explained. "Chemical analysis is fascinating butslow work--like watching a moth evolve from a grub. Had a fearful job,too, to get an analyst to chuck a theater and attend to business. Theblighter talked of office hours. _Cre nom_! Ten till four, and an hourand a half for lunch! Why can't we run _our_ show on those lines, James!"Winter finished carefully the left side of his broad expanse of face."You came down by the mail, I suppose?" he said casually."What a genius you are!" sighed Furneaux. "If _I_ were trembling withexpectation I could no more put a banal question like that than swallowthe razor after I was done with it. You might at least have the commondecency to thank me for leaving you to gorge on rare meats and vintagewines while I dallied with the deadly railway sandwich."Winter scraped the other cheek, his chin, and upper lip."Shall I go to the bathroom first, or listen?" he inquired."Ah, well, I'm tired, and hiking these frail bones to bed till twelve, soI'll give you a condensed version," snapped Furneaux. "Elkin 's illness,begun by whiskey and over-excitement, developed into steady poisoning bySiddle. The chemist used a rare agent, too--pure nicotine--easy, in asense, to detect, but capable of a dozen reasonable explanations whenrevealed by the post-mortem. But Elkin wasn't to be killed outright, Igather. The idea was to upset stomach and brain till he was half crazy.As you can read print when it's before your eyes, I needn't go into thematter of motive; Elkin's behavior supplies all details.""How about the knots? Hurry! I hate the feeling of soap drying on myskin.""One running noose and twice two half hitches on each package.""Good! Charles, we're going to pull off a real twister.""_We!_ Well, that tikes it, as the girl said when her hat blew off withthe fluffy transformation pinned to it."Winter rushed to the bathroom, and Furneaux crept languidly to bed.Before going to Knoleworth, Mr. Franklin consulted with Tomlin as to asuitable dinner, to which the other guests staying in the inn, namely,Mr. Peters and the Scotland Yard gentleman--the little man with theFrench name--might be invited. This important point settled, Mr. Franklincaught an early train, and was absent all day, being, in fact, closetedwith Superintendent Fowler and a Treasury solicitor.Furneaux was sound asleep long after twelve o'clock, and swore at Tomlinin French when the landlord ventured to arouse him. Tomlin wentdownstairs scratching his head."Least said soonest mended," he communed, "but we may all be murdered inour beds if them's the sort of 'tecs we 'ave to look arter us."However, he cheered up towards night. Ingerman, a lawyer, and somepressmen, arriving for the inquest, filled every available room, and thekitchen was redolent of good fare. All parties gathered in thedining-room, of course, and Ingerman had an eye for Mr. Franklin's party.The scraps of talk he overheard were nothing more exciting than theprospects of a certain horse for the Stewards' Cup. Peters had the tipstraight from the stables. A racing certainty, with a stone in hand.After dinner the financier was surprised when Furneaux approached, andtapped him professionally on the shoulder."A word with you outside," he said.Ingerman was irritated--perhaps slightly alarmed."Can't we talk here?" he said, in that singularly melodious voice of his."Better not, but I shan't detain you more than five minutes.""Anything my legal adviser might wish to hear?""Not from me. Tell him yourself afterwards, if you like."In the quiet street the detective suddenly linked arms with hiscompanion. Probably he smiled sardonically when he felt a telltale quiverrun through Ingerman's lanky frame."You've brought down Norris, I see?" he began."Yes.""Meaning to make things hot for Grant tomorrow?""Meaning to give justice the materials--""Cut the cackle, Isidor. I know you, and it's high time you knew me.Grant has retained Belcher. Ah! that gets you, does it? You haven'tforgotten Belcher. Now, be reasonable! Or, rather, don't run your headinto a noose. Grant had no more to do with the murder of your wife thanyou had. Call off Norris, and Grant withdraws Belcher. Twig? It's deadeasy, because the Treasury solicitor will simply ask for another week'sadjournment, as the police are not ready to go on. In the meantime, youpay off Norris, and save your face. Is it a deal?""Am I to understand--""Don't wriggle! The key of the situation is held by Belcher. Name of apipe! What prompting does Belcher need from me or anybody else after theBokfontein Lands case?""But--""Isidor, this is the last word. I was at the funeral on Saturday, and metyour wife's mother and sister. They do love you, don't they?"Ingerman died game."If I have your assurance that Mr. Grant is really innocent of Adelaide'sdeath, that is sufficient," he said slowly."Well, if it pleases you to put it that way, I'm agreeable. Which is yourroad? Back to the hotel? I'm for a short stroll. Mind you, no wobbling!Go straight, and I'll attend to Belcher. But, good Lord! How his eyeswill sparkle when they light on you to-morrow!"Neither the redoubtable Belcher, nor the Bokfontein Lands, nor poorAdelaide Melhuish's mother and sister may figure further in thischronicle. The inquest opened at the appointed hour next day, and wasclosed down again for a week with a celerity that was most disappointingboth to the jury and the general public. Of three legal luminariespresent only one, the Treasury man, uttered a few bald words. Belcher andNorris did not even announce the names of their clients. Norris noticedthat Belcher surveyed Ingerman with a grim smile, but thought nothing ofit until he received a check later in the week. Then he made someinquiries, and smiled himself.The foreman of the jury looked a trifle pinched, though his cheeks boretwo spots of hectic color. Mr. Franklin, drawn to the court by curiosity,happened to glance at him once, and found him gazing at Furneaux in apeculiarly thoughtful manner.Elkin, thriving on a diet of tea and eggs, was also interested in therepresentative of Scotland Yard. He seemed to ignore Grant entirely.Doris Martin was not in court. Superintendent Fowler had called abouthalf, past nine to tell her she would not be asked to attend that day.Near Mr. Franklin sat a few village notabilities, who, since they had notthe remotest connection with anyone concerned in the tragedy, have beenleft hitherto in their Olympian solitude. He listened to their comments."As usual, the police are utterly at sea," said one."Yes, 'following up important clews,' the newspapers say," scoffedanother."It's a disgraceful thing if a crime like this goes undetected andunpunished.""Which is the Scotland Yard man!""The small chap, in the blue suit.""What? _That_ little rat!""Oh, he's sharp. I met a man in the train and he told me--"Mr. Franklin grinned amiably; Hobbs, the butcher, intercepting his eye,grinned back. It is not difficult to imagine what portion of theforegoing small talk reached Furneaux subsequently.Oddly enough, both detectives had missed a brief but illuminatingincident which took place in the Hare and Hounds the previous night,while Winter was finishing a cigar with Peters, and Furneaux wasbludgeoning Ingerinan into compliance with his wishes.Elkin's remarkable improvement in health was commented on by Hobbs, andSiddle took the credit."That last mixture has proved beneficial, then?" he said, eying thehorse-dealer closely."Top-hole," smirked Elkin. "But it's only fair to say that I've chuckedwhiskey, too.""Did you finish the bottle?""Which bottle?""Mine, of course.""Nearly.""Don't take any more. It was decidedly strong. I'll send a boy earlyto-morrow morning with a first-rate tonic, and you might give him any oldmedicine bottles you possess. I'm running short."Elkin hesitated a second or two."I'll tell my housekeeper to look 'em up," he said. After the inquest hecommunicated this episode to Furneaux as a great joke."Queer, isn't it?" he guffawed. "A couple of dozen bottles went back, asI'm always getting stuff for the gees, but those two weren't among 'em.You took care of that, eh? When will you have the analysis?""It'll be fully a week yet," said the detective. "Government offices arenot run like express trains, and this is a free job, you know. But, beadvised by me. Stick to plain food, and throw physic to the dogs."Another singular fact, unobserved by the public at large, was that apoliceman, either Robinson or a stranger, patrolled the high-street allday and all night, while no one outside official circles was aware thatother members of the force watched The Hollies, or were secreted amongthe trees on the cliffside, from dusk to dawn.Next morning, however, there was real cause for talk. Siddle's shop wasclosed. Over the letter-box, neatly printed, was gummed a notice:"Called away on business. Will open for one hour after arrival of 7 p. m.train. T. S."Everyone who passed stopped to read. Even Mr. Franklin joined Furneauxand Peters in a stroll across the road to have a look."I want you a minute," said the big man suddenly to Furneaux. There wasthat in his tone which forbade questioning, so Peters sheered off, wellcontent with the share permitted him in the inquiry thus far."That fellow, Hart, is no fool," went on Winter rapidly. "He said lastnight 'How does one get evidence?' It was not easy to answer. Siddle hasgone to his mother's funeral. What do you think!""You'd turn me into a housebreaker, would you?" whined Furneaux bitterly."I must do the job, of course, just because I'm a little one. Well, well!After a long and honorable career I have to become a sneak thief. It maycost me my pension.""There's no real difficulty. An orchard--""Bet you a new hat I went over the ground before you did.""Get over it quickly now, and get something out of it, and I'll _give_you a new hat. Got any tools?""I fetched 'em from town Tuesday morning," chortled Furneaux. "So nowwho's the brainy one?"He skipped into the hotel, while Winter went to the station to make sureof Siddle's departure and destination. Yes, the chemist had taken areturn ticket to Epsom, where a strip of dank meadow-land on the road toEsher marks the last resting-place of many of London's epileptics. Onreturning to the high-street, Winter lighted a cigar, a somewhat commonoccurrence in his everyday life, where-upon Furneaux walked swiftly upthe hill. A farmer, living near the center of the village, owned a rathershowy cob. Winter found the man, and persuaded him to trot the animal toand fro in front of the hotel. There was a good deal of noise andhoof-clattering, and people came to their doors to see what was going on.Obviously, if they were watching the antics of a skittish two-year-old inthe high-street, their eyes were blind to proceedings in the backpremises. Even the postmaster and his daughter were interested onlookers,and a policeman, who might have put a summary end to the display,vanished as though by magic.Luckily, Winter was a good judge of a horse. When the cob was stabled,and the farmer came to the inn to have a drink, he was forced to admit atendency to cow hocks, which, it would seem, is held a fatal blemish inthe Argentine.Meanwhile, Furneaux had dodged into a lane and thence to a bridle-pathwhich emerged near Bob Smith's forge. When he had traversed, roughlyspeaking, one-half of a rectangle in which the Hare and Hounds occupiedthe center of one of the longer sides, he climbed a gate and followed ahedge. Though not losing a second, he took every precaution to remainunseen, and, to the best of his belief, gained an inclosed yard at theback of Siddle's premises without having attracted attention. He slippedthe catch of a kitchen window only to discover that the sash wasfastened by screws also. The lock of the kitchen door yielded topersuasion, but there were bolts above and below. A wire screen in alarder window was impregnable. Short of cutting out a pane of glass, hecould not effect an entry on the ground floor.Nimble as a squirrel, and risking everything, he climbed to the roof ofan outhouse, and tried a bedroom window. Here he succeeded. When thecatch was forced, there were no further obstacles. In he went, pausingonly to look around and see if any curious or alarmed eye was watchinghim. He wondered why every back yard on that side of the high-street wasempty, not even a maid-servant or woman washing clothes being in sight,but understood and grinned when the commotion Winter was creating came inview from a front room.Then he undertook a methodical search, working with a rapid yetpainstaking thoroughness which missed nothing. From a wardrobe heselected an overcoat and pair of trousers which reeked with turpentine.They were old and soiled garments, very different from the well-cut blackcoat and waistcoat, with striped cloth trousers, worn daily by thechemist. He drew a blank in the remainder of the upstairs rooms, whichincluded a sitting-room, though he devoted fully quarter of an hour toreading the titles of Siddle's books.A safe in the little dispensing closet at the back of the shop promisedsheer defiance until Furneaux saw a bunch of keys resting beside amethylated spirit lamp."'Twas ever thus!" he cackled, lighting the lamp. "Heaven help us poordetectives if it wasn't!"In a word, since murder will out, Siddle had forgotten his keys!Probably, he had gone to the safe for money, and, while writing thenotice as to his absence, had laid down the keys and omitted to pickthem up again.Furneaux disregarded ledgers and account books. He examined a bankpass-book and a check-book. In a drawer which contained these and aquantity of gold he found a small, leather-bound book with a lock, whichno key on the bunch was tiny enough to fit. A bit of twisted wire soonovercame this difficulty, and Furneaux began to read.There were quaint diagrams, and surveyor's sketches, both in plan andsection, with curious notes, and occasional records of what appeared tobe passages from letters or conversations. The detective read, andread, referring back and forth, absorbed in his task, no doubt, butevidently puzzled.At last, he stuffed the book into a pocket, completed his scrutiny of thesafe, examined the bottles on the shelf labeled "poisons," and took asample of the colorless contents of one bottle marked "C10H14N2."Then he went to the kitchen, replaced all catches and the lock of thedoor, and let himself out by the way he had come.Winter saw him from afar, and hastened upstairs to the privatesitting-room. Furneaux appeared there soon."Well?" said the Chief Inspector eagerly."Got him, I think," said Furneaux.Not much might be gathered from that monosyllabic question and itsanswer, but its significance in Siddle's ears, could he have heard, wouldhave been that of the passing bell tolling for the dead.CHAPTER XVIIITHE TRUTH AT LASTNot often did Furneaux qualify an opinion by that dubious phrase, "Ithink," which, in its colloquial sense, implies that the thought containsa reservation as to possible error.Winter looked anxious. Both he and his colleague knew well when to dropthe good-natured banter they delighted in. They were face to face nowwith issues of life and death, dark and sinister conditions which hadalready destroyed one life, threatened another, and might envisagefurther horrors. Small wonder, then, if the Chief Inspector's usuallycheerful face was clouded, or that his hopes should be somewhat dashedwhen Furneaux seemed to lack the abounding confidence which was his mostmarked characteristic."You've got something, I see," he said, trying to speak encouragingly,and glancing at the bundle of clothing which Furneaux had wrapped in anewspaper before dropping from the bedroom window of Siddle's house."Yes, a lot. What to make of it is the puzzle. We either go ahead on theflimsiest of evidence or I carry out another housebreaking job thisafternoon and restore things in status quo. First, the bundle--an oldcovert-coating overcoat and a pair of frayed trousers which probablydraped Owd Ben's ghost. They've been soaked in turpentine, which, chemistor no chemist, is still the best agent for removing stains. We'll put 'emunder the glass after we've examined the book. Siddle keeps a sort ofdiary, a series of jumbled memoranda. If we can extract nutriment out ofthat we may have something tangible to go upon. Let's begin at the end."Opening the leather-bound note-book, Furneaux stood with his back to thewindow. Winter, owing to his superior height, could look over the lesserman's shoulder. Many an occult document affecting the famous crimes andsocial or dynastic intrigues of the previous decade had these twoexamined in that way, the main advantage of scrutiny in common being thatthey could compare readings or suggested readings without loss of time,and with the original manuscript before both pairs of eyes.In the first instance, there were no dates--only scraps of sentences, orcomments. The concluding entry in the book was:"A tactical error? Perhaps. Immovable."Then, taking the order backward:"Scout the very notion of such an infamy. You and every scandal-monger inS. may do your worst.""Free to confess that events have opened my eyes to the truth, so, notfor the first time, out of evil comes good.""A prig.""Visit for such a purpose a piece of unheard-of impudence."These were all on one page."Quite clearly a _precis_ of Grant's remarks when Siddle called onMonday," said Winter.At any other time, Furneaux would have waxed sarcastic. Now hemerely nodded."Stops in a queer way," he muttered. "Not a word about the inquest or themissing bottles."The preceding page held even more disjointed entries, which,nevertheless, provided a fair synopsis of Doris's spirited words on theSunday afternoon."Malice and ignorance.""Patient because of years.""Loyal comrade. Shall remain.""Code.""No difference in friendship.""E. hopeless. Contempt.""Skipping--good."On the next page:"Isidor G. Ingerman. Useful. Inquire.""E.'s boasts? Nonsensical, surely!""Why has D. gone?"Both men paused at that line."Detective?" suggested Winter."That's how I take it," agreed Furneaux.Then came a sign: "+10%.""Elkin's mixture was not 'as before.' It was fortified," grinnedFurneaux. "That's the exact increase of nicotine. By the way, I havea sample. We can take care of him on that charge, without a shadowof doubt."Winter blew softly on the back of his friend's head."You're thorough, Charles, thorough!" he murmured. "It's a treat to workwith you when you get really busy."Furneaux ran his thumb across the end of several leaves."I can tell you now," he said, "that there's nothing of real value in theearlier notes. So far as I can judge, they refer either to a sort ofsettlement with his wife or chance phrases used by Doris Martin whichmight imply that she was heart whole and fancy free. There's not a ballyword dealing with the murder, or that can be twisted into the vaguestallusion to it. But here's a plan and section which have a sort ofsignificance. I've seen the place, so recognized it, or thought I did. Wemust check it, of course. Here you are! You know the footbridge acrossthe river from Bush Walk?""Yes.""The eastern end is supported on a hollow pier of masonry, in which onemight tog up unseen. These drawings would be useful as an _AideMemoire_ on a dark night. A false step, with the river in flood, mightbe awkward.""What's that on the opposite page?""I give it up--at present."This somewhat rare display of modesty on Furneaux's part was readilyunderstandable. A series of straight lines and angles conveyed verylittle hint of their purport; but Winter smiled behind his friend's back."I've been prowling about this wretched inn longer than you," he said."Look outside, to the left.""Don't need to, now," cackled Furneaux. "It's the profile of a wall,gate, and outhouse along which one could reach the window of theclub-room. Would you mind stopping grinning like a Cheshire cat?""Anything else?""Yes. This one: 'S.M.? 1820.' That beats you, eh?""Dished completely.""Doris Martin, as usual, supplies the answer. An old volume of the_Sussex Miscellany_, probably that for 1820, contains the full story ofOwd Ben. I might have mentioned it to you, but focussed on currentevents. Siddle has it among his books, which, by the way, are made uplargely of scientific and popular criminal records.""Is that the lot?""I'm afraid so. Have a look.""Just a minute. I want to think."Winter turned and gazed through the open window. Seldom had a moregracious June decked England with garlands. The hour was then high noon,and a pastoral landscape was drowned in sunshine. The Chief Inspector cutthe end off a cigar dreamily but with care."Broadmoor--perhaps," he muttered. "But we can't hang him yet, Charles. Acouple of knots and a theory won't do for the Assizes. We haven't asolitary witness. Hardly a night but he goes home at 9.30. If only he hadkilled Grant! But--Adelaide Melhuish!"In sheer despair he struck a match."Well, let's overhaul these duds," said Furneaux savagely. "I'll chancethe dinner hour for the return visit. Steynholme folk eat at half pasttwelve to the tick, and you can hardly get up another horse show."There was a knock at the door."Let me in, quick!" came Peters's voice, and the handle was triedforcibly."Go away! I'm busy!" cried Winter."This is urgent, devilish urgent," said Peters.Furneaux snatched up the note-book, and Winter tore off his coat,throwing it over the package which reposed in an armchair. Then the ChiefInspector unlocked the door, blocking the way aggressively."Now, I must say--" he began.But Peters clutched his shoulder with a nervous hand."Siddle has just hurried up the street and entered his shop," he hissed.The journalist had not only kept his eyes open, but excelled in the artof putting two and two together, an arithmetical calculation which, asapplied to the affairs of life, is not so readily arrived at as manypeople imagine."Buncoed! He's missed his keys!" shrilled Furneaux."Confound the man! He might at least have attended his mother's funeral!"stormed Winter, retrieving his coat.Thus it happened that Furneaux was the first down the stairs, though thethree emerged from the door of the inn on each other's heels. A stoutman, in all likelihood a farmer with horses for sale, was mounting thetwo steps which led to the entrance. His head was down, and his weightforward, so he successfully resisted Furneaux's impact, but Peters andWinter were irresistible, and he tumbled over with a muffled yell.At that instant Siddle quitted his shop, and headed straight for the postoffice. In his right hand he carried an automatic pistol. The street waswide. Furneaux, absolutely fearless in the performance of his duty, ranin a curve so as to bar the chemist's path, and it was then that Siddlesaw him. The man's face was terrible to behold. His eyes were rolling,his teeth gnashing; he had bitten his tongue and cheeks, and hisstertorous breathing ejected from his mouth foam tinged with blood."Ha!" he screamed in a falsetto of fury, "not yet, little man, not yet!"With that he raised the pistol, and fired point-blank at the detective.Furneaux ducked, and seized a small stone, being otherwise quite unarmed.He threw it with unerring aim, and, as was determined subsequently,struck the hand holding the weapon. Possibly, almost by a miracle, theblow caused a faulty pressure, because the action jammed, though thepistol itself was most accurate and deadly in its properties.By this time Winter, sweeping Peters aside, was within ten feet of themaniac, who turned and ran into the shop. The door, a solid one, fittedwith a spring lock, slammed in the Chief Inspector's face, and resisted amighty effort to burst it open. A few yards away stood an empty,two-wheeled cart, uptilted, and Winter demanded the help of a few men whohad gathered on seeing or hearing the hubbub."I call on you in the King's name!" he shouted. "We must force that door!Then stand clear, all of you!"He raced to the cart, and, when his object was perceived, willing handsassisted in converting the heavy vehicle into a battering-ram. Thegradient of the hill favored the attack, which was made at an acuteangle, and the first assault smashed the lock. There were a couple ofseconds' delay while the cart was backed out, and the detectives rushedin, Furneaux leading, because Winter gave his great physical strength tothe shafts. But the Chief Inspector grabbed his tiny friend by thecollar as the latter darted around the counter and into the dispensaryin the rear."Two of us can't go abreast, and you'll only get hurt," he said, speakingwith a calmness that was majestic in the circumstances."The nicotine is gone!" yelped Furneaux; both saw that the safestood open.Behind the dispensary was a small passage, whence the stairs mounted, anda door led to the kitchen. That door was closed now, though it was openwhen Furneaux ransacked the house. Therefore, they made that way at once.No ordinary lock could resist Winter's shoulder, and he soon masteredthis barrier. But the kitchen was empty--the outer door locked butunbolted. Since it is practically impossible for the strongest man topull a door open, the two made for the window, and tore at screws andcatch with eager fingers. Furneaux, light and nimble-footed, scrambledthrough first, so it was he who found Siddle lying in the orchard beyondthe wall of the yard. The unhappy wretch had swallowed nearly the wholeremaining contents of the bottle of nicotine, or enough to poison a scoreof robust men. He presented a lamentable and distressing spectacle. Someof the more venturesome passers-by, who had crowded after the detectivesand Peters, could not bear to look on, and slunk away in horror.Furneaux soon brought an emetic, which failed to act. Siddle breathed hislast while the glass was at his lips.In that moment of crisis only three men did not lose their heads. Wintercleared away the gapers, while Furneaux remained with the body. P.C.Robinson came up the hill at a run, and was sent for a stretcher,bringing from Hobbs's shop the very one on which the ill-fated AdelaideMelhuish was carried from the river bank.But where was Peters? In the post office, writing the first of a seriesof thrilling dispatches to a London evening newspaper. What journalistever had a more sensational murder-case to supply "copy"? And when was"special correspondent" ever better primed for the task? He wrote on, andon, till the telegraphist cried halt. Then he hied him to London bytrain, and began the more ambitious "story" for next morning. What he didnot know he guessed correctly. A fagged but triumphant man was JimmiePeters when he "blew in" to the Savage Club at 1 A.M. to seek sustenanceand a whiskey and soda before going home.Furneaux was white and shaken when Winter escorted the stretcher-bearersto the orchard."Poor devil!" he said, as the men lifted the body. "Foredoomed frombirth! We can eradicate these diseases from cattle. Why not from men!"The villagers could not understand him. Already, in some mysterious way,the word had gone around that Siddle had murdered the actress, and takenhis own life to avoid arrest, after shooting at the detective who was hoton his trail.Not until Peters's articles came back to Steynholme did the public atlarge realize that the chemist undoubtedly meant to kill Doris Martin. Hewas going straight to the post office when the way was barred byFurneaux. The bullet which missed the latter actually pierced the zincplate of the letter-box, and scored a furrow, inches long, in an oakcounter which it struck laterally.The village did not recover its poise for hours. Grant and Hart, to whomBates brought the news about one o'clock, rose from an untasted luncheonand hurried to the high-street. Knots of people stared at Grant, somesheepishly, others with frank relief, because all who knew him liked him.One man, a retired ironmonger and an impulsive fellow, came forward andwrung his hand heartily. A few prominent residents followed suit. Grantwas greatly embarrassed, but managed to endure these awkward ifwell-meant congratulations. There could be no mistaking their intent. Hehad been tried for murder at the bar of public opinion, and was nowformally acquitted.Even Fred Elkin, ignorant as yet of his own peril, yielded to theinfluences of the moment and bustled through the crowd."Mr. Grant," he cried outspokenly, "I ask your pardon. I seem to havemade a d--d fool of myself!""Easier done than said," chimed in Hart. "But, among all thisbell-ringing, can anyone tell what has actually happened? Where'sPeters?""In the post office."The two went in, and found the journalist scribbling against time. Hartcoolly grabbed a few slips of manuscript, and commenced reading. Grantlooked about for Doris. She was not visible, but Mr. Martin, pallid andnervous, nodded toward the sitting-room. The younger man, taking thegesture as a tacit invitation, entered the room.Doris was sitting there, crying bitterly. Poor girl! She had seen thatportion of the drama which was enacted in the street, and the shock of itwas still poignant. She looked up and met her lover's eyes. Neitheruttered a word, but Grant did a very wise thing. He caught her by theshoulders, raised her to her feet, and, after kissing her squarely on thelips, gave her a comforting hug."It will be all right now, Doris," he whispered tenderly. "Suchthunderstorms clear the air."An eminent novelist might have found many more ornate ways of avowinghis sentiments, but never a more satisfactory one. At any rate, itserved, so what more need be said?Certain rills of evidence accumulated into a fair-sized stream beforenight fell. P.C. Robinson, for instance, scored a point by ascertainingthat Peggy Smith had seen Furneaux dropping from the bedroom window ofthe chemist's shop. She was some hundreds of yards away, and could not bepositive that some man, perhaps a glazier, had not been therelegitimately effecting repairs. Still, when she met Siddle hurrying fromthe station, she told him of the incident."He never even thanked me," she said, "but broke into a run. The look inhis eyes was awful."The girl had, in fact, confirmed his worst fears, and her neighborlysolicitude had merely hastened the end.Again, the railway officials showed that Siddle had returned fromVictoria instead of taking train to the asylum. Furneaux had guessedaright. The discovery that his keys had been left behind drove the maninto a panic of fright.It took nearly three weeks before the unhappy business was finallydisposed of. A Treasury solicitor was given the chance of his career bythe medico-legal disquisition which cleared up an extraordinary record.The annals of the disease which predisposed Theodore Siddle to crimewent back many years. He was a fairly wealthy man by inheritance, andadopted the profession of chemistry as a hobby. One fact stood outboldly. He was aware of his hereditary taint, and had settled down inSteynholme believing that a quiet life, free from care or thedistractions of a town, would enable him to overcome it. Probably, thelawyer held, the man owned two distinct individualities, and the baserinstincts gradually overpowered the humane ones.Of course, the whole history of those trying days had to come out in opencourt, and the postmaster's daughter was given a descriptive andpictorial boom which many an actress envied. Peters was restored to gracewhen he showed plainly that his articles had kept the fickle barometer ofpublic opinion at "set fair," in so far as Grant and Doris wereconcerned."But," as Hart drawled during a dinner of reconciliation, "you needn'thave been so infernally personal about my hat."Grant and Doris were married before the year was out. Mr. Martin retiredon a pension, and the young couple decided that they could neverdissociate The Hollies from the tragic memories bound up with itsghost-window and lawn. So the place was sold, and Steynholme knows "thepostmaster's daughter" no more. Winter and Furneaux week-ended with themrecently at a pretty little nook in Dorset. Hart, just home from theBalkans, traveled from town with the detectives, and Doris, a radiantyoung matron, was as flippant as the best of them.One evening, when the men were sitting late in the smoking-room, the talkturned on the now half-forgotten drama in which the hapless AdelaideMelhuish played her last role."I met Peters in the Savage Club the other night," said Hart, filling thenegro-head pipe with care while he talked, "and he was chortling abouthis 'psychological study,' as he called it, of that unfortunate chemist.He still clings to the theory that your wife was the intended victim,Grant. Do you agree with him?""Rubbish!" cried Furneaux, before his host could answer. "At best, Petersis only a clever ass. Siddle never had the remotest notion of killingMiss Doris Martin, as Mrs. Grant was then. We shall never know forcertain just what happened, but there are elements in the affair whichgive ground for reasonable guesswork. The first thing that impressedWinter and me--at least, I suppose I really evolved the idea, though mybulky friend elaborated it" (whereat Winter smiled forgivingly, andbeheaded a fresh Havana) "was the complete noiselessness of the crime.Here we had Mr. Grant startled by the face at the window, and actuallysearching outside the house for the ghostly visitant, while Miss Doriswas gazing at The Hollies from the other side of the river, and not asound was heard, though it was a summer's night, without a breath ofwind, and at an hour when the splash of a fish leaping in the streamwould have created a commotion. Now, Miss Melhuish was an active andwell-built young woman, an actress, too, and therefore likely to meet anemergency without instant collapse. Yet she allows herself to be struckdead or insensible without cry or struggle! How do you account for it?""Go on, Charles; don't be theatrical," jeered Winter. "You've got thestory pat. Even that simile of the jumping fish is mine.""True," agreed Furneaux. "I only brought it in as a sop. But, tocontinue, as the tub-thumper says. Isn't it permissible to assume thatSiddle accompanied the lady, either by prior arrangement or by contrivinga meeting which looked like mere chance? We know that she went to hisshop. We know, too, that he was clever and unscrupulous, and any allusionto Grant would stir his wits to the uttermost. He would see instantly howinterested Miss Melhuish was in the owner of The Hollies, while she, asmart Londoner, would recognize in Siddle an informant worth all the restof the babblers in Steynholme. At any rate, no matter how the thing wasbrought about, it is self-evident that Siddle brought his intended victiminto the grounds, and told her of the small uncovered window throughwhich she could peer at Grant after Miss Doris had gone. He showed herwhich path to use, and undoubtedly waited for her, and stayed her flightwhen Grant rose from his chair. She was close to him, and whollyunafraid, finding in him an ally. They were purposely hidden, in thegloom of dense foliage, and remained there until Grant had closed thewindow again. Then, and not till then, did the murderer strike, probablystifling her with his free hand. He had the implement in his pocket. Therope was secreted among the bushes. He could carry through the wholewretched crime in little more than a minute. And his psychology went fardeeper than Peters gave him credit for. He had weighed up the situationto a nicety. No matter who found the body, Mr. Grant was saddled with aresponsibility which might well prove disastrous, and was almost sure toaffect his relations with the Martin household. For instance, nothingshort of a miracle could have stopped Robinson from arresting him on acharge of murder.""You, then, are a miracle?" put in Hart, pointing the pipe at thelittle man."To the person of ordinary intelligence--yes.""After that," said Winter, "there is nothing more to be said. Let's seewho secures the pocket marvel as a partner at auction."       *       *       *       *       *As a fitting end to the strange story of wayward love and maniacal frenzywhich found an unusual habitat in a secluded hamlet like Steynholme, asmall vignette of its normal life may be etched in. The trope is germaneto the scene.On a wet afternoon in October Hobbs and Elkin had adjourned to the Hareand Hounds. Tomlin was reading a newspaper spread on the bar counter. Hewas alone. The day was Friday, and the last "commercial" of the week haddeparted by the mid-day train."Wot's yer tonic?" demanded the butcher."A glass of beer," threw Elkin over his shoulder. He had walked to thewindow, and was gazing moodily at the sign of the "plumber and decorator"who had taken Siddle's shop. The village could not really support anout-and-out chemist, so a local grocer had elected to stock patentmedicines as a side line.Tomlin made play with a beer-pump."Where's yer own?" inquired Hobbs hospitably.Elkin came and drank. After an interlude, Tomlin ran a finger down acolumn of the newspaper."By the way, Fred, didn't you tell me about that funny little chap,Furno, the 'tec, buyin' some pictures of yours?" he said."I did. Had him there, anyhow," chuckled Elkin."How much did you stick 'im for?""Three guineas.""They can't ha' bin this lot, then, though I've a notion it wur the samename, 'Aylesbury Steeplechase.'""What are you talking about?""This."Tomlin turned the paper, and Elkin read:At their monthly art sale on Wednesday Messrs. Brown, Jenkins and Browndisposed of an almost unique set of colored prints, by F. Smyth, dated1841. The series of six represented various phases of the long defunctAylesbury Steeplechase, "The Start," "The Brook," "The In-and-Out," andso on to "The Finish." It is understood that this notable series,produced during the best period of the art, and at the very zenith ofSmyth's fame, were acquired recently by a Sussex amateur at a low price.Bidding began at fifty guineas, and rose quickly to one hundred andtwenty, at which figure Messrs. Carnioli and Bruschi became the owners.Elkin read the paragraph twice, until the words burnt into his brain."No," he said thickly. "They're not mine.
