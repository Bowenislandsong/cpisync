s satisfactorily completed. I have succeeded withyou----""Completed, Mr. Fraser!" said Angela, open-eyed. "Do you mean to saythat I am to stop now just as I have begun to learn?""My dear, you have learnt everything that I can teach you, and,besides, I am going away the day after to-morrow.""Going away!" and then and there, without the slightest warning,Angela--who, for all her beauty and learning, very much resembled therest of her sex--burst into tears."Come, come, Angela," said Mr. Fraser, in a voice meant to be gruff,but only succeeding in being husky, for, oddly enough, it is tryingeven to a clergyman on the wrong side of middle-age to be wept over bya lovely woman; "don't be nonsensical; I am only going for a fewmonths."At this intelligence she pulled up a little."Oh," she said, between her sobs, "how you frightened me! How couldyou be so cruel! Where are you going to?""I am going for a long trip in southern Europe. Do you know that Ihave scarcely been away from this place for twenty years, so I mean tocelebrate the conclusion of our studies by taking a holiday.""I wish you would take me with you."Mr. Fraser coloured slightly, and his eye brightened. He sighed as heanswered--"I am afraid, my dear, that it would be impossible."Something warned Angela not to pursue the subject."Now, Angela, I believe that it is usual, on the occasion of theseverance of a scholastic connection, to deliver something in thenature of a farewell oration. Well, I am not going to do that, but Iwant you to listen to a few words."She did not answer, but, drawing a stool to a corner of the fireplace,she wiped her eyes and sat down almost at his feet, clasping her kneeswith her hands, and gazing rather sadly into the fire."You have, dear Angela," he began, "been educated in a somewhatunusual way, with the result that, after ten years of steady work thathas been always interesting, though sometimes arduous, you haveacquired information denied to the vast majority of your sex, whilstat the same time you could be put to the blush in many things by aschool-girl of fifteen. For instance, though I firmly believe that youcould at the present moment take a double first at the University,your knowledge of English literature is almost nil, and your historyof the weakest. All a woman's ordinary accomplishments, such asdrawing, playing, singing, have of necessity been to a great extentneglected, since I was not able to teach them to you myself, and youhave had to be guided solely by books and by the light of Nature ingiving to them such time as you could spare."Your mind, on the other hand, has been daily saturated with thenoblest thoughts of the intellectual giants of two thousand years ago,and would in that respect be as much in place in a well-educatedGrecian maiden living before the time of Christ as in an English girlof the nineteenth century."I have educated you thus, Angela, partly by accident and partly bydesign. You will remember when you began to come here some ten yearssince--you were a little thing then--and I had offered to give yousome teaching, because you interested me, and I saw that you wererunning wild in mind and body. But, when I had undertaken the task Iwas somewhat puzzled how to carry it out. It is one thing to offer toeducate a little girl, and another to do it. Not knowing where tobegin, I fell back upon the Latin grammar, where I had begun myself,and so by degrees you slid into the curriculum of a classical andmathematical education. Then, after a year or two, I perceived yourpower of work and your great natural ability, and I formed a design. Isaid to myself, 'I will see how far a woman cultivated underfavourable conditions can go. I will patiently teach this girl tillthe literature of Greece and Rome become as familiar to her as hermother-tongue, till figures and symbols hide no mysteries from her,till she can read the heavens like a book. I will teach her mind tofollow the secret ways of knowledge, I will train it till it can soarabove its fellows like a falcon above sparrows.' Angela, my prouddesign, pursued steadily through many years, has been at lengthaccomplished; your bright intellect has risen to the strain I have putupon it, and you are at this moment one of the best all-round scholarsof my acquaintance."She flushed to the eyes at this high praise, and was about to speak,but he stopped her with a motion of the hand, and went on:"I have recognized in teaching you a fact but too little known, that aclassical education, properly understood, is the foundation of alllearning. There is little that is worth saying which has not alreadybeen beautifully said by the ancients, little that is worthy ofmeditation on which they have not already profoundly reflected, save,indeed, the one great subject of Christian meditation. Thisfoundation, my dear Angela, you possess to an eminent degree.Henceforth you will need no assistance from me or any other man, for,to your trained mind, all ordinary knowledge will be easy toassimilate. You will receive in the course of a few days a partingpresent from myself in the shape of a box of carefully chosen books onEuropean literature and history. Devote yourself to the study ofthese, and of the German language, which was your mother's nativetongue, for the next year, and then I shall consider that you arefairly finished, and then, too, my dear Angela, I shall expect to reapa full reward for my labours.""What is it that you will expect of me?""I shall expect, Angela," and he rose from his chair and walked up anddown the room in his excitement--"I shall expect to see you take yourproper place in your generation. I shall say: 'Choose your own line,become a critical scholar, a practical mathematician, or--and perhapsthat is what you are most suited for with your imaginative powers--awriter of fiction. For remember that fiction, properly understood anddirected to worthy aims, is the noblest and most far-reaching, as itis also the most difficult of the arts.' In watching the success thatwill assuredly attend you in this or any other line, I shall be amplyrewarded for my trouble."Angela shook her head with a gesture of doubt, but he did not wait forher to answer."Well, my dear, I must not keep you any longer--it is quite dark andblowing a gale of wind--except to say one more word. Remember that allthis is--indirectly perhaps, but still none the less truly--a means toan end. There are two educations, the education of the mind and theeducation of the soul; unless you minister to the latter, all the timeand toil spent upon the former will prove to little purpose. Thelearning will, it is true, remain; but it will be as the quartz out ofwhich the gold has been already crushed, or the dry husks of corn. Itwill be valueless and turn to no good use, will serve only to feed theswine of intellectual voluptuousness and infidelity. It is, believeme, the higher learning of the soul that gilds our earthly lore. Theloftier object of all education is so to train the intellect that itmay become competent to understand something, however little, of thenature of our God, and to the true Christian the real end of learningis the appreciation of His attributes as exemplified in His mysteriesand earthly wonders. But perhaps that is a subject on which you are aswell fitted to discourse as I am, so I will not enter into it.'Finis,' my dear, 'finis.'"Angela's answer to this long oration was a simple one. She rose slowlyfrom her low seat, and, putting her hands upon Mr. Fraser's shoulders,kissed him on the forehead and said--"How shall I ever learn to be grateful enough for all I owe you? Whatshould I have been now but for you? How good and patient you have beento me!"This embrace affected the clergyman strangely; he put his hand to hisheart, and a troubled look came into his eyes. Thrusting her gentlyaway from him, he sat down."Angela," he said presently, "go away now, dear, I am tired to-night;I shall see you at church to-morrow to say good-by."And so she went homewards, through the wind and storm, little knowingthat she left her master to struggle with a tempest far moretremendous than that which raged around her.As for him, as the door closed, he gave a sigh of relief."Pray God I have not put it off too long," he said to himself. "Andnow for to-morrow's sermon. Sleep for the young! laughter for thehappy! work for old fools--work, work, work!"And thus it was that Angela became a scholar.                             CHAPTER XVIIThe winter months passed away slowly for Angela, but not by any meansunhappily. Though she was quite alone and missed Mr. Fraser sadly, shefound considerable consolation in his present of books, and in thethought that she was getting a good hold of her new subjects of study.And then came the wonder of the spring with its rush of budding life,and who, least of all Angela, could be sad in springtime? Butnevertheless that spring marked an important change in our heroine,for it was during its sweet hours, when, having put her books aside,she would roam alone, or in company with her ravens, through theflower-starred woods around the lake, that a feeling of restlessness,amounting at times almost to dissatisfaction, took possession of her.Indeed, as the weeks crept on and she drew near the completion of hertwentieth year, she realized with a sigh that she could no longer callherself a girl, and began to feel that her life was incomplete, thatsomething was wanting in it. And this was what was wanting in Angela'slife: she had, if we except her nurse, no one to love, and she had somuch love to give!Did she but guess it, the still recesses of her heart already trembleto the footfall of one now drawing near: out of the multitude of thelives around her, a life is marked to mingle with her own. She doesnot know it, but as the first reflection of the dawn strikes theunconscious sky and shadows the coming of its king, so the red flushthat now so often springs unbidden to her brow, tells of girlhood'stwilight ended, and proclaims the advent of woman's life and love."Angela," called her father one day, as he heard her footsteps passinghis study, "come in here; I want to speak to you."His daughter stopped, and a look of blank astonishment spread itselfover her face. She had not been called into that study for years. Sheentered, however, as bidden. Her father, who was seated at hiswriting-table, which was piled up with account-books, did not greatlydiffer in appearance from what he was when we last saw him twentyyears ago. His frame had grown more massive, and acquired a slightstoop, but he was still a young, powerful-looking man, and certainlydid not appear a day more than his age of forty-two. The eyes,however, so long as no one was looking at them, had contracted aconcentrated stare, as though they were eternally gazing at someobject in space, and this appearance was rendered the more marked byan apparently permanent puckering of the skin of the forehead. Themoment, however, that they came under the fire of anybody else'soptics, and, oddly enough, more particularly those of his owndaughter, the stare vanished, and they grew shifty and uncertain to acurious degree.Philip was employed in adding up something when his daughter entered,and motioned to her to sit down. She did so, and fixed her great greyeyes on him with some curiosity. The effect was remarkable; her fatherfidgeted, made a mistake in his calculations, glanced all round theroom with his shifty eyes (ah, how changed from those bold black eyeswith which Maria Lee fell in love four-and-twenty years ago!) andfinally threw down his pen with an exclamation that would have shockedAngela had she understood it."How often, Angela, have I asked you not to stare me out ofcountenance! It is a most unladylike trick of yours."She blushed painfully."I beg your pardon; I forgot. I will look out of the window.""Don't be a fool; look like other people. But now I want to speak toyou. In the first place, I find that the household expenditure for thelast year was three hundred and fifty pounds. That is more than I canafford; it must not exceed three hundred this year.""I will do my best to keep the expenses down, father; but I can assureyou that there is no money wasted now."Then came a pause, which, after humming and hawing a little, Philipwas the first to break."Do you know that I saw your cousin George yesterday? He is back atlast at Isleworth.""Yes, Pigott told me that he had come. He has been away a long while.""When did you last see him?""When I was about thirteen, I believe; before he lost the election,and went away.""He has been down here several times since then. I wonder that you didnot see him.""I always disliked him, and kept out of his way.""Gad, you can't dislike him more than I do; but I keep good friendswith him for all that, and you must do the same. Now, look here,Angela, will you promise to keep a secret?""Yes, father, if you wish it.""Well, then, I appear to be a poor man, don't I? And remember," headded, hastily, "that, with reference to household expenses, I ampoor; but, as a matter of fact"--and here he sunk his voice, andglanced suspiciously round--"I am worth at this moment nearly onehundred and fifty thousand pounds in hard cash.""That is six thousand pounds a year at four per cent.," commentedAngela, without a moment's hesitation. "Then I really think you mightput a flue into the old greenhouse, and allow a shilling a week toMrs. Jakes' mother.""Curse Mrs. Jakes' mother! Nobody but a woman would have interruptedwith such nonsense. Listen. You must have heard how I was disinheritedon account of my marriage with your mother, and the Isleworth estatesleft to your cousin George, and how, with a refined ingenuity, he wasforbidden to bequeath them back to me or to my children. But markthis, he is not forbidden to sell them to me; no doubt the old mannever dreamt that I should have the money to buy them; but, you see, Ihave almost enough.""How did you get so much money?""Get it! First, I took the gold plate my grandfather bought, and soldit. I had no right to do it, but I could not afford to have so muchcapital lying idle. It fetched nearly five thousand pounds. With thisI speculated successfully. In two years I had eighteen thousand. Theeighteen thousand I invested in a fourth share in a coal-mine, whenmoney was scarce and coals cheap. Coals rose enormously just then, andin five years' time I sold my share to the co-holders for eighty-twothousand, in addition to twenty-one thousand received by way ofinterest. Since then I have not speculated, for fear my luck shoulddesert me. I have simply allowed the money to accumulate on mortgageand other investments, and bided my time, for I have sworn to havethose estates back before I die. It is for this cause that I havetoiled, and thought, and screwed, and been cut by the wholeneighbourhood for twenty years; but now I think that, with your help,my time is coming.""With _my_ help. What is it that you wish me to do?""Listen," answered her father, nervously tapping his pencil on theaccount-book before him. "George is not very fond of Isleworth--infact, he rather dislikes it; but, like all the Caresfoots, he does notcare about parting with landed property, and, though we appear to begood friends, he hates me too much ever to consent, under ordinarycircumstances, to sell it to me. It is to you I look to overcome thatobjection.""I! How?""You are a woman and you ask me how you should get the blind side of aman!""I do not in the least understand you."Philip smiled incredulously."Then I suppose I must explain. If ever you take the trouble to lookat yourself in the glass, you will probably see that Nature has beenvery kind to you in the matter of good looks; nor are you by any meansdeficient in brains. Your cousin George is very fond of a prettywoman, and, to be plain, what I want you to do is to make use of youradvantages to get him under your thumb and persuade him into sellingthe property.""Oh! father, how can you?" ejaculated Angela, in an agony of shame."You idiot, I won't want you to marry him; I only want you to make afool of him. Surely, being of the sex you are, you won't find _that_an uncongenial occupation."Angela's blushes had given away to pallor now, and she answered withcold contempt:"I don't think you quite understand what a girl feels--at least, whatI feel, for I know no other girls. Perhaps it would be useless for meto try to explain. I had rather go blind than use my eyes for such ashameful purpose.""Angela," said her father, with as much temper as he ever showed now,"let me tell you that you are a silly fool; you are more, you are anencumbrance. Your birth," he added, bitterly, "robbed me of yourmother, and the fact of your being a girl deprived our branch of thefamily of their rights. Now that you have grown up, you prefer togratify your whims rather than help me to realize the object of mylife by a simple course of action that could do no one any harm. Inever asked you to commit yourself in any way. Well, well, it is whatI must expect. We have not seen much of each other heretofore, andperhaps the less we meet in the future the better.""You have no right to talk to me so," she answered, with flashingeyes, "though I am your daughter, and it is cowardly to reproach mewith my birth, my sex, and my dependence. Am I responsible for any ofthese things? But I will not burden you long. And as to what youwanted me to do, and think such a little of, I ask you, is it what mypoor mother would have wished her daughter----"Here Philip abruptly rose, and left the room and the house."She is as like her mother as possible," he mused, as soon as he wasclear of the house. "It might have been Hilda herself, only she istwice as beautiful as Hilda was. I shall have another bad night afterthis, I know I shall. I must get rid of that girl somehow, I cannotbear her about me; she is a daily reminder of things I dare notremember, and whenever she stares at me with those at eyes of hers,I feel as though she were looking through me. I wonder if she knowsthe story of Maria Lee!"And then dismissing, or trying to dismiss, the matter from his mind,he took his way across the fields to Isleworth Hall, a large whitebrick mansion in the Queen Anne style, about two miles distant fromthe Abbey, and, on arrival, asked for his cousin George, and was atonce shown into that gentleman's presence.Years had told upon George more than they had upon Philip, and, thoughthere were no touches of grey in the flaming red of his hair, thebloodshot eyes, and the puckered crowsfeet beneath them, to saynothing of the slight but constant trembling of the hand, all showedthat he was a man well on in middle-life, and who had lived every dayof it. Time, too, had made the face more intensely unpleasant andvulgar-looking than ever. Such Caresfoot characteristics as itpossessed were, year by year, giving place, in an increasingly greaterdegree, to the kitchen-maid strain introduced by the mother. In short,George Caresfoot did not even look a gentleman, whereas Philipcertainly did."You don't seem very well, George. I am afraid that your travels havenot agreed with you.""My dear Philip," answered his cousin, in a languid and affectedvoice, "if you had lived the life that I have for the last twentyyears, you would look a little knocked up. I have had some very goodtimes; but the fact is, that I have been too prodigal of my strength,not thought enough about the future. It is a great mistake, and one ofthe worst results is that I am utterly _blase_ of everything; even _labelle passion_ is played out for me. I haven't seen a woman I caretwopence about for ten years.""Ah! you should sell this place, and take a house in town; it wouldsuit you much better.""I can do that without selling the place. I don't intend to sell theplace--in fact, nothing would induce me to do so. Some day I maymarry, and want to transmit it to some future Caresfoot; but I confessI don't mean to do that just yet. Marry when you want a nurse, butnever before; that's my maxim. Marriage is an excellent institutionfor parsons and fools, the two classes that Providence has created topopulate the world; but a wise man should as soon think of walkinginto a spring-trap. Take your own case, for instance, my dear Philip;look what marriage led to.""At any rate," answered his cousin, bitterly, "it led to youradvantage.""Exactly; and that is one of the reasons why I have such a respect forthe institution in the abstract. It has been my personal benefactor,and I worship it accordingly--at a distance. By the way, talking ofmarriage reminds me of its legitimate fruits. Bellamy tells me thatyour daughter Angela (if I had a daughter, I should call her Diabola,it is more appropriate for a woman) has grown uncommonly handsome.Bring her to see me; I adore beauty in all its forms, especially itsfemale form. Is she really so handsome?""I am no judge, but you will soon have an opportunity of forming anopinion--that is, I hope so. I propose coming with Angela to make aformal call on you to-morrow.""Good. Tell my fair cousin that I shall be certain to be in, and beprepared, metaphorically, to fall at the feet of so much loveliness.By the way, that reminds me; you have heard of Bellamy's, or ratherMrs. Bellamy's, good fortune, I suppose?""No.""What--not? Why, he is now Sir John Bellamy, knight.""Indeed! How is that?""You remember the bye-election six months back?""Oh, yes! I was actually badgered by Mrs. Bellamy into promising tovote, much against my personal convenience.""Exactly. Well, just at the time, old Prescott died, you may rememberthat Mr. Showers, the member of the Government, was unseated onpetition from some borough or other, and came down here post-haste toget re-elected. But he had Sir Percy Vivyan against him, and, as Iknow to my cost, this benighted country is not fond of those whopreach the gospel of progress. Bellamy, who is a stout Radical, as youknow--chiefly, I fancy, because there is more to be got out of thatside of politics--got the job as Showers' agent. But, three daysbefore, it became quite clear that his cause, cabinet minister or not,was hopeless. Then it was that Mrs.--I beg her pardon, Lady--Bellamycame to the fore. Just as Showers was thinking of withdrawing, shedemanded a private interview with him. Next day she posted off to oldSir Percy, who is a perfect fool of the chivalrous school, and wasdesperately fond of her, and, _mirabile dictu_, that evening Sir Percywithdraws on the plea of ill-health or some such rubbish, and Showerswalks over. Within three months, Mr. Bellamy becomes Sir John Bellamy,nominally for his services as town-clerk of Roxham, and I hear thatold Sir Percy is now perfectly rampant, and goes about cursing herladyship up hill and down dale, and declaring that he has beenshockingly taken-in. How our mutual friend worked the ropes is morethan I can tell you, but she did work them, and to some purpose.""She is an uncommonly handsome woman.""Ah! yes, you're right there, she is A1; but let us stroll out alittle; it is a fine evening for the 30th of April. To-morrow will bethe 1st of May, so it will, a day neither of us are likely to forget."Philip winced at the allusion, but said nothing."By the way," George went on, "I am expecting a visitor, my ward,young Arthur Heigham, who is just back from India. He will be twenty-five in a few days, when he comes of age, and is coming down to settleup. The fact is, that ten thousand of his money is on the Jotleyproperty, and both Bellamy and myself are anxious that it should stopthere for the present, as if the mortgage were called in it might beawkward.""Is he well off?""Comfortably; about a thousand a year; comes of an old family too.Bellamy and I knew his father, Captain Heigham, slightly, when we werein business. His wife, by the way, was a distant cousin of ours. Theyare both dead now; the captain was wiped out at Inkerman, and, forsome unknown reason, left me the young gentleman's sole guardian andjoint trustee with a London lawyer, a certain Mr. Borley. I have neverseen him yet--my ward, I mean--he has always been at Eton, orCambridge, or in India, or somewhere."Here Philip began to manifest signs of considerable uneasiness, thecause of which was sufficiently apparent; for, whilst they weretalking, a very large and savage-looking animal of the sheep-dog orderhad emerged from the house, and was following him up and down,growling in a low and ominous undertone, its nose being the whileglued to his calves as they alternately presented themselves in hisline of vision."Would you mind calling off this animal, George?" he said at length."He does not look amiable.""Oh! that's Snarleyow; don't mind him, he never bites unless youstop." Philip instinctively quickened his pace. "Isn't he a beauty?He's a pure bred Thibet sheep-dog, and I will back him to fightagainst any animal of his own weight. He killed two dogs in onemorning the other day, and pulled down a beggar-woman in the evening.You should have heard her holler."At that moment, fortunately for Philip's calves, which were beginningto tingle with an unwholesome excitement, Mr. Snarleyow's attentionwas diverted by the approach of a dog-cart, and he left to enjoy theamusement of snapping and barking at the horse. The cart pulled up atthe door, and out of it emerged a tall and extremely gentlemanly-looking young fellow, followed by a very large red bull-dog."Mr. Caresfoot, I believe," said the young gentleman to George, takingoff his hat."Yes, Mr. Heigham, at your service. I am very glad to see you. Mycousin, Mr. Philip Caresfoot."                            CHAPTER XVIII"I must apologize for having brought Aleck, my dog, you know, withme," began Arthur Heigham; "but the fact was, that at the very lastmoment the man I was going to leave him with had to go away, and I hadno time to find another place before the train left. I thought that,if you objected to dogs, he could easily be sent somewhere into thevillage. He is very good-tempered, though appearances are againsthim.""Oh! he will be all right, I daresay," said George, rather sulkily;for, with the exception of Snarleyow, in whose fiendish temper hefound something refreshing and congenial, he liked no dogs. "But youmust be careful, or Snarleyow, _my_ dog, will give him a hammering.Here, good dog, good dog," and he attempted to pat Aleck on the head,but the animal growled savagely, and avoided him."I never knew him do that before," ejaculated Arthur, in confusion,and heartily wishing Aleck somewhere else. "I suppose he has taken adislike to you. Dogs do sometimes, you know."Next second it struck him that this was one of those things that hadbetter have been left unsaid, and he grew more uncomfortable thanever. But at this very moment the situation was rendered intenselylively by the approach of the redoubtable Snarleyow himself, who,having snapped at the horse's heels all the way to the stables, had onhis return to the front of the house spotted Aleck from afar. He wasnow advancing on tiptoe in full order of battle, his wicked-lookingteeth gleaming, and his coat and tail standing out like an angrybear's.Arthur, already sufficiently put out about the dog question, thoughtit best to take no notice; and even when he distinctly heard Georgequietly "sah" on his dog as he passed him, he contented himself withgiving Aleck a kick by way of a warning to behave himself, and enteredinto some desultory conversation with Philip. But presently a seriesof growls behind him announced that an encounter was imminent. Lookinground, he perceived that Snarleyow was standing over the bull-dog, ofwhich he was more than twice the size, and holding on to the skin ofhis neck with his long teeth; whilst George was looking on withscarcely suppressed amusement."I think, Mr. Caresfoot, that you had better call your dog off," saidArthur, good-temperedly. "Mine is a peaceable animal, but he is anawkward customer when he does fight.""Oh! better let them settle it; they will be much better friendsafterwards. Hold him, Snarleyow."Thus encouraged, the big dog seized the other, and fairly lifted himoff the ground, shaking him violently--a proceeding that had theeffect of thoroughly rousing Aleck's temper. And then began a mostHomeric combat. At first the bull-dog was dreadfully mauled; hisantagonist's size, weight, and length of leg and jaw, to say nothingof the thick coat by which he was protected, all telling against him.But he took his punishment very quietl never so much as uttering agrowl, in strange contrast to the big dog's vociferous style of doingbusiness. And at last patience was rewarded by his enemy's fore-pawfinding its way into Aleck's powerful jaw, and remaining there tillSnarleyow's attentions to the back of his neck forced him to shift hishold. From that time forward the sheep-dog had to fight on three legs,which he found demoralizing. But still he had the advantage, and itwas not until any other dog of Aleck's size would have retreated halfkilled that the bull-dog's superior courage and stamina began to tell.Quite heedless of his injuries, and the blood that poured into hiseyes, he slowly but surely drove the great sheep-dog, who by this timewould have been glad to stop, back into an angle of the wall, and thensuddenly pinned him by the throat. Down went Snarleyow on the top ofthe bull-dog, and rolled right over him, but when he staggered to hislegs again, his throat was still in its cruel grip."Take your dog off!" shouted George, seeing that affairs had taken aturn he very little expected."I fear that is impossible," replied Arthur, politely, but lookinganything but polite."If you don't get it off, I will shoot it.""You will do nothing of the sort, Mr. Caresfoot; you set the dog on,and you must take the consequences. Ah! the affair is finished."As he spoke, the choking Snarleyow, whose black tongue was protrudingfrom his jaws, gave one last convulsive struggle, and ceased tobreathe. Satisfied with this result, Aleck let go, and having sniffedcontemptuously at his dead antagonist, returned to his master's side,and, sitting quietly down, began to lick such of his numerous woundsas he could reach.George, when he realized that his favourite was dead, turned upon hisguest in a perfect fury. His face looked like a devil's. But Arthur,acting with wonderful self-possession for so young a man, stopped him."Remember, Mr. Caresfoot, before you say anything that you may regret,that neither I nor my dog is to blame for what has happened. I amexceedingly sorry that your dog should have been killed, but it isyour own fault. I am afraid, however, that, after what has happened, Ishall be as unwelcome here as Aleck; so, if you will kindly order thecart for me again, I will move on. Our business can no doubt befinished off by letter."George made no reply: it was evident that he could not trust himselfto speak, but, turning sullenly on his heel, walked towards the house."Wait a bit, Mr. Heigham," said Philip, who had been watching thewhole scene with secret delight. "You are perfectly in the right. Iwill go and try to bring my cousin to his senses. I am very thankfulto your dog for killing that accursed brute."He was away for about ten minutes, during which Arthur took Aleck to afountain there was in the centre of a grass plot in front of thehouse, and washed his many wounds, none of which, however, were,thanks to the looseness of his hide, very serious. Just as he hadfinished that operation, a gardener arrived with a wheelbarrow tofetch away the deceased Snarleyow."Lord, sir," he said to Arthur, "I am glad to have the job of tuckingup this here brute. He bit my missus last week, and killed a wholeclutch of early ducks. I seed the row through the bushes. That 'eredog of yours, sir, he did fight in proper style; I should like to havea dog like he."Just then the re-arrival of Philip put a stop to the conversation.Drawing Arthur aside, he told him that George begged to apologize forwhat had occurred, and hoped that he would not think of going away."But," added Philip, with a little laugh, "I don't pretend that he hastaken a fancy to you, and, if I were you, I should cut my visitshort.""That is exactly my view of the case. I will leave to-morrow evening."Philip made no further remarks for a few moments. He was evidentlythinking. Presently he said,"I see you have a fishing-rod amongst your things; if you find thetime hang heavy on your hands to-morrow, or wish to keep out of theway, you had better come over to Bratham Lake and fish. There are somevery large carp and perch there, and pike too, for the matter of that,but they are out of season."Arthur thanked him, and said that he should probably come, and, havingreceived instructions as to the road, they parted, Arthur to go andshut up Aleck in an outhouse pointed out to him by his friend thegardener, and thence to dress for a dinner that he looked forward towith dread, and Philip to make his way home. As he passed up throughthe little flower-garden at the Abbey House, he came across hisdaughter, picking the blight from her shooting rose-trees."Angela," he said, "I am sorry if I offended your prejudices thisafternoon. Don't let us say anything more about it; but I want you tocome and pay a formal call with me at Isleworth to-morrow. It willonly be civil that you should do so.""I never paid a call in my life," she answered, doubtfully, "and Idon't want to call on my cousin George.""Oh! very well," and he began to move on. She stopped him."I will go, if you like.""At three o'clock, then. Oh! by the way, don't be surprised if you seea young gentleman fishing here to-morrow."Angela reflected to herself that she had never yet seen a younggentleman to speak to in her life, and then asked, with undisguisedinterest, who he was."Well, he is a sort of connection of your own, through the Prestons,who are cousins of ours, if any of them are left. His mother was aPreston, and his name is Arthur Preston Heigham. George told mesomething about him just now, and, on thinking it over, I remember thewhole story. He is an orphan, and George's ward.""What is he like?" asked Angela, ingenuously."Really I don't know; rather tall, I think--a gentlemanly fellow. Itreally is a relief to speak to a gentleman again. There has been anice disturbance at Isleworth," and then he told his daughter thehistory of the great dog fight."I should think Mr. Heigham was perfectly in the right, and I shouldlike to see his dog," was her comment on the occurrence.As Arthur dressed himself for dinner that evening he came to theconclusion that he disliked his host more than any man he ever saw,and, to say the truth, he descended into the dining-room withconsiderable misgivings. Just as he entered, the opposite door opened,and Sir John Bellamy was announced. On seeing him, George emerged fromthe sulky silence into which he was plunged, and advanced to meet him."Hullo, Bellamy! I must congratulate you upon your accession to rank.""Thank you, Caresfoot, thank you," replied Mr. Bellamy, who, with theexception that he had grown a size larger, and boasted a bald patch onthe top of his head that gave him something of a appearance of a jollylittle monk, looked very much the same as when we last saw him as anewly married man."A kind Providence," he went on, rubbing his dry hands, and glancingnervously under the chairs, "has put this honour into my hands.""A Providence in petticoats, you mean," broke in George."Possibly, my dear Caresfoot; but I do not see him. Is it possiblethat he is lurking yonder, behind the sofa?""Who on earth do you mean?""I mean that exceedingly fine dog of yours, Snarleyow. Snarleyow,where are you? Excuse me for taking precautions, but last time he puthis head under my chair and bit me severely, as I dare say youremember."Arthur groaned at hearing the subject thus brought forward."Mr. Heigham's dog killed Snarleyow this afternoon," said George, in asavage voice.At this intelligence, Sir John's face became wreathed in smiles."I am deeply delighted--I mean grieved--to hear it. Poor Snarleyow! hewas a charming dog; and to think that such a fate should haveovertaken him, when it was only last week that he did the same kindoffice for Anne's spaniel. Poor Snarleyow! you should really have himstuffed. But, my dear Caresfoot, you have not yet introduced me to thehero of the evening, Mr. Heigham. Mr. Heigham, I am delighted to makeyour acquaintance," and he shook hands with Arthur with gentleenthusiasm, as though he were the last scion of a race that he hadknown and loved for generations.Presently dinner was announced, and the three sat down at a smallround table in the centre of the big dining-room, on which was placeda shaded lamp. It was not a cheerful dinner. George, having saidgrace, relapsed into moody silence, eating and drinking with gusto butin moderation, and savouring every sup of wine and morsel of food asthough he regretted its departure. He was not free from gluttony, buthe was a judicious glutton. For his part, Arthur found a certainfascination in watching his guardian's red head as he bobbed up anddown opposite to him, and speculating on the thickness of eachindividual hair that contributed to give it such a spiky effect. Whathad his mother been like, he wondered, that she had started him inlife with such an entirely detestable countenance? Meanwhile he wasreplying in monosyllables to Sir John's gentle babblings, till at lasteven that gentleman's flow of conversation ran dry, and Arthur wasleft free to contemplate the head in solemn silence. As soon as thecloth had been cleared away, George suggested that they had better getto work. Arthur assented, and Sir John, smiling with much sweetness,remarked profoundly that business was one of the ills of life, andmust be attended to."At any rate, it is an ill that has agreed uncommonly well with you,"growled George, as, rising from the table, he went to a solid ironsafe that stood in the corner of the room, and, unlocking it with asmall key that he took from his pocket, extracted a bundle ofdocuments."That is an excellent deed-box of yours, Caresfoot," said Sir Johncarelessly."Yes; that lock would not be very easy to pick. It is made on my owndesign.""But don't you find that small parcels such as private letters are aptto get lost in it? It is so big.""Oh! no; there is a separate compartment for them. Now, Mr. Heigham."And then, with the able and benign assistance of Sir John, heproceeded to utterly confuse and mystify Arthur, till stocks,preference-shares, consols, and mortgages were all whirling in hisbewildered brain. Having satisfactorily reduced him to this condition,he suddenly sprang upon him the proposal he had in view with referenceto the Jotley mortgage, pointing out to him that it was an excellentinvestment, and strongly advising him, "as a friend," to leave themoney upon the land. Arthur hesitated a little, more from naturalcaution than anything he could urge to the contrary, and George,noticing it, said,"It is only right that, before you come to any decision, you shouldsee the map of the estate, and a copy of the deed. I have both in thenext room, if you care to come and look at them."Arthur assented, and they went off together; Sir John, whose eyesappeared to be a little heavy under the influence of the port,presuming that he was not wanted. But, no sooner had the door closed,than the worthy knight proved himself very wide-awake. Indeed, hecommenced a singular course of action. Advancing on tiptoe to the safein the corner of the room, he closely inspected it through hiseyeglass. Then he cautiously tried the lid of an artfully contrivedsubdivision."Um!" he muttered, half aloud, "that's where they are; I wish I hadten minutes."Next he returned swiftly to the table, and, taking a piece of the softbread which he was eating instead of biscuit with his wine, he rapidlykneaded it into dough, and, going to the safe, divided the materialinto two portions. One portion he carefully pressed upon the keyholeof the subdivision, and then, extracting the key of the safe itself,took a very fair impress of its wards on the other. This done, hecarefully put the pieces of dough in his breast-pocket in such a waythat they were not likely to be crushed, and, with a smile ofsatisfaction, returned to his chair, helped himself to a glass ofport, and dozed off."Hullo, Bellamy, gone to sleep! Wake up, man. We have settled thisbusiness about the mortgage. Will you write to Mr. Borley, and conveyMr. Heigham's decision? And perhaps"--addressing Arthur--"you will dothe same on your own account.""Certainly I will write, Caresfoot; and now I think that I must beoff. Her ladyship does not like having to sit up for me."George laughed in a peculiarly insulting way."I don't think she would care much, Bellamy, if you stayed away allnight. But look here, tell her I want to see her to-morrow; don'tforget."Sir John bit his knightly lip, but answered, smiling, that he wouldremember, and begging George not to ring, as his trap was at the hall-door, and the servant waiting, he bade an affectionate good-night toArthur, to whom he expressed a hope that they would soon meet again,and let himself out of the room. But, as soon as the door was closed,he went through another performance exceedingly inappropriate in aknight. Turning round, his smug face red with anger, he pirouetted onhis toes, and shook his fist violently in the direction of the door."You scoundrel!" he said between his teeth, "you have made a fool ofme for twenty years, and I have been obliged to grin and bear it; butI will be even with you yet, and her too, more especially her."So soon as Sir John had left, Arthur told his host that, if themorning was fine, he proposed to go and fish in Bratham Lake, and thathe also proposed to take his departure by the last train on thefollowing evening. To these propositions George offered no objection--indeed, they were distinctly agreeable to him, as lessening the timehe would be forced to spend in the society of a guest he cordiallydetested, for such was the feeling that he had conceived towardsArthur.Then they parted for the night; but, before he left the room, Georgewent to lock up the safe that was still open in the corner. Struck bysome thought, he unlocked the separate compartment with a key thathung on his watch-chain, and extracted therefrom a thick and neatlyfolded packet of letters. Drawing out one or two, he glanced throughthem and replaced them."Oh! Lady Anne, Lady Anne," he said to himself as he closed the case,"you are up in the world now, and you aspire to rule the countysociety, and have both the wealth and the wit to do it; but you mustnot kick over the traces, or I shall be forced to suppress you, LadyAnne, though you are the wife of a Brummagem knight, and I think thatit is time you had a little reminder. You are growing a touch tooindependent."                             CHAPTER XIXArthur's sleep was oppressed that night by horrible nightmares offighting dogs, whereof the largest and most ferocious was fitted withGeorge's red head, the effect of which, screwed, without any eye tothe fitness of things, to the body of the deceased Snarleyow, struckhim as peculiarly disagreeable. He himself was armed with a gun, andwhilst he was still arguing with Sir John Bellamy the nice pointwhether, should he execute that particular animal, as he felt a carnallonging to do, it would be manslaughter or dogslaughter, he foundhimself wide awake.It was very early in the morning of the 1st of May, and, contrary tothe usual experience of the inhabitants of these islands, the sky gavepromise of a particularly fine day, just the day for fishing. He didnot feel sleepy, and, had he done so, he had had enough of his doggydreams; so he got up, dressed, and taking his fishing-rod, let himselfout of the house as he had been instructed to do on the previousevening, and, releasing Aleck from his outhouse, proceeded towardsBratham Lake.And about this time Angela woke up too, for she always rose early, andran to the window to see what sort of a day she had got for herbirthday. Seeing it to be so fine, she threw open the old lattice, atwhich her pet raven Jack was already tapping to be admitted, and letthe sweet air play upon her face and neck, and thought what awonderful thing it was to be twenty years old. And then, kneeling bythe window, she said her prayers after her own fashion, thanking Godwho had spared her to see this day, and praying Him to show her whatto do with her life, and, if it was His will, to make it a little lesslonely. Then she rose and dressed herself, feeling that now that shehad done with her teens, she was in every respect a woman grown--indeed, quite old. And, in honour of the event, she chose out of herscanty store of dresses, all of them made by Pigott and herself, hervery prettiest, the one she had had for Sunday wear last summer, atight-fitting robe of white stuff, with soft little frills round theneck and wrists. Next she put on a pair of stout boots calculated tokeep out the morning dew, and started off.Now all this had taken a good time, nearly an hour perhaps; for, beingher birthday, and there having been some mention of a young gentlemanwho might possibly come to fish, she had plaited up her shining hairwith extra care, a very laborious business when your hair hangs downto your knees.Meanwhile our other early riser, Arthur, had made his way first to thefoot of the lake and then along the little path that skirted its areatill he came to Caresfoot Staff. Having sufficiently admired thatmajestic oak, for he was a great lover of timber, he proceeded toinvestigate the surrounding water with the eye of a true fisherman. Afew yards further up there jutted into the water that fragment of wallon which stood the post, now quite rotten, to which Angela had boundherself on the day of the great storm. At his feet, too, thefoundations of another wall ran out for some distance into the lake,being, doubtless, the underpinning of an ancient boathouse, but thisdid not rise out of the water, but stopped within six inches of thesurface. Between these two walls lay a very deep pool."Just the place for a heavy fish," reflected Arthur, and, even as hethought it, he saw a five-pound carp rise nearly to the surface, inorder to clear the obstruction of the wall, and sink silently into thedepths.Retiring carefully to one of two quaintly carven stone blocks placedat the foot of the oak-tree, on which, doubtless, many a monk had satin meditation, he set himself to get his fishing-gear together.Presently, however, struck by the beauty of the spot and its quiet,only broken by the songs of many nesting birds, he stopped a while tolook around him. Above his head the branches of a great oak, nowclothing themselves with the most vivid green, formed a dome-likeroof, beneath the shade of which grew the softest moss, starred hereand there with primroses and violets. Outside the circle of its shadowthe brushwood of mingled hazel and ash-stubs rose thick and high,ringing-in the little spot as with a wall, except where its depthswere pierced by the passage of a long green lane of limes that, unlikethe shrubberies, appeared to be kept in careful order, and of whichthe arching boughs formed a perfect leafy tunnel. Before him lay thelake where the long morning lights quivered and danced, as its calmwas now and again ruffled by a gentle breeze. The whole scene had alovely and peaceful look, and, gazing on it, Arthur fell into areverie.Sitting thus dreamily, his face looked at its best, its expression ofgentle thoughtfulness giving it an attraction beyond what it wasentitled to, judged purely from a sculptor's point of view. It was anintellectual face, a face that gave signs of great mentalpossibilities, but for all that a little weak about the mouth. Thebrow indicated some degree of power, and the mouth and eyes no smallcapacities for affection and all sorts of human sympathy and kindness.These last, in varying lights, could change as often as the Englishclimate; their groundwork, however, was blue, and they were honest andbonny. In short, a man in looking at Arthur Heigham at the age oftwenty-four would have reflected that, even among English gentlemen,he was remarkable for his gentleman-like appearance, and a "fellow onewould like to know;" a girl would have dubbed him "nice-looking;" anda middle-aged woman--and most women do not really understand theimmense difference between men until they are getting on that way--would have recognized in him a young man by no means uninteresting,and one who might, according to the circumstances of his life, developinto anything or--nothing in particular.Presently, drawn by some unguessed attraction, Arthur took his eyesoff an industrious water-hen, who was building a nest in a hurriedway, as though she were not quite sure of his intentions, andperceived a large raven standing on one leg on the grass, about threeyards from him, and peering at him comically out of one eye. This wasodd. But his glance did not stop at the raven, for a yard or twobeyond it he caught sight of a white skirt, and his eyes, travellingupwards, saw first a rounded waist, and then a bust and pair ofshoulders such as few women can boast, and at last, another pair ofeyes; and he then and there fell utterly and irretrievably in love."Good heavens!" he said, aloud--poor fellow, he did not mean to sayit, it was wrung from the depths of his heart--"good heavens, howlovely she is!"Let the reader imagine the dreadful confusion produced in that otherpair of eyes at the open expression of such a sentiment, and the vividblush that stained the fair face in which they were set, if he can.But somehow they did not grow angry--perhaps it was not in the natureof the most sternly repressive young lady to grow angry at acompliment which, however marked, was so evidently genuine andunpremeditated. In another moment Arthur bethought him of what he hadsaid, and it was his turn to blush. He recovered himself pretty well,however. Rising from his stone seat, he took off his hat, and said,humbly,"I beg your pardon, but you startled me so, and really for a moment Ithought that you were the spirit of the place, or," he added,gracefully, pointing to a branch of half-opened hawthorn bloom sheheld in her hand, "the original Queen of the May."Angela blushed again. The compliment was only implied this time; shehad therefore no possible pretext for getting angry.For a moment she dropped the sweet eyes that looked as though theywere fresh from reading the truths of heaven before his gaze ofunmistakable admiration, and stood confused; and, as she stood, itstruck Arthur that there was something more than mere beauty of formand feature about her--an indescribable something, a glory ofinnocence, a reflection of God's own light that tinged the worship herloveliness commanded with a touch of reverential awe."The angels must look like that," he thought. But he had no time tothink any more, for next moment she had gathered up her courage inboth her hands, and was speaking to him in a soft voice, of which thetones went ringing on through all the changes of his life."My father told me that he had asked you to come and fish, but I didnot expect to meet you so early. I--I fear that I am disturbing you,"and she made as though she would be going.Arthur felt that this was a contingency to be prevented at allhazards."You are Miss Caresfoot," he said, hurriedly, "are you not?""Yes--I am Angela; I need not ask your name, my father told it me. Youare Mr. Arthur Heigham.""Yes. And do you know that we are cousins?" This was a slightexaggeration, but he was glad to advance any plea to her confidencethat occurred to him."Yes; my father said something about our being related. I have norelations except my cousin George, and I am very glad to make theacquaintance of one," and she held out her hand to him in a winningway.He took it almost reverently."You cannot," he said with much sincerity, "be more glad than I am. I,too, am without relations. Till lately I had my mother, but she diedlast year.""Were you very fond of her?" she asked, softly.He nodded in reply, and, feeling instinctively that she was ondelicate ground, Angela pursued the conversation no further.Meanwhile Aleck had awoke from a comfortable sleep in which he wasindulging on the other stone seat, and, coming forward, sniffed atAngela and wagged his tail in approval--a liberty that was instantlyresented by the big raven, who had now been joined by another notquite so large. Advancing boldly, it pecked him sharply on the tail--aproceeding that caused Master Aleck to jump round as quickly as hismaimed condition would allow him, only to receive a still harder peckfrom its companion bird; indeed, it was not until Angela intervenedwith the bough of hawthorn that they would cease from their attack."They are such jealous creatures," she explained; "they always followme about, and fly at every dog that comes near me. Poor dog! that isthe one, I suppose, who killed Snarleyow. My father told me all aboutit.""Yes, it is easy to see that," said Arthur, laughing, and pointing toAleck, who, indeed, was in lamentable case, having one eye entirelyclosed, a large strip of plaster on his head, and all the rest of hisbody more or less marked with bites. "It is an uncommonly awkwardbusiness for me, and your cousin will not forgive it in a hurry, Ifancy; but it really was not poor Aleck's fault--he is gentle as alamb, if only he is let alone.""He has a very honest face, though his nose does look as though itwere broken," she said, and, stooping down, she patted the dog."But I must be going in to breakfast," she went on, presently. "It iseight o'clock; the sun always strikes that bough at eight in spring,"and she pointed to a dead limb, half hidden by the budding foliage ofthe oak."You must observe closely to have noticed that, but I do not thinkthat the sun is quite on it yet. I do not like to lose my new-foundrelations in such a hurry," he added, with a somewhat forced smile,"and I am to go away from here this evening."The intelligence was evidently very little satisfactory to Angela, nordid she attempt to conceal her concern."I am very sorry to hear that," she said. "I hoped you were going tostay for some time.""And so I might have, had it not been for that brute Aleck, but he hasput a long sojourn with your cousin and the ghost of Snarleyow out ofthe question; so I suppose I must go by the 6.20 train. At any rate,"he added, more brightly, as a thought struck him, "I must go fromIsleworth."She did not appear to see the drift of the last part of his remark,but answered,"I am going with my father to call at Isleworth at three thisafternoon, so perhaps we shall meet again there; but now, before I goin, I will show you a better place than this to fish, a little higherup, where Jakes, our gardener, always sets his night-lines."Arthur assented, as he would have been glad to assent to anythinglikely to prolong the interview, and they walked off slowly together,talking as cheerfully as a sense that the conversation must soon cometo an end would allow. The spot was reached all too soon, and Angelawith evident reluctance, for she was not accustomed to conceal herfeelings, said that she must now go."Why must you go so soon?""Well, to tell you the truth, to-day is my birthday--I am twentyto-day--and I know that Pigott, my old nurse, means to give me alittle present at breakfast, and she will be dreadfully disappointedif I am late. She has been thinking a great deal about it, you see.""May I wish you many, very many, happy returns of the day? and"--witha little hesitation--"may I also offer you a present, a very worthlessone I fear?""How can I----" stammered Angela, when he cut her short."Don't be afraid; it is nothing tangible, though it is something thatyou may not think worth accepting.""What do you mean?" she said bluntly, for her interest was aroused."Don't be angry. My present is only the offer of myself as yoursincere friend."She blushed vividly as she answered,"You are very kind. I have never had but one friend--Mr. Fraser; but,if you think you can like me enough, it will make me very happy to beyour friend too." And in another second she was gone, with her ravensflying after her, to receive her present and a jobation from Pigottfor being late, and to eat her breakfast with such appetite as anentirely new set of sensations can give.In the garden she met her father, walking up and down before thehouse, and informed him that she had been talking to Mr. Heigham. Helooked up with a curious expression of interest."Why did you not ask him in to breakfast?" he said."Because there is nothing to eat except bread and milk.""Ah!--well, perhaps you were right. I will go down and speak to him.No; I forgot I shall see him this afternoon."And Arthur, let those who disbelieve in love at first sight laugh ifthey will, sat down to think, trembling in every limb, utterly shakenby the inrush of a new and strong emotion. He had not come to the ageof twenty-four without some experience of the other sex, but neverbefore had he known any such sensation as that which now overpoweredhim, never before had he fully realized what solitude meant as he didnow that she had left him. In youth, when love does come, he comes asa strong man armed.And so, steady and overwhelming all resistance, the full tide of apure passion poured itself into his heart. There was no pretence ormake-believe about it; the bold that sped from Angela's grey eyes hadgone straight home, and would remain an "ever-fixed mark," so long aslife itself should last.For only once in a lifetime does a man succumb after this fashion. Tomany, indeed, no such fortune--call it good or ill--will ever come,since the majority of men flirt or marry, indulge in "platonicfriendships," or in a consistent course of admiration of theirneighbours' wives, as fate or fancy leads them, and wear their timeaway without ever having known the meaning of such love as this. Thereis no fixed rule about it; the most unlikely, even the more sordid andcontemptible of mankind, are liable to become the subjects of anenduring passion; only then it raises them; for though strongaffection, especially, if unrequited, sometimes wears and enervatesthe mind, its influence is, in the main, undoubtedly ennobling. But,though such affection is bounded by no rule, it is curious to observehow generally true are the old sayings which declare that a man'sthoughts return to his first real love, as naturally and unconsciouslyas the needle, that has for a while been drawn aside by someovermastering influence, returns to its magnetic pole. The needle haswavered, but it has never shaken off its allegiance; that would beagainst nature, and is therefore impossible; and so it is with theheart. It is the eves that he loved as a lad which he sees through thegathering darkness of his death-bed; it is a chance but that he willalways adore the star which first came to share his loneliness in thisshadowed world above all the shining multitudes in heaven.And, though it is not every watcher who will find it, early or late,that star may rise for him, as it did for Arthur now. A man may meet aface which it is quite beyond his power to forget, and be touched oflips that print their kiss upon his very heart. Yes, the star mayrise, to pursue its course, perhaps beyond the ken of his horizon, oronly to set again before he has learnt to understand its beauty--rarely, very rarely, to shed its perfect light upon him for all histime of watching. The star may rise and set; the sweet lips whosetouch still thrills him after so many years may lie to-day                "Beyond the graveyard's barren wall,"or, worse still, have since been sold to some richer owner. But ifonce it has risen, if once those lips have met, the memory _must_remain; the Soul knows no forgetfulness, and, the little thread oflife spun out, will it not claim its own? For the compact that it hassealed is holy among holy things; that love which it has given is ofits own nature, and not of the body alone--it is inscrutable as death,and everlasting as the heavens.Yes, the fiat has gone forth; for good or for evil, for comfort or forscorn, for the world and for eternity, he loves her! Henceforth thatlove, so lightly and yet so irredeemably given, will become theguiding spirit of his inner life, rough-hewing his destinies,directing his ends, and shooting its memories and hopes through thewhole fabric of his being like an interwoven thread of gold. He maysin against it, but he can never forget it; other interests and tiesmay overlay it, but they cannot extinguish it; he may drown itsfragrance in voluptuous scents, but, when these have satiated andbecome hateful, it will re-arise, pure and sweet as ever. Time orseparation cannot destroy it--for it is immortal; use cannot stale it,pain can only sanctify it. It will be to him as a beacon-light to thesea-worn mariner that tells of home and peace upon the shore, as arainbow-promise set upon the sky. It alone of all things pertaining tohim will defy the attacks of the consuming years, and when, old andwithered, he lays him down to die, it will at last present itselfbefore his glazing eyes, an embodied joy, clad in shining robes, andbreathing the airs of Paradise!For such is love to those to whom it has been given to see him face toface.                              CHAPTER XXArthur did not do much fishing that morning; indeed, he never so muchas got his line into the water--he simply sat there lost in dreams,and hoping in a vague way that Angela would come back again. But shedid not come back, though it would be difficult to say what preventedher; for, had he but known it, she was for the space of a full hoursitting within a hundred yards of him, and occasionally peeping out towatch his mode of fishing with some curiosity. It was, she reflected,exceedingly unlike that practised by Jakes. She, too, was wishing thathe would detect her, and come to talk to her; but, amongst other newsensations, she was now the victim of a most unaccountable shyness,and could not make up her mind to reveal her whereabouts.At last Arthur awoke from his long reverie, and remembered with asudden pang that he had had nothing to eat since the previous evening,and that he was consequently exceedingly hungry. He also discovered,on consulting his watch, that it was twelve o'clock, and, moreover,that he was quite stiff from sitting so long in the same position. So,sighing to think that such a vulgar necessity as that of obtainingfood should force him to depart, he put up his unused fishing-rod andstarted for Isleworth, where he arrived just as the bell was ringingfor lunch.George received him with cold civility, and asked him what sport hehad, to which he was forced to reply--none."Did you see anybody there?""Yes, I met Miss Caresfoot.""Ah! trust a girl to trail out a man. What is she like? I remember hera raw-boned girl of fourteen with fine eyes.""I think that she is the handsomest woman I ever saw," Arthur replied,coldly."Ah!" said George, with a rude little laugh, "youth is alwaysenthusiastic, especially when the object is of the dairymaid cut."There was something so intensely insolent in his host's way of talkingthat Arthur longed to throw a dish at him, but he restrained hisfeelings, and dropped the subject."Let me see, you are only just home from India, are you?" askedGeorge, presently."I got back at the beginning of last month.""And what were you doing there?""Travelling about and shooting.""Did you get much sport?""No, I was rather unfortunate, but I and another fellow killed twotigers, and went after a rogue elephant; but he nearly killed us. Igot some very good ibix-shooting in Cashmere, however.""What do you intend to do with yourself now? Your education has beenextravagantly expensive, especially the Cambridge part of it. Are yougoing to turn it to any account?""Yes. I am going to travel for another year, and then read for theBar. There is no particular object in being called too young, and Iwish to see something more of the world first.""Ah! I see, idleness called by a fine name.""Really I cannot agree with you," said Arthur, who was rapidly losinghis temper."Of course you can't, but every man has a right to choose his own roadto the dogs. Come," he added, with a smile of malice, as he noticedArthur's rising colour, "no need to get angry; you see I stand _inloco parentis_, and feel bound to express my opinion.""I must congratulate you on the success with which you assume thecharacter," answered Arthur, now thoroughly put-out; "but, aseverything I have done or mean to do is so distasteful to you, I thinkit is a pity that you did not give me the benefit of your advice alittle sooner."George's only answer was a laugh, and presently the two parted,detesting each other more cordially than ever.At half-past three, when George was still away, for he had gone outwith his bailiff immediately after lunch, Philip and his daughter wereshown into the drawing-room, where we may be sure Arthur was awaitingthem."Mr. Caresfoot is not back yet," said Arthur, "but I do not supposethat he will be long.""Oh! he will be here soon," said Philip, "because I told him we werecoming to call. What sort of sport did you have? What, none! I am verysorry. You must come and try again--ah! I forgot you are going away.by the way, Mr. Heigham, why should you go just yet? If you are fondof fishing, and have nothing better to do, come and put up at theAbbey House for a while; we are plain people, but there is plenty ofroom, and you shall have a hearty welcome. Would you care to come?"It would have been amusing to any outsider to watch Angela's face asshe heard this astounding proposition, for nobody had been invitedinside her father's doors within her recollection. It assumed first ofall a look of blank amazement, which was presently changed into one ofabsolute horror."Would he come, indeed?" reflected Arthur. "Would he step intoParadise? would he accept the humble offer of free quarters in theGarden of Eden?" Rapture beamed so visibly from every feature of hisface that Philip saw it and smiled. Just as he was about to acceptwith enthusiasm, he caught sight of Angela's look of distress. Itchilled him like the sudden shock of cold water; she did not wish himto come, he thought, she did not care for him. Obliged, however, togive an answer, he said,"I shall be delighted if"--and here he bowed towards her--"MissCaresfoot does not object.""If father," broke in Angela, with hesitation, "you could arrange thatMr. Heigham came to-morrow, not to-day, it would be more convenient. Imust get a room ready.""Ah! domestic details; I had overlooked them. I daresay you can managethat--eh, Heigham?""Oh! yes, easily, thank you."As he said the words, the door was flung open, and "Lady Bellamy" wasannounced with the energy that a footman always devotes to theenunciation of a title, and next second a splendid creature,magnificently dressed, sailed into the room."Ah! how do you do, Mr. Caresfoot?" she said, in that low, rich voicethat he remembered so well. "It is some time since we met; indeed, itquite brings back old times to see you, when we were all young peopletogether.""At any rate, Lady Bellamy, you show no signs of age; indeed, if youwill permit me to say so, you look more beautiful than ever.""Ah! Mr. Caresfoot, you have not forgotten how to be gallant, but letme tell you that it entirely depends upon what light I am in. If yousaw me in the midst of one of those newfangled electric illuminations,you would see that I do look old; but what can one expect at forty?"Here her glance fell upon Angela's face for the first time, and sheabsolutely started; the great pupils of her eyes expanded, and a darkfrown spread itself for a moment over her countenance. Next second itwas gone. "Is it possible that that beautiful girl is your daughter?But, remembering her mother, I need not ask. Look at her, Mr.Caresfoot, and then look at me, and say whether or not I look old. Andwho is the young man? Her lover, I suppose--at any rate, he looks likeit; but please introduce me.""Angela," said Philip, crossing to the window where they were talking,"let me introduce you to Lady Bellamy. Mr. Heigham--Lady Bellamy.""I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Miss Caresfoot, though Ithink it is very generous of me to say so."Angela looked puzzled."Indeed!" she said."What! do you not guess why it is generous? Then look at yourself inthe glass, and you will see. I used to have some pretension to goodlooks, but I could never have stood beside you at the best of times,and now---- Your mother, even when I was at my best, always _killed_me if I was in the same room with her, and you are even handsomer thanyour mother."Angela blushed very much at this unqualified praise, and, putting itand the exclamation her appearance had that morning wrung from Arthurtogether, she suddenly came to the conclusion--for, odd as it mayseem, she had never before taken the matter into serious consideration--that she must be very good-looking, a conclusion that made her feelextremely happy, she could not quite tell why.It was whilst she was thus blushing and looking her happiest andloveliest that George, returning from his walk, chanced to look in atthe window and see her, and, gradually drawn by the attraction of herbeauty, his eyes fixed themselves intently upon her, and his coarsefeatures grew instinct with a mixture of hungry wickedness anddelighted astonishment. It was thus that Arthur and Lady Bellamy sawhim. Philip, who was looking at a picture in the corner of the room,did not see him; nor, indeed, did Angela. The look was unmistakable,and once more the dark frown settled upon Lady Bellamy's brow, and theexpanding pupils filled the heavy-lidded eyes. As for Arthur, it madehim feel sick with unreasonable alarm.Next minute George entered the room with a stupid smile upon his face,and looking as dazed as a bat that has suddenly been shown the sun.Angela's heaven-lit beauty had come upon his gross mind as arevelation; it fascinated him, he had lost his command over himself."Oh! here you are at last, George," said Lady Bellamy--it was alwaysher habit to call him George. "We have all been like sheep without ashepherd, though I saw you keeping an eye on the flock through thewindow."George started. He did not know that he had been observed."I did not know that you were all here, or I would have been backsooner," he said, and then began to shake hands.When he came to Angela, he favoured her with a tender pressure of thefingers and an elaborate and high-flown speech of welcome, both ofwhich were inexpressibly disagreeable to her. But here Lady Bellamyintervened, and skilfully forced him into a conversation with her, inwhich Philip joined."What does Lady Bellamy remind you of?" Angela asked Arthur, as soonas the hum of talk made it improbable that they would be overheard."Of an Egyptian sorceress, I think. Look at the low, broad forehead,the curling hair, the full lips, and the inscrutable look of theface.""To my mind she is an ideal of the Spirit of Power. I am very muchafraid of her, and, as for him"--nodding towards George--"I dislikehim even more than I was prepared to," and she gave a little shudder."By the way, Mr. Heigham, you really must not be so rash as to acceptmy father's invitation.""If you do not wish to see me, of course I will not," he answered, ina hurt and disappointed tone."Oh! it is not that, indeed; how could you think so, when only thismorning we agreed to be friends?""Well, what is it, then?" he asked, blankly."Why, Mr. Heigham, the fact is that we--that is, my old nurse and I,for my father is irregular in his meals, and always takes them byhimself--live so very plainly, and I am ashamed to ask you to shareour mode of life. For instance, we have nothing but bread and milk forbreakfast;" and the golden head sunk in some confusion before hisamused gaze."Oh! is that all?" he said, cheerily. "I am very fond of bread andmilk.""And then," went on Angela with her confession, "we never drink wine,and I know that gentlemen do.""I am a teetotaller, so that does not matter.""Really?""Yes--really.""But then, you know, my father shuts himself up all day, so that youwill have nobody but myself to talk to.""Oh! never mind"--encouragingly. "I am sure that we shall get on.""Well, if, in spite of all this and a great deal more--ah! a verygreat deal that I have not time to tell you--you still care to come, Iwill do my best to amuse you. At any rate, we can read together; thatwill be something, if you don't find me too stupid. You must rememberthat I have only had a private education, and have never been tocollege like you. I shall be glad of the opportunity of rubbing up myclassics a little; I have been neglecting them rather lately, andactually got into a mess over a passage in Aristophanes that I shallask you to clear up."This was enough for Arthur, whose knowledge of the classics was thatof the ordinary University graduate; he turned the subject withremarkable promptitude."Tell me," he said, looking her straight in the face, "are you gladthat I am coming?"The grey eyes dropped a little before the boldness of his gaze, butshe answered, unhesitatingly,"Yes, for my own sake I am glad; but I fear that you will find it verydull.""Come, Angela, we must be off; I want to be home by a quarter to six,"said Philip just then.She rose at once and shook hands with Arthur, murmuring, "Good-by tillto-morrow morning," and then with Lady Bellamy.George, meanwhile, with the most unwonted hospitality, was pressingher father to stay to dinner, and, when he declined, announcing hisintention of coming over to see him on the morrow. At last he gotaway, but not before Lady Bellamy had bid him a seemingly cordialadieu."You and your charming daughter must come and see me at Rewtham House,when we get in. What, have you not heard that Sir John has bought itfrom poor Maria Lee's executors?"Philip turned pale as death, and hurried from the room."It is good," reflected Lady Bellamy, as she watched the effect of hershaft, "to let him know that I never forget."But, even when her father had gone, the path was still blocked toAngela."What!" said George, who was, when in an amiable mood, that worst ofall cads, a jocose cad, "are you going to play truant, too, my prettycousin? Then first you must pay the penalty, not a very heavy one,however." And he threw his long arm round her waist, and prepared togive her a cousinly embrace.At first Angela, not being accustomed to little jokes of the sort, didnot understand what his intentions were, but as soon as she did, beingan extremely powerful young woman, she soon put a stop to them,shaking George away from her so sharply by a little swing of her lithebody, that, stumbling over a footstool in his rapid backward passage,he in a trice measured his length upon the floor. Seeing what she haddone, Angela turned and fled after her father.As for Arthur, the scene was too much for his risible nerves, and hefairly roared with laughter, whilst even Lady Bellamy went as near toit as she ever did.George rose white with wrath."Mr. Heigham," he said, "I see nothing to laugh at in an accident.""Don't you?" replied Arthur. "I do; it is just the most ludicrousaccident that I ever saw."George turned away muttering something that it was perhaps as well hisguest did not hear, and at once began to attack Lady Bellamy."My dear George," was her rejoinder, "let this little adventure teachyou that it is not wise for middle-aged men to indulge in gallantriestowards young ladies, and especially young ladies of thews and sinews.Good-night."At the same moment the footman announced that the dog-cart whichArthur had ordered was waiting for him."Good-by, Mr. Heigham, good-by," said George, with angry sarcasm."Within twenty-four hours you have killed my favourite dog, takenoffence at my well-meant advice, and ridiculed my misfortune. If weshould ever meet again, doubtless you will have further surprises instore for me;" and, without giving Arthur time to make any reply, heleft the room.                             CHAPTER XXIEarly on the day following Arthur's departure from Isleworth, LadyBellamy received a note from George requesting her, if convenient, tocome and see him that morning, as he had something rather important totalk to her about."John," she said to her husband at breakfast, "do you want thebrougham this morning?""No. Why?""Because I am going over to Isleworth.""Hadn't you better take the luggage-cart too, and your luggage in it,and live there altogether? It would save trouble, sending backwardsand forwards," suggested her husband, with severe sarcasm.Lady Bellamy cut the top off an egg with a single clean stroke--allher movements were decisive--before she answered."I thought," she said, "that we had done with that sort of nonsensesome years ago; are you going to begin it again?""Yes, Lady Bellamy, I am. I am not going to stand being bullied andjeered at by that damned scoundrel Caresfoot any more. I am not goingto stand your eternal visits to him.""You have stood them for twenty years; rather late in the day toobject now, isn't it?" she remarked, coolly, beginning her egg."It is never too late to mend; it is not too late for you to stopquietly at home and do your duty by your husband.""Most men would think that I had done my duty by him pretty well.Twenty years ago you were nobody, and had, comparatively speaking,nothing. Now you have a title and between three and four thousand ayear. Who have you to thank for that? Certainly not yourself.""Curse the title and the money! I had rather be a poor devil of anattorney with a large family, and five hundred a year to keep them on,than live the life I do between you and that vulgar beast Caresfoot.It's a dog's life, not a man's;" and poor Bellamy was so overcome athis real or imaginary wrongs that the tears actually rolled down hispuffy little face.His wife surveyed him with some amusement."I think," she said, "that you are a miserable creature.""Perhaps I am, Anne; but I tell you what it is, even a miserablecreature can be driven too far. It may perhaps be worth your while tobe a little careful."She cast one swift look at him, a look not without apprehension in it,for there was a ring about his voice that she did not like, but hisappearance was so ludicrously wretched that it reassured her. Shefinished her egg, and then, slowly driving the spoon through theshell, she said,"Don't threaten, John; it is a bad habit, and shows an un-Christianstate of mind; besides, it might force me to cr-r-rush you, in self-defence, you know;" and John and the egg-shell having finallycollapsed together, Lady Bellamy ordered the brougham.Having thus sufficiently scourged her husband, she departed in duecourse to visit her own taskmaster, little guessing what awaited herat his hands. After all, there is a deal of poetic justice in theworld. Little Smith, fresh from his mother's apron-strings, issavagely beaten by the cock of the school, Jones, and to him Jones isan all-powerful, cruel devil, placed above all possibility ofretribution. If, however, little Smith could see the omnipotent Jonesbeing mentally ploughed and harrowed by his papa the clergyman, incelebration of the double event of his having missed a scholarship andtaken too much sherry, it is probable that his wounded feelings wouldbe greatly soothed. Nor does it stop there. Robinson, the squire ofthe parish, takes it out of the Reverend Jones, and speaks ill of himto the bishop, a Low Churchman, on the matter of vestments, and veryshortly afterwards Sir Buster Brown, the Chairman of the QuarterSessions, expresses his opinion pretty freely of Robinson in hismagisterial capacity, only in his turn to receive a most unexampledwigging from Her Majesty's judge, Baron Muddlebone, for not showinghim that respect he was accustomed to receive from the High Sheriff ofthe county. And even over the august person of the judge himself therehangs the fear of the only thing that he cannot commit for contempt,public opinion. Justice! why, the world is full of it, only it ismostly built upon a foundation of wrong.Lady Bellamy found George sitting in the dining-room beside the safethat had so greatly interested her husband. It was open, and he wasreading a selection from the bundle of letters which the reader mayremember having seen in his hands before."How do, Anne?" he said, without rising. "You look very handsome thismorning. I never saw a woman wear better."She vouchsafed no reply to his greeting, but turned as pale as death."What!" she said, huskily, pointing with her finger to the letters inhis hand, "what are you doing with those letters?""Bravo, Anne; quite tragic. What a Lady Macbeth you would make! Comequote, 'All the perfumes of Araby will not sweeten this little hand.Oh, oh, oh!' Go on.""What are you doing with those letters?""Have you never broken a dog by showing him the whip, Anne? I have gotsomething to ask of you, and I wish to get you into a generous frameof mind first. Listen now, I am going to read you a few extracts froma past that is so vividly recorded here."She sank into a chair, hid her face in her hands, and groaned. George,whose own features betrayed a certain nervousness, took a yellow sheetof paper, and began to read."'Do you know how old I am to-day? Nineteen, and I have been married ayear and a half. Ah! what a happy lass I was before I married; howthey worshipped me in my old home! "Queen Anne," they always calledme. Well, they are dead now, and pray God they sleep so sound thatthey can neither hear nor see. Yes, a year and a half--a year ofhappiness, half a year of hell; happiness whilst I did not know you,hell since I saw your face. What secret spring of wickedness did youtouch in my heart? I never had a thought of wrong before you came. Butwhen I first set eyes upon your face, I felt some strange change comeover me: I recognized my evil destiny. How you discovered myfascination, how you led me on to evil, you best know. I am no coward,I do not wish to excuse myself, but sometimes I think that you havemuch to answer for, George. Hark, I hear my baby crying, my beautifulboy with his father's eyes. Do you know, I believe that the child hasgrown afraid of me: it beats at me with its tiny hands. I think thatmy very dog dislikes me now. They know me as I am; Nature tells them;everybody knows me except _him_. He will come in presently fromvisiting his sick and poor, and kiss me and call me his sweet wife,and I shall act the living lie. Oh! God, I cannot bear it muchlonger----'"There is more of the same sort," remarked George, coolly. "It affordsa most interesting study of mental anatomy, but I have no time to readmore of it. We will pass on to another."Lady Bellamy did not move; she sat trembling a little, her face buriedin her hands.He took up a second letter and began to read a marked passage."'The die is cast, I will come; I can no longer resist your influence;it grows stronger every day, and now it makes me a murderess, for theshock will kill him. And yet I am tired of the sameness and smallnessof my life; my mind is too big to be cramped in such narrow fetters.'"That extract is really very funny," said George, critically. "Butdon't look depressed, Anne, I am only going to trouble you with onemore dated a year or so later. Listen."'I have several times seen the man you sent me; he is a fool andcontemptible in appearance, and, worst of all, shows signs of fallingin love with me; but, if you wish it, I will go through the marriageceremony with him, poor little dupe! You will not marry me yourself,and I would do more than that to keep near you; indeed, I have nochoice, I _must_ keep near you. I went to the Zoological Gardens theother day and saw a rattlesnake fed upon a live rabbit; the poor thinghad ample room to run away in, but could not, it was fascinated, andsat still and screamed. At last the snake struck it, and I thoughtthat its eyes looked like yours. I am as helpless as that poor animal,and you are much more cruel than the snake. And yet my mind isinfinitely stronger than your own in every way. I cannot understandit. What is the source of your power over me? But I am quite recklessnow, so what does it matter? I will do anything that does not put mewithin reach of the law. You know that my husband is dead. I _knew_that he would die; he expired with my name upon his lips. The child,too, I hear, died in a fit of croup; the nurse had gone out, and therewas no one to look after it. Upon my word, I may well be reckless, forthere is no forgiveness for such as you and I. As for little B----, asI think I told you, I will lead him on and marry him: at any rate, Iwill make his fortune for him: I _must_ devote myself to something,and ambition is more absorbing than anything else--at least, I shallrise to something great. Good-night; I don't know which aches most, myhead or my heart.'"Now that extract would be interesting reading to Bellamy, would itnot?"Here she suddenly sprang forward and snatched at the letter. ButGeorge was too quick for her; he flung it into the safe by his side,and swung the heavy lid to."No, no, my dear Anne, that property is too valuable to be parted withexcept for a consideration."Her attempt frustrated, she dropped back into her chair."What are you torturing me for?" she asked, hoarsely. "Have you anyobject in dragging up the ghost of that dead past, or is it merely foramusement.""Did I not tell you that I had a favour to ask of you, and wished toget you into a proper frame of mind first?""A favour. You mean that you have some wickedness in hand that you aretoo great a coward to execute yourself. Out with it; I know you toowell to be shocked.""Oh, very well. You saw Angela Caresfoot, Philip's daughter, hereyesterday.""Yes, I saw her.""Very good. I mean to marry her, and you must manage it for me."Lady Bellamy sat quite still, and made no answer."You will now," continued George, relieved to find that he had notprovoked the outburst he had expected, "understand why I read youthose extracts. I am thoroughly determined upon marrying that girl atwhatever cost, and I see very clearly that I shall not be able to doso without your help. With your help, the matter will be easy; for noobstacle, except the death of the girl herself, can prevail againstyour iron determination and unbounded fertility of resource.""And if I refuse?""I must have read those extracts to very little purpose for you totalk about refusing. If you refuse, the pangs of conscience willovercome me, and I shall feel obliged to place these letters, and moreespecially those referring to himself, in the hands of your husband.Of course it will, for my own sake, be unpleasant to me to have to doso, but I can easily travel for a year or two till the talk has blownover. For you it will be different. Bellamy has no cause to love younow; judge what he will feel when he knows all the truth. He willscarcely keep the story to himself, and, even were he to do so, itcould easily be set about in other ways, and, in either case, you willbe a ruined woman, and all that you have toiled and schemed for fortwenty years will be snatched from you in an instant. If, on the otherhand, you do not refuse, and I cannot believe that you will, I will onmy wedding-day burn these uncomfortable records before your eyes, or,if you prefer it, you shall burn them yourself.""You have only seen this girl once; is it possible that you are inearnest in wishing to marry her?""Do you think that I should go through this scene by way of a joke? Inever was so much in earnest in my life before. I am in love with her,I tell you, as much in love as though I had known her for years. Whathappened to you with reference to me has happened to me with referenceto her, or something very like it, and marry her I must and will."Lady Bellamy, as she heard these words, rose from her chair and flungherself on the ground before him, clasping his knees with her hands."Oh, George, George!" she cried, in a broken voice, "have some littlepity; do not force me to do this unnatural thing. Is your heart astone, or are you altogether a devil, that by such cruel threats youcan drive me into becoming the instrument of my own shame? I know whatI am, none better: but for whose sake did I become so? Surely, George,I have some claim on your compassion, if I have none on your love.Think again, George; and, if you will not give her up, choose someother means to compass this poor girl's ruin.""Get up, Anne, and don't talk sentimental rubbish. Not but what," headded, with a sneer, "it is rather amusing to hear you pitying yoursuccessful rival."She sprang to her feet, all the softness and entreaty gone from herface, which was instead now spread with her darkest and mostvindictive look."_I_ pity her!" she said. "I hate her. Look you, if I have to do this,my only consolation will be in knowing that what I do will drag mysuccessor down below my own level. I suffer; she shall suffer more; Iknow you a fiend, she shall find a whole hell with you; she is purerand better than I have ever been; soon you shall make her worse than Ihave dreamt of being. Her purity shall be dishonoured, her lovebetrayed, her life reduced to such chaos that she shall cease tobelieve even in her God, and in return for these things I will giveher--_you_. Your new plaything shall pass through my mill, GeorgeCaresfoot, before ever she comes to yours; and on her I will repaywith interest all that I have suffered at your hands;" and, exhaustedwith the fierceness of her own invective and the violence ofconflicting passions, she sank back into her chair."Bravo, Anne! quite in your old style. I daresay that the young ladywill require a little moulding, and she could not be in better hands;but mind, no tricks--I am not going to be cheated out of my bride.""You need not fear, George; I shall not murder her. I do not believein violence; it is the last resort of fools. If I did, you would notbe alive now."George laughed a little uneasily."Well, we are good friends again, so there is no need to talk of suchthings," he said. "The campaign will not be by any means an easy one--there are many obstacles in the way, and I don't think that myintended has taken a particular fancy to me. You will have to work foryour letters, Anne; but first of all take a day or two to think itover, and make a plan of the campaign. And now good-by; I have got abad headache, and am going to lie down."She rose, and went without another word; but all necessity for settingabout her shameful task was soon postponed by news that reached herthe next morning, to the effect that George Caresfoot was seriouslyill.                             CHAPTER XXIIThe dog-cart that Arthur had hired to take him away belonged to anold-fashioned inn in the parish of Rewtham, situated about a mile fromRewtham House (which had just passed into the hands of the Bellamys),and two from Bratham Abbey, and thither Arthur had himself driven. HisJehu, known through all the country round as "Old Sam," was an ancientostler, who had been in the service of the Rewtham "King's Head," manand boy, for over fifty years, and from him Arthur collected a gooddeal of inaccurate information about the Caresfoot family, including agarbled version of all the death of Angela's mother and Philip'sdisinheritance.After all, there are few more comfortable places than an inn; not ahuge London hotel, where you are known as No. 48, and have to lock thedoor of your cell when you come out of it, and deliver up your key tothe warder in the hall; but an old-fashioned country establishmentwhere they cook your breakfast exactly as you like it, and give yousound ale and a four-poster. At least, so thought Arthur, as he sat inthe private parlour smoking his pipe and reflecting on the curiousvicissitudes of existence. Now, here he was, with all the hopes andinterests of his life utterly changed in a single space of six-and-twenty hours. Why, six-and-twenty hours ago, he had never met hisrespected guardian, nor Sir John and Lady Bellamy, nor Philip and hisdaughter. He could hardly believe that it was only that morning thathe had first seen Angela. It seemed weeks ago, and, if time could havebeen measured on a new principle, by events and not by minutes, itwould have been weeks. The wheel of life, he thought, revolves with astrange irregularity. For months and years it turns slowly andsteadily under the even pressure of monotonous events. But, on someunexpected day, a tide comes rushing down the stream of being, andspins it round at speed; and then tears onward to the ocean called thePast, leaving its plaything to creak and turn, to turn and creak, orwrecked perhaps and useless.Thinking thus, Arthur made his way to bed. The excitement of the dayhad wearied him, and for a while he slept soundly, but, as the fatigueof the body wore off, the activity of his mind asserted itself, and hebegan to dream vague, happy dreams of Angela, that by degrees tookshape and form, till they stood out clear before the vision of hismind. He dreamt that he and Angela were journeying, two such happytravellers, through the green fields in summer, till by-and-by theycame to the dark entrance of a wood, into which they plunged, fearingnothing. Thicker grew the overshadowing branches, and darker grew thepath, and now they journeyed lover-wise, with their arms around eachother. But, as they passed along, they came to a place where the pathsforked, and here he stooped to kiss her. Already he could feel thethrill of her embrace, when she was swept from him by an unseen force,and carried down the path before them, leaving him rooted where hewas. But still he could trace her progress as she went, wringing herhands in sorrow; and presently he saw the form of Lady Bellamy, robedas an Egyptian sorceress, and holding a letter in her hand, which sheoffered to Angela, whispering in her ear. She took it, and then in asecond the letter turned to a great snake, with George's head, thatthrew its coils around her and struck at her with its fangs. Next, thedarkness of night rushed down upon the scene, and out of the darknesscame wild cries and mocking laughter, and the choking sounds of death.And his senses left him.When sight and sense came back, he dreamt that he was still walkingdown a wooded lane, but the foliage of the overhanging trees was of aricher green. The air was sweet with the scent of unknown flowers,beautiful birds flitted around him, and from far-off came the murmurof the sea. And as he travelled, broken-hearted, a fair woman with agentle voice stood by his side, and kissed and comforted him, till atlength he grew weary of her kisses, and she left him, weeping, and hewent on his way alone, seeking his lost Angela. And then at length thepath took a sudden turn, and he stood on the shore of an illimitableocean, over which brooded a strange light, as where                   "The quiet end of evening smiles                    Miles on miles."And there, with the soft light lingering on her hair, and tears ofgladness in her eyes, stood Angela, more lovely than before, her armsoutstretched to greet him. And then the night closed in, and he awoke.His eyes opened upon the solemn and beautiful hour of the firstquickening of the dawn, and the thrill and softness that comes fromcontact with the things we meet in sleep was still upon him. He got upand flung open his lattice window. From the garden beneath rose thesweet scent of May flowers, very different from that of his dreamwhich yet lingered in his nostrils, whilst from a neighbouring lilac-bush streamed the rich melody of the nightingale. Presently it ceasedbefore the broadening daylight, but in its stead, pure and clear andcold, arose the notes of the mavis, giving tuneful thanks and glory toits Maker. And, as he listened, a great calm stole upon his spirit,and kneeling down there by the open window, with the breath of springupon his brow, and the voice of the happy birds within his ears, heprayed to the Almighty with all his heart that it might please Him inHis wise mercy to verify his dream, inasmuch as he would be wellcontent to suffer, if by suffering he might at last attain to such anunutterable joy. And rising from his knees, feeling better andstronger, he knew in some dim way that that undertaking must be blestwhich, in such a solemn hour of the heart, he did not fear to pray Godto guide, to guard, and to consummate.And on many an after-day, and in many another place, the book of hislife would reopen at this well-conned page, and he would see the dimlight in the faint, flushed sky, and hear the song of the thrushswelling upwards strong and sweet, and remember his prayer and thepeace that fell upon his soul.By ten o'clock that morning, Arthur, his dog, and his portmanteau, hadall arrived together in front of the Abbey House. Before his feet hadtouched the moss-grown gravel, the hall-door was flung open, andAngela appeared to welcome him, looking, as old Sam the ostlerforcibly put it afterwards to his helper, "just like a hangel with thewings off." Jakes, too, emerged from the recesses of the garden, andasked Angela, in a tone of aggrieved sarcasm, as he edged his waysuspiciously past Aleck, why the gentleman had not brought the"rampingest lion from the Zoologic Gardens" with him at once? Havingthus expressed his feelings on the subject of bull-dogs, he shoulderedthe portmanteau, and made his way with it upstairs. Arthur followedhim up the wide oak stairs, every one of which was squared out of asingle log, stopping for a while on the landing, where the staircaseturned, to gaze at the stern-faced picture that hung so that it lookedthrough the large window facing it, right across the park and over thewhole stretch of the Abbey lands, and to wonder at the deep-gravedinscription of "Devil Caresfoot" set so conspicuously beneath.His room was the largest upon the first landing, and the same in whichAngela's mother had died. It had never been used from that hour tothis, and, indeed, in a little recess or open space between a cupboardand the wall, there still stood two trestles, draped with rotten blackcloth, that had originally been brought there to rest her coffin on,and which Angela had overlooked in getting the room ready.This spacious but somewhat gloomy apartment was hung round withportraits of the Caresfoots of past ages, many of which bore a markedresemblance to Philip, but amongst whom he looked in vain for one inthe slightest degree like Angela, whose handiwork he recognized in twolarge bowls of flowers placed upon the dark oak dressing-table.Just as Jakes had finished unbuckling his portmanteau, a task that hehad undertaken with some groaning, and was departing in haste, lest heshould be asked to do something else, Arthur caught sight of thetrestles."What are those?" he asked, cheerfully."Coffin-stools," was the abrupt reply."Coffin-stools!" ejaculated Arthur, feeling that it was unpleasant tohave little details connected with one's latter end brought thusabruptly into notice. "What the deuce are they doing here?""Brought to put the last as slept in that 'ere bed on, and stood eversince.""Don't you think," insinuated Arthur, gently, "that you had bettertake them away?""Can't do so; they be part of the furniture, they be--stand there allhandy for the next one, too, maybe you;" and he vanished with asardonic grin.Jakes did not submit to the indignities of unbuckling portmanteaus andhaving his legs sniffed at by bull-dogs for nothing. Not by any meanspleased by suggestions so unpleasant, Arthur took his way downstairs,determined to renew the coffin-stool question with his host. He foun
