AND OUR MEMORIES OF THE EAST.SIX WOMENICHAPTER IListless and despondent, feeling that he hated everything in life,Hamilton walked slowly down the street. The air was heavy, and thesun beat down furiously on the yellow cotton awnings stretched overhis head. Clouds of dust rose in the roadway as the white bullocksshuffled along, drawing their creaking wooden carts, and swarms offlies buzzed noisily in the yellow, dusty sunshine. Hamilton wenton aimlessly; he was hot, he was tired, his eyes and head ached, hewas thirsty; but all these disagreeable sensations were nothingbeside the intense mental nausea that filled him, a nausea of life.It rose up in and pervaded him, uncontrollable as a physicalmalady. In vain he called upon his philosophy; he had practised itso long that it was worn out. Like an old mantle from theshoulders, it fell from him in rags, and he was glad. He felt hehated his philosophy only less than he hated life--hated, yetdesired as the man hates a mistress he covets, and has never yetpossessed. "Never had anything, never done anything, never feltanything decent yet," he mused.He was an exceptionally handsome and attractive individual, andthough in reality forty years of age, he had the figure, the look,and air of twenty-eight. Masses of black hair, without a whitethread, waved above a beautifully-cut and modelled face, of whichthe clear bronze skin, with its warm colour in the cheeks, was notthe least striking feature. He was about six feet or a little overin height, and had a wonderfully lithe, well-knit figure, and acarriage full of grace and dignity. A bright, charming smile thatcame easily to his face, and an air of absolute unconsciousness ofhis own good looks, completed the armoury of weapons Venus hadendowed him with for breaking hearts. But Hamilton neglected hisvocation: he broke none. He got up early, and slaved away at hisduties for the Indian Civil Government in his office all day, andwent to bed dead tired at night, with nothing but a drearyconsciousness of duty done and more duty waiting for him thefollowing day, as a sleeping companion.Hamilton's life had been ruined by an early and an unsuccessfulmarriage. At twenty, when full of the early, divine fires of life,he had married a girl of his own age and rank, dazzled by thebeauty she then, in his eyes, possessed, and in that amazingblindness to character that make women view men with wonderingcontempt. His blindness, however, ended with the ceremony. On hiswedding-night the woman, who, it must be admitted, had acted herpart of loving submissiveness, of gentle devotion, admirably,mocked at him and his genuine, ardent passion.How well he had always remembered her words to him as they stoodface to face in the chilly whiteness of an English bridal chamberin midwinter! "It's no use, dear, I don't want any of this sort ofthing. It seems to me coarse and stupid, and I don't want thebother of a dozen babies. I married because I wanted the positionof a married woman, and a nice presentable man to go about with insociety. Besides, things were not satisfactory at home, and Iwanted a man to keep me, and all that. But I don't see why youshould get into such a state of mind about it. I will keep house,and be perfectly good and amiable, and we can go about together, ofcourse; only I want to keep my own room."And how well he remembered her as she stood there, shattering hislife with her cold, light words--a tall, slim girl, in her whitedinner dress! She had been very fair then, with a quantity of softflaxen hair, which shortly after she had taken to dyeing--a thinghe had always hated. She had a small, heart-shaped face, so lightin colour as to suggest anaemia, with a high, thin nose, of whichthe nostrils were excessively pinched together, a short upper lip,and a thick, quite colourless mouth, small when closed, when shelaughed opening wide far back to her throat, showing, as it seemed,an infinite quantity of long, narrow, white, wolf-like teeth.How hideous she had suddenly appeared to him in those moments, seenthrough the dark waves of passion she rolled back upon him! In thehot, rosy glow she had deliberately conjured up before his eyes oflove and love returned he had thought her beautiful. Now, as shetook the veil from her mean, base mind, it fell also from herbeauty, and he saw her ugly, as she really was, body and soul.Stunned and amazed, loathing his own folly, his own blindness,condemning these more than he did her cruelty, Hamilton hadlistened in silence while she revealed herself. When the firstshock was over, he had set himself to talk and reason with her.Naturally intensely kind and sympathetic, it was easy for him tosee another's view, to put himself in another's place. He blamedhimself at once, more than her, for the position he now foundhimself in. And patiently he tried to understand it, to find theclue, if possible, to remedy it. He reasoned long and gently withher, but she, knowing well the generous nature she had to dealwith, yielded not an inch. Hamilton was not the man to use force orviolence. The passions of the body, divested of their soul, werenothing to him. On that night she struck down within him all desirefor or interest in her. He left her at last, and withdrew toanother room, where he sat through the remaining hours of thenight, looking into the face of his future.Shortly after, he had left for India, the corpse of dead passionwithin his breast. He made a confident of no one, told no one ofhis secret burden, remitted half his pay regularly to his wife withthat obedience to custom and duty as the world sees it, with thatquiet dutifulness that is so astounding to the onlooker, butcharacteristic of so many Englishmen, and threw himself into hiswork, avoiding women and personal relations with them.Such a life as this invariably calls down the anger of Venus, andHamilton had worn out by now the patience of the goddess.The tragedy of Euripides' Hippolytus is called a myth, but thatsame tragedy is played out over and over again, year by year, inall time, and is as true now as it was then. The slighted goddesstakes her revenge at last. As he walked on, the sound of sometom-toms dulled by distance came to his ears. He hesitated at acrossing where a side alley led down towards the bazaar, thenwithout thought or intention walked down the turning, the musicgrowing louder as he advanced.It came from a house some way lower down, before the open door ofwhich hung a large white sheet with scarlet letters on it. Hamiltonglanced up and read on it, "Dancing girls from the Deccan.Admission, six annas. Walk in." He stared dully at it till the redletters danced in the fierce, torrid sunlight, and the flies,finding him standing motionless, came thickly round his face. Apuff of hot wind blew down the street, bringing the dust: it lifteda corner of the sheet and turned it back from the doorway. Withinlooked cool and dark. The entry was a square of darkness. He wastired of the sun, the heat, the noise, the dust and the flies. Withno thought other than seeking for shelter, he stepped behind thesheet and was in the darkness; a turnstile barred his way: on thetop of it he laid down his six annas, his eyes too full of theyellow glare of the outside to see whom he paid: he felt theturnstile yield, and stumbled on in the obscurity. A hand pushedhim between two curtains. Then he found himself in a low squareroom, and could see about him again by the subdued light of oillamps fixed against the wall. At one end was the small stage, itsscarlet curtain now down; in front a row of tin lamps, primitivefootlights, and the rest of the room was filled with rows of emptychairs. Mechanically and without interest, Hamilton went forwardand seated himself in the first of these rows. The tom-toms hadceased: there was quiet, an interval of rest presumably for thedancers. It was far cooler than outside, and Hamilton breathed asigh of relief as he sank into his seat. The dimness of the light,the quiet, the coolness all pleased him: he had not known till hesat down how tired he was. He might have sat there a quarter of anhour, his mind in that state of hopeless blank that supervenes onovermuch unsatisfactory thinking, when suddenly the tom-tomsstarted up again with a terrific rattle, and the scarlet curtainwas somewhat spasmodically jerked up, displaying a semicircle ofgirls seated on European chairs facing the tin lamps. Two of theseven were African girls, with the woolly hair and jet black skinof their race; they were seated one at each end of the semicircle,dressed in short scarlet skirts, standing out from their waist inEnglish ballet-girl fashion, the upper part of their bodies bare,except for the masses of coloured glass necklaces covering theirbreast from throat to waist. The next pair of girls seemed torepresent Spanish dancers, and were in ankle-long black and yellowdresses, little yellow caps with bells depending from them sat inamongst their masses of black hair, and they held languidly totheir sides their tambourines and castenets. Next on the chairs sattwo strictly Eastern dancers in transparent pale green gauzyclothing held into waist and each ankle by jeweled bands. Theirpale ivory bodies shone through the filmy green muslin as the moonshines clearly in green water, and the jewels blazed like starswith red and blue fires at each movement of their limbs. Theirheads were crowned simply with white clematis, and the glory oftheir straight-featured Circassian faces, together with theunrivalled contours of softly moulded throat and breast and perfectlimbs, veiled only so much as a light mist may veil, would havetaken the breath away of the most inveterate frequenter of theAlhambra and Empire in dull old England. Hamilton drew in hisbreath with a little start as he first saw the semicircle, but itwas not on the Circassians that his eyes were fixed, but on thevery centre figure of that beautiful half-moon. Set in the centre,she seemed to be considered the pearl amongst them, as indeed shewas. The mist that enveloped her was not pale green as the veils ofthe other two, but white, and the beautiful perfect form that itenclosed was of a warmer, brighter tint than theirs.The white films of the drapery fell from the base of her throat,leaving her arms quite bare, but softly clinging to breast andflanks, till a gold band resting on her hips confined it closely,and depressed in the centre, was fastened by a single enormousruby, the one spot of blood-red colour upon her. Beneath thesloping belt of gold fell her loose Turkish trousers of gleamingwhite, transparent tissue, clasped at the ankles by bands of gold.On her feet were little Turkish slippers, on her brow--nothing, butthe crown of her radiant youth and beauty. Hamilton, gazing at itacross the footlights, thought he had never seen, either picturedor in the flesh, a face so beautiful, so full of the beauty, thegoodness, the power and wonder of life.The sight thrilled him. Like the power of electricity, its powerbegan to run along his veins, heating them, stirring them, callingupon nerve and muscle and sense to wake up. He looked, and lifeitself seemed to stream into him through his eyes. The girl's facewas a well-rounded oval, supported on the round, perfect column ofher throat; the eyes seemed pools of blackness that had caught allthe splendour and the radiance of a thousand Eastern nights. Thefires of many stars, the whole brilliance of the purple nights ofAsia were mirrored in them. Above them rose the dark, arching spanof the eyebrows on the soft warm-tinted forehead, cut in one lineof severest beauty with the delicate nose. Beneath, the curlinglips were like the flowers of the pomegranate, a living, vividscarlet, and the rounded chin had the contour and bloom of thenectarine.She smiled faintly as she met the fixed gaze of Hamilton's eyesacross the footlights--such an innocent, merry little smile itseemed, not the mechanical contortions one buys with pieces ofsilver. Hamilton's blood seemed to catch light at it and flame allover his body. He sat upright in his seat: gone were his fatigue,his thirst, his eye-ache. His frame felt no more discomfort: hiswhole soul rushed to his eyes, and sat there watching. In some mentheir physical constitution is so closely knitted to the mental,that the slightest shock to either instantly vibrates through theother and works its effect equally on both. Hamilton was of thisorder, and his body responded, instantly now, to the joy andinterest born suddenly in his mind.A moment after the curtain was rolled up, a huge negro, dressed ina fancy dress of scarlet, and with a high cap of the same colour onhis head, came on from the side. In his hand he carried a smalldog-whip, and as he cracked it all the girls stood up. Hamiltonsickened as he looked at him: an indefinable feeling of horror cameover him as this man stalked about the stage. He pointed with hiswhip to the two African girls at the end of the semicircle, andthey came forward, while the rest sat down. A horrid uneasy feelingof discomfort grew up in Hamilton, similar to that which a lover ofanimals feels, when called upon to witness performing dogs, and allthe fear and anxiety pent up in their fast-beating little hearts iscommunicated to himself. He watched the girls' faces keenly as thenegro went round and placed himself behind the middle chair of thesemicircle, while the two Africans danced. Hamilton hardly noticedtheir dance, a curious barbaric performance that would have beenalarming to the British matron, but was neither new nor interestingto Hamilton. He kept his eyes fixed on the white-clothed girl inthe centre, and the sinister figure behind her chair. She seemedcalm and indifferent, and when the negro put his hand on hershoulder looked up and listened to his words without fear orrepulsion. Hamilton, keenly alive, with every sense alert, sat inhis chair, a prey to the new and delightful feeling, not known foryears, of interest.Yes, he was interested, and the energetic sense of loathing forthe negro proved it. The music, loud and strident--an ordinaryItalian piano-organ having been introduced amongst the Orientalinstruments--banged on, and then abruptly came to a stop when thenegro cracked his whip. The two African women resumed their chairs,there was some applause, and a good many small coins fell on thestage from the hands of the audience. The second pair of girlsrose, came forward and commenced to dance, the organ playing someappropriate Spanish airs. After these, the two Indian girls whogave the usual _dance de ventre_ to a lively Italian air on theorgan. Then, at last, _she_ rose from her chair and approached thefootlights. The organ ceased playing, only the Indian musiccontinued: wild sensual music, imitating at intervals the cries ofpassion.To this accompaniment the girl danced.Had any British matrons been present we must hope they would havewalked out, yet, to the eye of the artist, there was nothing coarseor offending, simply a most beautiful harmony of motion. The girl'sbeauty, her grace and youth, and the slight lissomness of all herbody lent to the dance a poetry, a refinement it would not havepossessed with another exponent.Moreover, though there was a certain ardour in her looks andgestures, in the way she yielded her limbs and body to theinfluence of the music, yet there was also a gay innocence, abright naive irresponsibility in it that contrasted strongly withthe sinister intention underlying all the movements of the othertwo Indian dancers. At the end of the dance Hamilton took a rupeefrom his pocket and threw it across the tin lamps towards her feet.She picked it up smiling, though she left the other coins whichfell on the stage untouched, and went back to her chair.After her dance, the great negro came forward and did a turn of hisown. Hamilton looked away. What was this man to the little circle?he wondered. He could not keep his mind off that one query? Werethey his slaves? willing or unwilling? did they constitute hisharem? or were they paid, independent workers? His mind was made upto get speech with this one girl, at least, that evening. Thisdelightful feeling of interest, this pleasure, even this keendisgust, all were so welcome to him in the dreary mental state ofindifference that had become his habit, that he welcomed themeagerly, and could not let them go. Beyond this there was risingwithin him, suddenly and overwhelmingly, the force of Life,indignant at the long repression it had been subjected to. Man maybe a civilized being, accustomed to the artificial restraints andlaws he has laid upon himself, but there remains within him stillthat primitive nature that knows nothing, and never will learnanything of those laws, and which leaps up suddenly after years ofits prison-life in overpowering revolt, and says, "Joy is mybirthright. I will have it!"This moment is the crisis of most lives. It was with Hamilton now,and it seemed suddenly to him that twenty years of fidelity to anunloved, unloving woman was enough. The debt contracted at thealtar twenty years before had been paid off. The promise, givenunder a misunderstanding to one who had wilfully deceived him, waswiped out. It was a marvel to him in those moments how it had heldhim so long.Hamilton had one of those keen, brilliant minds that make theirdecisions quickly, and rarely regret them. He took his resolutionnow. That prisoner in revolt within him should be free; he wouldstrike off the fetters he had worn too long and vainly. He wasbefore the open book of Life, at that page where he had stood solong. With a firm decisive hand he would take the new page, andturn it over. That last page, on which his wife's name was writtenlarge, was completely done with, closed.The old joyous spirit, the keen eagerness for love and joy andlife, the Pagan's gay rejoicing in it, that had been such a markedfeature of his disposition before his marriage, came back to him,rushed through him, refilled him.His marriage, with its disillusionment, had crushed it out of himfor a time, and, with that same decisiveness that marked him now,he had turned over the pages of youthful dreams and joys and loves,and opened the next page of work, of strenuous endeavour, of ahard, rigid observance of fidelity to the vows he had taken. Andfor a time work and its rewards, effort and its returns, a hard,practical life in the world amongst men, had held him. That nowwas no longer to be all to him.His life, and such joy as it might hold for him, was to be his ownagain. The joy of the decisions filled him, elated him. He felt asif his mind had sudden wings, and could lift him with it to theroof.Such a decision, when it comes, seems to oneself, as it seemed toHamilton now, a sudden thing. It has the force and shock of arevelation, but it is not really sudden. The great rebellion nearlyall natures--certainly some, and these usually the greatest andbest--feel at the absence of joy in their lives had been graduallygrowing within him, gathering a little strength each day. It isonly the climax of such feelings that is sudden--the awakening ofthe mind to their presence. The growth has been going on day byday, week by week, unmeasured, unreckoned with.Immediately the curtain fell, Hamilton left his seat and wentup to a door, reached by a few steps, on the level of thefootlights, and at the left side of them. No one hindered him.The rest of the audience were going out. He pushed the door,which yielded readily, and he passed through. A narrow,white-washed, lath-and-plaster passage opened before him, at theend of which he saw a tin lamp burning against the wall and heardvoices.The passage led into a three-cornered room, where he found some ofthe dancers and an old woman who was huddled up on a straw mat inthe corner. The negro was not there. The girls stood about idly;some were changing their clothes. They did not seem to heed hispresence, except the one he was seeking, who came straight towardshim. As she moved across the dirty, littered room, her limbs undertheir transparent covering moved, and her head was carried with theair of an empress. "Will the Sahib come with me?" she said in alow, soft tone. She raised her eyes to his face. They were wide,enquiring, like the deer's brought face to face with the hunter inthe green thickets.The other girls glanced towards him, and some smiles wereexchanged, but no one approached him. They seemed to understand hewas there only for the star of the troupe. Hamilton looked downinto those glorious midnight eyes fixed upon him, and a faintcolour came into his cheek."I will come wherever you lead," he answered in Hindustani. Thesesurroundings were horrible, but the shade of them did not seem todim her charm.The scent in the air was disagreeable. Tawdry spangles and falsejewels lay about on the tumble-down settees. From behind littledoors that opened from the walls round came the sound of men'svoices."Let the Sahib come this way, then," she answered, and turnedtowards one of the small doors in the wall. This took them intoanother tiny, musty-smelling passage that wound about like the runof a rabbit warren, only wide enough for one to pass along at atime, and the strips of lath were so low overhead that Hamiltonbent his neck involuntarily to avoid them.At a door in the side of this she stopped and pushed it open; thelittle run way wound on beyond in the darkness.Hamilton followed her into the sloping-roofed, lath-and-plasterpent-house that had been run up between the back of the stage andthe wall of the building. Native lamps were hooked into the wall,and their light showed the garish ugliness of it all--the hastilywhitewashed walls, the scraps of ragged, dirty, scarlet cloth hunghere and there over a bulge or stain in the plaster: the boardedfloor, uneven and cracked: the bed against the wall, not too cleanlooking, its dingy curtains not quite concealing the dingierpillows; the broken chair on which a basin stood, placed on twogrey-looking towels; another chair with the back rails knocked outleaning against the wall.He threw his gaze round it in a moment's rapid survey, then hepressed to the rickety, uneven door and shot the bolt.The girl stood in the middle of the room, an exquisitely lovelyfigure. She regarded him with wide, innocent eyes. Hamilton feltall the blood alight in his veins; it seemed to him he could hearhis pulses beating. Never in his life before had joy and passionmet within him to stir him as they did now, but in natures wherethere is a strong, deep strain of intellectuality the body neverquite conquers the mind, the light of the intellect never quitegoes down, however strong the sea, however high the waves ofanimal passion on which it rides; and now Hamilton felt the greatappeal to his brain as well as to his senses that the girl's beautymade.He went up to her. She looked at him with an intense admiration,almost worship in her eyes. A man at such moments looks, as Natureintended he should, his very best, and Hamilton's face, of a nobleand splendid type, lighted now by the keenest animation, held hergaze."Tell me," he said in a low tone, for footsteps passed on thecreaking boards, and gibbering voices and laughter could be heardoutside, "tell me, what is that man to you? Do you belong to him,all of you?""That...? He is not a man, he is a ... nothing," replied the girl,looking up with calm, glorious eyes. "He can do no harm ... norgood."Hamilton drew a quick breath."You dance like this every evening, and then choose someone in theaudience in this way?" he questioned, slipping his hand round herneck and looking down at her, a half-amused sadness coming into hiseyes.The girl shook her head with a quick negation."No, I have only been here a few days--a week, I think. Did younotice that old woman as we came through here? I belong to her; shetaught me to dance. She brought me here, and I dance for theNothing, but I have never taken any one like this before. The othergirls do, every night, but each night the Nothing said to me, 'Noone here to-night, good enough. Wait till an English Sahib comes.'"Hamilton listened with a paling cheek; his breath came and wentfaintly; he hardly seemed to draw it; he put his next question verygently, watching her open brow and proud, fearless eyes."Do you know nothing of men at all, then?""Nothing, Sahib, nothing," she answered, falling on her kneessuddenly at his feet, and raising her hands towards him. "This willbe my bridal night with the Sahib. The Nothing told me to pleaseyou, to do all you told me. What shall I do? how shall I pleaseyou?"Hamilton looked down upon her: his brain seemed whirling; thepulses along his veins beat heavily; new worlds, new vistas of lifeseemed opening before him as he looked at her, so beautiful in herfirst youth, in her unclouded innocence, full, it is true, ofOriental passion, with a certain Oriental absence of shame, butuntouched, able to be his, and his only.Before he could speak again, or collect his thoughts that thegirl's words had scattered, her soft voice went on:"Surely the Sahib is a god, not a man. I have seen the men acrossthe footlights: there were none like the Sahib. I said to mymother, 'I do not like men, I do not want them; what shall I do?'And my mother said, 'There is no hurry, my child; we will wait tilla rich Sahib comes.' But you are not a man, you must be a god, youare so beautiful; and I am the slave of the Sahib, for ever andever."She looked up at him, great lights seemed to have been lighted inthe midnight pools of her eyes, the curved lips parted a little,showing the perfect, even teeth; the rounded, warm-hued cheeksglowed; the lids of her eyes lifted as those of a person lookingout into a new world.Hamilton stood looking at her, and two great seas of conflictingemotions swept into his brain, and under their tumult he remainedirresolute. Mere instincts and nature, the common impulse of themale to take his pleasure whenever offered, prompted him to drawher to his breast and let her learn the great joy of life in hisarms; but some higher feeling held him back: the knowledge that thefirst way in which a woman learns these things colours her wholeafter estimation of them, restrained him.Here he saw, suddenly, there was new ground for Love to buildhimself a habitation upon. Should it be but a rude shanty, looselyconstructed of Desire? Was it not rather such a fair and lovelysite that it was worthy a perfect temple, built and finished withdelicate care?This flower of wonderful bloom he had found by chance in such apoor, rough garden, was it not better to carry it gently to somesheltered spot, to transplant and keep it for his own, rather thanjust tear at it with a careless touch in passing by?Hamilton had the brain of the artist and the poet; things touchedhim less by their reality than by that strange halo imaginationthrows round them.The sound of some shuffling steps in the passage outside, a lurchas of some drunken and unsteady figure, some whispered words, andthen a burst of ribald laughter just outside the door, decided him.No: her wedding night should not be here. Keen in his sympathy withwomen, Hamilton knew how often that night recurs to a woman'sthoughts, and should its memories always bring back to her thisloathsome shed, these hideous sounds?A repulsion so great filled him that it swept back his desire forthe moment. A great eagerness to get her away unharmed, unsoiledfrom such a place, filled him. Already she seemed to be part ofhimself, to be a possession he must guard. His heart was empty andhungry: by means of her beauty and this strange unexpectedinnocence she had so suddenly revealed to him, she had leapt intoit, made it her own. He sat down on the mean, dingy bed, and drewher warm, supple body into his arms: she stood within their circlesubmissively, quivering with pleasure. His touch was very gentleand reverent, for he was a man who knew the value of essentials;his brain was keen enough to go down to them and judge of them,undeterred and unhindered and undeceived by externals, byfictitious emblems. He saw here that he was in the presence of atender, youthful, unformed mind of complete innocence, and theabhorrent surroundings affected that essential not at all.A married woman in his own rank, with her dozen lovers and herknowledge of evil, high in the favour of the world, could neverhave had from him the same reverence that he gave to thisdancing-girl of the Deccan, who in the world's eyes was but acreature put under his feet for him to trample on."Would you like to leave all these people and come to live onlywith me? dance only for me?" he said softly, looking into thosegreat wondering eyes fixed in awe upon his face."Would you like to have a house to yourself, and a garden full offlowers, and stay there with me alone?"The girl clasped her hands joyously, smile after smile rippledover the brilliant face."Oh, Sahib, it would be paradise! If I can stay with the Sahib, Ishall be happy anywhere. I am the slave of the Sahib. If he but useme as the mat before his door to walk upon, I shall be content."Hamilton shivered. He drew her a little closer. "Hush! I do notlike to hear you say those things. You shall come to me and sleepin my arms, but not to-night. Love is a very great thing: it willbe a great thing with us, and it must not be thought of lightly, doyou see? Will you stay here and think of me only till I come again?Think of your bridal night with me, dream of me till I come backfor you?""The Sahib's will is my law; but even if I wished, I could think ofnothing else but him till I see him again," she responded, her eyesfixed upon his face. Hamilton gazed upon her. She made such alovely picture standing there: he thought he had never seen beautyso perfect, so exquisitely fresh. The soft transparent tunic didnot conceal it, only lightly veiled its bloom. Her breasts, roundedand firm, stood out as a statue's. They seemed to express thevigour of her buoyant youth: they had never known artificialsupport, and needed none. The waist was naturally slight, the hipsalso, the straight supple limbs and round arms were the mostrichly-modelled parts, perhaps, of the whole perfect form.Hamilton slipped his arm down to her yielding waist and drew hercloser. Then he bent his head and kissed the wonderfully-carved andglowing mouth. With a little cry of joy the girl threw both armsabout his neck and kissed him back with a wealth of fervour in herlips, pressing her soft bosom against his in all the natural,unrestrained ardour of a first and new-found love."Sahib, Sahib! do not leave me long. Come and take me away soon! Iam all yours! No other shall see me till you come again."Hamilton was satisfied. He raised his head, his whole ardent natureaflame."Dear little girl, let us go then to the old woman, and perhaps Ican pay her enough to make her take you away from here, and keepyou safe till I can come for you.""Come, Sahib, come!" she answered, joyfully drawing out of hisarms and running across the room; she unbolted the door and pulledit open, nearly causing the old woman who was crouched justoutside, and apparently leaning against it, to roll into the room."Saidie, Saidie! you have no respect for me," she grumbled, gettingon her feet with some difficulty. Hamilton came up, and helped tobalance her as she stood."Your Saidie pleases me very much," he said, drawing out apocket-book. "I want to take her away from here altogether. Howmuch do you ask for her?"The old woman's beady-black eyes twinkled and gleamed, and fixed onthe pocket-book."It is not possible, Sahib," she said in a grumbling tone, "for meto part with her and her services. A girl like that with herbeauty, her dancing, her singing! She will earn gold every night.Let the Sahib come here each evening if he will and take his turnwith the rest. For a girl like that to go to one man alone is wasteand folly."The colour mounted to Hamilton's face. His brows contracted."What I have to say is this," he answered sternly and briefly, "Iwant this girl, and if you take her with you to some place ofsafety for to-night, I will come to-morrow or the next day and giveyou 2000 rupees for her--no more and no less. I have spoken.""Two thousand rupees!" replied shrilly the old woman, "for Saidie,the star of the dancers, and not yet fifteen! No, Sahib, no! aParsee will give more than that for a half hour with her."Hamilton caught the old creature by her skinny arm:"You waste your words talking to me," he said. "I am a policemagistrate, and I can have your whole place here closed, and all ofyou put in prison, if I choose. The girl is willing to come withme, and I will take her and pay you well for her. You have herready for me to-morrow night, or you go to prison--which youplease." The old woman shivered at the word magistrate, and felltrembling on her knees."Let the Sahib have mercy! That great black brute will kill me ifthe police come here. I take Saidie to my house, the Sahib comesthere when he will. He pays, he has her. It is all finished."She spread out her thin black hands in a shaking gesture offinality, and then fell forward and kissed Hamilton's boots afterthe complimentary but embarrassing manner of natives. Hamilton drewback a little. He was angered that Saidie should be witness,auditor of all this. She stood silent, passive, gazing at the hot,angry colour mounting to his face. He bent forward and dragged theold woman up by her arms."Take this for yourself now," he said, putting a hundred-rupee noteinto her hand, "and make no more difficulty. Take every care ofSaidie, and you will have your two thousand rupees very shortly."The old woman seized the note, and began to mumble blessings onHamilton, which he cut short: "Give me the name of your street andthe house where you live, that I may find you easily," he said, andnoted down the directions she gave him. Then he turned to the girland put his arm round her neck."Dear Saidie! I trust to you. Remember it is your innocence, yourvirtue, I love more than your beauty. Do not dance nor let anyonesee you till I come again."He kissed her on the lips as she promised him. The soft, warm formthrilled against him as their lips met. Then with a mental wrenchhe turned and went out of the room and quickly down the darkpassage.At the end his way was barred by the immense form of the negro."Something for me, master; do not forget me! I keep the prettythings here for the gentlemen to see."Hamilton drew back with loathing. Then he reflected--it was better,perhaps, to keep all smooth.He dived into his pockets and found a roll of small notes, which hepushed into the negro's hand. The man bowed and let him pass, andHamilton went on out into the street.It was evening now. The calm, lovely golden light of an Indianevening fell all around him as he walked rapidly back to hisbungalow. As he entered it, how different he felt from the man whohad left it that morning! How light his footstep, how bright andkeen the tone of his voice! It quite surprised himself as he calledout to his butler that he was ready for dinner. Then he bounded upto his room humming. His very muscles were of quite a differenttexture seemingly now from an hour or two ago! How the blood flewabout joyously in his body! Dear Venus! she makes us pay generally,but who can cavil at the glorious gifts she gives? As soon as hisdinner was disposed of, and all his other servants had retired fromthe room, Hamilton called his butler, Pir Bakhs, to him, and held along conference with that intelligent and trustworthy individual.Hamilton was one of those men that by reason of his strikingly goodlooks, his charm of manner, his consideration for others, and hiscomplete control over himself that never allowed him to be betrayedinto an unjust word or action was greatly liked by every one, andsimply worshipped by his servants and all those in any way in aposition dependent on him.When to-night Pir Bakhs was honoured by his confidence, theservant's whole will and all his keen energies rose with delightto serve his master. After he had listened in silence toHamilton's wishes, he proceeded to make himself master of the wholescheme, detail by detail."The Sahib wishes a very beautiful bungalow far out, away from thecity? I know of one house across the desert; my cousin was butlerthere. The Sahib went away to England, and the bungalow is to belet furnished. Have I the Sahib's permission to go down to bazaar,see my cousin to-night? I make all arrangements. I go to-morrowmorning; I get cook and all other servants. I stay there and makeall ready for the Sahib to-morrow evening."Hamilton smiled at the man's eagerness to serve him. He knew wellthat secretly in his heart his Mahommedan butler had alwaysdeplored the severely monastic style in which he had lived, theabsence of women in his master's bungalow, the emptiness of hisarms that should have had to bear his master's children, and thathe now was ready to welcome heartily his master's reformation."Could you really do all that, Pir Bakhs?" he asked; "and can youassure me that the house is a good one, and has the compound beenwell kept up?""The house is about the same as this, but not quite so large. It isin the oasis of Deira, across the desert. The Sahib knows how wellthe palms grow there. My cousin tells me the compound is verylarge; the Sahib there kept four malis;[1] very fine garden, manyEnglish roses there."[Footnote 1: Gardeners.]"English roses I do not care for, Pir Bakhs," returned Hamiltonwith a melancholy smile. "The roses of the East are far fairer tome."The butler bowed with his hand to his forehead. He took hismaster's speech as a gracious compliment to his country."Everything grow there," he answered, spreading out his hands:"pomegranates, bamboo, mangoes, bananas, sago palm, cocoanut palm,magnolia--everything. I go to-morrow, I engage malis; I have allready for the Sahib.""Very well, I trust you with it all. I shall keep on this housejust as it is, and leave most of the servants here. You and yourwives must come out with me, and you engage any other necessaryservants and hire any extra furniture you want.""The Sahib is very good to his servant," returned the butler, hisface lighting up joyfully. "When will the Sahib shed the light ofhis countenance on the bungalow?""I will try to run out to see it, to-morrow, after office hours,"replied Hamilton, "if you will have all ready by then. I shall lookover it, and return to dine here as usual. Then about ten or later,I will come over and bring your new mistress out with me. You musthave a good supper waiting for us. Take over all the linen andplate you may want, but see that enough is left in this house sothat I can entertain the English Sahibs here if I want to, and letmy riding camel be well fed early. I shall use him for coming andgoing. That's all, I think."The butler bowed, and retired radiant with joyous importance, andHamilton sat on alone by the table thinking. The blood ran at hightide along his veins, his eyes glowed, looking into space. Life, hethought, what a joyous thing it was when it stretched out its handsfull of gifts!CHAPTER IIThe following afternoon, directly his work at the office wasfinished, he went out to the oasis in the desert to look at his newpossession, his bungalow in the palms.The moment he saw it peeping out from amongst them, and surroundedby roses, he expressed himself satisfied, and named the placeSaied-i-stan, or the place of happiness.The butler met him there; he was bursting with self-importance."You leave everything to me, Sahib--everything. I know all theSahib wants. He shall have all. Let him come, ten o'clock, nineo'clock, no matter when; all quite ready. I am here. I haveeverything waiting for the Sahib."Hamilton smiled and praised him, and went back to the station; tooka pretence of dinner and a hurried cup of coffee, and then wentdown into the bazaar with the precious bit of paper containing thedirections to Saidie's dwelling-place in his breast pocket.He found the house at last, and, going in at the doorlessentrance, climbed patiently the wooden stairs that ran straight upfrom it in complete darkness. On the topmost landing--a frailwooden structure that creaked beneath his feet--he paused, andrapped twice on the door opposite him.His heart beat rapidly as he stood there; the blood seemed flyingthrough it. All the strength of his vigorous body seemed gatheringitself together within him, all the fire of his keen, hungry brainleapt up, and waiting there in the dark on the narrow landing heknew the joy of life.The door was opened. In a moment his eye swept round the interiorof the high windowless room. The floor was bare, with mats here andthere, and in the centre stood a flat pan of charcoal, glowingunder a closed and steaming cooking-pot. At one end a coarse chick,suspended from a wooden bar, dropped its long lines to the floor,and behind this, on some cushions, sat Saidie with another of thedancing-girls.The old woman who had opened the door, salaamed, touching the floorwith her forehead as Hamilton walked in, and then securely shut andfastened the door behind him. Saidie rose and looked through theshimmering lines of the chick at him as he entered.Very handsome the tall commanding figure looked in the mean, bareroom: the long neck and well-modelled head, with its black,close-cut hair, stood out a noble relief against the colourlesswall, and the clear brown skin, with the warm tint of quick bloodin it that showed above the English collar, arrested the girl'seyes with a keen thrill of joy. Looking at him, she felt rushingthrough her the passionate delight that self-surrender to such aman would be. Without waiting to be summoned, she parted the linesof the chick, came out from them, and fell on her knees at hisfeet.The heat in the shut-up room was very great, and she was wearingonly a straight white muslin tunic, through which all the softbeauty of her form could be seen, as an English face is seenthrough a veil. Her hair was looped back from her brows and tiedsimply with a piece of green ribbon, as an English girl's mighthave been, and flowed in its thick, black glossy waves to herwaist.Hamilton bent over her and raised her in his arms, feeling in thatmoment, though the whole universe were reeling and rocking roundhim to its ruin, he would care nothing while he pressed that softbreast to his.The old woman sat down cross-legged by the charcoal, and began tofan it.The other girl behind the chick looked out curiously, but her eyesnever noted the strength and beauty of Hamilton's figure, nor thebright glow in the oval cheek: she looked to see if he wore ringson his fingers, and tried to catch sight of the links in his cuffsto see if they were silver or gold.Saidie had the divine gift of passion: all the fire of the gods inher veins. Zenobie had none, and Saidie's joy now was something shecould not understand."Have you come to take me away, now at once?" Saidie murmured in asoft, passionate whisper close to his ear, and the accent of joyand delight went quivering down through the deepest recesses of theman's being."Yes: are you ready to come with me?" Needless question! put onlyfor the supreme pleasure of listening to its answer."Oh, more than ready," whispered the soft voice back. "How shallthe slave explain her longing to her lord?"Zenobie had come round the chick, while they stood by the door, anddrawn forward the one little low wooden stool that they possessed.She came up now, and pulled at Saidie's sleeve."Let the Sahib be seated," she said reprovingly, and Saidie let herarms slip from his neck and drew him forward to the stool by thecharcoal pan.With some difficulty Hamilton drew up his long legs and seatedhimself cautiously on the small seat; Saidie and Zenobie satcross-legged on the ground close to his feet. The old woman ceasedto fan the fire; the bright red glow of the coals fell softly onthe strong, noble beauty of the man's face, and Saidie, looking upto it, sat speechless, her bosom heaving, her lips parted, her darkeyes full of mysterious fires, melting, swimming, behind their veilof lashes.Zenobie watched her with curiosity: what did she feel for thisinfidel who wore no rings and only silver in his cuffs?Hamilton, as soon as he was seated, drew out his pocket-book--oldand worn, for he spent little on himself--and opened it.The old woman sat up. Zenobie's eyes gleamed: the business wasgoing to commence. Only Saidie did not stir nor move her eyes fromhis face."Two thousand rupees was the price agreed upon; here it is," hesaid, taking out a thick bundle of notes that occupied the wholeinside of the poor, limp pocket-book; and as the old womanstretched out a skinny claw for them and began to slowly countthem, he turned his gaze away, on to the upturned face of the girlwatching him with sensual adoration.The old woman counted through the notes, and then securely tiedthem into the end of her chudda."The sum is the due sum, well counted," she said, looking up; "andwhen will my lord take his slave?""To-night," Hamilton replied briefly, but not without a swiftenquiring glance into the girl's eyes. Though he had bought andpaid for her, he could not get out of the Western knack ofconsidering that the girl's desires had to be consulted.The old woman raised her hands in affected horror."To-night! But she is not well clothed, she is not bathed andanointed; the bridal robes are not prepared. My lord, it cannotbe!"Hamilton looked at Saidie; she crept to his side and put her headon his breast."Yes, to-night, take me to-night," she murmured eagerly; he smiled,and put his arm around her."The bridal clothes are of no consequence," he answered decisively."My camel waits below. I will take her to-night.""She has no shoes," objected the old woman. "She cannot descend thestairs.""I will carry her down," replied Hamilton, and, springing up fromthe little stool, he stooped over the lovely form at his feet,raising her into his arms, close to his breast. Saidie clung to hisneck with a little cry of pleasure, her bare, warm-tinted feet hungover his arm.The old woman gasped: Zenobie laughed. The Englishman looked sobig, so immensely strong. The weight of Saidie, tall andwell-developed as she was, seemed as nothing to him."Zenobie, will you hold the lamp at the doorway, that he may seehis way?" Saidie cried out, slipping off a thin gold circlet shewore on her arm, and letting it drop into the other's hands."Farewell, Zenobie; may you be always as happy as I am now."Zenobie caught the bracelet and ran to the wall, unhooked the lampthat hung there, and came to the door."Farewell, my mother," Saidie said, as they turned to it."Farewell, my daughter; be submissive to the Sahib, and obey him inall things."The door was opened, and by the dim, uncertain light of Zenobie'slamp, Hamilton, clasping his warm, living burden, went slowly andheavily down the bending stairs, feeling the life brimming in everyvein.Outside, in the tranquil splendour of the starry Eastern night,knelt the camel, peacefully awaiting its lord, and as Hamiltonapproached it with his burden, it turned its head and large, liquideyes upon him with a gurgle of pleasure."The camel loves Hamilton Sahib," murmured the girl, as he set heron the soft red cloth laid over the animal's back, which formed theonly saddle. He took his own place in front of her."Hold to my belt firmly," he told her, gathering into his hand thelight rein. "Are you ready for him to rise?"He felt her little, soft hands glide in between his belt and waist."Yes, I am quite ready," she answered, and at a word ofencouragement, the great beast rose with its slow, stately swing toits feet, and Hamilton guided it towards the Meidan. The soft, hotair stirred against their faces as they moved through the night.Nothing could present a more lovely picture than the bungalow thatevening. A low, white house, looking in the moonlight as if builtof marble, surrounded by masses of palms which threw a delicatetracery of shadow upon it and drooped their beautiful, fan-like,feathery branches over it, between it and the jewelled sky.A light verandah ran around the lower of the two stories,completely covered by the white, star-like bloom of the jessaminethat poured forth floods of fragrance like incense on the hot,still air, and a giant pink magnolia rioted over the wide porch oflattice-work. Within it was brightly lighted, and a warm glow fromshaded lamps came out from each window, stealing softly through theveil of scented jessamine and falling on the masses of pink rosessurrounding the house.The deep peace, the sweet scent in the silence, the kiss of themoonlight and the starlight on the sleeping flowers, the exquisiteform of the shadows on the white wall, filled Hamilton withpleasure: each sense seemed subtly ministered to; he felt as ifinvisible spirits round him were feeding him with ambrosia.He turned round to Saidie as the camel slowly and majesticallyentered the compound gate, and saw her clearly framed in the softsilver light; all this wondrous beauty round them seemed to be toher beauty but as the harmonies that in an opera float round thecentral air. And she smiled as he turned upon her."How do you like your new house, Saidie?" he said, half laughing ashe leant back to her."Surely it is Paradise, Sahib," she murmured back in awestrucktones.Within the door waited the servants to welcome them in a doubleline, and as Saidie entered, they fell flat with their faces on thefloor. She passed through the prostrate row saluting them, and onto the foot of the stairs. The ayah that the butler had engagedrose and followed her mistress upstairs, where she was ushered intoher bath and dressing-room; while the butler, swelling withimportance and joyous pride, led Hamilton to the large room he hadprepared as a bedroom on the first floor. As they went in Hamiltongave a murmur of approval very dear to the man's heart, as he heardit, standing respectfully by the door.The room was large, and two windows, draped with curtains, stoodopen to the soft night.The bed in the centre of the room was one of the wide Indiancharpais which are unrivalled for comfort, and glimmered softlywhite beneath its filmy mosquito curtains in the lamplight shed byfour handsome rose-shaded lamps. Small tables stood everywhere,bearing vases of fresh flowers, roses, and stephanotis; a rich,deep rose-coloured carpet spread all over the floor, with only asmall border of chetai visible round the walls; and two easy-chairsof the same colour and numerous smaller ones piled up with cushionscompleted the equipment of the room. The air was full of scent, andthe scheme of colour in the room perfect. Nothing but rose andwhite was allowed to meet the eye. The flowers were selected withthis view, and the great bowls of roses all blushed the sameglorious tint through the snowy whiteness of the stephanotis.The room suggested, in its softly-lighted glow of pink and white, abridal chamber.Hamilton turned to his servant with a pleased smile on hishandsome, animated face."You are an artist, Pir Bakhs, and a sort of magician, to do allthis in twelve hours."Pir Bakhs bowed and salaamed by the door, his well-formed polishedface wreathed in many smiles.Downstairs the girl was already waiting for her lord, bathed, andwith her long hair shaken out and brushed after the dust of thedesert ride, and looped back from her forehead by a fresh greenribbon. She did not sit down, but stood waiting.This room showed the same care as the upper one, and the table waslaid out with Hamilton's plate and glass and four beautifulepergnes held the flowers.Natives are artists, particularly in colour arrangements; the wholecolour scheme here was white and green, and any table in Belgraviawould have had hard work to equal this one. Saidie stood looking atit, and the servants, already ranged by the sideboard, stood withtheir eyes on the ground, yet conscious of her wonderful beauty,and pleased by it in the same way that they would have felt prideand pleasure in the beauty and good condition of a new horse orcamel acquired by their master.After a few minutes Hamilton came down. He had put on his eveningclothes as they had been laid out for him by the bearer, andlooked radiant as he entered.Saidie gave a little cry as she saw him. His present dress, wellcut and close-fitting, showed his splendid figure to greateradvantage than the loose suit she had seen him in hitherto. Hislong neck carried his fine, spirited head erect, and the masses ofthick, black hair, with just the least wave in it, shone in thelamplight. His well-cut face, with its gay animation and charming,debonair, unaffected expression, made a kingly and perfect pictureto the girl's dazzled eyes.As they took their places and their soup was served, she could notdetach her gaze from his face.He laughed as he looked at her."Come, you must be hungry. Take your soup while it's hot; don'twaste your time looking at me.""Sahib, I cannot help looking at you. You are so wonderful to me!Please give me leave to. I do not want any soup."Hamilton, who by this time had finished his own, leant back in hischair and laughed again, looking at her with eyes blazing withmirth and passion. This innocent, genuine admiration was verypleasing to him in its flattery; this worship offered to himself,rather than his gifts, was something new to him, and the girl'sbeauty sent all the fires of life in quick streams through hisframe as he looked on it. He was alive for the first time in hisexistence, and filled with a surprised happiness as great as thegirl's. He was as virgin to joy as she was to love. "You are thedearest little girl I ever knew," he said; "but if you won't takesoup, you must eat fish. Yes, I positively refuse you my permissionto look at me till you have finished that whole plate."Saidie dropped her eyes to her fish very submissively at this,while Hamilton himself filled her glass."Have you ever tasted wine?" he asked. "This is champagne; drinkit, and tell me what you think of it.""All my people are Mahommedans; we do not drink wine," Saidiereplied, taking up the glass and sipping from it."Perhaps you won't like it," he suggested, watching her."If the Sahib gives it to me I shall like it," replied Saidie,smiling at him over the delicate golden glass: it threw its lightupwards into her great gleaming eyes, and Hamilton kissed thelittle hand that put the glass gently down on the table again.Next after the fish came game and joints, course after course, morefood in that one meal than Saidie was accustomed to see for manypeople for a week. Her own appetite was soon satisfied, and she satfor the most part gazing at Hamilton, with her hands tightly lockedtogether in her lap: such a nervous delight filled her, such astrange joy in knowing herself to be alive, to be possessed of abeautiful body that by reason of its beauty was worthy the caressesof a man like this; such a pure rapture animated every fibre, torealise that it was in her power to give pleasure to him. With suchfeelings as these no faintest hint of humiliation or degradationcould mingle. Saidie felt only that superb and joyous pride thatNature originally intended the female to have in her surrender tothe male.Her very breath seemed to flutter softly with joyous trepidationand excitement as it passed over her lips. That she was to be his,held in his arms, admitted to his embrace, seemed to her to be thecrown of her life, an honour given by special divine favour.So must Rhea Sylvia have felt praying before her Vestal altar whenMars first appeared to her startled eyes.And Hamilton, with his keen, sensitive temperament, saw into hermind clearly, and was fully aware of all this fervent adoration,this intense passionate worship springing within her; and animmense tenderness and reverence grew up within him, enclosing allhis passion as the crystal vessel encloses the crimson wine.That she would not in her present state have shrunk or flinchedfrom a knife, if only his hand held it while it wounded her, heknew quite well, and this wonderful voluntary self-sacrifice whichis the soul of all female passion appealed to him as a very holything.He knew that constantly this adoring love was poured out by womenfor men, that almost every virgin heart beats with this sameworship as the first pain of love enters it, but ah! for how shorta time! How quickly the man tears open those eyes that would sowillingly be closed to his vileness! how soon come the infidelity,the lies and the meanness, the trickery and the treachery! Howassiduously the man teaches the woman who loves him that there isnothing in him worthy of adoration, not even admiration, not evendecent respect! How little confidence, how little credence she soongives to his word that was once so sacred to her! How in her heart,though her lips say nothing, is that once rapturous worship changedinto a measureless contempt!Men persistently teach women that they must not expect the bestfrom them, but the lowest. And the women cry in pain as they seethe white mantle of their love trampled upon and dragged in themire of lies and falseness, and they take it back from the basehands and burn it in the fires kindled in their outraged hearts.Something of this flashed through Hamilton's brain as he met theadoring trust and love in the girl's eyes, and an unspoken vowformed itself within him that he would not deceive and betray it,that his lips should not lie to her, that to the end he would be toher as she now saw him in the glamour of those first hours.When he had tempted her to every sweet and bon-bon on the table,and made her drink all the wine he thought good for her, he sentthe servants away, and they remained alone together in thedining-room with their coffee before them. He put his arm roundher, and drawing her out of her own chair, took her on to his kneesand pressed her head down on his shoulder."Are you not tired with that long ride on the camel?" he asked."No, Sahib, I am not tired."The soft weight of her body pressed upon him; her lids drooped overher eyes as her head leaned against his neck."I think you are tired and very sleepy," he repeated, pinching theglowing arm in its transparent muslin sleeve."If the Sahib says so, I must be," responded Saidie quite simply."Come, then, and sleep," he said in her ear, and they wentupstairs.Saidie gave a little cry of delight as they entered together therose-filled room, and beyond its soft shaded lights she saw thegreat flashing planets in the dark sky."This is a different and a better home for love than we had lastnight," said Hamilton softly, as he closed the door.A great peace reigned all round them. Within and without thebungalow there was no sound. The lights burned steadily andsubdued, the sweet scent of the flowers hung in the air like asilent benediction upon them.He put his arm round her, and felt her tremble excessively as hishand unfastened the clasp of her tunic. He stopped, surprised."Why do you tremble so? Are you afraid of me?" he asked, lookingdown upon her, all the tenderness and strength of a great passionin his eyes."No, no," she returned passionately, "I tremble because great wavesof happiness rush over me at your touch. I cannot tell you what Ifeel, Sahib; the love and happiness within me is breaking me intofragments.""Then you must break in my arms," he murmured back softly, drawingher into his embrace, "so that I shall not lose even one of them."       *       *       *       *       *In the morning a flood of sunlight rushing into the room throughthe open windows, bringing with it the gay chatter of birds, rousedthe lovers. Hamilton opened his eyes first, and, lifting his headfrom the pillow, looked down upon Saidie still asleep beside him.In the rich mellow light of the room her loveliness glowed underhis eyes like a jewel held in the sun. He hardly drew his breath,looking down upon her. Her heavy hair, full of deep purplishshades, and with the wave in it not unusual in the Asiatic, waspushed off the pale, pure bronze of the forehead, on which weredrawn so perfectly the long-sweeping Oriental brows. The nose,delicately straight, with its proud high-arched nostrils, and thetiny upper lip, led the eye on to the finely-carved Eastern mouth,of which the lips now were softly, firmly folded in repose. Howexquisitely Nature had fashioned those lips, putting more elaboratework in those lines and curves of that one feature than in thewhole of an ordinary English face. Hamilton hung over her, filledwith a passion of tenderness, watching the gentle breath movesoftly the warm column of bronze throat and raise the soft, fullbreast.Passion, in its highest phase, is indeed the supreme gift of thegods. In giving it to a mortal for once they forget their envy: foronce they raise him to their level; for that once they grant himdivinity.Hamilton now marvelled at himself. The whole fruit of his fortyyears of life--all that accomplished work, success, wealth,rewarded worth, satisfied ambition, all the pleasures his youth,his health and strength, and powers had always brought him, crushedtogether--could not equal this: the charm and ecstasy with which hegazed down on this warm beauty of the flesh beside him.And yet he knew that it was not really in that flesh, not even inthat beauty, that lay the delight. It was in himself, in his ownintense desire, and the gratification of it, that the joy hadbirth; and if the gods give not this desire, no matter what elsethey give, it is useless.The girl might have been as lovely, Hamilton himself, and all thecircumstances the same, yet waking thus he might have been but theordinary poor, cold, clay-like mortal a man usually is. But thegreat desire for this beauty that had flamed up within him, now inits possession, gave him that fervour and fire, those wings to hissoul, that seemed to make him divine. It was for him one of thosemoments for which men live a life-time, as he indeed had done, butthey repay him when they come. To some, they come never. To theselife must indeed be dark.Suddenly the girl opened her eyes; the fire in his bent upon herseemed to electrify and thrill her into life, and with a littlemurmur of delight she stretched up her rounded arms to him.At breakfast Hamilton regretted he should have to leave her allday; what would she do?"You must not think of it, Sahib," she answered. "Have I not thegarden? I shall be quite happy. I shall sing all day long to theflowers about my lord, and count the minutes till he comes back."The office did not attract Hamilton at all that day, yet he felt itwas better to attend there as usual, to make no break in his usualroutine.Scandal there was sure to be, sooner or later, about hisdesert-bungalow, but at least it was better not to give to thescandal-mongers the power to say he had neglected his duties. Yethe lingered over his departure, and took her many times into hisarms to kiss her before he went, keeping his impatient Arab waitingat the door. He would not use the camel again this morning, butleft it resting in its corner of the compound beneath the palms.After Hamilton had gone, Saidie stepped through the long windowinto the verandah, full of green light, completely shaded as it wasby the giant convolvulus that spread all over it. The chetaicrushed softly under her feet, and she went on slowly to the endwhere it opened to the compound. Here she stood for a moment gazinginto the wilderness of beauty of mingled sun and shade before her.Against the dazzling blue of the sky the branches of the palmsstood out in gleaming gold, throwing their light shade over themasses of crimson and white and yellow roses that rioted togetherbeneath. Groves of the feathery bamboo drooped their delicatestems in the fervent, sweet-scented heat, over the white,thick-lipped lilies, from one to other of which passed languidlyon velvet wings great purple butterflies.The pomegranate trees made a fine parade of their small, exquisitescarlet flowers, and pushed them upwards into the sparklingsunlight through the veils of white starry blossoms of thejessamine that climbed over and trailed from every tree in thecompound.The girl went forward dreaming. How completely, superbly happy shewas! And she had nothing but the gifts of Nature, such as she, thekindly one, gives to the gay bird swinging on the bough, thebutterfly on the flower, the deer springing on the hills: healthand youth, beauty and love.These only were hers; nothing that man ordinarily strivesfor--neither wealth nor fame, fine houses, costly garments, jewels,slaves, power; none of these were hers. Over her body hung simply amuslin tunic worth a few annas; of the garden in which she stoodnot a flower belonged to her, no weight of jewels lay on her happyheart. She had no name; she was only a dancing-girl from theDeccan. With the animals she shared that wonderful kingdom of joythat they possess: their food and mate secured, their vigoroushealth bounding in their limbs, their beauty radiant in theirperfect bodies.Are they not the Lords of Creation in the sense that they are lordsof joy? Man is the slave of the earth, doomed by his own vile luststo bondage of the most dismal kind. All of those gifts that Naturegives, and from which alone can be drawn happiness, he tramplesbeneath his feet, putting his neck under the yoke of ceaselesstoil, striving for things which in the end bring neither peace norjoy.All within the compound under the reign of Nature rejoiced. Theparroquets swung on the trees, and the butterflies floated from themarble whiteness of the lily's cloisters to the deep, warm recessesof the rose, and the dancing-girl walked singing through thesparkling, scented air thinking of her lord.Hamilton, speeding down the dusty, burning road to his office inthe native city, felt a strange bounding of his heart as histhoughts clung to the low, white bungalow amongst the palmsoutside the station, and all that it held for him.He went through his work that day with a wonderful energy, born ofthe new life within him. Nothing fatigued, nothing worried him. Thecourt-house air did not oppress him. He heard the pleadings andmade his decisions with ease and promptitude. His patience,gentleness, his clearness and force of brain were wonderful. Thewhole electricity of his body was satisfied: the man was perfectlywell and perfectly happy. Who cannot work under such conditions? Inthe evening his horse was brought round, and with a wild leaping ofthe heart he swung himself into the saddle. The animal feltinstantly the elation of his master, and at once broke into acanter; as this was not checked, he threw up his lovely head, andas Hamilton turned across the plain, let himself go in a longgallop towards where the palms glowed living gold against therose-hued sky.Hamilton had hardly passed through the white chick into theinterior of the house before he heard the sound of bare feet uponthe matting, and through the soft magnolia-scented, pinky gloom ofthe room, shaded from the sunset light, Saidie came and fell at hisknees, taking his dusty hands and kissing them.Hamilton lifted her up, and held her a little from him, that hemight feast his eyes on the delicate beautiful carving of the lips,and on the great velvet eyes, soft, round throat, and breastsswelling so warmly lovely under the transparent gauze.Then he crushed her up in his arms close to his breast, and carriedher to their own room with the golden and green chicks all roundit, where the servants did not come without a summons. The garlandshe had twisted on her head smelt sweetly of roses, and the massesof her silky hair of sandal-wood; her soft lips, that knew so wellinstinctively the art of kissing, were on his; the warm, tenderarms clasped his neck. All the way that he carried her she murmuredlittle words of passion in his ear.After dinner the servants carried chairs for them into theverandah, with a small table laden with drinks and sweetmeats, thatthey might sit and watch the moon rising behind the palms in thecompound, and see the hot silver light pour slowly through theirexquisite branches and foliage."How did you amuse yourself all day?" he asked her as she sat onhis knee, his arm round the flexible, supple waist pulsating underthe silky web of her tunic."I was so happy. I had so much to do, so much to think of," sheanswered, gazing back into his eyes bent upon her, and eagerlydrawing in their fire. "I wandered in the compound and made garlandafter garland, then I sang to my rabab and practised my dancing. Inthe heat I went in and slept on my lord's bed dreaming of him--ah!how I dreamt of him!" She broke off sighing, and those sighs fannedthe blazing fires in the man's veins."You were quite contented, then, with your day?""How could I not be contented when I had my lord to think about,his love of last night, his love of the coming night?"Hamilton sighed and smiled at the same time."English wives need more than that to make them content," heanswered."English wives," repeated Saidie, with her laugh like the sound ofa golden bell; "what do they know of love?""Not much certainly, I think," replied Hamilton.For a moment the vision of a thin blonde face, with its expressionof sour discontent, rose before him. What had he not given thatwoman--what had she not demanded? Extravagant clothes to deck outher tall lean body, a carriage to drive her here and there, amansion to live in, all the money he could gain by constantwork--these things she demanded because she was his wife, and hehad given them, and yet she was always discontented, simply becauseshe was one of those women who do not know desire nor the delightof it. This one had nothing but that divine gift, and it made allher life joy."Dance for me now in the cool," murmured Hamilton in the littlefine curved ear with the rose-bud just over it.Saidie slipped off his knee, and fastening the little gilt link ather neck more securely, drew her soft filmy garment more closely toher, and commenced to dance before him in the screened verandah,with the hot moonlight, filtered through the delicate tracery; ofinnumerable leaves falling on her smooth, warm-tinted body.To please him, to please him, her lord, her owner, her king: it wasthe one passion in her thoughts, and it flowed through every limband muscle, glowed in her eyes, quivered on her parted lips, andmade each movement a miracle of sweet sinuous grace.The soft, hot night passed minute by minute, the scents of athousand flowers mingled together in the still violet air. Somewhite night-moths came and fluttered round the exquisite form onwhose rounded contours the light played so softly, and Hamilton layback in his chair, silent, absorbed, hardly drawing his breaththrough his lungs, shaken by the nervous beating of his heart.Motionless he lay there, almost breathless, for the wine of lifewas in all his veins, mounting to his head, intoxicating him."I am very tired; may I stop now?" came at last in a low murmurfrom the curved lips so sweetly smiling at him, and the whole softbody drooped like a flower with fatigue. Hamilton opened his armswide. She saw how the fresh colour glowed in the handsome cheek,how his splendid neck swelled as the red deer's in November, howthe dark eyes blazed upon her."Come to me," he commanded, and she flew to his arms as thelove-bird flies upward to her mate in the pomegranate tree.CHAPTER IIIFor three months Hamilton and Saidie lived in the white bungalow inthe palms, and drank of the wine of life together, and were happyin the overwhelming intoxication it gives.For three months Saidie lived there, never going beyond theprecincts of the house and the palace of flowers that was thecompound.Why should she leave them? What had she to gain by going out intothe dusty way? What had she to seek? Her garden of Eden, herParadise, was here. She was too wise to go beyond its limits.Pedlars and merchants of all sorts brought their best and richestwares to her, and Hamilton sat by her in the verandah, commandingher to buy all that pleased her, though she protested she needednothing.Jewels for her neck, and gold anklets and bracelets, and robes andsweetmeats were laid out before her. Only the best of the bazaarwas brought, and of this again only the best was chosen. And whenHamilton was not there she walked from room to room singing,clothed in purple silken gauze, with his jewels blazing on herbreast, his kisses still burning on her lips. Then she would takeher rabab and play to the listening flowers, or practise herdancing, the source of his pleasure, or lie in the noonday heat onthe edge of the bubbling spring that rose up in the moss under theboughain-villia and look towards the East and dream of hishome-coming. What did she want more?Hamilton now lived the enchanted life of one who is wholly absorbedin a secret passion. He was wise--more wise than men generallyare--and made no effort to parade his treasure. This wonderfulexotic, this flower of happiness, that bloomed so vividly in thedark, secluded recesses of his heart, how did he know that thedestructive heat and light of publicity might not fade and searits marvellous petals? He told no one of his life; took no one outinto the desert with him, to the bungalow among the palms.He was away a great deal. His work and certain social dutiesclaimed a large part of his day, and during all that time he had toleave her alone with her flowers, but this gave him no anxiety. Itwas not a dangerous experiment, as it always is to leave a Europeanwoman alone. He knew that Saidie, the Oriental, would spend thewhole time dreaming of him, longing for him, singing to the flowersof him, talking to her women-attendants of him, filling the wholegarden and house with his image till the longed-for moment of hisreturn.And to Hamilton, full of unspoiled life and vigour, this security,this certainty of her complete fidelity was a wondrous charm.Unlike a man of jaded passions, who requires his love to beconstantly stimulated by the fear of imminent loss, Hamilton, fullof unused strength, and thirsty after the joy of life, now that thecup was offered him, drank of it naturally and with ecstasy,needing no salt and bitter olives of jealousy between thedraughts.For years he had longed for love and happiness: at last he hadfound both, and with simple, uncavilling thankfulness he claspedthem to his breast and held them there, content.Saturday and Sunday were their great days. Hamilton left the officeat two on Saturday afternoon, and was back at the bungalow by five.They went to bed early that night, and rose on the Sunday morningwith the first glimmer of dawn. Everything would be preparedovernight for a day's excursion and picnic in the desert, whichSaidie particularly delighted in.The great brown camel, fat and sleek like all Hamilton's animals,and with an enormous weight of rich hair on his supple neck, wouldbe kneeling waiting for them below in the dewy compound, while theearly tender light stole softly through the palms; and they wouldmount and go swinging out through the great open spaces of thedesert, full of delicate white light, towards the sister-oasis ofDirampir, where masses of cocoanut palms grew round a set ofsprings, and waved their branches joyfully as they drew in the saltnourishment of the air from the amethystine sea not fifty milesdistant.Into the shelter of these palms they would come as the first greatgolden wave of light from the climbing sun broke over the desert,and, descending from the camel, walk about in the groves by thespring, and select a place for boiling their kettle and havingtheir breakfast. The long ride in the keen air of the morning gavethem great appetites, and they enjoyed it in the whole joyousbeauty of the scene round them. The palm branches over them grewgold against the laughing blue of the sky, a thousand shafts ofsunlight pierced through the fan-like tracery, the golden oriolesat play darted, chasing each other from bough to bough, the springbubbled its cool musical notes beside them, and the sense of theblighting heat of the ravening desert round them seemed toaccentuate the beauty of the peace and shade in the oasis.Saidie enjoyed these days beyond everything, and would sit singingat the foot of a palm, weaving a garland of white clematis forHamilton's handsome head as it rested on her lap.No English people ever came to the oasis; as a matter of fact, theEnglish generally do avoid the best and most beautiful spots in ornear an Indian station; but the place was greatly beloved by thenatives who came there to doze and dream, play, sing, and weavegarlands in the usual harmless manner in which a native takes hispleasure. Looking at them standing or sitting in their harmoniousgroups against a background of golden light and delicate shade,Hamilton often thought how well this scene compared with that ofthe Britisher taking a holiday--Hampstead Heath, for instance, withits noisy drunkenness, its spirit of hateful spite, its ill-usedanimals, its loathsome language. The Oriental endeavours to enjoyhimself, and his method is generally peaceful and poetic: thesinging of songs, the weaving of garlands, and the letting alone ofothers. The Briton's idea of enjoying himself is extremely simple;it consists solely in annoying his neighbours.To see a handsome English Sahib here was to the habitualfrequenters of the oasis something rather remarkable, but thesepeople are early taught the custody of the eyes and to mind theirown business. Therefore Hamilton and Saidie were not troubled byoffensive stares, or in any other way. All there were free,gathered to enjoy themselves, each man in his own way; and thenatives in their gay colours added to the beauty, withoutdisturbing the peace of the scene, much as the bright-plumagedbirds that flitted from tree to tree absorbed in their own affairs.How Hamilton enjoyed those long, calm, golden hours--the goldenhours of Asia, so full of the enchantment of rich light and colour,soft beauty before the eyes, sweet scent of the jessamine in thenostrils, the warbling of birds, and Saidie's love songs in hisears!Not till the glorious rose of the sunset diffused itself softly inthe luminous sky, and all the desert round them grew pink, and theshadows of the palms long in the oasis, and the great planets abovethem burst blazing into view into the still rose-hued sky, did theyrise from the side of the spring and begin to think of theirhomeward ride. And what a delight it was that night ride homethrough the majestic silence of the desert, where their own hearts'beating and the soft footfall of the camel were the only sounds!the wild flash of planet and star, and sometimes the soft glimmerof the rising moon, their only light! Eros, the god of passion,seated with them on the camel, their only companion!To Saidie, cradled in his arms, looking upwards to his face aboveher, its beauty distinct in the soft light, feeling his heartbeating against her side, it seemed as if her happiness was toogreat for the human frame to bear, as if it must dissolve, meltinto nothingness, against his breast, and her spirit pass into thegreat desert solitudes, dispersed, almost annihilated, in the agonyand ecstasy of love.Week after week passed lightly by in their brilliant setting, thehours on their winged feet danced by, and these two livedindependent of all the world, wrapped up in their own intimate joy.One morning, just as he was about to leave the bungalow, he heardSaidie's voice calling him back. He turned and saw her smilingface hanging over the stair-rail above him. He remounted thestairs, and she drew him into their room. Her face was radiant, hereyes blazed with light as she looked at him."I have something to tell you, Sahib! I could not let you gowithout saying it. Only think! is not Allah good to me? I am to bethe mother of the Sahib's child," and she fell on her knees,kissing his hands in a passion of joy. Hamilton stood for themoment silent. He was startled, unprepared for her words, unused tothe wild joy with which the Oriental woman hails a coming life.Her message carried a certain shock to him: it augured change; andhis happiness had been so perfect, so absolute, what would change,any change, even if wrought by the divine Hand itself, mean to himbut loss?Saidie, terrified at his silence, looked up at him wildly."What have I done? Is not my lord pleased?" Her accent was one ofthe acutest fear.Hamilton bent down and raised her to his breast."Dearest one, light of my soul, how could I not be pleased?" andhe kissed her many times on the lips, and on the soft upper armthat pressed his throat, and on her neck, till even she wassatisfied."Come and sit with me for a moment that I may tell you all," shesaid. Hamilton sat beside her on the bed, and she told him manythings that an Englishwoman would never say, nor would it enterinto her mind to conceive them.Hamilton was greatly moved as he sat listening. The wonderfulimagery, the vivid language in which she clothed her pure joyousthoughts appealed to his own poetic, artistic habit of mind.On his way across the desert to the city, Hamilton pondered deeplyover the news and the girl's unaffected joy. Since all thosewhispered confidences poured into his ear while they sat side byside on the bed, the throb of jealousy he had first felt at herwords had passed away. Saidie had made it so clear to him that herjoy was not so great at being the mother of a child as that she wasto be the mother of _his_ child, and similarly Hamilton felt inall his being a curious thrill at the thought that his child washers, that this new life was created in and of her life that hadbecome so infinitely dear to him.He was glad now that his wife had refused to have a child. Thebitter pain he had felt then, those years ago, how little he hadthought it was to be the parent of this present joy. Now the womanhe loved as he had loved no other would be the one to bear hischild. Still the thought of the suffering the mother would gothrough depressed his sensitive mind, and the idea of the risk toher life that came suddenly into his brain made him turn white tothe lips as he rode in the hot sunlight. Such intense happiness ashe had known for the last three months can turn a brave man into acoward. For a moment he faced the horrid thought that had come tohim--Saidie dead! And the whole brilliant plain, laughing sky, anddancing sunlight and waving palms became black to him. To go backto that dreary existence of nothingness of his former life, afteronce having known the delight that this bright, eager, ardentlove, these delicate little clinging hands had made for him, wouldbe impossible."No," he murmured to himself, "if she goes, then it's a snuff outfor me too. I have never cared for life except as she has made itfor me."And the cloud rolled off him a little as he met the idea of his owndeath. Besides, Saidie had declared so positively that she couldcome to no harm, that it would all be pure delight, that pain andsuffering could not exist for her in such a matter since she wouldbe all joy in making him this gift, that gradually he grew calmeras he thought over her words."But I didn't want any change," he burst out a little later,talking to the still golden air round him. "Confound it! I wasperfectly happy. How impossible it is to keep anything as it is inthis world! All our actions drag in upon us their consequences sofast! There is no getting away from this horrible change, noenjoying one's happiness peacefully when one has obtained it."When he arrived at his office in the city he found that a farheavier cloud had arisen on his horizon than that created bySaidie's words. The English mail was in, and a long thin envelope,impressed with a much-hated handwriting, faced him on the top ofthe pile of his correspondence as he entered.He picked it up and opened it.     "DEAR FRANK,--You often used to invite me to come to India,     and I have really at last made up my mind to. I am coming out     by next month's boat to stay with you for a time. I have been     very much run down in health lately, and my doctor says a     sea-voyage and six months in India will be first-rate for me.     I hope you have a nice comfortable house and good servants.       --Yours affectionately, JANE."Hamilton stared at the letter savagely as he put it down before himon the table, a sort of grim smile breaking slowly over his face.He felt convinced that in some way his wife had learned of hisnew-found happiness, and that had given birth to her sudden desireto visit India after twenty years of persistent refusal to do so.He sat motionless for a long time, then stretched out his hand foran English telegraph form and wrote on it--     "Regret unable to receive you now. Defer visit. FRANK."He did not for one moment think that his wife would obey hisinjunction, or that his wire would have the least effect on her;but he wished to have a good ground to stand on when she arrived,and he declined to receive her. His teeth set for a moment as hethought of the interview."This is a sort of wind-up day of my happiness," he muttered, as hetook his place at the office table. "Well, I suppose no one couldexpect such pleasure as I have had these last three months tocontinue; but, whatever happens, Saidie and I will stick together."He sat musing for a moment, staring with unseeing eyes at the pileof work in front of him."Saidie, my Saidie! I shall never part from her; therefore I cannever part from my happiness." He smiled a little at the play onthe words, and then commenced his day's labours.That evening, when he returned, Saidie noticed at once thedepression in his usually gay, bright manner. When they were aloneat dinner she laid her hand on his."What has darkened the light of my lord's countenance?" she askedsoftly.Hamilton drew from his pocket his wife's letter, and laid it besideher plate."Can you read that, Saidie? If so, you will know all about it."The girl leaned one elbow on the table and bent over the letter,studying it. She had been trying hard to improve herself in thelanguage, of which she knew already something, and with Orientalquickness, had acquired much in the past three months. She made outthe sense now easily enough."This lady is a wife of yours?" she said quickly, with a swiftupward glance at him, when she had finished reading the letter.Hamilton laughed a little."She was my wife till I saw you, Saidie. No one is my wife now, norever will be, but you."A soft glow of supreme pleasure and pride lighted up Saidie's greatlustrous eyes. She bent her head and put her soft lips to hishand."Have you forbidden this wife to come to you?" she asked after aminute."Yes, I have; but she will come all the same. English wives thinkit foolish to obey their husbands."He laughed sardonically, and Saidie looked bewildered andhorrified.       *       *       *       *       *A month later, a long, lean woman sat in a deck chair on board anIndian liner as it crossed the enchanted waters of the IndianOcean. Enchanted, for surely it is some magician's touch that makesthese waters such a rich and glorious blue! How they roll sogently, full of majestic beauty, crested with sunlight, under theships they carry so lightly! How the gold light leaps over them,how the azure sky above laughs down to their tranquil mirror! howthe gleaming flying-fish rise in their glinting cloud, whirl overthem, and then softly disappear into their mysterious embrace!The long, lean woman saw none of the magic round her. Her dull,boiled-looking eyes gazed through the soft sunlight without seeingit. In her lap lay a thin foreign letter and a telegram, togetherwith a copy of "Anna Lombard" that she was reading with thestrongest disapproval. She picked up the letter and glanced throughit again, though she knew it nearly by heart, especially onepassage:     "Your husband is leading such a life here! He has built a     wonderful white marble palace in the desert for an Egyptian     dancing-girl. They say it's a sort of Antony and Cleopatra     over again, and she goes about loaded with jewels and golden     chains. I don't know if you are getting your allowance     regularly, but I should think your husband is pretty well     ruining himself. I never saw a man so changed. He used to be     so melancholy, but now he is as bright as possible, and looks     so well and handsome. I hear the woman is expecting a child,     and they are both as pleased as they can be. I hear all about     it, as our cook's cousin is sister to the ayah your husband     hired for the woman, and my ayah gets it all from our cook. I     really should, my dear, come out and look into the matter, as     after a time he will probably want to stop sending home his     pay."The thin sheet fell into the woman's lap again, and she seemed toponder deeply. Then she read Hamilton telegram again--"Regret unable to receive you now. Defer visit," and a disagreeablelaugh broke from her thick, colourless lips."I will go out and see her first," she thought, smoothing down witha large, bony hand the folds of her rather prim white cambricdress. She was a very stupid woman, and not a passionate one;therefore the agony of pain of a loving, jealous wife was quiteunknown to her. But she was malignant, as such people usually are.She loved making other people uncomfortable in a general way, andtaking away from them anything she could that they valued. She alsofelt a peculiar curiosity such as those who cannot feel passionthemselves have usually about the intense happiness it gives toothers. The picture of this other woman, who had found joyapparently in the arms she herself years ago had thrust aside,interested her profoundly. She told herself that this Egyptianloved Hamilton's money, but some instinct within her held her backfrom believing this.The little bit about the child went deeply into her mind. Itrested there like an arrow-head, and her thoughts grew round it.When the ship came into port a week or two later, Mrs. Hamiltonwas one of the first passengers to land, and after carefulenquiries and well-bestowed tips she was expeditiously conveyedby ticker-gharry[1] and sedan chair across the desert to thebungalow at Deira. She was considerably pleased on seeing thatthe white marble palace resolved itself into an ordinary whitebungalow, but the garden, was unutterably lovely, and, as she sawin a moment, represented something quite unusual in cost andcare.[Footnote 1: Hired carriage.]It was just high noon when she arrived, and she thankfully escapedfrom the suffocating heat and glare of the desert into the coolshaded hall, and gave her card with a throb of spiteful elation tothe butler.The Oriental servant read the name, and hurried with the card tohis mistress's room. On hearing of the arrival of the Mem-Sahib,Saidie descended from the upper room, where she had been lying inthe noonday heat, and, pushing aside the great golden chick thatswung before the drawing-room entrance, went in.Her dress was of the most exquisite Indian muslin that Hamiltoncould obtain, heavily and wonderfully embroidered in gold, andpeacocks' eyes of vivid deep blue and green; her feet were bare,for Hamilton, in his revolt from English ways, had kept up Orientaltraditions as far as possible in the clothing of his new mistress,and weighty anklets of solid gold gleamed beneath the border of herskirt. Round the perfect column of her neck, full and stately asthe red deer's, were twisted great strings of pearls, throwingtheir pale irridescent greenish hue onto the velvet skin. Above thesplendour of her dress rose the regal and lovely face, its delicatecarving and the marvel of its dark, flashing, enquiring eyesvividly striking in the clear mellow light of the room.Mrs. Hamilton, dressed in a plain, grey alpaca dress, rather hotand dusty after her long drive, sat on one of the low divansawaiting her. As Saidie entered, the glory of her youth and beautystruck upon the seated woman like a heavy blow, under which shestarted to her feet and stood for a second, involuntarilyshrinking."Salaam, be seated," murmured Saidie, indicating a fauteuil nearthe one on which she sank herself.Mrs. Hamilton came forward, her hands closing and unclosingspasmodically in their grey silk gloves, and sat down again, hereyes riveted on the other's face."Do you know who I am?" she said at last in a stifled voice.Saidie smiled faintly; one of those liquid, lingering smiles thatmade Hamilton's heaven."Yes, I know; you are Mem Sahib Hamilton, the first, the oldwife.".Saidie, according to her own Eastern ideas, was in the position ofa superior receiving an unfortunate inferior. She was the latestacquired--the darling, the reigning queen--confronted with the poorcast-off, old, unattractive first wife; and being of a natureequally noble as the type of her beauty, she felt it incumbent onher, in such a situation, to treat the unfortunate with everyconsideration, gentleness, and tenderness.The British matron's views of the relative positions of first andsubsequent wives differs, however, from Saidie's, and Mrs.Hamilton's face grew purple as she heard Saidie's answer, and somefaint comprehension of Saidie's view was borne in upon her."Where is my husband?" she demanded fiercely."The Sahib is in the city to-day," returned Saidie calmly. Howodious they were, these Englishwomen, with their short skirts andbig boots, and red, hot faces, with great black straw houses overthem, and their curt manners, and the impertinent way they spoke oftheir lords!"When will he be back?" pursued the other, sharply.Saidie glanced towards the clock."In a few hours; perhaps more. He returns at sunset.""And what do you do all day, shut up by yourself?" questioned hervisitor, with a sort of contemptuous surprise."I think of him," returned Saidie, quite simply, with a sort ofproud pleasure that made the Englishwoman stare incredulously."Silly little fool!" she ejaculated, with a harsh, disdainfullaugh."Does he give you all those things, and dress you up like that?"she added, staring at the pearls on Saidie's neck."He has given me everything I have," she replied, seriously.That Hamilton was wasting his substance on another went home farmore keenly to his lawful wife than that he was wasting his love onthe same. She got up, and went close to the girl, with a face offury."They are all mine! I should like to drag them off you! Do youunderstand that an Englishman's money belongs to his wife, and _I_am his wife? You! What are you? He belongs to me, and, whatever youmay think, I can take him from you. By our laws he must come backto me."Saidie rose and faced the angry woman unmoved."No law on earth can make a man stay with a woman he does notlove," she said calmly, "nor take him from one he does. You mustknow little, or you would know that love is stronger than all law.I give you leave to withdraw. Salaam."And she herself moved slowly backwards towards the hanging chick,passed through it, and was gone, leaving the Englishwoman alone inthe room.       *       *       *       *       *Three hours later Hamilton, sitting in his own private office,surrounded with papers, started suddenly as he heard a well-knownand hated voice say, outside the door."Thanks, I'll go in myself."The next minute the door had opened and his wife stood before him.He sat in silence, regarding her."Well, Frank, I suppose you were expecting me? You saw the boatcame in, doubtless. You don't look particularly pleased to see me!"There was only one chair in the room, and Hamilton remained seated.His wife stood in front of him."I do not know of any reason why I should be pleased, do you?" hesaid calmly, gazing at her with eyes full of concentratedhostility."No, considering you've got that black woman up at your house, Idon't suppose you do want your wife back very badly; but I've cometo stay, my dear fellow, some time, so you've got to make the bestof it.""You will not stay with me," returned Hamilton quietly. His facewas very white, his eyes had become black as they looked at her.One hand played idly with a paper-knife on his table."And a nice scandal there'll be when I go to stay at the hotelhere, and it's known I'm your wife, and you are living out in thedesert with a woman from the bazaar!""The fear of scandal has long since ceased to regulate my life,"answered Hamilton calmly. "Be good enough to make your interviewshort; I have a great deal of work to-day.""You are a devil!" replied the woman, white, too, now with impotentrage, "to desert your own wife for that filthy native woman. I--"But Hamilton had sprung to his feet; his face was blazing; heseized his wife's wrists in both hands."Be quiet," he said, in a low tone of such fury that she coweredbeneath it. "One word more and I shall _kill_ you; do youunderstand?"Then he raised one hand and brought it down on his gong. Instantlytwo stalwart, bronze giants, his chuprassis, entered the room andstood by the door."Take this woman out, and keep her out," he said to them. "Neverlet her in again. She annoys me."The chuprassis put their hands to their foreheads, and thenimpassively approached the Englishwoman. She looked at her husbandwildly as they took her arms."Frank! you will not surely--" she expostulated. "Your own wife!"and she struggled to release her arms.Hamilton waved his hand, and the natives forced her to the door.For a moment she seemed inclined to scream and struggle. Then herface changed. A look of intense malevolence came over it. Shewalked between the men quietly to the door. As she passed throughit, she looked back."You and she shall regret this," she said. Then the door shut, andHamilton was alone.He sat down, collapsed in his chair. Oh, how could he free himselffrom this millstone at his neck? What relief could he gainanywhere? To what power appeal? He could keep her out of his house,out of his office, but not out of his life. She had come here withthe deliberate intention of wrecking that, and she would succeedprobably, for she would have the blind, hideous force ofconventional morality on her side. She would destroy his life--thatlife till lately so valueless to him; that dreary stretch madebarren so many years by her hateful influence, but which, in spiteof it, at Saidie's touch, had now bloomed into a garden of flowers.The thought of Saidie strengthened him. It was true that his wifewould probably succeed in breaking up his life here from theconventional and social point of view, and he would be obliged mostlikely to give up his appointment; but he had a small independentincome, and on that he and Saidie could still live together. Theywould go to Ceylon or to Malabar. Perhaps also he could make moneyotherwise than officially. Wherever he went his wife would probablypursue him, intent on making his life a misery. Still, Fortunemight favour him; he and Saidie might in time reach some corner ofthe world where their remorseless tracker would lose trace of them.Perhaps to go to England at once and obtain a legal separationwould be the best plan, but then it was winter in England now, andhe could not with advantage take Saidie to England in winter, forfear his exotic Eastern flower would fade in the northern winds.His thoughts wandered from point to point, and the minutes passedunheeded. His papers lay untouched, scattered on the floor. Thechuprassi brought in from time to time a note, laid it on the tableand withdrew. Hamilton noticed nothing; he sat still, thinking.Meanwhile Mrs. Hamilton had been driven to the hotel, where sheengaged very modest quarters and ordered luncheon. While waitingfor this she went out into the balcony before her windows, andlooked with gloomy eyes into the sunny, laughing splendour of theEastern afternoon. At the side of the hotel was a luxuriant garden,and the palms and sycamores growing there threw a light shade intothe sunny street just below her window; the sky overhead stretchedits eternal Eastern blue, and the pigeons wheeled joyfully in andout the eaves in the clear sparkling air, or descended to the poolsin the garden to bathe, with incessant cooing. Up and down theroad passed the white bullocks with their laden carts, and thegaily-dressed Turkish sweet-meat sellers went by crooning out songsdescriptive of their wares, pausing under the shade of the gardento look up at the English Mem-Sahib in the balcony. She leant herarms on the rail, and looked out on the gay scene with unseeingeyes. "Beast!" she muttered at intervals, and her hard-lined facecrimsoned and paled by turns.When her luncheon came in she returned to the room, took off herhat and looked in the glass. The narrow, selfish, petty emotions oftwenty years were written all over her face in deep, hideous lines.The mass of yellow hair, newly-dyed, looked glaringly youthful andincongruous above it.Burning with a sense of malevolent discontent and misery, sheturned from the glass and hurried through her luncheon, thenordered it to be cleared away and writing materials to be broughtin, and set herself with grim feverishness to the concoction of along letter to the Commissioner. In it Hamilton's twenty years ofpatient fidelity, through which time he had regularly transmittedto her half his pay year by year were naturally not mentioned; herown refusal to live with him, her incessant demands for more money,her extravagance, her long, whining letters to him, her debts, herown life in town were, of course, also suppressed. In the lettershe figured as the ardent, tender, anxious wife, arriving to findher abandoned husband wasting his substance on a black mistress.The visit to the cruel tyrant in his office was long dwelt on, andthe whole closed with a pathetic appeal to the Commissioner to usehis influence to restore her dearest boy to her arms. It was not abad letter from the artist's and the liar's standpoint, and sheread it through with a glow of satisfaction, sealed it up with abaleful smile of triumph, and then sounded the gong."Take this at once to the Commissioner Sahib," she said, handingthe note to the servant, "and let me have some tea; also you canorder me a carriage. I shall want to drive afterwards."When the tea came, she thoroughly enjoyed it after her virtuouslabours, and in the cool of the evening drove out to see the city.       *       *       *       *       *That evening at dinner, seated at their table, laden with flowers,with the light from the heavy Burmese silver lamps falling on herlovely glowing face, and round bangle-laden arms, Saidie toldHamilton of the visit of the white Mem-Sahib. His face darkened andhis lips set."So she came here, did she? Did she frighten you? attempt to hurtyou?""Oh, no," returned Saidie; "not at all. Naturally she is very hurt,very sorry; no wonder she longs after the Sahib, and wishes to betaken back to his harem. I was very sorry for her. It is quitenatural she should be jealous, of course," and Saidie rested onesoft, silken skinned elbow on the table and leaned across theflowers, and her half-filled wine-glass, looking with tender liquideyes earnestly at the face of her lord."The Sahib is so wonderful, so beautiful, so far above other men,"she murmured, gazing upon him. "It is no wonder she is unhappy."Hamilton smiled a little, looking back at her. He had indeed asingularly handsome face, with its straight, noble features andwarm colour, and as he smiled the breast of the Eastern girlheaved; her heart seemed to rush out to him."Ah, Saidie! you do not understand English wives," he said gently,with a curious melancholy in his voice. "Love and worship such asyou give me they think shameful and shocking. To love a man forhimself, for his face, for his body is degrading. They are so pure,they love him only for his purse. They tell him to take his passionto dancing-girls like you. They hate to bear him children. Theylike to live in his house, be clothed at his expense, ride in hiscarriage, but they care little to sleep in his arms."Saidie regarded him steadfastly, with eyes ever growing wider asshe listened."I do not understand ..." she murmured at last, clasping both soft,supple hands across her breast, as if trying to mould herself intothis new belief; "it is so hard to comprehend.... Surely it mustbe right to love one's lord, to bear him sons, to please him, tomake him happy every hour, every minute of the day and night.""Right?" returned Hamilton passionately, getting up from his seatand coming over to her. "Of course it is right! love such as yoursis a divine gift to man, straight from the hands of God." He leanedhis burning hands heavily on the delicately-moulded shoulders,looking down into her upturned face. How exquisite it was! its finestraight nose, its marvellously-carved mouth and short upper lip,its round, full chin, and midnight eyes beneath their greatarching, sweeping brows!"That woman is a fiend, one of the unnatural creatures our wretchedEuropean civilisation has made only to destroy the lives of men.Don't let us speak of her! never let us think of her! She isnothing to me. You are my world, my all. If she drives us away fromhere, there are other parts of the world for us. Separate us shenever shall. Come! why should we waste our time even mentioning hername. Come with me into our garden. Darling! darling!"He stooped over her, and on her lips pressed those kisses so longrefused, uncared for by one woman, so priceless to this one, andalmost lifted Saidie from the chair. She laughed the sweet lowlaughter of the Oriental woman, and went with him eagerly towardsthe verandah, and out into the compound where the roses slept inthe warm silver light.       *       *       *       *       *For two days nothing happened. Hamilton went as usual to his officefor the day. At four he left, and, mounting his camel, went intothe desert to the oasis in the palms.On the third day he received a summons from the Commissioner, andwent up to his house in the afternoon. His heart seethed with ragewithin him, but except for an unusual pallor in the clear warmskin, his face showed nothing as he entered the large, imposingdrawing-room.The Commissioner was a short, pompous little man, ratherovershadowed by his grim raw-boned wife, and had under her strictguidance and training developed a stern admiration for conventionalvirtue, particularly in regard to conjugal relations. He rose andbowed as Hamilton entered, but did not offer to shake hands.Hamilton waited, erect, silent."Sit down, Mr. Hamilton." Hamilton sat down. "Er--I--ah--havereceived what I may term a painful--yes, a very painfulcommunication, and er--I may say at once it refers to you and yourconcerns in a most distressing manner--most distressing."The Commissioner coughed and waited. Hamilton remained silent. TheCommissioner fidgeted, crossed his knees, uncrossed them again,then turned on him suddenly. The Indian climate is trying to thetemper; it means many pegs, and small control of the passions."Damn you, sir!" he broke out fiercely. "What the devil do you meanby keeping a black woman in your house, and sending your wife tothe hotel here?"He was purple and furious; in his hand he crushed Mrs. Hamilton'sbeautiful composition."She tells me you called in natives to throw her out of youroffice: it's disgraceful! Upon my word it is; it's scandalous! Andyou sent her to the hotel! I never heard of such a thing!""Mrs. Hamilton came out uninvited, in defiance of my expresswishes, and on her arrival I told her she could not stay with me,"returned Hamilton quietly. "Whether she went to the hotel or not, Idon't know.""But your wife, damn it all, your wife, has a right to stay withyou if she chooses; naturally she would come to you, and you can'tturn her out in this way.""She has long ago forfeited all rights as my wife," repliedHamilton calmly, in a low tone, with so much weight in it that theCommissioner looked at him keenly."Why don't you get a divorce or a separation then?" he askedabruptly. "Do the thing decently--not have her out like this, andmake a scandal all over the station.""I know of no grounds for a divorce," returned Hamilton. "There aremany ways of breaking the marriage vows other than infidelity. Imarried Mrs. Hamilton twenty years ago, and for those twenty yearsshe has practically refused to live with me. For twenty years Ihave remitted half my income to her every year. During that time Ihave many times asked her to join me here, sought a reconciliationalways to be refused. Recently I found another interest; the momentmy wife discovered this, she came out with the sole purpose ofannoying me. I have come to the conclusion that twenty years'fidelity to a woman without reward is enough. I shall not alter mylife now to suit Mrs. Hamilton."The Commissioner was silent. He was quite sure Hamilton wasspeaking the truth, and in reality, in the absence of Mrs.Commissioner, he felt all his sympathies go with him. But hiswife's careful training and his official position put other wordsthan his mind dictated into his mouth."Well, well," he said at last, "we can't go into all that. You andyour wife must arrange your matters somehow between you. But therecan't be a scandal like this going on. You, a married man, livingwith a native woman, and your wife out here at the hotel! Somethingmust be done to make things look all right--must be done," and heknitted his brows, looking crossly at Hamilton from under them.Hamilton shrugged his shoulders."You'd better give up this native woman," snapped theCommissioner.Hamilton smiled. His was such an expressive face, it told moreclearly the feelings than most impassive English faces, and therewas that in the smile that held the Commissioner's gaze; and thetwo men sat staring at each other in silence.After some moments the Commissioner spoke again but his tone wasdifferent."Hamilton, you know we all have to make sacrifices to our officialposition, to public opinion, to social usage. Ah! what a Molochthat is that we've created, it devours our best. Yes ... a Moloch!"he muttered half to himself, gazing on the floor."Still, it's there, and we all suffer equally in turn. I know whatit is myself. I have been through it all." He stopped, gazingfixedly at the beautiful crimson roses in the pattern of his Wiltoncarpet. What visions swept before him of gleaming eyes and sweepingbrows, ruthlessly blotted out by a large, raw-boned figure and faceof aggressive chastity. "I am sorry for you, but there it is;whatever the rights of the case, you can't make a scandal likethis.""I am ready to resign my post if necessary," returned Hamilton; "Ihave enough to live on without my pay."The Commissioner started, and looked at him."Is she so handsome as that?" he asked in a low tone, leaning alittle forward. Mrs. Commissioner was not there, and he wasforgetting officialdom.Hamilton hesitated a moment. Then he drew from his pocket aphotograph, taken by himself, of Saidie standing amongst herflowers.The beautiful Eastern face, the lovely, youthful, sinuous figure,veiled in its slight, transparent drapery, taken by an artist and alover in the clear, actinic Indian light, made an exquisite work ofart. It lay in the hand of the Commissioner, and he gazed on it,remembering his long-past youth.After a long time Hamilton broke the silence."Now, you know," he said at last, "why I am ready to resign my postrather than resign _that_; and it is not only her beauty thatcharms me, it is her devotion, her love.... Do you know, white orblack, superior or inferior, these two women are not to bementioned in one breath. The one you see there is a woman, theother is a fiend."The Commissioner tried to look shocked, but failed; the smooth cardstill lay in his hand, the lovely image impressed on it smiled upat him."I don't know but what you are right," he muttered savagely as hehanded it back to Hamilton. "These wives, damn 'em, seem to have noother mission but to make a man uncomfortable."He got up and began to pace the room. He seemed to have forgottenHamilton and the official _role_ he himself had started to play. Heseemed absorbed in his own thoughts--perhaps memories. Hamilton satstill, gazing at the card.Half-an-hour later the interview came to an end. Hamilton went awayto his office with a light heart, and a smile on his lips. TheCommissioner had given him some of his own reminiscences, andHamilton had sympathised. The two men had drifted insensibly ontocommon ground, and the Commissioner finally had promised to helpHamilton as far as he could. Hamilton was pleased. That he hadmerely been twisting a piece of straw, that would be bent intoquite another shape when Mrs. Commissioner took it in hand, did notfor the moment occur to him. That night Saidie danced for him inthe moonlight, and afterwards ran from him swiftly, playing athide-and-seek amongst the roses laughing, inviting his pursuit. Inand out behind the great clumps of boughain-villia gleamed thelovely form, with hair unbound falling like a mantle to the waist.Through the pomegranate bushes the laughing face looked out at him,then swiftly vanished as he approached, and next a laugh and aflash of warm skin drew him to the bed of lilies where he overtookher, and they fell laughing on the mossy bank together. Weariedwith dancing and running and laughter, she sank into his armsgladly, as Eve in the garden of Eden."Let us sleep here," she murmured, looking up to the palm branchesover them defined against the lustrous sky."See how the lilies sleep round us!"And that night they slept out in the moonlight.CHAPTER IVA month had gone by, and during that month, except for the time hewas with Saidie in the bungalow, Hamilton, had he been less of aphilosopher, would have been extremely uncomfortable.The Commissioner's wife had completely and entirely espoused thecause of Mrs. Hamilton, and had insisted on her leaving the hoteland coming to stay with her. Everywhere that the Commissioner'swife went, riding or driving, Mrs. Hamilton accompanied her; andwhenever he met the two women, his wife threw him a mild,reproachful glance of martyred virtue, while the Commissioner'swife glared upon him in stony wrath.Hamilton took no notice of either glance, but passed them as ifneither existed. The Commissioner looked miserably guilty wheneverhe encountered Hamilton's amused, penetrating eyes, and avoidedhim as much as possible. The Commissioner's house was completelyshut to him; he never approached it now except on officialbusiness, and nearly every house in the station followed itsexample. The story of Mrs. Hamilton's woes and wrongs had spreadall over the community, and proved a theme of delightful andnever-ending interest to all the ladies of the station. They wereunanimous in supporting her. Not one voice was raised in favour ofHamilton. He was a monster, a heartless libertine, given over toall sorts of terrible vices. Tales of the fearful doings in thedesert bungalow, where Hamilton and Saidie lived the gay, bright,joyous life of two human beings, happily mated, as Nature intendedall things to be, spread over the station, and the stony stare ofthe women upon Hamilton, when they met him, mingled insensibly witha shrinking horror that greatly amused him.Nobody spoke to him except in his business capacity. Every oneavoided him. He was practically ostracised. Mrs. Hamilton, on theother hand, went everywhere, and thoroughly enjoyed herself in the_role_ of gentle forgiving martyr that she played to perfection.Being plain and unattractive to men, she was thoroughly popularwith the women, and they were never tired of condoling with her onhaving such a brute of a husband. What more natural, poor dear!than that she should refuse to live with him in India, if theclimate did not suit her? So unreasonable of him to expect it! Thequestion of a family, too! why, what woman was there now who didnot hate to have her figure spoiled, and object to be always in thesick-room and nursery? So natural that she did not wish thosedisagreeable passionate relationships: a man could not expect thatsort of thing from his wife! And then the money, too! she had neverhad more than half his income all these twenty years! It seemed tothem that she had been wonderfully good and resigned.Such was the talk at the afternoon teas, and the married men at theclub, coached by their wives, and being in the position of the foxwho had lost his brush, and wished no other fox to retain his,condemned Hamilton quite as freely."It was beastly rough on his wife," they agreed, "to set up ablack dancing-girl under her eyes."Hamilton cared not at all for the social life of the station, andwas greatly relieved by not having invitations to give or toanswer. All that he regretted was the ultimate resignation of hispost, which, he foresaw, would be the result of all this scandalsooner or later.Saidie, with Oriental quickness, had soon grasped the wholesituation, and had flung herself at his feet in a passion of tears,begging him to send her away or to kill her rather than let herpresence make him unhappy. Hamilton had some difficulty in turningher mind from the resolve to kill herself by way of serving him;and it was only his solemn oath to her that she was the one singlejoy and happiness of his life, that with her in his arms he caredabout nothing else, that if he lost her his life was at an end,which pacified and at last convinced her.Another month went by, and Mrs. Hamilton began to tire of herposition. She felt she was not making Hamilton half unhappy enough.She had had but one idea, and that was to separate him from Saidie,and in this she had failed. He had not even been turned out of hispost. He had been expelled from the social life of the station; butshe knew he would not feel that, that he would only welcome thegreater leisure he had to spend in his Eden with _her_. To play themartyr for a time had been interesting, but its pleasure wasbeginning to wane; moreover, she could not stay permanently withthe Commissioner's wife. She grew restless: she must carry out herplan somehow. When Hamilton's life was completely wrecked, shewould be ready to return to England--not till then; and she layawake at nights grinding her long, narrow, wolf-like teeth togetheras she thought of Hamilton in the desert bungalow.One morning, after a nearly sleepless night, she got up and lookedcritically at her face in the glass. Old and haggard as usual itlooked; but to-day, in addition to age and care, a specially evildetermination sat upon it."Life is practically done with," she thought, looking at it. "Ihave only this one thing to care about now, and I'll do it somehowbefore I go. If I can't enjoy my life, he shan't enjoy his."She turned from the glass, and commenced dressing. The evil lookdeepened on her face from minute to minute, and the word "Beast!"came at intervals through her teeth.Outside the window of her charming room all was waking in thejoyous dawn of the East. Long shadows lay across the velvet greenslopes of the Commissioner's lawn as the sun rose behind themajestic palms that shaded it; floods of golden light were ripplingsoftly over roses and stephanotis, opening bud after bud to theazure above them; the gay call of the birds rang through the clearmorning air; the perroquets swung in ecstasy on the bamboobranches, crying out shrill comments on each other's toilet. Thescent of a thousand blossoms rose up like some magic influence,stealing through the sparkling sunlight into the room, and playedround the thin face of the woman within, but it could make nomessage clear to her. Every sense of hers had long been sealed toall joy by hate.At breakfast she announced her intention of leaving India by thefollowing mail, and not all the kind pressure brought to bear uponher by the Commissioner's wife could induce her to postpone herdeparture. She was gentle, calm, and resigned in manner, as usual,excessively grateful for all they had done for her, and thekindness shown her. She spoke very sweetly of her husband, toldthem how she had hoped by coming out to induce him to leave theevil life he was leading; but she saw now that these things lay inhigher hands than hers, and she felt all she could do was to prayand hope for him in silence."Why don't you divorce him?" broke in the Commissioner abruptly andquickly, anxious to get it out before his wife could stop him. Hetugged violently at his moustache, waiting for her answer. If shewould do that, he was thinking, what a relief for that poor devilHamilton!"Divorce him?" returned Mrs. Hamilton resignedly. "Never! It is awife's duty to submit to whatever cross Providence lays upon her,but divorce seems to me only the resource of abandoned women."The Commissioner's wife nodded her head in majestic approval. TheCommissioner got up abruptly, breakfast being concluded. He saidnothing, but his mental ejaculation was, "Old hag! knows shecouldn't get any one else, nor half such a handsome allowance!"The day for Mrs. Hamilton's departure came, and on its morningHamilton found a note from her on his office desk. He took it upand opened it with a feeling of repulsion.     "DEAR FRANK,--I am leaving by the noon boat for England. They     seem to have altered their time of sailing to twelve instead     of seven P.M.     "I am sorry my visit here has caused you trouble. Do not be     too hard on me. I am leaving now, and do not intend to worry     you again. You must lead your own life until, perhaps, some     day you wish to return to me. You will find me ready to     welcome you. Good-bye, and forgive any pain I have caused     you.--Your affectionate wife,                                   JANE."Hamilton read this note with amazement, and a sense of its falsityswept over him, as if a wind had risen from the paper and struckhis face. But as men too often do, he tried to thrust away hisfirst true instincts, and replace their warning with a lumberingreason. He sat deep in thought, gazing at the table before him. Ifit were true, if she were really going, if she really meantgood-bye, what a relief! But it was impossible, unless, indeed, shehad accomplished her plan, and had heard that he had been, or wasabout to be dismissed from his post.This seemed to throw a light upon the matter, and with the idea offinding confirmation of this in some of the other letters awaitinghim, he started to go through them. It was a heavy post-bag, andgave him much to attend to. He went through the letters, but foundnothing relative to himself in them, and settled down to his work.Twelve, one, and two passed, and he looked up at the clock,wondering if she were really gone. He seemed to have no inclinationfor lunch, so he worked on without leaving the office, and onlyrose to clear his desk when it was time to leave for the day.To-morrow he would learn definitely what passengers the out-goingboat had carried. He would not stay this evening to find out. Hefelt ill, listless; he only wanted to be back with Saidie in therestful shade of the palms.As he rode across the desert that evening an indefinable depressionhung over him. Never since he had found Saidie had that melancholy,once so natural, come back to him. Her spirit, whether she wereabsent or present, seemed always with him--a gay, bright, beautifulvision ever before his eyes, giving him the feeling that he waslooking always into sunlight. But to-night there seemed emptiness,gloom about him."It's the weather," he muttered, and looked upward to the curioussky. It was gold, gleaming gold; but close to the horizon lay twobright purple bars, like lines of writing in the West: the prophecyof a storm, and the heat seemed to hang in the air that not afaintest breath moved.Swiftly and evenly the great camel bore him, its well-belovedmaster, over the rippling sand towards the palms in the goldenwest, but the approaching night travelled faster than they, and itwas quite dark, with a sullen heavy darkness, before they reachedthe bungalow. It seemed very quiet, with an indefinable sense ofstillness in the garden and wide hall. Neither Saidie nor anyservant came to meet him, and it was quite dark: no lamp had beenlighted. With a sudden throb of terror in his heart, Hamiltonpaused and called "Saidie."There was no response, no sound. Striking a match, Hamiltondeliberately lit a lamp. Some great evil was upon him, and with acurious calmness he went forward to meet it. He went upstairs andpushed open the door of their bedroom, shielding the light with hishand and seeking first with his eyes the bed. Saidie lay there: theexquisite form, in its transparent purple gauze, lay composed uponthe bed, a little to one side. The glorious hair, unbound, rippledin a dark river to the floor; the head rested sideways as in sleep,upon the pillow. In silence Hamilton approached; near the bed hisfoot slid suddenly; he looked down; there was a tiny lake ofscarlet blood, blackening at its edges, blood on the woodenbedstead side, blood on the purple muslin over the perfect breasts.Hamilton, his body growing rigid, put out his hand to her forehead;it was cold. He set down the lamp and turned her face towards it,putting his arm under her head. Her lips were stone colour, thelids were closed over the eyes; the face was the face of death.In those moments Hamilton realized that his own life was over.Saidie was dead--murdered. The world then was simply no more forhim. All was finished: he himself was a dead man. Only one thingremained, one duty for him. To avenge her! Then utter rest andblackness. He looked round thinking. The room was quite empty,undisturbed. The great pearls on Saidie's neck were untouched. Theygleamed gently in the pale light from his lamp. No robber, nooutsider had been here. Then, in the darkened room, leapt up beforehim the truth: a white, blonde face seemed looking at him from thewalls--the thick pale lips, the half-closed sinister eyes, the leanlong figure of his wife rose before him."But she was to leave by the morning's boat," he muttered. Then... a thought struck him. He withdrew his arm gently from thepassive head, lighted another lamp, putting it on a bracket in thewall, and left the room, descending to the vacant hall. He went tothe verandah and called to his servants. They came, a tremblingcrowd, with upraised hands, and fell flat before him, weeping andstriking their heads on the ground."It is not our fault, Light of Heaven, Father of the Poor, theMem-Sahib came--the white Mem-Sahib. We are poor men; we have nofault at all."Hamilton listened for a moment to the storm of words and protestingcries. Then he raised his hand and there was silence, but for asound of rising wind without and the sobbing of the natives."Pir Bakhs," he said to the head of them all, the butler, "tell meall you know. Your mistress is dead. Who is responsible?"The butler came forward and fell at his master's feet with claspedhands."Lord of the Earth, I know nothing but this. At five all was quietin the house, and our mistress sat in the garden singing. Thencame to the door two runners with a palanquin. They asked to seeour mistress. I said wait. I went to the garden. I said the whiteMem-Sahib has come in a palanquin. My mistress said, 'I will seeher.' She went to the drawing-room, and the white Mem-Sahib camein, and they drank tea together. Your servant is a poor man, and hesaw no more till the runners went away with the palanquin. So wesaid, 'The white Mem-Sahib has gone,' and my mistress said to meshe felt drowsy and must sleep, and went upstairs to the Light ofHeaven's room and shut the door. And your servant was laying thetable in your honour's dining-room a little later, and he went toclose the jillmills,[1] for the wind was rising, and your servantsaw through the jillmill the white Mem-Sahib again getting into herpalanquin that had appeared once more at the back, and the runnersran with it very fast into the desert; then your servant ran out toask the other servants why the white Mem-Sahib had come back, andthe ayah met him at the door and said she had found our mistresskilled in her room; and your honour's servant is a poor man, andhas wept ever since."[Footnote 1: Wooden shutters.]Hamilton listened in perfect silence. The man's face was lined withgrief, the tears rolled in streams down his livid cheeks. A wailwent up from the other servants at his words. Hamilton and hismistress were their idols, and his grief was very real tothemselves.Hamilton stretched out his hand to the trembling man with a benigngesture."Pir Bakhs, I believe you. You have served me many years, and neverlied to me. This is another's work, not yours. Be at peace. Youhave no fault."The butler wept louder, and the others wailed with him, callingupon Heaven to bless their master and avenge their mistress.Hamilton turned from them to the dark dining-room, which he crossedto the hall; through this he walked in the darkness as a blind manwalks, to the entrance.He tore the wood-work door open, wrenching it from its hinges, andlooked out into the night. A dust-storm was raging in the desertbeyond the compound, and its stinging blasts of wind, laden withsand, drove heavily over the exquisite masses of bloom, theglorious and delicate scented blossoms of the garden. It tore offthe flowers remorselessly, and even for the moment he stood there,a rain of thin, white, shredded petals was flung into his face. Thebranches of the trees groaned and whined in the thick darkness, theswish of broken and bent bamboo came from all sides, the roar ofthe dust driven through the foliage filled his ears. The garden,the beautiful, sheltered garden, scene of their delights, was beingruthlessly destroyed, even as his life had been; it was expiring inagony, even as he would shortly expire: to-morrow it would bedesolate, a shattered wreck under the dust, even as he, in a littlewhile--But something should be done first.Leaving the doorway open, letting the dust-laden wind tearshrieking through the silent house, he plunged into the roaringdarkness. He took the centre path that led straight to the compoundgate. The unhappy bushes and tortured branches of the trees, bentand twisted by the onrushing wind, lashed his face and body as hewent down the path. He did not feel their stinging blows. On, on tothe desert he went blindly but steadily in the thick darkness.When he got beyond the compound gate, out of the shelter of thegarden, the weight of the wind almost bore him down; but as hefaced its blast, his eyes saw, not so very far, out on the plain,dull in the whirling mist, the dancing uncertain light of a carriedlantern. As the tiger darts forward on its prey, as the snakesprings to the attack, Hamilton leapt forward into the wall of windthat faced him and ran at the dancing light.Choked with sand, blinded, suffocated and breathless, but full ofpower to kill, he was on it at last, and flung himself with sinewyhands on the swaying, covered sedan chair, between the two bearers,who, bewildered and helpless in the sudden storm, were gropingslowly across the plain. With a shriek they dropped the handles, asHamilton flung himself suddenly on the chair; the lantern fell intothe sand and went out. The natives, thinking the devil, the actualspirit of the storm, had overtaken them, fled howling into theblackness, their cries swallowed up like whispers in the roar ofthe wind. As the chair struck the sand, the woman within thrust herhead with a cry through the open side. Hamilton seized it by theneck. Out! out of the sedan chair, through the burst-open door, hepulled the wretched creature by her head, and then flung her withall his force upon the sand.The raging wind swept past them in sheets of dust, bellowing as itwent. He knelt on her body; his hands ground into her neck. Throughthe darkness he saw beneath him the thin, white oval of the face,with its eyes bulging, starting out of the head, its lips writhingin agony; two white hands beat helplessly in the black air besidehim. He looked hard into her eyes, bending down to her close, verynear, as his hands sank deeper into her neck, his fingers lockedmore tightly round it. In a few seconds the light of the eyes wentout, the hands ceased to beat the air. Saidie was avenged. With alaugh that rang out into the noise of the storm, the man got upfrom the limp body and stood by it, in the echoing darkness. Thenhe kicked it, so that it rolled over, and the sand came up inwaves eager to bury it.In an hour woman, sedan chair, lantern would all be beneath a levelplain of sand.He turned back towards the bungalow. "Saidie," he murmured, and thestorm-wind seemed to rave "Saidie!" "Saidie!" round him, to whirlthe name upwards to the dim stars, glimmering one here and there,far off and veiled in the heavens. He went back; the wind helpedhim. On its wings he seemed borne back to his house, through thetortured garden, through the gaping doorway, over the shattereddoor he passed, and then up the stairs to their room.After the inferno of the desert the inside of the house seemedquiet, and in their room the lamps burned steadily, but low. Theiroil was used up, their life, like his, was nearly done. The bedstood there and on its calm white stillness lay Saidie, waiting forhim, for him alone, as always.He went up to her and stood there."Saidie?" but she did not answer. He lay down beside her gently, soas not to break her slumber, and then drew her to his breast. Ahhis treasure! his world! Surely now all was well since she wassafe in his arms! He did not feel the deathly coldness. There was awhizzing in his brain where Nature had laid her finger on a vein,and broken it that he might be released from sorrow and die."Saidie?" he murmured again as her breast pressed his, and put hislips to hers.As his life had first dawned in her kiss, so it went back now tothe lips that had given it, and in that kiss he died.IIThere was complete silence in the large room, filled with long,wavering shadows that the flickering firelight chased over thewalls and amongst the gilt-edged tables.Beyond the windows the dusk was gathering quickly in the wind-sweptstreet, beneath the leaden sky. From the pane nearest the fire aside-light fell across a man's figure leaning against the corner ofthe mantel-shelf. A ruddy glow from the hearth struck upon the silkskirt of a girl leaning back in the easy-chair beneath the othercorner.Her face is lost in the shadow.He is a good-looking fellow, very. The high white collar that showsup in the dusk is fastened round a long, well-set neck; the figurein the blue serge suit is straight and pleasing, and the shoulderserect and slim.The girl's eyes, looking out of the shadow, take in these points,and the pleasure they give her seems inextricably confused withdull pain. Her gaze passes on to his face, and rests eagerly,almost thirstily, upon it.There is light enough still to show her its well-cut oval, spoilednow by the haggard falling in of the cheeks, the lines in theforehead, and the swellings beneath the eyes.He shifts his position a little and glances through the window. Hiseyes are full of irritation, and the girl knows it, though they areturned from her. She gives a suppressed, inaudible sigh; hisattitude now brings out the impatient discontent on his mouth andthe rigid determination of the chin."I suppose you mean two people can live upon nothing?" His voice iscold, even hostile, and he speaks apparently to the panes, but thetones are well-bred and pleasing; and again the girl wonders dimlywhich is the predominating sensation in her--pleasure or pain."No," she says, in rather a suffocated voice. "But I say, if eitherperson has enough, or the two together, it does not matter whichhas it, or which has the most."Silence, which her hesitating, timid voice breaks at last."Does it?""Yes, I think it does," he answered shortly. "The man must haveenough to support both, or he has no right to marry at all."The girl's hands lock themselves together convulsively, unseenbehind her slight waist, laced so skilfully into the fashionablebodice.There is a hard decision in the incisive tones that does not belongto the mere expression of a general theory--a cold authority and aweight of personal conviction that turns the words into a statementof rigid principle.The girl feels almost dizzy, and she closes her hot eyelidssuddenly to shut out the line of that hard, obstinate chin."People's ideas on what is enough to support both vary so much,"she says quietly, with well-bred indifference in her tone, whileher heart beats wildly as she waits for his next remark."Well, what would you consider enough yourself?" he says coldly,after a slight pause, turning a little more towards her.The red light glows steadily on her skirts, and he can see thegraceful outline of her knees under them, and one small foot uponthe hearthrug; the rest of the form is veiled in the shadow, exceptone rounded line of a shoulder and the glint of light hair above.He looks down at her, and there seems a sudden, nervous expansionin his frame; outwardly there is not the faintest impatientmovement. He waits quietly for her reply.The girl hesitates as she looks at him. To her, in her absorbinglove for the man before her, the question is an absurd mockery.To reduce to a certain number of pounds this "enough," when for heranything or nothing would be enough!"I would rather starve to death in your arms than live another daywithout you," is the current running under all her thoughts, and itconfuses them and makes it difficult for her to speak.What shall she answer? To name a sum too small in his eyes willbe as great an error as to name one too large. He would onlythink her a silly, sentimental girl, who knows nothing of whatshe is talking about, and who has no knowledge and appreciationof the responsibilities of life.Besides, to name a very small income will be to conjure up beforehis eyes the picture of a mean, pitiful, sordid existence, fromwhich she feels, with painful distinctness, he would turn withdisgust.Poor? Yes, he has told her that he is poor, and she believes it;but somehow--by contracting debt, probably--she thinks, as herkeen, observant eyes sweep over him, he manages at present to liveand dress as a gentleman.Those well-cut suits, those patent shoes and expensive cigarettes;these things, she feels instinctively, must be preserved for him,or any form of life would lose its charm.At the same time, she must mention something that is not hopelesslybeyond him. She recalls her own two hundred; surely, at the least,he must be making one."I can hardly say," she murmured at last, "because personally Ithink one can live on so very little; but I suppose most peoplewould say--well, about three hundred pounds a year.""Oh! three hundred a year," he says, stretching out his hand forthe tea-cup on a low table beside him. The tea has grown cold inthe discussion of abstract questions. He takes the cup and sitsdown deliberately in the corner of the couch opposite her, andstirs the tea slowly."How much is that a week? Five pounds fifteen, isn't it? Well, now,go on, see what you can make of it. Your house--the smallest--andservants--""House and servants!" interrupts the girl, "but why have a houseand servants at all?""I don't know," he rejoins curtly, "because the girl generallyexpects those things when she marries.""Not all girls," she says, and one seems to hear the smile withwhich she says it in her voice."You mean rooms?" he says quickly, with a gleam of pleasurebreaking for a moment across his face."Well--say rooms--you would want three--thirty shillings, Isuppose, at the least, and then another thirty for board. Thatleaves two fifteen for everything else.""Surely that's a good deal.""Oh, I don't know; think of one's clothes," and Stephen staresmoodily into the fire, with a pricking recollection of a tailor'sbill for twenty odd in his drawer at home now.Then, to remove the impression of selfish extravagance he feels hemay have given, he adds:"And a man wants to give his wife some amusement, and three hundreda year leaves nothing for that.""Amusement!" the girl repeats, starting up and standing upright,with one elbow just touching the mantelpiece, and the firelightflooding her figure from the slim waist downwards. "What amusementdoes a woman want if she is in love with the man she is livingwith? The man himself is her amusement! To watch him when he isoccupied, to wait for him when he is away, to nurse him when he isill--that is her amusement: she does not want any other!"Stephen stares at the flexible form, and listens to the words thathe would admire, only the cynical suspicion is in his mind that sheis talking for effect. His general habit was to consider all womenmercenary and untrustworthy. Deep in his heart--for he had a heart,though contracted from want of use--lay a hungry desire to beloved, really loved for himself; and the very keenness of thelonging, and the anxiety not to be deceived, lessened his powers ofpenetration, and blinded him to the girl's character.He laughs slightly. "You are taking a theatrical view of the wholething!""How do you mean?""Oh, well, that the wife really loves her husband and sticks to himthrough everything, and they pass through unheard-of difficultiestogether, and so on"; but he adds, with a faint yawn: "I've alwaysnoticed that when the money goes the love disappears too. There'sno love where there's abject poverty.""But three hundred a year is not abject poverty," answers the girlin a quiet tone, not denying his theory for fear of being calledagain theatrical."No," he admits. "Oh, it might do very well as long as there wereonly two; but then, when there are children, it means a nurse, andall sorts of expenses."He says the words with a simplicity and directness that makes thegirl almost catch her breath. For these two were not on intimateterms with each other, not even terms of intimate speaking.Nothing had passed between them yet but the merest society phrases,and before a certain quiet dinner one month back neither knew ofthe other's existence. Since then some chance meetings on thebeach, the parade, the pier, a few long afternoon rows, betweenthen and now: these are the only nourishment the flame in eitherbreast has received--a flame kindled in a few long glances acrossthe dinner-table.But this afternoon he has laid aside the customary phrases anddeliberately commenced the present conversation.True, it is purely an abstract one--all theory and hypotheses. Noone could say otherwise if it were repeated. Not a personal wordhas been uttered on either side; but the girl feels in thedetermined tone of his voice, in the studied way he started it, inthe cold precision with which he follows it, that it is practicallya test conversation of herself, and that she is virtually passingthrough an examination.He has come this afternoon with a set of certain questions that hemeans to put, to all of which her answers are received withoutcomment, and mentally noted down.He neither repeats himself, nor presses a point, nor leaves outanything on his mental list, nor allows any remark to lead awayfrom it.He has also certain things he means to say, which he will say, ashe asks his questions, deliberately, one after the other; and then,when he has heard and said all he intends, he will terminate theconversation as decisively as he began it and go. The girl feelsall this, for her brain is as clear and keen as the glance of hereyes.She knows that he is testing her: that she stands upon trial beforehim.She has nothing to hide: only, that too great love and devotion,that seems to swell and swell irrepressibly within her, and wouldpour itself out in words to him, but that his tone, his manner,his look keep it back absolutely, as a firm hand holds down therising cork upon the exuberant wine. And now, at this sentenceof his, her words fail her. They are strangers practically, thatis conventionally--quite strangers, she remembers confusedly--butfor this secret bond of passion, knit up between them, which bothcan feel but both ignore.The natural male in him, and the natural female in her, arealready, as it were, familiar, but the fashionable man and girl arestrangers still.Then, now, how is she to say what she wishes to him? How can shetalk with this mere acquaintance upon this subject? The very word"children" seems to scorch her lips. At the same time, familiaritywith him seems natural and unnatural; terrible, and yet simple.Then, too, what are his views?Will her next words shock him inexpressibly?In her passionate, excitable brain, inflamed with love for the man,the idea of maternity can merely present itself like an unwelcome,grey-clad Quaker at a banquet.She hesitates, choosing her words. She knows so little of the manin front of her. His clothes, she sees, are of the newest cut, buthis notions may not be.At last her soft, weak, timid voice breaks the pause."Do you think it necessary to have very large families?""No, I don't," he answers instantly with the energy and alacrity ofone who is glad to express his opinion. "No, I don't, not at all."The girl's suspended breath is drawn again. Unlike himself in hisqueries she presses her point home."Don't you think those marriages are the happiest where there areno children?""Yes," he says decidedly, getting up and thrusting his hands intohis coat pockets. "Yes, I do--much the happiest."There is silence. It is too dark for either to see the other'sexpression. He stands irresolutely for a minute or two, and thensays with a disagreeable laugh:"I should hate my own children! Fancy coming home and finding a lotof children crying and screaming in the place."To this the girl says nothing, and Stephen, after a minute'sreflection, softens his words."Besides, your wife's love, when she has children, is all given tothem.""Yes," murmurs her well-bred voice. "Oh, yes, one is happierwithout them."Neither speak. They are agreed so far; there is a deep relief andpleasure in the breast of each."Well," he says at last, rousing himself, "I must go. I shall belate for dinner."The girl leans down and stirs the fire into a leaping, yellowblaze. It fills the room with light, and reveals them fully now toeach other.She makes no effort to detain him, and they look at each other,about to part.The self-control of each is marvellous, and admirable for its merethoroughness and completeness.He has large eyes, and they stare down at her haggardly, as hestands facing her in the light. The hungry, hopeless look in thoseeyes and the drawn lines in his face go to the girl's heart, and toherself it seems literally melting into one warm flood of sympathy.Ill! he looks ill and wretched, and she longs with a longing thatpresses upon her, till it is like a physical agony, to give someway to her feelings."Dearest, my dearest!" she is thinking, "if I might only tellyou--even a little--"And Stephen stares at the soft face and warm lips, half-paralyzedwith desire to bend down and kiss them. How would a kiss be? howwould they--And so there is a momentary, barely perceptible pause,filled with a painful intensity of feeling, to which neither givesway one hair's breadth. Then he gives a curt laugh."We have discussed rather a difficult problem and not settled it,"he says in a conventional tone."It seems to me quite simple," murmurs the girl, with a throat sodry that the words are hardly audible.He hears, but makes no reply beyond another slight laugh, as heholds out his hand. The girl puts hers into it. There is a moderatepressure only on either side, and then he goes out and shuts thedoor, leaving the girl standing motionless--all the warm springsin her heart frozen by his last cynical laugh.Brookes finds his way down the stairs, through the unlighted hall,and lets himself out in the chill October air.He goes down the street feeling a confused sense of havinginflicted pain and left distress behind him, but his own sensationof irritation, his own vexation and angry resentment against hislot in life, all but obliterate it.For some seconds he walks on with all his thoughts merged togetherin a mere desperate and painful confusion. "Only a hundred a year!"is his plainest, most bitter reflection. "Five-and-twenty, and onlyearning a hundred a year!"Brookes is not of a calm temperament. His nervous system is tenselystrung, and generally, owing to various incidental matters,slightly out of tune, or at anyrate, feels so.His circulation is rapid, every pulse beats strongly, and the bloodflows hotly in his veins.His mental nature is of much the same order--passionate, excitable,and impatient; but there is such a heavy curb-rein of controlperpetually upon it, that its three leading qualities jar inwardlyupon himself more than they show to outsiders.Even now the confused, excited disorder in his brain is soonregulated and calmed by his will, and as he walks on he lapses intotrying to recollect whether he has said all he meant to.He concludes that he has, and a certain satisfaction comes overhim."Well, I have told her my views now," he reflects. "She sees what Ithink, and what my principles are. She won't wonder that I saynothing. I shall try for another post and a rise of salary, andthen--"Stephen's character was a fine one in its way. The capacity forself-command and self-denial was tremendous, his sense of honourkeen, his adherence to that which he conceived the rightinflexible, his will immutable; but of the subtler sweetness ofthe human heart he had none.Of sympathy, the divine [Greek: sym, pathos], _the suffering with_,he had not the vaguest conception: of its faint and poorreflections, pity and mercy, he had but a dim idea.He stuck as well as he could to what he thought was the rightpath, and as to the feelings of others, he could not be blamed fornot considering them, for he had never practically realized thatthey had any.In the present circumstances he had a few, fine, adamantine rulesfor conduct, which he was going to steadfastly apply, and hethought no more of the girl's feelings under them than one thinksof the inanimate parcel one is cording with what one knows is good,stout string.In his eyes it was distinctly dishonourable for a man to engage agirl to himself without a reasonably near prospect of marriage.It was also decidedly ungentlemanly to propose to a girl if she hadmoney and you had none. Moreover, it was extremely selfish toremove a girl from a comfortable position to a poorer one, thoughshe might positively swear she preferred it; and lastly, it wasunwise for various reasons, to be too amiable to the girl, or togive any but the dimmest clue to your own feelings.There was no telling--your feelings might change even--when youhave to wait so long--and then it was much better, _for the girl_,that she should not be tied to you.To visit the girl frequently, to hang about her to the amusement ofonlookers, to keep alive her passion by look and hint and innuendo,to excite her by advances when he was in the humour, and studiouslyrepulse her when she made any, to act almost as if he were her_fiance_, and curtly resent it if she ever assumed he was more thanan ordinary friend--this line of action he saw no fault in. Theabove were his views, and they were excellent, and if the girldidn't understand them she might do the other thing.Some weeks passed, and the man and the girl saw each otherconstantly--three or four times in the week, perhaps more; and theinward irritation grew intense, while their outward relationsremained unchanged.There was a certain brutality that crept into the man's tonesoccasionally when he addressed her, a certain savage irritabilityin manner, that told the girl's keen intelligence something; someinvoluntary sighs of hers as she sat near him, and an increasinglook of exhaustion on her face, that told him something. But thatwas all.There were no tender passages between them; none of theconventional English flirting--matters were too serious, and thenature of each too violent to permit of that. A little bitter,more or less hostile, conversation passed between them on themost trifling subjects in his long afternoon calls. A littlemusic would be attempted--that is, he would sing song after song,while she accompanied him, but a song was rarely completed.Generally, before or at the middle, he would seize the music in agust of irrepressible and barely-veiled irritability, and flingit on the piano--yet they attempted the music with unwaveringpersistence, and both rose to go to the instrument with mutualalacrity.There they were close to each other--so close that the warmth andbreath of their beings were interchanged. There in the pursuit of afallen sheet of music, his head bent down and touched hers. Once,apparently to regain the leaf, his hand and arm leaned hard uponher lap. One second, perhaps, no more; but the girl's wholestrained system seemed breaking up at the touch--her controlshattered, like machinery violently reversed.The music leaf was replaced, but her hands had fallen nervelessfrom the keys."It is hot. I can't go on playing. Put the window open, will you,for me?"Stephen walked to the window, raised it, and smiled into the dark.That night it seemed to Stephen he could never force himself toleave the girl. He prolonged the playing past all reasonablelimits, until May's sister laughingly reminded him that they wereonly staying in seaside lodgings, and other occupants of the housemust be considered. Stephen reluctantly relinquished the friendlypiano, and then stood, with May's sweet figure beside him, and herupraised face clear to the side vision of his eye, talking to hersister.At last, when every trifle is exhausted of which he can makeconversation, there comes a pause, a silence; he can think ofnothing more. He nerves himself, holds out his hand, and says,"Good-night!"May, influenced equally by the same indomitable aversion to beseparated from him, follows him outside the drawing-room, andanother pause is made on the stair. By this time a fresh stock ofchaff and light wit is ready in Stephen's brain, and he makes useof anything and everything to procure him another moment at herside; but of all the passion within him, of the ardent, impetuousimpulse towards her, nothing, not the faintest trace, shows.A mere "Good-night!" ends their conversation at length, and thegirl did not re-enter the drawing-room, but passed straight up thestairs to her own room."Does he care? Does he care or not?" she asked herself, walkingceaselessly backwards and forwards. "If I only knew that he did!This is killing me; and suppose, after all, he does not care!"She almost reels in her walk, and then stretches her arms out onher mantelpiece, and leans her head heavily upon them."So this is being in love!" she thinks, with a faint satiricalsmile. "All this anxiety and pain and feeling of illness! Why, itis as if poison had been poured through me."Through the next day May lay pallid and silent on the couch,without pretence of occupation, feeling too exhausted even torespond to her sister's chaff and raillery.It was only at dinner, when her brother-in-law informed his wife hewas sick of the place, and that nothing would induce him to staymore than another week, that a stain of scarlet colour appeared inMay's cheeks and a terrified dilation in her eyes.Her lids were lowered directly, and the blood receded again. Shemade no remark, but at the close of dinner she excused herself, andwent upstairs alone.Once in her room, she stripped off her dinner-dress and shoes, andre-dressed in morning things. Her hands trembled so violently thatshe could hardly fasten her bodice over the wildly-expanding bosom.But her resolve was fixed. They were going in a week. To-morrow,she knew, Stephen was leaving the place for a fortnight. She mustsee him to-night.When she is completely dressed, she pauses for a moment to chokedown the terrible physical excitement that seems to rob her ofbreath and muscular power.Then she passes downstairs quietly and goes out.The night is still, cold, and dark.May walks rapidly through the few streets that divide his house andhers.The few men she meets turn involuntarily to glance after thesplendid form that goes by them, and in her decisive walk, in theeyes blind to them, they feel instinctively she is already owned,mentally or actually, by some one other.When she reaches Stephen's house, she learns he is in, and with agreat fear of him suddenly rushing over her, she sends word up tohim by the servant: Will he see her?While she waits in the hall, her message is taken upstairs. Mayleans against the wall, a terrible sick faintness, born ofexcitement and hysteria, coming suddenly upon her.There is a hall-chair, but her eyes are too darkened to see it; shesimply clings to the handle of the door, and lets her head sinkagainst the side of the passage.Brookes is upstairs with his brother and two friends; they havebeen playing cards, but a game is just over, and the men have gotup to stretch themselves.Stephen himself is leaning back against the mantelpiece, as hishabit is, and yawning slightly. He has just been beaten, and he isa man who can't play a losing game."No," his brother remarks. "I didn't know what the deuce 'Ladas'meant till I looked it up; did you, Steve?""Oh, I should think every schoolboy would know that," is the curtresponse, and at that moment the servant's knock comes at the door."Please, sir, there's a lady as wants to see you," the girl sayswith a perceptible grin. "She said she wouldn't come up, and she'swaiting in the hall, sir."There is a blank silence in the room. Brookes pales suddenly, andhis eyebrows, that habitually have a supercilious elevation, risestill higher with annoyance.He hesitates a single second, then, without a word in reply, hecrosses the room towards the door, and the servant retreatshastily.The men glance furtively at each other, but Stephen's devil of atemper being well known, they forbear to laugh or even smile tillhe is well out of the room. Brookes goes down the stairs with onesentence only in his mind: Coming to my rooms, and making a foolof me!He is annoyed, intensely annoyed, and that is his sole feeling.May is standing upright now in the centre of the hall under theswinging lamp, and she watches him run lightly down the long flightof stairs towards her with swimming eyes.What is there in that figure of his that has so much influence onher senses? More, perhaps, even than his face, do the lines of hisneck and shoulders and their carriage please her. All the pleasureshe can ever realise in life seems contained for her in that slim,well-made frame, in its blue serge suit.She makes one impetuous step forward, her whole form dominated,impelled by the surge of ardent feelings within her, and holds outone trembling, burning hand. Stephen, with a confused sense of itsbeing awfully bad form that she should be standing in his hall,takes it in his right hand, feeling hastily for the lucifers withhis left."Er--come into the dining-room, won't you?" he says, with thefamiliar, supercilious accent that with him is the expression ofsuppressed annoyance and slight embarrassment.He knows the rooms are unlet, and with gratitude for thisprovidential circumstance in his thoughts, and his heart beatingviolently with sudden excitement now he is actually in herpresence, he turns the handle of the door and sets it wide open.He strikes a match and holds it up, leaning back against the door,for her to pass in before him.As she does so, their two figures for one second almost touch eachother, and a sudden glow lights up in his veins. He feels it, andit warns him instantly to summon his self-control. That beforeeverything.The next moment he follows her into the room, lights the gas,returns to the door, closes it, and then comes back towards the rugwhere she is standing.By this time his command is his own. His face is as calm as a mask.His large eyes, somewhat bloodshot now from hours of smoking and asleepless night, rest upon her with cold enquiry.She has seen them once, met them once, fixed, liquid, withpassionate longing upon hers; desperately she seeks in them now forone gleam of the same light, but there is none. They and his faceare cloaked in a cold reserve. Sick, and with her heart beating tosuffocation, she says, as he waits for her to explain her presence:"We are--going away."Stephen's heart seems to contract at the words he had so oftendreaded to hear, heard at last.His thoughts take a greyer hopelessness."Oh, really!" he says merely, the shock he feels only slightlyintensifying his habitual drawl. "Not immediately, I hope?"Nothing to the nervous, excited, over-strained girl before himcould be more galling, more humiliating, more crushing than thecold, conventional politeness of his tones and words.This frightful fence of Society manner that he will put betweenthem--a slight, delicate defence, is as effectual as if he caused aprecipice by magic to yawn between them."No--not--not--quite immediately, but soon," she falters. "And itseems as if I could not exist if--I--never see you."There is a strained pause while they stand facing each other. Heis motionless; one hand rests in his pocket, the other hangsnerveless at his side.They look at each other. Each is thinking of the supremedelight--even if momentary--the other's embrace could give if--butthe conditions in the respective minds are different--in his: "If Ithought it wise;" in hers: "If he only would.""Well, we can write to each other," he says at last."Oh, but what are letters?" the girl says passionately; and then,urged on hard by her love for him, her intuition of his love forher, and her common-sense instinct not to throw away her life'shappiness for a misunderstanding or petty feeling of pride, sheadds: "You know--don't you?--that I care for you more than anythingelse in the world."Her tones are sharp with the intensity of feeling, and shestretches both hands imploringly a little way towards him.He sees them quiver and her face whiten, and the frightened appealincrease in her pained eyes searching his face, and it is amarvel--later, he marvels at it himself--how, with his own passionkeen and alive in him, he maintains his ground. But there issomething in the whole scene that jars upon him--somethingtheatrical that makes the thought flash upon him: Is it a got-upthing?This puts him on the defensive directly; besides, he resents hercoming to him in this way, and endeavouring to surprise from himwords he has already explained to her he is unwilling to say.She is trying to rush him, he puts it to himself; and the thoughtrouses all his own obstinacy and self-will.When he chooses he will speak, and not before."It is very good of you to say so," he answers quietly, in a coldformal tone, and the girl quivers as if he had struck her.Now, in his lonely, sleepless nights, the misery on the white facecomes back and back to him in the darkness of his room, but then heis blind to it.In an annoyed mood to begin with, irritated beyond bearing by hisown helpless, ignominious position, as he fancies, he has noperception left for his own danger of losing her.And the man, who had lived till five-and-twenty, desiring reallove, and not knowing it, deliberately trampled upon it withoutrecognising what he did.His words cut the girl terribly.It seems impossible for the second that she can force herself tospeak again to him, but the terrible, irrepressible longing withinher nerves her for one more effort."Is that all you can tell me? Do you not care for me at all?"He looks at her and hesitates. So modest, so appealing, so timid,and yet so passionate! Surely this is genuine love for him. Whythrust it back? But the thought recurs. No. She is rushing him; andhe declines to be rushed. Also a sort of half-embarrassment comesover him, a nervous instinct to put off, ward off a scene in whichhe will be called upon to demonstrate feelings he may not satisfy.He laughs slightly, and says:"Of course I do! I like you very much!"The tones are slighting and contemptuous, enough so to conveythe polite warning: Don't go any further, and force me to bepositively rude to you.Swayed by his strong physical passion, and blinded by the doggeddetermination he has to remain master of it, he is absolutelyinsensible of another's suffering.Had the girl had greater experience with men, more hardihood andless modesty; if she could have approached him, and taken his handsand pressed them to her bosom; if she had had the courage to forceupon him the mysterious influence of physical contact, Stephen'scontrol would have melted in the kindled fire.Words stir the brain, and through the brain, the senses; but withsome people it's a long way round.Touch stirs the nerves, and its flame runs through the body like aflying pain.Stephen's physical nerves were far more sensitive than his brain,and had the girl been a woman of the half-world, or even of theworld, she could have succeeded. But she was a girl; and hermodesty and innocence, the chastity of all her mental and physicalbeing, hung like dead weights upon her in the encounter.His words, his tones, his glance simply paralyze her--notfiguratively, but positively. Her physical power to move towardshim, to make a further appeal to him, is gone. Speech is dried uponher lips, wiped from them as a handkerchief passed over them mighttake their moisture.She looks at him, dumb, frenzied with the intense longing to throwherself actually at his feet, but yet held back by someirresistible power she cannot comprehend, any more than one cancomprehend the stifling, overpowering force in a nightmare.It is the simple result of her life, her breeding, her virtue, hercharacter, her habits of control and reserve. She is thefashionable, well-brought-up girl, with all her sensitive instinctsin revolt against forcing herself upon a man indifferent to her,and full of an overwhelming instinctive timidity that her desire iswild to break down and cannot.She stares at him, lost in a sense of bitter pain. All her vigorouslife seems wrung with pain, and in that torture, in which everynerve seems bruised and quivering, a faint smile twists at last thepale, trembling lips. "You would have made a good vivisector!" shesays. Then, before he has time to answer, she turns the handle ofthe door behind her, opens it and goes out.A second after the street door closes, and Stephen stands on thedining-room mat, looking down the empty hall. Thoroughly disturbedand excited, with all his own passion surging heavily through hisblood, and her last sentence--that he does not understand any morethan he understands his own cruelty--ringing in his ears, hehesitates a minute, and then re-enters the dining-room, shuts tothe door, and walks savagely up and down."Extraordinary girl!" he mutters. "What does she want? What can Ido? She knows I can say nothing at present, when I'm going into thework-house myself! But what a splendid creature she is! Lots of'go' in her. Well, I don't care. I'll have her one day; but there'sno use making a lot of talk about it now."May walked away from his doorstep, no longer a sane human being,responsible for its actions. The whole physical, nervous system,weakened by months of self-control, and night following night ofsleeplessness, was hopelessly dislocated now.The whole weight of her excited passion, flung back upon thesensitive brain, turned it from its balance. It had been abrilliant brain, and that very excitability that had lent itsbrilliance was fatal to it now.The hopeless passion ran like a corroding poison through theinflammable tissue.She had put the matter to the test, and found that truth of whichthe mere possibility had been torture. He had absolutely rejectedher. "He could not care for me," she kept repeating, as the silentair round her seemed full of his cold, short laughs.His passion for her was dead. It had existed, surely--those looksof his, the sudden violence of his touch when there was any excusefor the slightest contact with her--or had it all been some curiousdream?She could not tell now, but whether it had been or not, it was nolonger. To her that seemed the only explanation of his words andtones. To the tender female nature the depth of brutality in thepassion of the male--that is, in fact, the very sign of it--remainsalways an enigma.After the scene just passed, it seemed to the girl impossible,ludicrous, to suppose that Stephen loved her.She had already made great allowance for him. She had a large shareof the gift of her sex--intuition; and she had understood more thanmany women would have done, but to-night he had gone beyond thelimits of her imagination."No man would be so intensely unkind to a woman he cared for," sheargued. "For nothing, when there is no need."She was not an unreasonable, nor selfish, nor silly girl. HadStephen told her he loved her, but that they must suppress theirpassion, that she must wait, she would have obeyed him, and waitedmonths, years, gone down to her grave waiting, in patient fidelityto him. Her qualities of control were as fine as his, and herdevotion to a man who loved her would have been limitless, but,acting according to his views, Stephen had taken some trouble toconvince her he was not the man, and she was convinced.And being convinced, the vision of her life without him seemed justthen a dismal waste, impossible to face.In most of the actions of the human being, the physical state ofthe person at the time is the principal factor, and May's wholephysical frame, violently over-strained, craved for rest--rest thatthe excited brain could not give. Rest was the urgent demandpressed by the breaking nervous system, and from these twothoughts--rest, oblivion--grew the dangerous thought of Death."Sleep and forget! but I can't," she thought, "and if I do, thereis the horrible awakening;" and again her fatigue suggested all thepast sleepless nights, and the craving of the body urged the brainto find better means of satisfying it, in the same way as theappetite for food forces the brain to devise methods for procuringit.She walked on in a straight line from Stephen's house, and the roadhappened to pass a post-office. May stopped and looked absentlythrough its lighted, notice-covered panes."Send him a few lines," she thought; "because I am so stupid, Icould not tell him enough, and then--"She did not finish the sentence, but all beyond was blank peace.She went in, bought a letter-card, and wrote:--     "I could have loved you devotedly, intensely, had you wished     it, but you have made it clear to-night that you do not want     love--at any rate, not mine. I have discovered that I have     courage enough to die, but not to live without you. I am going     to the sea now, and in an hour we shall be separated for ever.     I shall know nothing and you will care nothing, so it seems a     good arrangement. My last thought will be of you, my last     desire for you, my last breath your name."She fastened it with an untrembling hand, passed out of the office,posted it, and went straight down a side street to the parade.The night was still, bound in a frosty silence. The temperaturesank momentarily, and the icy grip intensified in the air.Overhead the sky was black, and glittered coldly with the winterstars. Beside and behind her and before her not a livingcreature's footstep broke the silence. The sea lay smooth, black,and motionless on her left, like some huge sleeping monster.She walked on rapidly: a glorious, vigorous, living, youthfulfigure, full of that tremendous activity of brain and pulse andblood, so valuable when there is a use for it, so dangerous whenthrown back upon itself."How I could have loved him, worshipped him, lived for him, had hebut wanted me!" is the one instinctive cry of her whole nature.At the first easy descent to the beach she turns from the parade,and goes down, passing without hesitation from the light down tothe moist darkness of the beach. To get away into oblivion, toescape from this maddening sense of pain, to lose it, let it gofrom her like a garment in the black water, is her only impellinginstinct.She sees the glimmer of the water before her without a shudder. Howmuch dearer and more inviting it seems to her tired eyes than herbed at home, where so many, many sleepless, anguished nights havebeen spent! Here--rest and sleep, with no awakening to a grey andbarren to-morrow. The thought of Death is lost. Desire for thecessation of pain is keener at its height than even the desire forlife.She stumbles on the wet, black beach at the water's edge, and thenfinds where it is slipping like oil over the sand.She walks forward, and the chill of the water rises round herankles, then her knees, then her waist, and then she throws herselfface forwards on it, as she once thought to fling herself on hisbreast.In a half-drunken satisfaction she stretches her arms out in it andcommences to swim towards the horizon. "Like his arms!" she thinks,as the water encircles her. "Like his lips!" she thinks, as itpresses on her throat. "And as cold as his nature."       *       *       *       *       *The following morning is calm and still--a perfect specimen ofwintry beauty. A light frost covers the ground and sparkles on thetrees.There is a faint chill in the clear air, a tranquil calm on thegently rising and falling sea and in the lucid sky.The sunlight falling on Stephen's bed and across his sleeping faceshows a smile there, and his arm, lying on the coverlet--an armthinned by constant fever and night-sweats--rests, in his thoughts,round her neck; that white neck so sweetly familiar in his dreams.After a time he wakes and yawns, and turns his head heavily towardsthe window; and farther as the happy unconsciousness of sleeprecedes from his face, and recollection and intelligence come backto it, more clearly show the haggard lines, traced all over it, ofself-repression, seaming and marking it at five-and-twenty."Another day to be got through," he thinks merely, as Nature's mostprecious gift--the light--pours glowing through the panes.When half-an-hour later he opens his door to take in his boots, hefinds two letters with them, and at the sight of one his heartbeats hard.The other is in the girl's handwriting, and he lays it on histoilet-table, with the thought, "Asking me to go and see her, Isuppose," and turns to the other with a mad impatience.This is evidently the official letter with reference to hispost--the post that means to him but this one thing: herpossession.He bursts it open, and in less than two seconds his eye takes inits news: he has the appointment.The blood leaps over his face, and an exultant fire runs throughhis frame and along his veins.He replaces the letter quietly in its cover with but the slightesttremor of his fingers.Then he gets up from the bedside and stands in the middle of theroom, looking through the sparkling panes."I have her!" he is thinking. "Yes, by God! at last I have her!"The day is glorified; life is transfigured.Through his whole body mounts that boundless exhilaration of desireon the point of satisfaction. Not momentary desire, easily andrecently awakened, but the long desire that has been goaded andbaited to fury through weeks and months of repression, and temperedto a terrible acuteness in pain and suffering, like steel by flame.And now triumph, and a delight beyond expression, bounds like anelectrified pulse throughout all his strong, vigorous frame.The lines seem to fade from his face, the mouth relaxes, and thenhe laughs, as he makes a step towards the window, flings it open,and leans out into the keen air."At last I can speak out decently. No one could think I cared forher money, or any of that rot now. How unexpected!--this morning!Now I can tell her I'm free, independent! I am glad I waited--itwas much better. Far better, as I said, to be patient. Last night Ialmost--and now I'm very glad I didn't."He draws his head back, and turns to the glass to shave with alight heart.As he does so, he sees her letter again, and picks it up. "Youdarling!" he thinks, "I'll make you understand all now."Some miles westward of the pier, some fathoms deep, out of reach ofthe quiet sunlight lying on the surface, tosses the girl's body,senseless and pulseless, with all the million possibilities ofpleasure that filled those keen nerves and supple limbs gone out ofthem for ever, and Stephen draws out her despairing letter ofeternal farewell, with a smile lighting up his handsome, pleasingface."Yes, it was much better to wait," he murmurs, "I don't approve ofrushing things!"IIICHAPTER IIt was morning on the Blue Nile. The turbulent blue river rolledjoyously between its banks, for it was high Nile, and a swift,light breeze was blowing--the companion of the Dawn. The vault ofthe sky seemed arched at a great height above the earth, springingclearly, without any object to break the line from the horizon ofgold sand, and full of those white, filmy, light-filled gleamingclouds that are one of the wonders and glories of Upper Egypt andthe Soudan. It was a morning and a scene to make a man's heart risehigh in his breast, and cry out, as his eyes turned from thelevel-sanded desert floor, through sunlit space, to the vaultedroof, "After all, the world is a good house to live in."Slowly the strong yellow sunlight poured over the plain, the bankand the river, gilding every ripple; and, as the light grew,hundreds of delicate shapes--the forms of the ibis and flamingoand crane, and other river-fowl--became visible, crowding down thedark banks, with flapping of white and crimson wings, andstretching of legs, and opening of beaks, rustling down, shakingtheir feathers, to bathe and drink of the Blue River.Wonderful light, and miraculous, gleaming, cloud-filled sky, andwonderful birds preening their plumage and calling to each other,and wonderful breeze-swept water, bluer than the bluest depths ofthe Indian Ocean.It was still so early that, in the whole stretch of rollicking,tumbling, buoyant waters between bank and bank, only one piece ofriver-craft could be seen. This pushed onward, cleaving through thelittle billows in the teeth of the morning breeze. It was a tinynaphtha launch--a horrid, fussy, smoking little thing, cuttingthrough breeze and water, and diffusing a scent of oil and greasediron in the pure and radiant air. A white bird on the bank lookedat it, and rose with a startled note of alarm, and a flight oflovely-salmon-coloured colleagues followed. The others merelylooked up and paused, with their wings wide stretched, and thenwent on calmly with their toilets--they had seen it before.In the launch, of which the whole centre was taken by thenaphtha-stove--the engine by courtesy--sat a young Englishman,whose face had that frank, attractive look of one whose thoughtsare kindly, well disposed to all the world; and at stem and sternstood, erect and silent, the white-clothed figure of a boy fromthe Soudan. Lithe, graceful forms supported long necks andstraight-featured faces, black as if carved out of smooth ebony,and contrasting strangely with the white turbans of stiff linentwisted deftly into a high crest above the brows. Swiftly thelittle boat ran on for a mile or two against wind, with its threesilent and motionless occupants; then one boy turned, andpronounced solemnly the two words, "Mister, Omdurman!"This was accompanied with a gracious wave of his hand towards thebank, as he leant forward to stop the engine, and his companionturned the boat to land.Omdurman, as seen from the river level, looks like nothing but along streak of duller yellow on the real gold of the African sand.Its tiny, square, flat-roofed mud-houses are not, with fewexceptions, higher than six feet, and there is nothing else savethem and their dreary, yellow-brown, muddy monotony in the wholevillage: not a palm, not a flower, not one blade of grass, simply acollection of low mud-houses, with trampled mud-paths between, andhere and there an open, brown, dusty square.The stillness and heat of the day were settling down now: the firstwild, cool youth of the morning was past, and the Englishman feltthe heat of the desert rise from the ground and strike his face,like the blow of a flail, as he stepped on land. He expected theSoudanese boys to follow, as they generally did on similarexcursions--one to secure the boat and sit and wait beside it, andthe other to accompany himself, carry his tripod and camera, andact as guide and general escort. To-day the boy stood in the boat,and addressed him earnestly:"Boat wanted by other misters: let us go back: take them. We makemuch money; come again evening, take you home.""But, you young ruffians, what am I to do out here alone? I don'tknow the way, and I want you to carry my things," expostulated theEnglishman, vainly trying to adjust a pair of blue goggles over hiseyes, smarting already in the intolerable glare from the sand,while striving not to let drop his camera, fiercely cuddled underone arm, and its tripod of steel legs and an overcoat balanced onthe other.The black remained for a moment impassive, statuesque, wrapped inreflection. Then he brightened:"Me know," he said, suddenly springing from the boat. "Me take youmy house. Sister show you the way: sister carry mister's things."The Englishman stared for a moment into the eager, intelligentface, strangely handsome, though in ebony. After all, do we notthink a well-carved table beautiful, although sometimes, evenbecause, it is in ebony? Then _he_ brightened:"Very good; take me to your house, and let me see your sister," hesaid good-humouredly; adding inwardly, "If she's anything like you,she'll be the very thing for the camera."They turned from the cool, rolling, billowy water inwards towardsthe desert and the huts of Omdurman, and the heat rose up andstruck their cheeks each step they took.       *       *       *       *       *Merla stood that morning at her hut doorway looking out--outtowards the river she could not see, for the banks rise and thedesert falls slightly behind them. She stood on the threshold, andthe sun beat on her Eastern face, and showed it was very good. Shewas sixteen, and, like her brothers who ran the naphtha launch forthe English, she was straight and erect, tall and lithe and supple,with a wonderful stateliness and majesty of carriage, though shehad never been taught deportment nor attended physical cultureclasses. Merla was beautiful, with the perfect beauty of line thatbelongs to her race, and possessed the straight, high forehead, thebroad, calm brow that tells of its intelligence and nobility. Sheknew, however, nothing of her own beauty. She never cared forstaring into the little squares of glass that the girls of thevillage would buy in the market-place, nor coveted the long stringsof blue glass beads that the Bishareens brought in such numbers tosell in Omdurman; nor did it specially please her to lay the beadsagainst her neck, and see them slide up and down on her smooth skinas she breathed, though her companions would thus sit for hourscross-legged before their little mirrors, breathing deep to notehow their beads rose and fell and glistened in the light.Merla loved much better to steal out of the hut at night, when theoil-lamp smoked against the mud wall and the air was heavy, intothe pure calm darkness of the desert, and gaze up at the stars, andlisten to the far-off tom-toms beating fitfully against thestillness. And if ever any little coins came into her possession,it seemed unkind to spend them on glass or beads when there wasalways milk and oil needed in the house. And if, when these werebought, there was any coin left, then her real luxury was to buyfood for the poor thin camel that lay at night in the mud-yardbehind their hut, and to go and feed it secretly in the starlight.And she would press her hands into the soft fur of its neck as itleant towards her, feeling that delight that springs from beingkind and loving, and being loved. The law of her life was love, alaw springing naturally in her mind, as the beauty and health inher body. Her father, her mother, her brothers were all loved byher; and, beyond these, the unfortunate camels and the donkeyswhose sides bled where the girths cut them as the carelessEnglishmen rode them in and out of the village to and from theMahdi's tomb, and the lean, barking curs in the mud street thatseldom barked as she passed by. All these she loved and sympathisedwith, though she had not been taught sympathy any more than she hadbeen taught grace.This morning she was radiant and happy as she looked through thequivering, yellow light that danced above the sand towards theriver. Last night she had fed the camel and caressed it, and shehad listened, half awe-struck, to the tom-toms in the distance. Themusic had seemed to come to her ears with a new sound. The breezehad blown from the river with a new kiss to her face. She wasgrowing into a woman, and the sap of life was rising fast andvigorous within her, lifting her up with the boundless joy of life.And as she looked, two white spots, a crested turban and a solartopee, appeared over the edge of the bank, moving towards her."My sister!" said the Soudanese boy, with a regal air, when theystood at the mudhouse door. And some instinct, as he was young andfoolish, made the Englishman drag off both goggles and solar topeefor a moment, and so Merla looked up and saw him with the sunbright on his light Saxon hair and friendly blue eyes."Merla," went on the boy rapidly to his sister in his own tongue,"this English mister from Khartoum must have a guide to Kerreree. Igo back to the boat: other Englishman want me. You go to Kerreree,Show everything; carry black box for him--carry everything. Salaam,Stanhope Mister."And, without waiting for either assent or dissent, he swiftly, yetwithout any loss of dignity or show of hurry, departed. Merla'slarge eyes were downcast. She was a free woman, and came and wentunveiled, nor was it impossible for her to talk to the whitepeople, for her parents were poor and humble, and glad to makepiastres in any way they could. One of her sisters was awater-carrier at the hotel in Khartoum, and she might be engagedthere also when she was older. But still she held her eyes down,for she felt embarrassed and oppressed, and, besides, the topee andthe goggles had been replaced, and they spoilt the vision she hadseen first of the English face."Well, Merla, if that's your name, will you come with me?" theEnglishman said lightly. He knew the tongue well that her brothersspoke, not in any of its refinement and subtlety, but in theordinary distorted way an Englishman usually speaks a foreigntongue."I will ask if I may," she returned simply, in a low voice, anddrew back into the dark hut behind her. After a moment shereappeared. "My mother and my brother have ordered it," she saidcalmly. "I am ready."Struck by the philosophic, impassive accent of her voice, and notfeeling at all flattered, the young man added in rather a nettledtone:"But I hope it's not disagreeable to you. You are willing to come?"Then Merla looked at him steadily from under her calm,widely-arching brows: "I am willing." A calm pride enwrapped allher countenance, and it seemed as if she said it somewhat as avictim might say, "I am willing," on being led to the altar ofsacrifice. Yet her eyes were radiant, and seemed to smile on him.The young Englishman was puzzled, as young England mostly is by theEast, and, seeing this, the girl added, "Certainly I am willing; itis fated I should go with you. Give me the black box."But it goes against the grain of an Englishman to let a woman carryhis baggage, though he hires her to do it, and he held his cameraback from her."Take these," he said; "they are lighter," and he gave the littletripod to her, and so they started down the mud sun-baked streetthat leads through Omdurman to the desert, and out towards thebattle-ground of Kerreree. There were few people stirring; the menhad already started to their work in the fields by the Nile, or onthe river itself, and the women kept within the close darkness ofthe huts mixing and baking meal for the evening's food. Merlawalked on swiftly and silently like a shadow at Stanhope's sidethrough the mud village, and then on into the silent heat of thedesert beyond. Here the fury of the sun was intense. The river wasout of sight, lying low between its banks. To infinite distance onevery side of them stretched the plain, and the soil here was notgolden sand, but curiously black, like powdered coal or lava. Not aliving thing moved near them; only, far away towards the horizon,now and then passed a string of camels of some Bedouins travelling.They walked on in silence. Stanhope found the walking heavy, as hisheeled boots sank into the loose, black soil, and it was difficultto keep up with the swift, easy steps of the bare black feet besidehim. His duck suit was damp, and the line of flesh exposed betweencuff and glove on his wrist was burnt to a livid red already in thesmiting heat. Suddenly Merla's eyes fell on this, and she stopped.Over her head she wore a loose veil of coarse white muslin. As shestopped, she unwound this from her hair, and tore two strips fromit. Stanhope stopped too, well pleased at the pause."You burn your English skin; the flesh will come off," she saidgravely, and before he quite realised it, she had passed one of themuslin strips round and tied it on his wrist. Stanhope's instinctwas to protest at once, but there was something in the girl'searnestness and the tender interest with which she put the muslinon his hand that checked him. Also the pain, whenever his sharpcuff touched the seared skin, was unpleasant, and made him reallyappreciate the improvised protection."Your pretty veil, Merla, you've torn it up for me," he remarkedregretfully as they started again. Merla glanced at him suddenly;she said nothing, but the pride and joy in her eyes startled theman beside her. He could find no more words, and silence fellon them again till Merla roused him from a reverie by sayingindifferently:"Look! that white heap there--bones, dead men, dead horses. Thisside, white bones too; many dead here--many bones."Stanhope looked round. Everywhere, scattered in heaps, shone thewhite bones. They had come to the edge of the battlefield. Beforethem rose the little hill of Teb-el-Surgham, crowned by its cairnof black stones and rocks, surrounded by whitened bones and skulls,from the summit of which the English watched the defeat of theKhalifa's force. Stanhope cast his eyes over the dreary, black,blood-soaked plain, on which there was no blade of grass, no plant,no flower--only black rock and white bones, that shimmered togetherin the torrid heat."Horrible! Merla, war is horrible! Come and sit down; I'm deadtired. Let's sit down here against this rock and rest."Stanhope threw himself down by one of the rocks at the base of thehill, and leant back against it. The girl took her place on thesand opposite him, with her feet tucked under her. Not far fromthem lay a skull, turned upwards to the glaring sky."Will you let me photograph you?" he asked after a minute's gazingat the rich dark beauty of the youthful face, "or is it againstyour customs?""It is against our customs," Merla answered, her hands closing hardon the tripod beside her. What terror it would mean for her tostand before that great black box, and have that evil black eyeglare upon her for long seconds! She had seen her countrywomen fleeshrieking to their huts, when the Englishmen approached with theirblack boxes."But you will do it for me, won't you?" answered Stanhopepersuasively, having set his heart on the picture."Yes, I will do it for you; it is right, if you wish it," sheanswered steadily.Stanhope accepted at once such a convenient theory, and sprang upto fix the tripod and the camera in order, and the girl sat stillon the sand watching him, cold with terror in the burning air."Now, pick up that skull and hold it out in your hand, so. Yes,that's right. Now, stand a little further back. Yes, that'sperfect."There was no difficulty in getting her to pose. The naturalattitudes of her race are all perfect poses. And Merla stooderect, facing the camera, with the emblem of death in her hand."Thank you; I am very much obliged! That'll be a first-ratepicture," he said gratefully when he had finished, and Merla satdown with a strange swimming feeling of joy rushing over her.Stanhope was some time fussing with his camera, and putting it backin its case out of the light. Then he wanted lunch, and drew fortha sandwich-case and a wine-flask. The girl would only eat verylittle, and would not taste the wine. Stanhope, who was very hungryand thirsty, ate all his sandwiches and drank all the wine, andbegan to feel very bright, refreshed, and exhilarated."Do you know you are very beautiful?" he remarked, as he stretchedhimself comfortably in the shade of the rock and gazed at her,seated sedately on the sand in front of him."Beautiful?" she repeated slowly, reflectively, "am I? The whitecamel that lives down by the market square is beautiful, and so wasthe Mahdi's tomb.""Well, you are more beautiful even than the white camel or theMahdi's tomb," returned Stanhope, laughing. "And what do you thinkof me?" he added curiously. "Where do I come in the list? somewhereclose after the white camel, I hope."Then, as she gazed at him steadfastly, without replying at all, hefelt rather piqued, and took off his blue glasses and squared hisfine shoulders against the rock."Oh, you!" said the girl softly at last, "You are like nothing onearth, lord! You are like the sun when he first comes over theplain, or the moon at night, when it floats, white and shining,through the blue spaces!"She sat sedately still, but her breast heaved under the straight,white tunic: her eyes were full of soft fire: her voice was low,and quivered with enthusiasm. Stanhope flushed scarlet. Confusedand startled, he stared into her eyes, and so they sat, silent,gazing at each other.       *       *       *       *       *That same afternoon there was a big fair or bazaar in the trampledmud square in the centre of the Soudanese village that lies higherup the river at the back of Khartoum. The place was gay with colourand crowded with moving figures. From long distances, from far-offvillages down and up the river, the natives had come in, either tosell or to buy along the wide, dusty road that went out from eitherside of the square, leading each way north and south. The mud-hutsstood all round the square, backed by some date-palms, for Khartoumand the village behind it are more favoured with shade thansun-baked Omdurman. And in the centre of the square stood or satthe natives, buying and selling, chaffering and gesticulating. Somewere Bishareens, with straight forms and features, and black bodiesalmost covered with long strings and chains of beads. They stoodabout gracefully to be admired, with their wooly hair fluffed outat right angles to their head, for the occasion. Some werecorn-merchants, sitting leisurely before a heap of golden grainpiled up loosely on the ground. Others stood by patiently withtheir fowls or goats or camels, feeding them with green fodder; andothers had vivid scarlet rugs and carpets of native make spread outon the uneven ground. And all day long the noise of the merchants,and the cry of the fowls, and the groan of the camels, and thedust of the square, and the smoke of the cooking fires went up fromthe bazaar.In one corner of it, on a square of blue carpet, spread beneath hiscamel's nose, sat a merchant who had been observed to come early tothe fair. He appeared to be a man of some substance, for he wasclothed, and the camel kneeling beside him was fat and sleek, andwould easily make two of the thin camels of Khartoum. Opposite him,sitting on his heels and holding out two lean hands to tend thesmall fire that smoked between them, was another, obviously poorer,from his smaller amount of dress and flesh."It is true: your Merla is the pearl of the desert. I have heard itfrom my mother," observed the merchant reflectively. "Still, think,my brother, a good riding camel that can be hired out to theEnglishmen every day for thirty piastres the day; in a short timeyou will feed on goat's flesh, and wear boots, with all thatmoney."The black eyes of the listener sparkled, but he objected shrewdlyenough."My daughter eats not as much as a camel, and the English want nota camel every day."The stranger, fat and comfortable-looking, with a certain amount ofopulent Oriental good looks, waved his hand with a lordly gesture."Let it not be said that Balloon is an oppressor of the poor. Giveme the pearl, and this knife shall go with the camel, also thispiece of blue carpet--a noble offer, my brother; where will youfind such another?"He drew from his crimson sash a longish knife, keen-bladed, withtrueblue, Eastern steel, and having a good bone-handle, on whichthe fingers clasped easily. The other took the knife and gazed atit intently."'Tis but a poor thing," he said at last, indifferently thrustingit into the cloths twisted round his waist. "Yet the camel and thecarpet may suit me, and, as you say, you need not the girl atpresent, I will agree, as I am a poor man, and the poor are everunder the heel of the rich. The girl shall be sent to your house onyour return.""I go now northwards, and shall return by the full moon; disappointme not, Krino or it shall be evil for you.""I disappoint no man," replied Krino calmly, taking over from theother the string of the camel, and the fine beast turned its dark,soft head, and looked with liquid eyes on its new owner.The sky began to show an orange and crimson glow behind the palms,and many cooking-fires now gleamed like spots of blood upon thesand, and the figures still came and went, and talked and bartered,for the goods were not nearly all sold, and the heaps of fine cornwere still high in many places, and the fair would go on to-morrowand the next day. But Krino got up and took his way homeward,exulting over his bargain, and leading the camel.At the same hour, lower down the Nile, at Omdurman, the river laycalm now, without a ripple, and bathed in gold; a stream of liquidgold it seemed, asleep between its deep-green banks, and only nowand then did a white-sailed felucca glide by in the golden eveninglight.Two figures came down from the desert to the Nile out of the flat,heated air of the plain to the divine freshness by the water.Here, in the cool, golden light, they paused slow and reluctant topart."Good-night, Merla! Are you unhappy that I must go?"The girl raised her face, and looked at him with steadfast eyes."The sun gilds the black rock, but the rock cannot expect the sunto stay. I am quite happy. Good-night!"Another moment and the little launch had sprung out from the deepshadowed bank on to the golden surface, and was steaming, amidstthe gold and rosy ripples, back to Khartoum.When Merla reached the little enclosure of stamped clay round herhut, she saw a new camel feeding there, and cried out for joy. Sheran to it and clasped her hands about its velvet neck, and calledto her father, as he sat smoking at the doorway, a dozen questions.Where had it come from? Whose was it? But the old man only chuckledand laughed, and would not answer."No, no," he thought, watching her with pride, as she played roundthe camel, "let the maiden wait to know the joy in store for hertill the full moon; she is but a child."Stanhope went that night to a dance at the palace at Khartoum, buthe was late in arriving, and seemed very dull and absent-mindedwhen he came, and flattered the women less than usual. "He used tobe such a nice boy when he first came here," they complainedamongst themselves, "but he was quite horrid to-night--he must bein love," and they all laughed, for every one knew there was no onein Khartoum to fall in love with except themselves, and he had notled any one of them to suppose she was the favoured one.CHAPTER IIThe night was calm, and in the purple, star-filled sky the moon wasrising. It was at the full. The naphtha launch was on the river,but it moved silently; current was with it, and the light airsfavourable, so there was no need of the engine; one single sailcarried the boat easily over the buoyant water. The stars and therising moon gleamed in the smooth, black ripples. Stanhope sat inthe boat thinking, wrapped in a cruel reverie.He felt he had sailed the craft of his life too near the perilousshore of unconventionality, and now he saw the rocks ahead of himplainly, on which it would be torn in pieces. Yet how to turn back,or move the helm to steer away from them?"A month ago," he thought, as his eye caught the reflection of therising moon in the water, "when that moon was young, I was free.Not a soul cared for me, whether I lived or died, and I cared forno one." Now there was one, he knew, who lived upon his coming,whose feet ran to meet him, whose eyes strained their vision to seehis first approach. And he, too; he was no longer free. His heartwent out to that other heart, beating for him alone so truly, sofaithfully, full of such unquestioning adoration and obedience, inmud-walled sun-parched Omdurman.When the launch touched the bank, he sprang out and walked swiftlyup to their usual meeting-place: the deserted mud enclosure of adeserted hut--an unlovely meeting-place enough--but filled with thesweet air of the desert night and the royal light of the stars."My lord looks weary to-night," said Merla softly, after they hadgreeted each other, and had sat down side by side with their backsto the low wall."Yes, I am tired with thinking. What is to be the end of this,Merla? Where is our love drifting us to?""Why does my lord concern himself with that? We are in the hands ofFate."Stanhope moved impatiently."Our fate is what we make it.""It is not wise to enquire about our fate," replied Merla, and hesaw her face grow grave with resolution in the dim light. "But Ican tell you, if you like, what it will be: when you are ready, youwill go back to your own people, your own life, and you will bevery happy.""And you--?" asked Stanhope in a whisper."I shall then have lived my life. I shall die and be buried outthere," and she motioned to the desert. "I shall have given my lordhappiness for a time: think what delight, what honour!"Stanhope shuddered."Don't, don't, I can't bear to hear you; do you ask nothing foryourself from life?""Life has given me all now," returned Merla, with a proud smile onher face."Why should we not go home to my land together?" said Stanhopepassionately, in that sudden revolt against the laws of custom thatstirs all humanity at times. "Why should I not take you to livewith me for always to be my wife? who would forbid me?"Merla shook her head, and pressed hard on his hand lying beside heron the sand."The sun cannot lift the black rock from the desert and take it todwell in the blue spaces; neither can the sun stay with the rock.You are grieving for me; do not. I am quite happy. I accept whatmust be. My life ends when you go."For a wild moment it seemed to Stanhope that he must dareeverything and take her. After all, she was intelligent: she couldbe educated. She was beautiful, youthful; and what a love shepoured out at his feet!--different in calibre, in nature,different, from its root up, from any love he could hope to findagain--a love that asked absolutely nothing for itself, not eventhe right to live, and yet would give its all unquestioningly,unsparingly. It is not a toy to be thrown away lightly, andStanhope realised this."The blue spaces are cold and empty, Merla," he said, suddenlycatching her to his breast. "You must come with me.""No, lord, it is impossible; you speak only for me," whisperedMerla, though she clasped his neck tightly. "You must go and livehappy, and I shall die happy; even in my grave I shall rememberyour kisses."       *       *       *       *       *An hour later, the moon was well up in the sky, though the lightwas not yet brilliant, and they parted by the wall of thecattle-byre with promises to meet on the morrow, and he turned andleft her standing in the shadow; but some instinct moved him, andhe returned and kissed her yet again, and said one more farewell;then he took the narrow track leading down to the river, and Merlaknew that she must hasten home; for her father, who had been out inthe early evening, would be returning. Before she left she turnedback once more into the byre, and stood looking at the stars thatshe had communed with so often: a great sadness fell on herthoughts, a chill as after a final parting. As she turned to go,her eyes fell on a grey patch on the byre floor--his coat! He hadleft it behind. Merla gave a little laugh as she picked it up: theparting seemed less final now. She would keep it till the morrow.Would he want it? miss it? No, the night was so still and sultry;and, throwing it over her arm, she passed onwards to her hut.As she neared the enclosure, her heart beat rapidly. A light wasburning within the hut, and by the moonlight she saw the greatcamel moving restlessly in the narrow space outside. Angry voicesreached her in sharp discussion--her father's and another. Justinside the enclosure she paused and listened, trembling, uncertainwhat this unusual clamour and strange voice might mean."I gave you my camel, my knife, and my carpet. Where is the Pearl Iwas promised? Is not the moon at the full?"Merla heard these words with a thrill passing through every fibre.She knew her father had no pearl in his possession, but was nother name "Pearl of the Desert"? Next there came some confusedmurmur--seemingly words of apology--in her father's voice that shecould not catch, but the stranger interrupted angrily:"Unhappy man! tricked seller, tricked buyer, would you know wherethe Pearl is? would you know where your daughter hides? I haveheard that she has been seen with a stranger, a white-facedstranger--I know not if he be a leper or an Englishman--" with abitter laugh, "but in either case I want her not. Come, give me myknife, and I lead off my camel."Merla's heart failed, for her father gave a shriek as he heard theaccusation, and a shower of oaths and imprecations came to hershrinking ears. Nothing was clear any more; there was only clamourand raving in the hut. But once she caught the words, "to theriver--does he go to the river?" and above all the storm of wordsthere was the awful sound of the sharpening of a knife.Like a shadow, noiseless and silent, Merla crept swiftly, under theshade of the camel's body, across the enclosure to the mudpartition behind which her youngest brother slept, and roused him."Nungoon!" she said breathlessly, gripping his shoulder, "take thetrack to the river, and run for your life. You will overtake theEnglishman. Tell him this. 'Merla says: Run to the launch and getoff the land quickly, and never come back to Omdurman, or come witha guard. They seek to kill you here.' Go, brother; run!"The boy, startled from his sleep, gathered himself together androse. His sister, leaning over him with ashy face and fixed eyes,seemed like Fate itself directing him. Moreover, Oriental youth isaccustomed to obey unquestioningly. Without a word, simply with asign of assent, he fled out of the enclosure, down the track to theriver.Merla stepped back and out of the yard, and stood waiting, silentas before; she had formed her resolution, and all fear was past.The mats in front of the door were suddenly pushed aside, and astreak of light fell across the yard, but it could not touch her,sheltered by the wall. She saw her father rush out, wild-eyed, andthe long blade of the knife gleamed blue in the moonlight.Then, as he dashed through the enclosure entrance, she moved herfeet suddenly, scraping the sand, and then fled, wrapped inStanhope's long light overcoat, up towards the desert, away fromthe river. Krino, blinded, maddened by passion, glanced at the wallwhence came the scraping sound, and then, catching sight of aflying form in English dress, plunged with a cry of triumph afterit. Merla fled like the wind along in the shadow of the wall,keeping in the darkness, with her head down, fearing lest her barehead or bare feet might betray her. But Krino's eyes were fixed onthe silvery grey of the English overcoat, and, blind to all else,he raced on in the uncertain light with his eyes intent on theshoulders between which he would plunge his knife. Up through theheart of sleeping Omdurman, past silent huts and yellow walls thatgleamed pale in the moonlight, through the village to the desert,hunted and hunter fled on, and Krino's heart rose in savagetriumph."Fool! he cannot escape me now; by the river--yes, but not in thedesert; he cannot escape."And the desert was reached and entered, and still the two noiselessshadows fled over the sand.Merla's strength was failing: her sight was reeling; she could runno more. Only the joy of knowing that each step led the enemyfarther from her loved one had supported her till now. Now he wassafe, he must be away on the friendly river. There had been ampletime. Not now would it be possible for Krino to reach the riverbefore her lover had embarked. It was well. All was well! And theblack sand spun round her in the moonlight, as she heard the hissof her father's breath behind her. She wavered. With a bound theman threw himself forward. One stab, and the keen blade sankthrough the flesh below the shoulder, driving her forward, and shefell face downwards on the sand.Blind still with fury, the Soudanese bent down, tore at the head todrag it back that he might slash it from the body, and turned upthe face to the moonlight. Fixed in agony and triumph, it lookedback at him--the dead face of his daughter, the PEARL OF THEDESERT.IVThe last flare of the sunset was falling on the walls of Jerusalem,staining them crimson, and flooding all the enchanting circle ofthe hills that lie round the city with rosy light. Low down in oneof the depressions, where the long sun-rays could not reach, andthe olive-trees looked grey in the twilight, stood the grim, whiteMonastery of the Holy Virgin. The air was sweet and cool here, farfrom the pollution of the city, and the evening sky stretched fairand radiant above the purple hills. Unbroken quiet reigned, andonly one thing in the landscape moved--the figure of a girlascending swiftly a narrow, stony road under the shadow of thewall. She seemed burdened with many things that she was carrying,and oppressed with some haunting fear, for she looked backfrequently, and then pressed on with redoubled speed. The stonytrack brought her at last to the corner of the enclosure ofolive-trees belonging to the monastery; it branched here, one pathleading straight to the gates of the building, the other skirtingthe olive-wood plantation, and then passing on out into the barrenhills and open country towards Jericho. The girl took the secondtrack, and here, under the friendly shade of the sheltering trees,she walked more erect and easily. When she reached the farthercorner of the plantation she stopped and listened, gazing roundher. There was no sound, the light was failing, the hush deepening."Nicholas," she breathed in a clear whisper, leaning on the lowstone plantation wall, "are you there?" A rustling of some longrobe against bushes answered her--the olive branches were pushedaside, and the figure of a Greek priest came from between them.With a smile of intense joy on his face he leant over the wall, andclasped the girl's two soft hands in his."Esther!" he whispered back, "you have come; you have decided then,you are ready?""I am quite ready," answered the girl, pressing close to the walland lifting her face; the last gleam of gold light from the risingridge to the west touched it, and showed it was very fair. "If youare sure it is right, if you have faith in Jehovah to lead us."The priest's face, pale and emaciated, with the rapt look of thevisionary stamped upon it, lighted up suddenly with a newexaltation."I am quite sure. Last night when I was praying, still in doubt,before the great crucifix, I heard a voice from above saying:'Nicholas, you are absolved from further prayer and penance here.Go forth with the maiden you love and serve Me in the world. Thejoy of human hearts singing to Me in grateful praise is morepleasing to Me than these groans and tears and prayers. I havecreated the blue sky and the laughing seas and the green hills; goforth and see my works, and praise Me.'"The Jewish girl had listened intently, her face as rapt as hiswhile he spoke, the fire of joy glowing in her eyes."Come, then, at once," she murmured in an ardent whisper, andNicholas stepped over the low boundary into the hill road, nowwrapped in darkness. Before them still glimmered dimly the whiteoutlines of the monastery behind the trees. The man stoodmotionless, gazing at them, the girl's hand tightly clasped in hisand held against his breast."The agony, the misery I have suffered behind those walls," hemuttered, "for sixteen years!""It is over," murmured the girl; "come away to the hills; we haveno time to lose."She stooped to gather up the objects in the road. "I have broughtyou these things," she said confusedly, hardly audibly. "Changeinto them quickly, and then follow me up the road. No, I will takeall the rest," she added, as he took the bundle of clothing shegave him and stretched out his hand for the other smaller things."Hasten, Nicholas, it is so dangerous here!" With this partingentreaty she went on up the road carrying the bundles.After she had gone a little way she paused and listened--all wasquite still--the stars now showed fitfully in the deepening purpleof the sky, a little breeze blew gently up from the wildernesstowards Jerusalem. The girl sat down by the wall, with her backagainst it, and her hands clasped round her knees. Her face had astrange, wonderful beauty as she sat waiting, white-skinned andsoftly-moulded, with resolute, dark eyebrows drawn straight acrossthe calm forehead. A few moments passed, and then Nicholasapproached; his flowing priest's robes were gone, the high,straight, black hat of the order was no longer on his head: it wasbare, and the long uncut hair, as the Greeks wear it, was twistedin two thick fair coils round his head. Esther sprang up,untwisting a broad sash from her waist."Take this! No wait! let me twist it round your head--yes, so. Nowit looks like a Jewish turban. You have the robe and the hat withyou?--yes, bring them, bring them," and they hurried on, fleeingaway from the monastery. Esther knew a short track across the hillswhich in a little while joins the great main road to Jericho, thatdescends down and down through the bare rolling hills of thewilderness to the fair plain of the Jordan and the shores of theDead Sea. For the first few miles they sped on in silence withclasped hands, the night wind rushing against their faces, and nosound coming to their ears but the occasional whine of the hungryhyenas, prowling over the stony, starlit hills. In the man's breastswelled an exaltation beyond all words: it lifted him up so, thathis feet seemed flying over the rugged ground without touching it;the night-wind filled his veins with fire: his brain seemed alightand glowing. For years past the bare stone walls of his monk's cellhad given him pictures painted by his fevered fancy of such a walkas this through starlit, open spaces--a walk to life and freedom.For years his hot, caged feet had paced the stone cell floor,aching to pass the threshold; and for the last month ever sincefrom amongst the olive-trees he had seen the fair Jewish girl passby, a new vision had come upon those white-washed walls to add itstorture to the rest. Evening after evening he had stolen out atsunset to see her pass, as she came and went from the littlecluster of Jewish houses on the ridge beyond the monastery andwatched the sunlight play upon her brows and hair. Could thisthing, so divinely beautiful, be the creation of the devil todestroy men's souls? His reason revolted against it. If so, thewarm sunlight and radiant sky and air, the flowers and the purplehills, his weary eyes strained out to must be also the devil'swork, for all these things were akin, and the woman passing amongstthem was but the masterpiece made by the same hand."Say," he had said wearily, one night, to a monk passing him like asilent shadow on his way to his cell. "Is all the world the work ofthe devil?""Nay, brother, what blasphemy!" returned the other, startled beyondmeasure. "It is all the work of God" and Nicholas had passed intohis cell well pleased. And the next evening he had called softly tothe masterpiece of the Creator, as she went by, and the girl,startled and fearful at first, had spoken a few words out of sheerpity for the hungry, lonely soul looking out so wistfully at her;and then how soon had come other meetings, the plan to escape--thatfinal vision which had seemed to justify him,--and now the flight!"Will the boat be there! will they wait for us?" he asked eagerly,as they walked swiftly on."Yes, I heard the boat was coming over from the Jewish Colonybeyond the Dead Sea, and I sent word down it was to take me in itwhen it left again," the girl replied, "We shall get down thereto-morrow evening; we will go to old Solomon's house; he will letus stay with him one night, and in the morning we must get down tothe shore and the boat."Nicholas pressed her hand as they walked on. How wise she was, thislittle Jewish girl! She had lived her short life in the world, andknew her way about in it so well. And he, so much older, felt likea child beside her, after all those long, deadening, numbing yearsin the monastery.Five miles more of the white, stony road were traversed, winding inand out, but always descending between the barren desolate hills ofthe wilderness, and then Esther said with a little sob in hervoice:"We must stop here now and rest, I am so tired. I cannot go anyfurther to-night.""Tired?" he echoed wonderingly. Could he ever feel tired now? Hisfeet seemed borne on wings. But he stopped, and bending over her,lifted and carried her tenderly from the starlit road to a largerock jutting out from the hillside. Here, in the shadow on thefarther side, they lay down, and the girl fell at once into thedeep sleep of utter bodily fatigue. The man lay open-eyed claspingher to him, his brain on fire with freedom, listening with joy tothe cries of the wandering wild animals amongst the hills.The following evening, late, they reached the plain. The wildernesslay behind them, and in front, beyond the green darkness of thetrees, they knew the starlight was gleaming on the Dead Sea. Theheat down here was suffocating, and their weary feet moved onslowly through the village--a collection of a few white flat-roofedhouses, which are all that now mark the spot where stood once therich, mighty city of Jericho. In the last house shone a light, andEsther led Nicholas towards it.Solomon was waiting for them, and had prepared for them his bestupper room--a little narrow apartment, with windows facing towardsthe sea--where supper was laid, and opening from this a tinysleeping chamber. A swinging lamp hung over the centre table, andSolomon's younger brother waited on them. Esther, with the dust ofthe road washed from her skin, looked very fair, sitting under thelight of the lamp, her eyes glowing with the mysterious fires oflove and joy, and the two Jews sat listening to her eagerly as shetalked to them, telling them the news of her family and friends inJerusalem."If I could only go up to the city," sighed the younger man. "But Icannot walk, and I have no horse," and he grew sullen and dejectedand said no more, while the elder continued to ask and be answereda hundred questions about the life and doings of the city.That night, past midnight, when the whole plain of Jericho laywrapped in a deep hush, and not one light gleamed in the darknessof the village, a carriage drawn by two foam-covered horsesthundered down the last steep descent of the road from Jerusaleminto the village, and dashed through it straight to Solomon'sdwelling. Esther, asleep in the upper room, with Nicholas' headpillowed on her shoulder, heard the clatter of wheels and awokesuddenly, all her body growing rigid with terror."Nicholas, awake! they have followed us!" She sprang from the bed,and opening the window noiselessly, looked out. The night was quitedark, but by straining her eyes she could descry the form of acovered carriage below, and two dark figures stood hammering on thehouse-door. The sounds rang reverberating through the dwelling, anddisturbing the still, calm air without, laden with the scent ofmyrtle and orange-flower. A window above opened, and the old Jewlooked out."Who knocks?" he called."Priests from Jerusalem, from the Monastery of the Holy Virgin. Onewhom we seek is within; let us enter." Esther drew back into theroom, and saw Nicholas standing behind her, his face haggard withdespair. "Jehovah, then, is not with us."Esther pressed his hand."Esther is with you," she murmured softly. "You shall not go back,they shall not touch you. Give me your priest's clothing, and stayhere."Before he could answer she had snatched up the garments and wasgone, fastening the door behind her. Outside on the stairway shemet old Solomon, coming slowly down to answer the imperativesummons from below."Delay all you can in admitting them," she whispered, then ran pasthim, fleet of foot, up the stairs to the Jews' room--the door stoodopen as Solomon had left it. She entered, and stood within in thedarkness."Hiram," she called softly, "you wished to go up to Jerusalem. Nowis your opportunity. Get up, put on these things, and the priestswill take you back in their carriage." She heard the man rise andbound to the floor."Is that you, Esther? Have they sent from the monastery to takeNicholas?""Yes," returned Esther in an agonised voice. "But you will not letthem take him? See, Hiram, they cannot hurt you; they will notrecognise you, nor suspect you here in the darkness, in the dressof Nicholas. You need not speak. They will hasten you into thecarriage. To-morrow when they discover you, it will be too late forthem to overtake us. We shall be gone, and _you_ they will notwant. They cannot put you in their monastery. They must releaseyou, and you--will be at the gates of Jerusalem."Her low voice, thrilled with her agony of fear and suspense: therewas the very soul of persuasion in it. As she pleaded in thedarkness, she heard the man breathing quickly, and shuffling hisfeet on the floor. He was hesitating. He longed to go up to thecity, but this seemed a dangerous expedient. Yet it would serveEsther, and she was very fair, and was of his own kindred. Therewas a noise and clamour downstairs beneath them--the sound of theslow unbarring of bolts, and angry voices without. Esther drewnearer, and her voice grew sharp with fear:"Hiram, as they are pushing you to the carriage, I will throwmyself into your arms, and you shall kiss me your last farewell, asif you were Nicholas."In the darkness she felt that the man stretched out his hand."Give me the clothes; I will go."Esther threw them into his arms, and darted out, closing the door,and hung over the stair-rail. There was no light, but she couldhear the heavy footsteps coming up. Nearer they came, and nearer,stumbling, and Solomon's step behind, as he followed the priests,grumbling and protesting. Now they were almost opposite the door ofthe room where Nicholas crouched waiting."He is not here! he is not here!" wailed out Esther's voicesuddenly from above, and the priests hearing her, rushed up thestairs to where she stood, passing by, forgotten, the door of thelower room.Rigid and tense she stood before the door as if guarding it, herarms outstretched before it. The first priest pushed her roughly onone side, the second opened the door, and beyond, dimly outlinedagainst the open window square, was visible the draped figure andheavy hat of a priest. With a shout of triumph they darted forward,and Esther gave a great cry of wild despair. The priests draggedhim out unresisting, and forced him down the stairs. No word camefrom him. Solomon, leaning back against the wall to let them pass,stretched out his hand to the weeping Esther; but she passed him,crying and hurrying after her lover. Down in the passage the largedoor stood wide, showing the waiting carriage in the dim starlightof the sultry night. As they pushed him to the door, he suddenlywrested himself free for an instant, and Esther rushed into hisarms."Oh, Nicholas, Nicholas! Good-bye!"The priests seized her by the shoulder, wrenching her away, and onehurled her with a fury of loathing back into the darkness of thepassage. Then they forced their prisoner forward, stumbling,resisting, to the carriage. The door snapped to, the horses plungedforward, and the carriage thundered away into the night. Estherpicked herself up from where she had fallen in the passage, andbruised and trembling, but with a joyous smile, rushed up thenarrow stairway."Solomon!" she said, whispering in the old Jew's ear, "Hiram hasgone in the place of Nicholas! Nicholas is safe here. Oh, help usto get to the sea!"Solomon shook with laughter as he heard--for a Jew loves dearly aclever ruse--and he stroked Esther's soft hair as she stood by him."Light us a lamp, and let us get away to the shore, that we canembark and be away on the water at dawn, before they discover itand return," Then she passed by him and entered the room whereNicholas awaited her. Solomon trimmed a lamp and a lantern forthem, and put up some bread and meat for their journey, hisshoulders shaking with inward chuckles as he did so."Hiram a priest!" he repeated to himself; "that is a joke indeed,and Esther, what a quick brain she has--a true daughter of Israel!"and Esther was murmuring within to Nicholas:"Jehovah has saved us. Now let us hasten down to the sea."The next morning, when the dawn broke soft and rosy over the fairplain of Jericho, the sea that is called the Dead Sea, yet seems,in its glorious wealth of colour and sparkling brilliance to berather the emblem of Life, glowed and flashed like a huge sapphirein the sun's rays, and at its calm edge, that meets the shorewithout a ripple, swayed gently the ship of the pilgrims from theJewish Colony.Nicholas and Esther sat side by side watching the pilgrims' oarsdip quietly in perfect rhythm as they sang. And the song of praisewent up through the golden air, and echoed back to the sunny,silent strand vanishing behind them.VDawn was breaking over the desert. Steadily the triumphant rosespread upward in the pale opalescent sky, and broad waves of lightrippled slowly over the wide level plain. The little keen breeze ofthe morning, the herald of the dawn that runs ever in front of itschariot, stirred the branches of the palm trees by the Nile, andplayed a moment idly with the flap of a tent door before it passedonward. Here, some two miles away from cool Assouan, lying out inthe desert, was the Bishareen encampment, and the last small tentof the long line had its door open, and the flap of the awningloose, with which the morning wind stopped to play.Within, seated cross-legged on the scarlet rug and sheepskin whichformed their bed, were two girls braiding their hair before a tinysquare of glass, which each in turn held up for the other."How cold the morning is! How I hate to hear the wind shake thedoor flaps," one said and shivered."Doolga, don't; you are holding the glass all crooked; I cannot seemyself. Why should you feel cold this morning of all others, whenSheik Ilbrahim dar Awaz is coming to claim you?" returned theother, and she laughed softly, with her slim fingers busy trying tobind up and restrain her dusky cloud of hair.How lovely she was, this young Bishareen, who had looked on theyearly fall of the Nile but fifteen times--lovely as the tallslender palm of the oasis, or the gold light on the river atsunset. Tall and straight, with the stately carriage and proud headof her race; smooth and supple, with every limb faultlessly mouldedunder the clear, lustrous skin."Silka, Silka! I cannot marry the Sheik. I am in terror of him.Help me, save me!"The little glass fell on the blanket between them. In the warm roseglow now filling the tent, Doolga's face was ashen-coloured.Awe-struck and startled Silka gazed wide-eyed upon her. For aninstant the two girls sat staring in silence into each other'seyes. So much alike they were that one face seemed the reflectionof the other, only there was a bloom, a light, a sweetness onSilka's that was missing in the other."Why?" she breathed after that first startled silence, "what is thematter, Doolga? Tell me; tell me everything."She drew nearer her sister, and put one arm round her. The pinklight from without, striking through the tent canvas, touched herface, showing its delicately-cut, exquisite features and the tenderlove filling the eyes."I hate the Sheik!" sobbed Doolga, putting down her head on theother's soft bare shoulder; "I don't want him. I love _him_!"And Silka felt that everything indeed was told. The incoherent,inexplicable words were clear enough to her. She trembled all over,and the two girls clung together in the little tent, while thenoise of a large encampment awakening grew about them outside.Suddenly Doolga grew calm; she lifted her face, and Silka saw itwas grey, with great lines of anguish cut in it, and her heartseemed to contract with pain, for she loved Doolga better thananything she knew in the world, and Doolga's suffering was hersuffering."I thought, father thought you would be glad to marry the Sheik,"she faltered."I cannot. I will throw myself into the Nile rather; Silka, helpme!""How can I?""_You_ marry the Sheik!" Doolga's eyes were alight with flame.Something of the tiger's glare shone in them. She bent forward andseized the other girl's wrists in a feverish grip. The clasp hurtand burnt like fire. Silka drew back instinctively, paling withsurprise."I marry the Sheik?" she repeated, "but--""Yes, you _must_! Oh, Silka, you have always loved me: save me now.I cannot. It will be death to me. I love--I love--" she hesitated;then added, "so much. You love no one. Why not then the Sheik? Dothis for me. I will think of you, bless you always. Save me fromdeath; save me from the Nile!"The burning words, uttered low, in that strange, strained voice shehardly recognised, fell upon Silka like drops of molten lead. Hersister seemed mad: her eyes started forward from her livid face:her clasp on Silka's wrists gripped like iron. Silka's heart wasoverwhelmed with pity and distress."How can I?" she murmured back, bewildered by the sudden revelationof misery in the other--this other that had grown up with her,played with her, slept with her side by side through the soft, hotnights when they had lain counting the stars through a chink in thetent. Side by side their bodies had nestled together, and side byside their hearts had always been."You have but to unveil your face to the Sheik," returned the otherquickly, eagerly, almost furiously, "and he will take you insteadof me. Think, Silka! the head of the tribe, fifty camels, athousand goats--" She stopped in her eager outpour of persuasion.Silka was looking at her straight from under her dark, level brows,her lips curled in a sorrowful disdain."Have his riches any weight with you, Doolga? Why do you offer themto me?" she said proudly."Because you are free: you do not love," impetuously returned theother with glib, persistent vehemence. "I would marry the Sheik, Iwould prize his flocks, his riches; but I love--I love--I cannot!""Whom do you love so much?" replied Silka sadly. "Why have you nottold me? Who is he?"The girls were seated on the bed in one corner of the tent closebeside its stretched canvas wall. There was a little eyelet, asquare hole with a flap buttoned down over it, on a level withtheir heads. At Silka's question Doolga turned to the canvas, and,with an impatient movement, tore up the flap and looked out. Theplain was bathed in gold: above, the pure, pink glow still hung inthe limpid sky. The encampment was astir. The tents were open, andlittle cooking fires, sending up their spirals of blue smoke weredotted over the sand. At a few paces' distance from the main row oftents, the camels, lying down, made a velvet-like patch of shade onthe gleaming gold of the sand, and herds of white goats stood near,their silky coats flashing in the morning sunlight. Silka lookedout, too, over her sister's shoulder. She saw the burnished gold ofthe plain and the luminous sky, and between these two a figurethat stood by a low brown tent, with the sunlight falling full onits noble brow and the straight profile turned towards them. Doolgawrung Silka's hand, that she still clutched, as they knelt side byside on the sheepskin looking through the eyelet."That is he!" she said, and Silka's lips parted suddenly in alittle scream of pain."What is the matter?" asked Doolga roughly, drawing her back fromthe aperture, and letting the flap fall."You hurt me," replied Silka. "Is that the one you love?" Her voicesounded tremulous: her eyes, fixed on Doolga, seemed to widen withincreasing pain."Yes, that is he; that is Melun," answered Doolga softly. "Is henot handsome, wonderful? Why do you stare so? Might not any girllove him?"A little smile played round Silka's lips."Yes, indeed, any girl might love him," she answered."But not as I do--no, never! Oh, Silka, I cannot tell you how Ilove him. More than the Nile, more than the stars, more than wehave ever loved each other! I have met him often when I went todraw water, and sometimes we have stayed together in thepalm-grove. I was so happy till father sold me to the Sheik; andnow I must part from Melun for ever! Do not make me, dear, darlingSilka; do not send me to the Nile!" She spoke with increasingexcitement, with passionate intensity. She was close to Silka, andshe laid one arm softly round her neck and put her face close tohers. Such a beautiful oval face it was!--the face that Silkaloved: as she looked at it, her heart melted within her."See, dearest Silka," continued the other coaxingly, "you havenothing to do but to unveil before the Sheik; you are just like me,only a thousand times lovelier. He will not want me then, but you.You can say to our father: As I am fairer than my sister, he willgive you two more camels. Father will be pleased with the camels,and I shall be left free to marry Melun.""But suppose I don't want to marry the Sheik either," said Silka,slowly stroking the curls of the sheepskin as she looked down uponit."But why should you not? he has flocks and herds; he will give younecklets and bracelets, and a camel to ride, and take you to theoasis? Why should you mind?""It is late, Doolga. Father will be returning soon. Go, fill yoururns at the well.""But will you promise--?""I can promise nothing yet. Go, go, leave me, you must let me thinka little."Doolga got up well satisfied. She knew Silka had never refused heranything since they had first played as babies together in thesand. Silka loved her. Silka had never denied her anything.She took her large earthenware jar, poised it on her shoulder, andwent out of the tent into the hot light. Silka lay on the sheepskinwhere her sister had left her, and turned her face to it, shakenwith a storm of feeling that convulsed her slender body from headto foot. She heard none of the cheerful sounds of life stirringround the tent; she heard only Doolga's threat of the Nile, herpassionate pleading for help. Her face was buried in the sheepskin,yet she saw plainly in the wall of darkness before her eyeballsthe figure of the Bishareen standing out against the pink light ofthe morning sky. So it was Melun that Doolga loved! And to Melunall her own passionate impulsive heart had been given through hereyes. Had she not, morning after morning, gazed out through thesquare eyelet to catch a glimpse of him as he came from his tent,dressed in his snowy white linen tunic, and with countless stringsof coloured beads twisted round the firm column of his throat andhanging from his arms? Melun, the necklace-seller of Assouan!Melun, that the foreign tourists stopped to gaze after, as hewalked with slow and stately steps beneath the lebek trees on the"boulvard" by the Nile. Young and straight and slender, with abeautiful face and form, he never offered his wares for sale. Hesimply stood and looked at the tourists, and they came and boughtlargely. They came up to him with curious eyes to chaffer for hisblue-glass beads, and stare at his smooth, perfectly-moulded armsand throat, at the wonderfully straight features, and the loftycarriage of his head, at the thick hair, like fine, black wool,that waved above his forehead and clustered round the nape of hisneck, interwoven with his brilliant blue beads. Ah! how she lovedMelun! how she had dreamed of the day when her elder sister,happily married, she herself could go to her father and say, "LetMelun, the necklace-seller, come to the tent and see my face." Andnow, not for him, but for the old hard-visaged Sheik, she was askedto unveil. "I cannot do it; no, I cannot," she muttered to herself,and the thought of Melun came to her softly. "I have but to look athim, and he must love me; he is mine." Did not her mirror tell herthis each morning? Had not her sister but now said the same? Shesmiled to herself, and balm seemed poured through her. Then therecame another thought piercing her like a dagger. Melun is not mine,but hers. She loves him; he loves her. They have met in thepalm-grove. Never, never, could she unveil for him now. He mustnever see her. Though he loved her a thousand times, yet wouldshe never take him from Doolga. Doolga, bright, graceful, andbeautiful, the light of her eyes, the joy of the tent! could shebear to see her brought through the door cold, motionless,lifeless, killed by the embrace of the Nile?When Doolga returned with the flush of warmth on her cheek and thejar full of shimmering water on her shoulder, Silka was sittingupright on the bed with dry, wide eyes. One glance at her toldDoolga that she herself was free, that the other would take up herburden and bear it for her. She crossed over with a quick beautifulmovement, lithe, free, untamed."Darling Silka, you will consent? you will promise?""Do you meet him often in the palm-grove?" returned Silka; it wasnow her eyes that were full of flame as she met her sister's."Why--Melun? Yes, whenever it was possible. To-night there will beno moon; I was going, but why should you ask?" She bent forwardquickly, eagerly, some faint suspicion stirring in her."If I do this for you--if I save you--if I show myself to theSheik, then you must let me go to the palm-grove to-night."Doolga fell back from her, surprise and terror and horror minglingin her face. She clasped her small, soft hands together and wrungthem."Oh, Silka! you know, if he sees you, he will not look at me again;he will not care."Silka smiled a slow, painful smile."Do you not see?" she said in a whisper. "I shall go as you. Whowill know it is not you? Not Melun. He will be expecting you! hehas never seen me. I will not betray myself nor you, but this is mycondition. To-morrow I go in your stead to the Sheik; to-night, Igo in your stead to Melun."Doolga stared at her, barely comprehending."But why--why?" she stammered in return."I go to the Sheik in your stead because I love you, and to Melunin your stead because I love him," replied Silka firmly.There was a smile in her eyes, but her lips were pale, compressed,and sad. Doolga gazed at her in silence, both hands clasped tightlynow over her swelling breast. Astonishment, gratitude, mistrust,and jealousy were all struggling together within it for mastery."You love Melun too?" she said at last. "Then why do you not takehim? One glance from you and he is yours.""He was yours first," answered Silka miserably. "I cannot take himfrom you.""And you will marry the Sheik to save me?""Yes," replied Silka.Then Doolga fell on her knees and thanked Silka and kissed her, andDoolga's kisses were very sweet, and while those lips pressed hersSilka forgot everything else in the world. At last Doolga said in asudden recrudescence of jealousy:"In the grove to-night you will not--" and the rest was whispered."No," answered Silka; "I am the bride of the Sheik. You need fearnothing. But I must see Melun; all my life long I shall feed onyour happiness. There will be nothing else for me. I shall live onit. To do this I must have a vision of it before I go, and it willstay by me for ever."That afternoon the tent was gay with unrolled silks and scarletrugs, and coffee stood out in little porcelain cups upon the floor,for the Sheik Ilbrahim had come to the final parley for his bride.He sat before the coffee-cups on a black goat-skin, the pipe ofhonour placed beside him. A grave, quiet man, with kind eyes, butalready far on in the winter of life. Opposite him sat his host,the owner of the tent and father of the girls. Shrewd-eyed,keen-faced, quietly he did his bargaining. Earlier in the day theelder girl had laid the plan before him: herself for Melun, thenecklace-seller of Assouan, who owned neither camels nor goats, butwould pay well in silver straight from the hands of the tourists;her younger sister for the Sheik, who would give doubtless two morecamels for her wonderful beauty. The father listened placidly. Itwas not a bad bargain."But," he answered finally, "why should you not go to the Sheik nowfor two camels and by and by another will come for your sister andgive four camels. Then shall I have had six for the two of you.""But she may die," objected the ready Doolga, the keen-witteddaughter of her father. "Better secure the camels now, father.""True, she may die, and the bargain be lost," mused the father,and at last he spread out his hands with a gesture of conclusion."It is for the Sheik to decide," he said merely, and Doolga wascontent. She knew beforehand what the Sheik would decide when hesaw her sister. Now the two girls sat clasped in each other's armsbehind a curtain hung across a corner of the tent, and waitedsilently till they should be summoned."If she be fairer than your daughter Doolga," they heard the Sheiksay good-humouredly, "she must be fair indeed, and worth fourcamels. Let me see her."At those words Silka rose and stepped from behind the littlecurtain. With timid steps she came forward to the centre of thetent. A linen tunic clasped round the base of her throat fellalmost to her ankles, caught lightly in at the waist by a scarletcord; loose sleeves falling from the shoulder half-concealed herrounded arms; but her lovely face, with its arching brows andliquid eyes, looked out unveiled from her frame of cloudy hair, anddrew the Sheik's heart towards her. Wrapt in the enthusiasm of theholiest of all loves, that of sister for sister, tense with theardour of her sacrifice, a light shone out from the tender soulwithin that fired all her beauty, making it burn like the sun, andintoxicate like wine.Her father eyed her, and wished he had asked five camels.The Sheik stretched out his right hand towards her."Are you pleased to come, my daughter, to the oasis of roses withme?""My lord beholds his slave," answered Silka, and her eyes were fullof light, and her lips were curved in smiles."My camels, four of the best, will find their stable behind yourtent to-night," said the Sheik to her father, and he filled the cuphe had drunk from and handed it to the girl. Silka raised it to herlips."Does it please my lord that he fetch me to-morrow, and leave me inmy father's tent to-night?"The Sheik laughed good-naturedly, his eyes fixed on the pleading,youthful face."It pleases me not to leave you; but if you ask me, little one, Iwill not refuse. Let it be so."As he spoke Silka drained the coffee-cup he had given her, and byso doing bound herself to him henceforward.There was no moon that night; it was dark with the darkness of thedesert, and the splendour of its million stars. As Silka camesoftly from the tent she looked upwards; the wild heaving of herbosom seemed repeated in that restless, pulsing light above. Thesoft breath of the desert came to her; it whispered of Melunwaiting for her in the palm-grove. How happy she was! This waslife: one night of life was hers--no more. With the dawn came theend. This was her first--her last--night of life, but how exquisiteit was! The voice of the desert sang in her ears, the light softsand caressed her flying feet. Within bounded her heart, buoyantwith leaping joy. Never had she realised the strength of her swift,straight ankles--never till now the free, joyous power in hersupple limbs.Before her rose the palm-grove, distinct in all its beauty offeathery-topped trees, against the gorgeous starlit sky. By herside gleamed now the line of the river, silver in the starlight;smooth and lovely, studded with its fierce black rocks, flanked byits orange sand, and here and there, on its edge in the radiantdarkness, rose a lofty palm lifting its swaying branches towardsthe jewelled sky. Silka looked at the river curiously. Now she waskeenly alive; life was sharp and alert in every fibre, but it wasthe last. This night of life was also a night of good-byes.To-morrow she would look on the river again, but she would be deadthen--dead to joy and to love; it would only be Doolga who would beliving rich in both these gifts--gifts given by her. The thoughtran through her with a tumultuous gladness.She entered the palm-grove and went straight to the tree thatDoolga had told her of, a withered palm. A figure sat at the footof the tree. The starlight gleamed on its white clothing. Silka'sfeet stopped mechanically as she saw him; her heart beat so thatshe could scarcely breathe; but he had caught sight of her, andsprang to his feet and came towards her. How wonderful he was withhis fine head set on that long, firm throat, and how sweet the facewhen his beautiful mouth broke into smiles as he saw her!"Doolga!" he exclaimed, and then paused. She heard the little noteof wonder, of joy, in his voice, as she looked up at him in thesoft starlight, filtered through the palms. She was close to him,and his voice, his presence was a new wonder to her."You are lovelier to-night than ever before. You have a new beauty,what is it?" and he stretched out his arms passionately to her andenfolded her in them close to his breast and kissed her. Then inone moment did the rose of life, that unfolds slowly for mostmortals petal by petal, bloom suddenly for her whole and complete,and fill her with its wild fragrance, overwhelming her senses. Thehappiness of a hundred lives was compressed into that one perfectmoment when his lips touched hers, and she saw his face hang overhers in the starlight, blazing with the fires of love."This then is life," she thought, as she put her arms round hisneck. "This is what I am giving to Doolga.""Am I really more beautiful to-night than I have been?" she askedpresently, as they sat crouched close side by side at the foot ofthe palm, looking towards the silver river."A thousand times!" he answered passionately. "I have never lovedyou, never seen you as I do to-night.""Then you must always remember me as you see me now. However Doolgalooks to you in the future, always remember this night, and how youloved her then."And he took her more closely into his arms, and pressed kisses onher eyes, and told her in low murmured words of the tent he waspreparing for her, pitched where the cool breeze from the Nilewould reach them, and of the coming sunsets when she would sitawaiting his return in the doorway, and of the still radiant hoursof the desert night which would pass over them full of deliriousjoys; and the girl listened and lived out her life in those momentsagainst his heart. And ever as she listened, the thought of theSheik and his withered arms rose before her. Still it was Doolga'sfuture she looked into, the secrets of Doolga's happiness shelearned. As often as he murmured, "Doolga!" and caressed her, awave of joy passed through her.Three hours before the dawn they parted, and with slow, sad stepsshe returned to her father's tent. Her strength was spent. Lifeand she had finally separated. Entering the tent with noiselessfeet, no sound disturbed the sleeping chief, and she crept to whereher sister sat up, wild-eyed and sleepless, on the bed."This he gave to Doolga," she said, with her lips pressed toDoolga's ear, and passed over her head a necklace of faultlessbeads of jade.       *       *       *       *       *The following day, when the last flare of the sunset lit up the skywith flame, and the delicate branches of the palms of the oasisshowed before them tipped with gold, the Sheik Ilbrahim bent overhis bride sitting before him on the camel, decked out with goldornaments in her hair. He saw her smiling, and a glory that was notof the sunset on her face."Of what is my beloved one thinking?" he asked her.She looked up, but she did not see his face above her. She saw onlythe tent where the wind from the Nile could come, and Doolga withinradiant with the joy she had given her."Of what should your slave be thinking, lord," she answered, "butlove and happiness?"VIIt was evening. A sky of purest emerald, luminous, transparent, anddivinely calm, stretched over the city of Damascus, that lies inits white glory, wrapped round by its mantle of foliage, in theheart of the burning desert--unhurt, cool, invulnerable in the jawsof the all-devouring desert sand. In the East, with the first coolbreath of evening comes a spirit of rejoicing: the heat and burdenof the day are over, and there is one hour of pure delight beforethe darkness. This hour had come to Damascus: the roses liftedtheir heads in the garden, the birds burst into joyous floods ofsong, and the trees waved and spread their branches to the littlebreeze that came rippling through the crystal air.Almost on the confines of the city, where the belt of protectingverdure grows thin and the gaunt face of the desert presses againstthe city walls, rose the square, white dwelling of Ahmed Ali, andhis garden was the largest and most beautiful of the city. Highwhite walls enclosed it on every side, and from the broad,travelled highway that ran beside it the dusty and wearied wayfareroften lifted his eyes to the profusion of gay roses, the syringa,and star-eyed jasmine that tumbled jubilantly over the edge, andhung their scented wreaths far above his head. The tinkling of afountain could be heard within, and the mad rapture of song fromthe birds in the evening, when the scent of the orange blossomstole softly out on the radiant golden air. On the other side ofthe garden was a grove of orange-trees. The rich, glossy, greenfoliage rose in dark masses above the high wall, and someinquisitive, encroaching boughs stretched over and occasionallydropped their golden fruit into Ahmed's garden. On the inside ofthe old, moss-grown wall were numerous buttresses, and in theseangles and corners, sheltered from any breeze, the roses and thesmall fruit-trees fairly rioted together, blending their masses ofpink and white bloom.On this evening, when the sky shone like one sheet of purestmother-of-pearl, green and rose and faint purple, the garden wasvery still; the only sound was the murmur of the falling water, thecoo of some white doves in a pear-tree, and a very light steppacing on the tiny narrow path that wound its way round the wholegarden amongst the rose-bushes and lemon-trees.Dilama, the youngest of the ladies of the harem, was walking in thegarden with her white veil thrown back and a smile on her small,red, curling lips. She stooped here and there to gather a flowerwhenever a bud or blossom of particular beauty caught her eye, andfastened now one against her thick brown hair, and now one or twoupon the rich-embroidered muslin that covered the upper part of herbosom. She was intensely happy: in the spring at Damascus, atseventeen and in love, who would not be happy? The fires of youthand love and joy burned in her flesh and danced in her veins andshone in her eyes, and she sang and smiled to herself as shegathered the flowers. She was a Druze woman, and gifted with thewonderful beauty that Nature has showered on the women of Syria.Skins that the most perfect Saxon skin of milk and rose canscarcely rival are wedded to eyes of Eastern midnight and browntresses filled with shining lights of red and gold. She had beenborn in the fierce, barren mountains lying behind Beirut, and ateight years old had drifted--part of the spoils of a raid--into thekeeping of Ahmed Ali, the richest landowner and merchant ofDamascus. He was a Turk, of pure Turkish blood, and with the large,generous heart and the kindly nature of the Turk. All the life thatowed him allegiance, that was supported by his hand, was happy andwell cared for--from the magnificent black horses, ignorant of whipand spur, that filled his stables, and the dogs that lay peacefullyabout in his palace, to the beauties of the harem, who trippedabout gaily singing and laughing in their cool halls and shadedgarden. Where the Turk rules there is usually peace, for his natureis pacific, and in the palace of Ahmed there was joy and peace andlove and pleasure in abundance. There were seven ladies of theharem, including Dilama, and six of these were happy wives ofAhmed. Each had one or more sons, handsome, large-eyed, sedatelittle Mohammedans, who were being trained by Turkish mothers inall sorts of gentle ways and manners--in thought and care forothers, in courtesy and kindness; and who were very different intheir childish work and play from the brawling, selfish, cruellittle monsters that European children of the same age mostly are.But Dilama was not yet Ahmed's wife; she loved him most truly anddeeply as an affectionate daughter. For who could not love Ahmed?There was a charm in his stately beauty of face and figure, in thekind musical voice, in the eyes so large and dark and gentle, thatwas irresistible. But to Dilama he was something far above her: herking, her lord indeed, for whom she would lay down life itselfwithout question, but not the man to whom her ardent simple naturehad turned for love. Ahmed had not sought her. When first she cameto his palace she had been too young except for him to treat asa pretty child, and the relationship of father and daughterthen established had never yet been broken in upon. And thelight-hearted, sunny-natured Druze girl had taken life just as shefound it, regarding herself as Ahmed's daughter, and rejoicing inher home of love and beauty she ceased to remember that one day hewould inevitably claim her as his wife, and that that day must bethe beginning or the end of happiness just as she prepared for it.But she did not prepare for it, she ignored it: flitting like somegolden butterfly through the pleasant hours, and growing fairerevery day, so that the harem women looked at her with a littlesinking of the heart yet no ill-will, and said amongst themselves,"Surely Ahmed must choose her soon." But Ahmed loved at that timewith his whole soul a Turkish woman, and she was to give himshortly a second child, and for fear of disturbing her peace ofmind Ahmed remained in the Selamlik, and would not visit his otherwives, nor send for Dilama, though his eyes, like the others, notedher growing beauty day by day."I will wait in patience," he thought, looking out one morning atsunrise, and watching Dilama playing with the white doves on thebasin edge of the fountain. "I will wait till Buldoula is well andstrong again. She would fret now, and think I was forgetting her ina new love if I call Dilama to me yet. I will wait till her secondson is born, and then in her joy and pride she will not be jealousof the new wife."So he waited, but in the game of love he that waits is ever theloser. That night, when the moon was rising over the white and deepgreen of Damascus, Dilama walked, humming to herself, in thegarden, full of a great leaping desire, born of her youth and finehealth and the breath of the May night, to love and be loved.Suddenly, when she came to the corner, under the drooping boughs ofthe grove without the garden, an orange fell, and, just escapingher head struck her heavily on her bosom. With a great shock shestood still, looking up, and there, on the summit of the high wall,amid the green boughs, was a man sitting, leaning over down towardsher, with fiery eyes looking upon her from under a dark greenturban."It is death to be here," she whispered, her face pallid in themoonlight, "do not stay;" yet her whole being leapt up with hopethat he would disobey. The man laughed softly."It is life to look on you," he said merely, and to her terrifiedjoy and horrified delight he slid down between the lemon-trees andthe wall, and stood before her in the angle it made, where twobuttresses jutting forward hid him from all view unless one stooddirectly opposite.Dilama shook from head to foot; in one fierce, sweeping rush,love passed over and through her as she stood staring with wilddilated eyes on the form before her. Tall, tall as Ahmed, withall the grace and strength of youth, lithe and supple, with astraight-lined, dark-browed face above a stately throat, and darkkindling eyes, wells of living fire that called all her soul andheart and womanhood into life."I have often watched you walking in the garden," he murmured,gently taking in his, one nerveless hand. "I come from your villagein the hills, where you were taken from long ago. I am a Druze,"and he threw his head higher, as the stag of the forest throws hisat the first note of the challenge. Dilama knew well that he wasof her own people. Infant memories, instinctive, implantedconsciousness told her this without the aid of Druze clothing, orthe short, gay dagger thrust into his waist-sash."I think you are not yet the wife of Ahmed Ali?" he went on, asshe simply trembled in silence, wave after wave of emotion passingthrough her, striking her heart and choking her voice. "Tell me?"Dilama shook her head, and a triumphant smile curved the handsomelips before her."I knew it; you are mine," he said, in reply, and, bending over heras she stood shrinking, on the verge of fainting, between terrorand wonder and joy, he kissed her on the lips, not roughly--evengently--but with such a fire of life on his that it seemed to thegirl, in the destruction of all her usual feelings, in the havoc ofthe new ones called in their place, that the actual moment ofdissolution had come.That had been some three weeks ago, and now, on this soft, pearlyevening, she was waiting eagerly for the sky to deepen, and thelight of the stars to sharpen, and the orange to fall over thewall. For the Druze had come many times, and no one had discoveredthe lovers, screened by masses of roses in the buttress-shelteredcorner of the wall. In fact, for the last weeks no one had had timeor thought for anything but Buldoula, who lay sick within thepalace walls, and attendants waited anxiously or ran hither andthither on various errands, and Ahmed was in the depths of anxiety;and no one thought about Dilama or paid any attention to her, andshe was radiantly happy and self-engrossed, and came and wentbetween the garden and her own little chamber as she listed,undisturbed. And this evening, as usual, she slipped unobservedamongst the roses into the corner of the buttressed wall. A momentafter the boughs overhead parted, and the lithe Druze dropped downnoiselessly beside her. She put her gold braceleted arms round hisstrong brown neck, and pressed her silken-covered bosom hardagainst his rough cotton tunic. A great rush of rosy light floodedall the sky for some minutes, then began to pale softly before theapproach of the lustrous purple dark.In the palace a light behind one of the mushrabeared windows wasextinguished; there was the sound of the scurry of feet, and then along wail came out from the building, rending the pink-huedtwilight."Buldoula is dead!" remarked Dilama simply, as the lovers crouchedtogether between the wall and the roses. It meant nothing to her,enclosed in the happy warmth of her lover's arms; death had nomeaning for her yet, hardly seventeen years' journey distant frombirth, and full of all the sap and great leaping fires of life.Death was something so far away, so impossible to realise. It wasbut a word to her--a casket enclosing nothing. Yet the death ofBuldoula was the embryo event in the womb of time from which was todevelop the whole tragedy of her own life."Buldoula is dead," she said again, carelessly, her rose-tippedfingers smoothing the black sweeping arch of the man's brows."Perhaps her son is dead also. Ahmed will be very grieved--she wasgoing to bear her second son.""Little dove! I must take you away to the mountains soon," said theDruze, clasping her tighter to him. "Soon," he muttered again,stooping down to look under the rose-boughs to the white-facedhouse, now, with all its screened windows, dark. His words seemedirrelevant, yet they were not. He had a keen prescience that thedeath of the favourite of the harem might influence very quicklyDilama's fate."Why not take me now, Murad? I want to see the mountains," and shelaid her little head, crowned by its masses of brown-gold hair, onhis warm breast."The caravan does not start for two weeks more," he answeredthoughtfully. "We must wait for it. It would be madness to try toescape alone. We should be seen, noted, and tracked down. Think howAhmed will look for his treasure when he finds it stolen! But ifyou are hidden in a bale of goods on a camel in the caravan, whowill suspect, who will know that the Druze has taken you? The wholecaravan of Druzes cannot be stopped because Ahmed has lost a wife!No, in the caravan, with all the rest, we are safe. There is noother way."There was silence while the twilight deepened in the garden, andthe stars began to show above like flashing swords in the sky. Inthe languor of love that knows no fear and has no cares, thatopiate of the soul, Dilama lay in his arms and sought his lips andeyes, and asked no more about caravans and journeys and mountains,drugged and heavy with love. In an hour when all was velvetblackness beneath the wall, they kissed farewell. He scaled thecrumbling bricks, and regained the sheltering orange grove, and shewalked slowly back, drawing smooth her filmy veil, towards thedarkened palace.Five days later at noontime, as Dilama was sitting in the gardenplaying with the tame white doves by the fountain, one of the blackfemale slaves approached her. Dilama looked up questioningly,holding a dove to her bosom."The lord is sorrowing within for his dead wife and dead son. Hehas sent for you; go in, and lead him away from grief," and thewoman smiled and prostrated herself before Dilama, who shrankinstinctively away like a frightened child. But there is only onelaw and one will in the harem, and she rose obediently, letting thedove go, and stood ready to follow the slave. That meaning smile onthe woman's face filled her with an intuitive, instinctive,undefined fear, and at the same instant there rushed over her therealisation of the great happiness that same smile would havebrought her had there been no Murad, had she fled from thatrose-filled corner on that first evening--had she, in a word,_waited_! This summons to the presence of their lord is what somany of the harem slaves pine and long for through weary months,and sometimes years. It came now to her, and it meant nothing butvague fear and dread. She followed the slave with unelastic steps,and her brain full of heavy thoughts; they passed the women'sapartments and went on to the Selamlik and to the room of Ahmed,that looked out with unscreened windows into the cool, deep greenof the garden. The slave drew back at the door, holding a curtainaside for the girl to enter. She went forward, the curtain fellbehind her, and she was alone with Ahmed.He was sitting opposite on a low divan or couch, clothed from headto foot in a deep blue robe, and with a turban of the same colourtwisted above his level brows--a kingly, majestic figure, and thegirl's heart beat and her eyelids fell as she crept slowly over thefloor towards him. At his feet she sank to her knees, and wouldhave put her forehead to the ground, but Ahmed bent forward, andclasping both her arms lifted her on to the couch beside him."And you are the Druze child, Dilama?" he said gently, and leaninga little back from her, surveyed her intently with dark lustrouseyes. The girl felt swooning with terror; before his gaze her veryflesh seemed dissolving. It seemed as if her heart, her brain, withthe image of Murad stamped on them, would be laid bare to thosebrilliant, searching eyes. What would he not know, suspect, findout? What would he ask? demand of her? She could not ask herself.Was this to be the end of his paternal relationship to her? thebeginning of a new one? She dared not lift her eyes lest he shouldsee their terror; the blood burnt in the surface of all her fairskin, as if red-hot irons were pressed to it. And Ahmed, gazingupon her with the pure noonday light, softened by the leafy screenwithout pouring over her, drank in her fair Syrian beauty withdelight. The pale, rose-hued silken clothing she wore harmonisedwith the ivory and rose of her round arms and throat and cheeks,and threw up the masses of dark hair that fell beneath her veil toher slender waist. Ahmed very gently unbound the snowy garment fromher head and stroked her hair lightly, watching the gold gleams inits ripples as his hand passed over them. He saw her dismay,confusion, even her terror, and noticed the quiver of her hands andthe irregular leap of her bosom, but these did not dismay him. Hewas accustomed to be beloved even as he loved, and the women of theharem who came to him in fear left him with happy confidence. Heaffected now not to see her embarrassment, thinking it to be onlythat, and said quietly, "And you have been happy, Dilama, in myhouse?" The girl felt she must speak, though her throat seemedclosed and her tongue nerveless."Very happy," she faltered at last in a whisper."But you have been lonely, perhaps?" he asked. "Have the roses anddoves in the garden been companions enough for you? Have you notbeen too much alone?"In the heavy load of apprehension of intangible fear and horrorthat seemed stifling her, a madness of longing came over the girlto be free from her guilty secret, to have never known Murad. Nowshe could have looked up fearless, full of expectant joy! She couldhave loved this man; she knew it, now that she felt his loveapproaching her: hope was dying within her that ever again would heregard her simply as his daughter. She knew those tones of thevoice, she had heard them from Murad in the garden, but here thevoice was infinitely more refined, the sound of it exquisitelymusical; and now, that love for her was in it, it told her a newsecret, that she could have given love for love. She knew, thoughher eyelids were down, how beautiful the face was that bent overher: the straight, severe lines of it, the magnificent eyes andbrows burnt through her lids. Ah, why had he waited so long, or shenot waited longer?Full of intolerable, irrepressible pain, she looked up at lastsuddenly."Why did not my lord come into the garden, to the roses and dovesand--me?" she asked falteringly, her gaze held now irresistibly bythe dark orbs above her. Then, afraid of her own temerity, shebecame white as death under his gaze.But Ahmed was rather pleased by this first connected speech shehad made in the interview. It sounded to him like the tenderreproach of an amorous, expectant maiden, waiting eagerly for herlove, too long delayed. The under-meaning, the terrible regret forirrevocable ill, naturally escaped him. He smiled, and put his armround her shoulders. "Well, it is not too late," he said, bendingover her. But the girl shrank from his arm, and he realised itinstantly. He was aware directly that there was some feeling in hernot quite fathomed nor understood. It puzzled him. He was far toodeep a thinker, far too refined a nature to treat his women asinanimate toys to be used for his amusement, either with or withouttheir consent, as the chance might be. He knew them to be, andtreated them as, individual souls, with right of will and desireequal to his own, and was too proud to accept the gift of the bodyunless he had first conquered the will. But usually there was nodifficulty. Nature had gifted Ahmed with all the best treasures inher jewel-box; beauty of face and form, strength and grace, charmof voice and presence--everything needed to ensnare and delightthe senses, and he was accustomed to be loved, passionately adored,and worshipped. He was naturally a connoisseur in such matters, andknew well and easily the truth or dissembling in them. But herethere was neither: the girl shrank from him instinctively, andseemed possessed by nothing but dumb, helpless fear that wasdistressing to him. Yet not all distressing, for even in the bestof male natures there always remains some of the instinctive desireof conquest, the delight in opposition, if not too prolonged, thelove of battle, the hope of victory; and to Ahmed, the invariablysuccessful lover, the resistance of this slight, rose-leaf creaturehe could crush with one blow of his hand roused suddenly all theprimitive joy of the chase, the excitement of pursuit. Only, wherewith some natures it would have been brutal and rapid, the end andtriumph assured, the prize the body; here it would be gentle anddexterous, the end dependent on another, the prize the soul--thesoul, the will, the most difficult quarry to capture, as Ahmedknew.He let his arm slip from her shoulders, and rose and walked overto the window, looking out for a moment into the delicious greenbeyond. Dilama half-sat, half-crouched upon the divan, not daringto stir, and watched him furtively.Ahmed stood for a moment, and there was dead silence in the room.Then he returned and came towards the couch, standing opposite it,and looking down at her."Dilama, you seem very much afraid of me, and why is it? Look upand speak to me. There is no need for fear. Do you think I havecalled you here to force you to love me? There is no way of forcinglove. You are free to come and go to and from this room as youwill, but I am lonely and grieved, now Buldoula has been taken awayfrom me. I would like you to come here and play and sing to me, andconsole me; will you?"Dilama ventured to lift her eyes to the kingly figure before her,and meeting the pained, dark eyes bent on her, and realising thatthere was nothing, indeed, to make her fear but her own guiltyconscience, she burst suddenly into an uncontrollable passion ofweeping, and slipping from the couch fell sobbing at his feet.Ahmed stooped and gathered her up in his arms, holding her to hisbreast, and this time she did not shrink from him, but lay thereunresisting, crying violently. For a moment the clasp of his arm,the touch of gentle sympathy, soothed and comforted her. For onewild moment she longed to confide in him, to tell him the reality.What would happen? Was it possible that Ahmed would pardon her, andlet her go to her own life, her own love and lover! No, it was notpossible--any other offence but this; theft or murder he could haveforgiven and sheltered, but this, no! Instinctively she knew andfelt it would not be possible to him--a Turk, free from prejudiceand superstition, liberal as he was--to forgive her crime. Deathfor herself and Murad was the best she could expect. Ahmed's ownhonour, the traditions of all his house, his great position wouldmake it impossible for him to let her pass from his, a Turk's haremto a Druze lover. The thought whirled from her sick brain, leavingall confused and hopeless as before, and her tears rained fast.Ahmed smoothed her soft hair and kissed her forehead gently, as itlay against his breast."Go and fetch your music, and sing to me," he whispered, as hersobs ceased. "See how lovely the spring time is; it is no time fortears, but for songs and--love." He murmured the last word verysoftly and set her free. Without looking at him she slipped away tothe door in obedience to his command, and in a wild confusion offeeling in which pleasure struggled with fear.When she came back with her instrument, a small pear shaped guitarin appearance, she was more composed. Her eyes were still red andswollen, but the soft, elastic skin had already regained itscolouring. As she entered, soft bars of sunlight were fallingthrough the room, the window had been opened, and the song of thebirds came gaily through it. Ahmed had ordered coffee andsweetmeats to be brought, and these now stood on a small inlaidtable before her, on whose glistening arabesques of mother of pearlthe sunbeams twinkled merrily. Ahmed's eyes lighted up with tenderpleasure as he saw her enter, and she noted it. He was stillsitting on the couch, and held in his hand a small green leathercase--the counterpart of hundreds to be seen in the jewellers'windows in Paris. Dilama guessed at once it was some present forher. Unconsciously the light, gay, butterfly nature of the girlbegan to reassert itself in the knowledge that the final issue hadnot to be met then; that there was respite for her, delay; and anatural joy stirred in her looking across at Ahmed. It wassomething, after all, to be queen of the harem, to be wooed ingifts and smiles by its lord."Come here!" he said to her, and as she approached he opened thecase and took from it a bracelet, a limp band of gold with a claspof rubies and diamonds that flashed a thousand sparkling rays intothe astonished eyes of the girl, accustomed only to the dull, uncutor poorly-cut gems of the East."How wonderful! Is it for me, really?" she exclaimed, as Ahmed tookher unresisting arm and clasped the bracelet round it above theelbow, where it lent a new beauty to the flesh."Now, take some coffee, and then you shall play to me while I restand smoke," continued Ahmed, kissing her tenderly between the eyes,as she gazed up gratefully to him, and though she flushed andtrembled, this time she did not shrink from him.The coffee seemed more delicious than any that was served in theharemlik, and the gold-tipped cigarettes and the jam, made out ofrose leaves, that Ahmed pressed upon her, delighted her senses andhelped to make her think less of the passing hour and Murad, whowould be waiting in stormy passion for her, in the angle of thewall. "I can't help it; I can't help it!" she thought to herself asshe took up her instrument and bent over the strings to tune them,while Ahmed stretched himself at full length on the divan tolisten, with a scarlet cushion supporting his regal head. She couldboth sing and play well, for Ahmed loved music, and wiselyconsidered it a safe amusement--an outlet for superfluous passionsand unexpressed feelings--for the women of the harem. Instrumentswere provided in plenty, and instruction and all encouragementgiven to them to learn, and from her first day in the haremDilama's natural voice and talents had been noted and fostered.This afternoon, at first she was timid, and sang and playedstiffly, carefully, with a great attention to notes and strings;but slowly the calm and stillness of the beautiful sun-filled room,the scented air floating in from the garden, the tense atmosphereof passion about her, and the magic beauty of the face and formopposite influenced her, grew upon her, wrapped her round, and shebegan to sing passionately, ardently, with that abandonment,without which all music is a hollow sound. Her glorious voice,fresh, youthful, clear, and pure came rushing joyously over herlips and filled the room. Her spirits rose as she realised thepower she was exerting. She felt a little impatient at the thoughtof Murad. After all, she was a great lady, a lady of the harem ofAhmed Ali, the richest Turk in Damascus. She was dressed indelicate silks, and the jewels blazed on her arm. She was queen ofthe harem, and the beloved of its lord. He was most desirable toher and to all women, and, but for Murad, who seemed to stand likea black shadow between, she would have lain upon his breast withpure delight. She leant forward now, singing rapturously over theinstrument pressed close to her soft breast, while her rose-huedfingers leapt among its strings; a transparent flush, delicate asthe tint of a shell, glowed in her cheeks; her large, dark eyeslooked straight at Ahmed, drawing in all the proud beauty of hisface; her hair lay soft and thick without its veil above her brows,and one heavy tress fell forward over her shoulder to her knee.Ahmed lay watching her, his eyes filled with sombre fires, hiswhole soul listening to the song; and one other lay listening also,and this was Murad, crouching in the shade of the orange-treeplantation, catching with distended ears that flood of passionatemelody wafted to him over the still garden, from the window ofAhmed's apartment, from the Selamlik.When the song was finished, and the last notes had faltered softlyinto silence, Ahmed rose from his divan and crossed to where shesat. The room was full now of hot rosy light; the scent of theorange flowers poured in through the windows; the girl's sensesgrew confused and dizzy. Her cheeks were flaming with theexcitement and joy and effort and passion of her singing; hereyelids were cast down, and beneath them her eyes watched, half interror, half in a strained delight, the blue Persian slippersadvancing silently over the matting on the floor towards her."Will Dilama stay with me to-night?"The girl looked up, whitening to the lips, and slid to a kneelingposition. Terror at the thought of infidelity to Murad filled her;he would infallibly find it out and avenge himself. Her face workedconvulsively; she stretched out her hands with a gesture ofdespair."What my lord wills: I am the slave of his wishes."Ahmed drew his level brows together, and for a moment lined theserene beauty of his forehead. He gazed at her with a steady,puzzled look, and at last a faint, half-quizzical smile relaxed hislips. What could this strange idea, this whim be, so unlike allEastern maiden's usual fancies? He had not yet solved the riddle,nor found the clue! he would do so, but in the meantime she must beleft her freedom. In all noble natures power brings with it aterrible responsibility, and the habit of stern self-control andlong forbearance. Ahmed's complete power over the frightened pieceof humanity before him brought upon him the necessity practicallyof surrender; for the Turk possesses one of the noblest and gentlenatures the human race can boast of. Ahmed remained silent for afew seconds, and the girl gazed upon him with dilated, fascinatedeyes. She noted in a dazed way how the dark blue robe parted on hisbreast and showed beneath a vest of gold silk, fastened a little tothe side by a single emerald; how the column of throat toweredabove these, supporting the oval face and beautifully-modelledchin, and above these again, and the commanding brows, shoneanother solitary emerald between the folds of his turban on hisforehead.Murad began to seem like a robber depriving her of all thesethings. There is no fidelity in the body. Fidelity is a thing ofthe mind, always at war with and striving to coerce those instinctsof the senses that are ever clamouring after the new and theunknown. Nature is ever driving us on to seek new mates. The mindwith its trammels of affection, gratitude, pity, consideration, isever dragging us back and seeking to tie us to the old. Nature'srule is fresh seasons, fresh mates, new hours, new loves. And hewho seeks fidelity must woo the mind, for the body cannot give it,and knows not its laws.After a minute's silence Ahmed stretched out his hand to her andraised her to her feet. His face had lost its smiles and fire; itwas grave and sombre-looking now, but his voice was gentle as heanswered her:"You are free to return to the haremlik," he said; "no one has anypower to coerce you. I wish you to come and go as you will." Hewaved his hand towards the curtain with a gesture of dismissal, andthen turned away and rang a little silver bell on a table. Theblack slave appeared--it seemed almost instantly--before thecurtain; while Dilama still stood, motionless, irresolute, with acurious sense of disappointment, mingling with relief, stealingover her. Ahmed beckoned the slave to him, and said somethingin a low voice Dilama did not catch, but the last sentence sheoverheard. "Send Soutouma to me," and without taking any furthernotice of Dilama, Ahmed turned back towards the divan, threwhimself upon it, and drew the pipe-stand towards him.The black slave, with a smile on her curving lips, motioned toDilama to precede her, and Dilama, with one look flung backward toAhmed's couch in the full sunlight of the window, passed under theheavy blue curtain out into the passage. "Send Soutouma to me!" thewords went through her with a cutting feeling, as a knife dividingher flesh.Soutouma was next to Buldoula in age and rank--a fair beauty of theharem, with soft, long, sunlit tresses, and a skin of snow."Yes, why not? why not?" asked Dilama wildly to herself as her feetdragged along down the passage side by side with the grinningblack's. "I am a Druze girl: I belong to Murad and to themountains." But the insidious charm of Ahmed's personality workedon all the pulses of her body; pulses that know not fidelity,though her brain kept telling her that Murad would be waiting forher in the garden. But that night Murad did not come. The gardenstood cool and fragrant, full of perfume and rosy light, full ofthe music of birds and the tints of a thousand flowers--all theinvitations to love, but love itself was absent. Dilama searchedthe garden from end to end, and walked in and out among the rosesby the buttressed wall, but the garden was empty and silent. Shewas alone. Tired at last, and ready to cry with fatigue anddisappointment, she sat down by the red brick wall, leaning herchin on her hand and gazing up towards the windows of the Selamlik,which could only be seen in portions here and there through a leafyscreen of plane-tree branches. How still it was in the garden, andhow the scent of the orange flower weighed on the senses! How clearthe pink, transparent air!Through that same lucid air, under the spreading plane-trees, andthrough the great dim bazaars of the city, walked Murad thatevening with quick, hot feet, and the liquid coursing in his veinsseemed fire instead of blood. He went from Druze to Druze, whereverhe could find them, in their own homes, or sitting at a shadycorner of a street, where the tiny rush-bottomed stools aregathered round the tea-stalls with their hissing brazen urns andporcelain cups, or lounging in the bazaars, or at the marbledrinking-fountains. Wherever they were he found them, and spoke afew hot, eager words to them, urging them to hurry forward theirpreparations, and be ready to start with the caravan at the risingof the full moon. Then, as the rosy light changed into violet dusk,he went home to his low, yellow, square-roofed dwelling on the edgeof the desert, and sat there in his one unlighted room--sat theregazing out with unseeing eyes into the lustrous Damascus nightbeyond the open door, and with the fingers of his right handplaying absently with the handle of his knife.A week had passed over and Ahmed had not sent again for Dilama, norhad Murad visited the garden, and to the Eastern girl it seemed asif the world had stopped still. The hot, languid days, the gorgeousnights with the blaze of the stars and the rapture of thenightingales, filled her with madness that seemed insupportable.She knew of no reason for Murad's desertion. She could find outnothing. She did not dare to breathe a word to any one of theanxiety, the wonder, the desperation that seemed choking her. Whathad become of him? What had happened? Would he ever come again? Andas he appealed only to her senses, and he was not there, she ceasedto wish for him very much, but thought more of Ahmed and theSelamlik that were close to her. For the mind and the imaginationlove in absence and long after the absent one, but the senses arestirred by proximity, and turn to the one who is nearest.One evening, when the soft sky was a clear crimson and the fullmoon rose a perfect disk of transparent silver, faint as yet in theblood-red glow, Dilama felt as if she could exist no longer in thestill, even, unchanging peace of the women's apartments. The songof the water without, the coo of the doves, the incessantlyrepeated love-note of the mating sparrows, seemed to madden herbeyond endurance.She lay face downwards on the soft carpet of her littlesleeping-chamber, and moaned unconsciously aloud, "Let me die! letme die! I have lost favour with all men."The black slave was sitting cross-legged just outside the curtain,and when these slow, long drawn-out words came from the other sidea light gleamed in her shrewd, beady-black eyes. With one claw-likehand she cautiously drew back a fold of the curtain, and peering insaw the foremost lady of the harem lying prostrate, her facepressed to the floor. She made no sound, but dropping the curtainnoiselessly, sidled slowly off down the dark passage leading to theSelamlik. Ahmed was alone in his apartment when the slave appeared,sitting on the broad window ledge gazing out from the window whichoverlooked his grounds, and beyond them the white minarets andshining cupolas of the city. He turned at the interruption, but hisface lighted up with pleasure as he recognised the women'sattendant, and he signed to her to approach."The Lady Dilama is weeping in her chamber, desiring my lord,"announced the slave, with much bowing and prostration, but stillwith that confidence which showed she knew how welcome the newswould be to her august listener. Ahmed rose, a fire of joy leapingup suddenly within him."It is well," he said, in an even tone. "Let the Lady Dilama cometo me, and for yourself take this," and he dropped beside thecrouching heap of black back and shoulder a small velvet bag. Theslave grabbed it and put it in her breast, muttering a thousandthanks and blessings, and withdrew.Once outside, her lean black legs carried her swiftly back toDilama's room, where she pushed aside the curtain without ceremony."Come!" she said imperiously, "you are Ahmed Ali's chosen one; hehas sent for you. Put off that torn veil, and all that weeping. Ihave new robes here for you."Dilama, who had hurriedly gathered herself up at the slave's entry,shrank away now into a corner of the room, white as death."Has he sent for me?" she asked breathlessly. "Commanded me? Oh,must I go?"The slave looked at her strangely. She had no suspicion of Dilama'ssecret, and had no idea that her own misrepresentations were asgross as they were. But she had no wish to be harsh or unkind tothis girl, who would be in a few hours queen of the harem. She waspuzzled. She drew near to Dilama's shrinking form, and peered intoher face."Yes, he _commands_," she said; "but is it possible you do notwish to go to Ahmed? He is a king amongst men, and he loves you.What better fate could there be than to lie on his breast, in hisarms? Is it not better than the ground to which you were cryingjust now? Surely you will reward me well to-morrow?"Dilama answered nothing. Long shivers were passing through her. Itwas decided, then; she could no longer avoid her fate, and alreadywith that thought the Oriental calm of acceptance came to her.Besides, where was Murad? She could not tell. Fate had taken himfrom her, perhaps--the same Fate that gave her to Ahmed. She washelpless. She had no choice but to obey. And the words of theslave, accompanied by those piercing, meaning looks, inflamed hersenses. After that unbearable week of solitude the summons came toher not all unwelcome, and the supreme thought of Ahmed himselfloomed up suddenly, bringing irresistible joy with it. A flamepassed over her cheeks; she caught the slave's skinny black handbetween her own rose-leaf palms."Yes, I will reward you," she murmured. "Dress me beautifully,decorate me that I may find favour with Ahmed."The slave laughed meaningly."Does the desert traveller burn and sigh after water, and then dothe springs of Damascus not find favour in his eyes?" she asked,and laughed again as she approached Dilama, and began to undressher. In a few minutes the whole of the haremlik was in a state ofpleasant excitement. The news of the dressing of the bride spreadinto its furthest corners, and the women came to talk and jest, andthe servants fled hither and thither upon errands. Dilama was ledinto the large general room, and there bathed from head to footwith warm rose-water; while the others sat round and chattedtogether, and admired her ivory skin, with the wild rose Syrianbloom upon it, and her masses of gold-tinted chestnut hair. And theblack slave bathed and anointed and dressed her with the utmostcare and great self-importance, and sent the underslaves flying inall directions, one to gather syringa, and other heavy-scentedblossoms from the garden, and another to fetch the jewels for herneck; and as the attar of rose bottle was found to be empty, aslave was sent with flying feet to the bazaar to purchase more; andDilama, excited and elated, surrounded by jest and laughter andsmiling faces, felt her youth leap up within her, and rejoice atcoming into its kingdom--love.In the bazaar the slave sped to the perfume-seller, and, swellingwith the importance of his mission, stayed a moment to chatter withthe dealer."They are dressing a new bride for my master, and I must hastenback," he gossiped, lounging on the merchant's little stall. "AhmedAli awaits her in the Selamlik; I must be going. They say herbeauty is wonderful; she is not a Turk, but a Syrian from themountains by Beirut. I must hasten: they will be waiting.""Yes, hasten on your way," returned the perfume-seller. He was aTurk, dignified and gracious, and of no mind to listen to gossipfrom the harem, of which it was little short of scandalous to speakso publicly. He had other customers in his shop who could hear,amongst them a black-browed Druze in a green turban, who waswaiting patiently his turn, and who seemed to listen intently tothis most improper gossip. The slave disappeared with flying feetto catch up his wasted moments, but when the Turk turned to servethe silent Druze, he, too, had vanished, and some white-turbanedArabs pressed forward in his place.       *       *       *       *       *Dilama in her lighted chamber, with her fresh young eyes a littlepainted beneath their lids, and heavy gold chains about her softyoung throat, sat looking into the little French mirror of cheapglass and gilt, and waiting for the attar of rose to be poured onher shining hair.At last the boy returned breathless, and the precious stuff waspoured on her hair and hands. Then she stood up radiant and thewomen sighed and smiled by turns as she went out, preceded by theold slave. A long narrow passage, lighted overhead by swingingcoloured lamps, divided the women's from the men's apartments, andthrough this they passed noiselessly over the matting-coveredfloor. At the end fell heavy curtains, concealing the door and somesteps. Here the slave left the girl, and Dilama went through thecurtains alone. She mounted the steps and passed through the door.All was quite silent here, and the passage unlighted, except thatthrough a tiny window high up above her head a streak of moonlightfell across her way. Dilama paused oppressed, she knew not by whatfeeling. Only a short passage and another curtained door dividedher now from Ahmed's presence. Her breath came fast, her pulsesbeat nervously, and her feet dragged; slowly and unwillingly shecrept onward, harassed by cold, vague fears. Before the door itselfshe trembled, and her soft hands and wrists hardly availed to pushit open. It yielded slowly, and fell to behind her in silence.The room was full of light; a silver blaze of moonlight illuminedit from end to end. The great windows, over which usually thecurtains were drawn, stood uncovered and wide open to the softDamascus air. The scent of roses and jessamine from the great man'sgarden stole in with the silver light. The girl paused when justover the threshold: she was cold and frightened, and her bodyshook. Ahmed did not move or speak. He was sitting sideways to onegreat window, with his head resting against the high back of theone European chair that the room possessed. The light was so strongthat the rich, deep blue of the turban was distinctly visible init, but his face was in shadow. She could see, however, the noblethroat and pose of the shoulders as he sat waiting. The girl'sheart beat with a little sense of pleasure as she looked. Her feetcrept slowly a little farther into the room. A great tide ofpleasure was really just outside her heart, and would have rushedin and overwhelmed it in waves of joy had she but opened herheart's doors to it; but the shadow of Murad was on the bolts andlocks, and she felt afraid. The silence and great silver light inthe room oppressed her. Ahmed had not heard her enter, and had notstirred nor looked at her. She crept a little closer. The beauty ofthe majestic figure called her irresistibly. She drew closer. Shehad passed one window now, and was near enough to see the jewelsflash on the slender hand that hung over the chair-arm, and theglistening light on the embroidered Turkish slippers on his feet.Shading her brow with one hand, Dilama came forward, fell at thosefeet and kissed them. Still there was no movement, no sound. Thiswas so unlike Ahmed's way of treating his slaves, that the girl,forgetting her fears, looked up in sheer surprise. Then her heartseemed to stop suddenly, and then leap with excessive thuds ofhorror against her breast. The face above her seemed carved instone, pale, bloodless, calm; it was set, as the girl realised in amoment of terror and agony, in a repose that would never be broken.The large, dark eyes, still open, gazed past her, sightless,changeless. Fear, her fear of him, her awe, her oppressed terrorfell from her, giving way to an infinite regret, a sorrow, a senseof loss that rushed over her, filling every cell, every atom of herbeing. She, the unwilling, the reluctant, the slow-coming, thegrudging bride, now stood free. The bridegroom asked of hernothing, demanded nothing, needed nothing, desired nothing.The slave-girl neither shrieked nor fainted. A great, convulsivesob tore itself from her trembling body as she rose from her kneesand bent over the sitting figure. Wildly she passed her soft,shaking fingers across his brow, still warm, and round his throat,seeking mechanically the wound; then her eyes fell on the gold silkof his tunic, and just over the left breast she saw a little brownpatch, and on the left side of the chair the silver light gleamedon a small, dark-red pool. He had been stabbed as he sat there,waiting for her--stabbed from the back, and the dagger thrustthrough to the little brown spot in the front of the tunic. Andthrough that tiny door his life had gone.Lying at his feet, Dilama sobbed uncontrollably, rolling her head,with its wonderful crown of flower-decked hair, and her pink-silkclad body amongst the rugs on the floor. What was the worth or useof anything now, silk or bridal attire, or beauty, or flower-deckedhair? Never would any of them now be mirrored in his eyes again.Never could anything change that awful serenity, that implacablesilence, out of which she felt her own love, her own desire rushupon her and devour her. Ahmed had been hers and she had shrunkfrom him, and now all the blood in her body she would have givenwillingly to replace that little scarlet stream that had borne awayhis life.As she lay there, weeping in an agony of despair, a dark shadowsuddenly grew in the window, and fell a black patch in the panel ofwhite light upon the floor. A lithe figure balanced a moment on theledge of the open window, then leapt with the silent elastic boundof a cat into the room. Dilama sprang from the floor to her kneeswith a smothered cry of terror."Murad! why have you come here?"The Druze leant over her and caught her arm fiercely."To claim my own. It is not the first visit I have made to-night,as you see," and as he dragged her up from her knees he indicatedthe motionless figure beside them."You killed him!" she whispered, gazing up with dilated, terrifiedeyes."Who should, if not I? Had he not taken my wife? Come, we must begoing."With the nail-like grip on her arm, and the low, savage tones inher ears, and the blazing eyes like a tiger's, inflamed with thelust of murder above her, the girl felt sick and half-fainting withfear and misery."He did not take me. I was always faithful, Murad. I love you.I--" she stammered."It is well," returned Murad with a grim smile, "and these tears Isuppose are because I was too long absent? It is true I have beensome time: I had much to do, and then I knew I was quite safe, nowI had settled all accounts with him. Come! the caravan is ready;the camels wait for you."He dragged her towards the open square, the great square of thewindow. Without, the night-flies and the moths danced in the silverbeams, the trees rose motionless and stately in the sultry air, thegracious hours moved on with all the tranquil splendour of theOriental night. The girl threw her eyes over the sitting figure,unmoved by all the strenuous passions fighting round it. Wildly, indespairing agony, she stretched out her arms towards it in a vain,unconscious passionate appeal.The Druze struck them downwards, and gripping her unresisting bodymore tightly, he leapt from the window to the slight woodenstaircase without, and, like a tiger with his prey, crept awaystealthily through the silver silence of the rose garden towardsthe desert.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Six Women, by Victoria Cross*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SIX WOMEN ******** This file should be named 13238.txt or 13238.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/3/2/3/13238/Produced by Janet Kegg and the Project Gutenberg Online DistributedProofreading TeamUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

JacobsRelease Date: April 22, 2004 [EBook #12126]Language: EnglishCharacter set encoding: ASCII*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK IN THE LIBRARY ***Produced by David WidgerTHE LADY OF THE BARGEAND OTHER STORIESBy W. W. JacobsIN THE LIBRARYThe fire had burnt low in the library, for the night was wet and warm.It was now little more than a grey shell, and looked desolate.  TraytonBurleigh, still hot, rose from his armchair, and turning out one of thegas-jets, took a cigar from a box on a side-table and resumed his seatagain.The apartment, which was on the third floor at the back of the house, wasa combination of library, study, and smoke-room, and was the dailydespair of the old housekeeper who, with the assistance of one servant,managed the house.  It was a bachelor establishment, and had been left toTrayton Burleigh and James Fletcher by a distant connection of both mensome ten years before.Trayton Burleigh sat back in his chair watching the smoke of his cigarthrough half-closed eyes.  Occasionally he opened them a little wider andglanced round the comfortable, well-furnished room, or stared with a coldgleam of hatred at Fletcher as he sat sucking stolidly at his brier pipe.It was a comfortable room and a valuable house, half of which belonged toTrayton Burleigh; and yet he was to leave it in the morning and become arogue and a wanderer over the face of the earth.  James Fletcher had saidso.  James Fletcher, with the pipe still between his teeth and speakingfrom one corner of his mouth only, had pronounced his sentence."It hasn't occurred to you, I suppose," said Burleigh, speaking suddenly,"that I might refuse your terms.""No," said Fletcher, simply.Burleigh took a great mouthful of smoke and let it roll slowly out."I am to go out and leave you in possession?"  he continued.  "You willstay here sole proprietor of the house; you will stay at the office soleowner and representative of the firm?  You are a good hand at a deal,James Fletcher.""I am an honest man," said Fletcher, "and to raise sufficient money tomake your defalcations good will not by any means leave me the gainer, asyou very well know.""There is no necessity to borrow," began Burleigh, eagerly.  "We can paythe interest easily, and in course of time make the principal goodwithout a soul being the wiser.""That you suggested before," said Fletcher, "and my answer is the same.I will be no man's confederate in dishonesty; I will raise every penny atall costs, and save the name of the firm--and yours with it--but I willnever have you darken the office again, or sit in this house afterto-night.""You won't," cried Burleigh, starting up in a frenzy of rage."I won't," said Fletcher.  "You can choose the alternative: disgrace andpenal servitude.  Don't stand over me; you won't frighten me, I canassure you.  Sit down.""You have arranged so many things in your kindness," said Burleigh,slowly, resuming his seat again, "have you arranged how I am to live?""You have two strong hands, and health," replied Fletcher.  "I will giveyou the two hundred pounds I mentioned, and after that you must look outfor yourself.  You can take it now."He took a leather case from his breast pocket, and drew out a roll ofnotes.  Burleigh, watching him calmly, stretched out his hand and tookthem from the table.  Then he gave way to a sudden access of rage, andcrumpling them in his hand, threw them into a corner of the room.Fletcher smoked on."Mrs. Marl is out?" said Burleigh, suddenly.Fletcher nodded."She will be away the night," he said, slowly; "and Jane too; they havegone together somewhere, but they will be back at half-past eight in themorning.""You are going to let me have one more breakfast in the old place, then,"said Burleigh.  "Half-past eight, half-past----"He rose from his chair again.  This time Fletcher took his pipe from hismouth and watched him closely.  Burleigh stooped, and picking up thenotes, placed them in his pocket."If I am to be turned adrift, it shall not be to leave you here," hesaid, in a thick voice.He crossed over and shut the door; as he turned back Fletcher rose fromhis chair and stood confronting him.  Burleigh put his hand to the wall,and drawing a small Japanese sword from its sheath of carved ivory,stepped slowly toward him."I give you one chance, Fletcher," he said, grimly.  "You are a man ofyour word.  Hush this up and let things be as they were before, and youare safe.""Put that down," said Fletcher, sharply."By ---, I mean what I say!"  cried the other."I mean what I said!"  answered Fletcher.He looked round at the last moment for a weapon, then he turned suddenlyat a sharp sudden pain, and saw Burleigh's clenched fist nearly touchinghis breast-bone.  The hand came away from his breast again, and somethingwith it.  It went a long way off.  Trayton Burleigh suddenly went to agreat distance and the room darkened.  It got quite dark, and Fletcher,with an attempt to raise his hands, let them fall to his side instead,and fell in a heap to the floor.He was so still that Burleigh could hardly realize that it was all over,and stood stupidly waiting for him to rise again.  Then he took out hishandkerchief as though to wipe the sword, and thinking better of it, putit back into his pocket again, and threw the weapon on to the floor.The body of Fletcher lay where it had fallen, the white face turned up tothe gas.  In life he had been a commonplace-looking man, not to sayvulgar; now Burleigh, with a feeling of nausea, drew back toward thedoor, until the body was hidden by the table, and relieved from thesight, he could think more clearly.  He looked down carefully andexamined his clothes and his boots.  Then he crossed the room again, andwith his face averted, turned out the gas.  Something seemed to stir inthe darkness, and with a faint cry he blundered toward the door before hehad realized that it was the clock.  It struck twelve.[Illustration: BURLEIGH, WITH A FEELING OF NAUSEA, DREW BACK TOWARD THEDOOOR.]He stood at the head of the stairs trying to recover himself; trying tothink.  The gas on the landing below, the stairs and the furniture, alllooked so prosaic and familiar that he could not realize what hadoccurred.  He walked slowly down and turned the light out.  The darknessof the upper part of the house was now almost appalling, and in a suddenpanic he ran down stairs into the lighted hall, and snatching a hat fromthe stand, went to the door and walked down to the gate.Except for one window the neighbouring houses were in darkness, and thelamps shone tip a silent street.  There was a little rain in the air, andthe muddy road was full of pebbles.  He stood at the gate trying to screwup his courage to enter the house again.  Then he noticed a figure comingslowly up the road and keeping close to the palings.The full realization of what he had done broke in upon him when he foundhimself turning to fly from the approach of the constable.  The wet capeglistening in the lamplight, the slow, heavy step, made him tremble.Suppose the thing upstairs was not quite dead and should cry out?Suppose the constable should think it strange for him to be standingthere and follow him in?  He assumed a careless attitude, which did notfeel careless, and as the man passed bade him good-night, and made aremark as to the weather.Ere the sound of the other's footsteps had gone quite out of hearing,he turned and entered the house again before the sense of companionshipshould have quite departed.  The first flight of stairs was lighted bythe gas in the hall, and he went up slowly.  Then he struck a match andwent up steadily, past the library door, and with firm fingers turned onthe gas in his bedroom and lit it.  He opened the window a little way,and sitting down on his bed, tried to think.He had got eight hours.  Eight hours and two hundred pounds in smallnotes.  He opened his safe and took out all the loose cash it contained,and walking about the room, gathered up and placed in his pockets sucharticles of jewellery as he possessed.The first horror had now to some extent passed, and was succeeded by thefear of death.With this fear on him he sat down again and tried to think out the firstmoves in that game of skill of which his life was the stake.  He hadoften read of people of hasty temper, evading the police for a time, andeventually falling into their hands for lack of the most elementarycommon sense.  He had heard it said that they always made some stupidblunder, left behind them some damning clue.  He took his revolver from adrawer and saw that it was loaded.  If the worst came to the worst, hewould die quickly.Eight hours' start; two hundred odd pounds.  He would take lodgings atfirst in some populous district, and let the hair on his face grow.  Whenthe hue-and-cry had ceased, he would go abroad and start life again.  Hewould go out of a night and post letters to himself, or better still,postcards, which his landlady would read.  Postcards from cheery friends,from a sister, from a brother.  During the day he would stay in andwrite, as became a man who described himself as a journalist.Or suppose he went to the sea?  Who would look for him in flannels,bathing and boating with ordinary happy mortals?  He sat and pondered.One might mean life, and the other death.  Which?His face burned as he thought of the responsibility of the choice.  Somany people went to the sea at that time of year that he would surelypass unnoticed.  But at the sea one might meet acquaintances.  He got upand nervously paced the room again.  It was not so simple, now that itmeant so much, as he had thought.The sharp little clock on the mantel-piece rang out "one," followedimmediately by the deeper note of that in the library.  He thought of theclock, it seemed the only live thing in that room, and shuddered.  Hewondered whether the thing lying by the far side of the table heard it.He wondered----He started and held his breath with fear.  Somewhere down stairs a boardcreaked loudly, then another.  He went to the door, and opening it alittle way, but without looking out, listened.  The house was so stillthat he could hear the ticking of the old clock in the kitchen below.  Heopened the door a little wider and peeped out.  As he did so there was asudden sharp outcry on the stairs, and he drew back into the room andstood trembling before he had quite realized that the noise had been madeby the cat.  The cry was unmistakable; but what had disturbed it?There was silence again, and he drew near the door once more.  He becamecertain that something was moving stealthily on the stairs.  He heard theboards creak again, and once the rails of the balustrade rattled.  Thesilence and suspense were frightful.  Suppose that the something whichhad been Fletcher waited for him in the darkness outside?He fought his fears down, and opening the door, determined to see whatwas beyond.  The light from his room streamed out on to the landing, andhe peered about fearfully.  Was it fancy, or did the door of Fletcher'sroom opposite close as he looked?  Was it fancy, or did the handle of thedoor really turn?In perfect silence, and watching the door as he moved, to see thatnothing came out and followed him, he proceeded slowly down the darkstairs.  Then his jaw fell, and he turned sick and faint again.  Thelibrary door, which he distinctly remembered closing, and which,moreover, he had seen was closed when he went up stairs to his room, nowstood open some four or five inches.  He fancied that there was arustling inside, but his brain refused to be certain.  Then plainly andunmistakably he heard a chair pushed against the wall.He crept to the door, hoping to pass it before the thing inside becameaware of his presence.  Something crept stealthily about the room.  Witha sudden impulse he caught the handle of the door, and, closing itviolently, turned the key in the lock, and ran madly down the stairs.A fearful cry sounded from the room, and a heavy hand beat upon thepanels of the door.  The house rang with the blows, but above themsounded the loud hoarse cries of human fear.  Burleigh, half-way down tothe hall, stopped with his hand on the balustrade and listened.  Thebeating ceased, and a man's voice cried out loudly for God's sake to lethim out.At once Burleigh saw what had happened and what it might mean for him.He had left the hall door open after his visit to the front, and somewandering bird of the night had entered the house.  No need for him to gonow.  No need to hide either from the hangman's rope or the felon's cell.The fool above had saved him.  He turned and ran up stairs again just asthe prisoner in his furious efforts to escape wrenched the handle fromthe door."Who's there?"  he cried, loudly."Let me out!"  cried a frantic voice.  "For God's sake, open the door!There's something here.""Stay where you are!"  shouted Burleigh, sternly.  "Stay where you are!If you come out, I'll shoot you like a dog!"The only response was a smashing blow on the lock of the door.  Burleighraised his pistol, and aiming at the height of a man's chest, firedthrough the panel.The report and the crashing of the wood made one noise, succeeded by anunearthly stillness, then the noise of a window hastily opened.  Burleighfled hastily down the stairs, and flinging wide the hall door, shoutedloudly for assistance.It happened that a sergeant and the constable on the beat had just met inthe road.  They came toward the house at a run.  Burleigh, withincoherent explanations, ran up stairs before them, and halted outsidethe library door.  The prisoner was still inside, still trying todemolish the lock of the sturdy oaken door.  Burleigh tried to turn thekey, but the lock was too damaged to admit of its moving.  The sergeantdrew back, and, shoulder foremost, hurled himself at the door and burstit open.He stumbled into the room, followed by the constable, and two shafts oflight from the lanterns at their belts danced round the room.  A manlurking behind the door made a dash for it, and the next instant thethree men were locked together.Burleigh, standing in the doorway, looked on coldly, reserving himselffor the scene which was to follow.  Except for the stumbling of the menand the sharp catch of the prisoner's breath, there was no noise.  Ahelmet fell off and bounced and rolled along the floor.  The men fell;there was a sobbing snarl and a sharp click.  A tall figure rose from thefloor; the other, on his knees, still held the man down.  The standingfigure felt in his pocket, and, striking a match, lit the gas.The light fell on the flushed face and fair beard of the sergeant.  Hewas bare-headed, and his hair dishevelled.  Burleigh entered the room andgazed eagerly at the half-insensible man on the floor-a short, thick-setfellow with a white, dirty face and a black moustache.  His lip was cutand bled down his neck.  Burleigh glanced furtively at the table.  Thecloth had come off in the struggle, and was now in the place where he hadleft Fletcher."Hot work, sir," said the sergeant, with a smile.  "It's fortunate wewere handy."The prisoner raised a heavy head and looked up with unmistakable terrorin his eyes."All right, sir," he said, trembling, as the constable increased thepressure of his knee.  "I 'ain't been in the house ten minutesaltogether.  By ---, I've not."The sergeant regarded him curiously."It don't signify," he said, slowly; "ten minutes or ten seconds won'tmake any difference."The man shook and began to whimper."It was 'ere when I come," he said, eagerly; "take that down, sir.  I'veonly just come, and it was 'ere when I come.  I tried to get away then,but I was locked in.""What was?"  demanded the sergeant."That," he said, desperately.The sergeant, following the direction of the terror-stricken black eyes,stooped by the table.  Then, with a sharp exclamation, he dragged awaythe cloth.  Burleigh, with a sharp cry of horror, reeled back against thewall."All right, sir," said the sergeant, catching him; "all right.  Turn yourhead away."He pushed him into a chair, and crossing the room, poured out a glass ofwhiskey and brought it to him.  The glass rattled against his teeth, buthe drank it greedily, and then groaned faintly.  The sergeant waitedpatiently.  There was no hurry."Who is it, sir?"  he asked at length."My friend--Fletcher," said Burleigh, with an effort.  "We livedtogether."  He turned to the prisoner."You damned villain!""He was dead when I come in the room, gentlemen," said the prisoner,strenuously.  "He was on the floor dead, and when I see 'im, I tried toget out.  S' 'elp me he was.  You heard me call out, sir.  I shouldn'tha' called out if I'd killed him.""All right," said the sergeant, gruffly; "you'd better hold your tongue,you know.""You keep quiet," urged the constable.The sergeant knelt down and raised the dead man's head."I 'ad nothing to do with it," repeated the man on the floor.  "I 'adnothing to do with it.  I never thought of such a thing.  I've only beenin the place ten minutes; put that down, sir."The sergeant groped with his left hand, and picking up the Japanesesword, held it at him."I've never seen it before," said the prisoner, struggling."It used to hang on the wall," said Burleigh.  "He must have snatched itdown.  It was on the wall when I left Fletcher a little while ago.""How long?"  inquired the sergeant."Perhaps an hour, perhaps half an hour," was the reply.  "I went to mybedroom."The man on the floor twisted his head and regarded him narrowly."You done it!"  he cried, fiercely.  "You done it, and you want me toswing for it.""That 'll do," said the indignant constable.The sergeant let his burden gently to the floor again."You hold your tongue, you devil!"  he said, menacingly.He crossed to the table and poured a little spirit into a glass and tookit in his hand.  Then he put it down again and crossed to Burleigh."Feeling better, sir?"  he asked.The other nodded faintly."You won't want this thing any more," said the sergeant.He pointed to the pistol which the other still held, and taking it fromhim gently, put it into his pocket."You've hurt your wrist, sir," he said, anxiously.Burleigh raised one hand sharply, and then the other."This one, I think," said the sergeant.  "I saw it just now."He took the other's wrists in his hand, and suddenly holding them in thegrip of a vice, whipped out something from his pocket--something hard andcold, which snapped suddenly on Burleigh's wrists, and held them fast."That's right," said the sergeant; "keep quiet."The constable turned round in amaze; Burleigh sprang toward himfuriously."Take these things off!"  he choked.  "Have you gone mad?  Take themoff!""All in good time," said the sergeant."Take them off!"  cried Burleigh again.For answer the sergeant took him in a powerful grip, and staring steadilyat his white face and gleaming eyes, forced him to the other end of theroom and pushed him into a chair."Collins," he said, sharply."Sir?"  said the astonished subordinate."Run to the doctor at the corner hard as you can run!"  said the other."This man is not dead!"As the man left the room the sergeant took up the glass of spirits he hadpoured out, and kneeling down by Fletcher again, raised his head andtried to pour a little down his throat.  Burleigh, sitting in his corner,watched like one in a trance.  He saw the constable return with thebreathless surgeon, saw the three men bending over Fletcher, and then sawthe eyes of the dying man open and the lips of the dying man move.  Hewas conscious that the sergeant made some notes in a pocket-book, andthat all three men eyed him closely.  The sergeant stepped toward him andplaced his hand on his shoulder, and obedient to the touch, he arose andwent with him out into the night.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of In The Library, by W.W.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year.     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.

STRATAGEMS     ON THE COMPARATIVE PLACE OF INTEREST AND BEAUTY IN WORKS OF ART     PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS     ON THE WISDOM OF LIFE: APHORISMS     GENIUS AND VIRTUETRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.The volume now before the reader is a tardy addition to a series inwhich I have endeavoured to present Schopenhauer's minor writings inan adequate form.Its contents are drawn entirely from his posthumous papers. Aselection of them was given to the world some three of four yearsafter his death by his friend and literary executor, JuliusFrauenstaedt, who for this and other offices of piety, has receivedless recognition than he deserves. The papers then published haverecently been issued afresh, with considerable additions andcorrections, by Dr. Eduard Grisebach, who is also entitled togratitude for the care with which he has followed the text of themanuscripts, now in the Royal Library at Berlin, and for having drawnattention--although in terms that are unnecessarily severe--to anumber of faults and failings on the part of the previous editor.The fact that all Schopenhauer's works, together with a volume of hiscorrespondence, may now be obtained in a certain cheap collection ofthe best national and foreign literature displayed in almost everybookshop in Germany, is sufficient evidence that in his own countrythe writer's popularity is still very great; nor does the demand fortranslations indicate that his fame has at all diminished abroad. Thefavour with which the new edition of his posthumous papers has beenreceived induces me, therefore, to resume a task which I thought, fiveyears ago, that I had finally completed; and it is my intention tobring out one more volume, selected partly from these papers andpartly from his _Parerga_.A small part of the essay on _The Art of Controversy_ was published inSchopenhauer's lifetime, in the chapter of the _Parerga_ headed _ZurLogik und Dialektik_. The intelligent reader will discover that a gooddeal of its contents is of an ironical character. As regards the lastthree essays I must observe that I have omitted such passagesas appear to be no longer of any general interest or otherwiseunsuitable. I must also confess to having taken one or two libertieswith the titles, in order that they may the more effectively fulfilthe purpose for which titles exist. In other respects I have adheredto the original with the kind of fidelity which aims at producingan impression as nearly as possible similar to that produced by theoriginal.T.B.S.February, 1896THE ART OF CONTROVERSY.PRELIMINARY: LOGIC AND DIALECTIC.By the ancients, Logic and Dialectic were used as synonymous terms;although [Greek: logizesthai], "to think over, to consider, tocalculate," and [Greek: dialegesthai], "to converse," are two verydifferent things.The name Dialectic was, as we are informed by Diogenes Laertius, firstused by Plato; and in the _Phaedrus, Sophist, Republic_, bk. vii., andelsewhere, we find that by Dialectic he means the regular employmentof the reason, and skill in the practice of it. Aristotle also usesthe word in this sense; but, according to Laurentius Valla, he wasthe first to use Logic too in a similar way.[1] Dialectic, therefore,seems to be an older word than Logic. Cicero and Quintilian use thewords in the same general signification.[2][Footnote 1: He speaks of [Greek: dyscherelai logicai], that is,"difficult points," [Greek: protasis logicae aporia logicae]][Footnote 2: Cic. _in Lucullo: Dialecticam inventam esse, veri etfalsi quasi disceptatricem. Topica_, c. 2: _Stoici enim judicandi viasdiligenter persecuti sunt, ea scientia, quam_ Dialecticen _appellant_.Quint., lib. ii., 12: _Itaque haec pars dialecticae, sive illamdisputatricem dicere malimus_; and with him this latter word appearsto be the Latin equivalent for Dialectic. (So far according to "PetriRami dialectica, Audomari Talaei praelectionibus illustrata." 1569.)]This use of the words and synonymous terms lasted through the MiddleAges into modern times; in fact, until the present day. But morerecently, and in particular by Kant, Dialectic has often been employedin a bad sense, as meaning "the art of sophistical controversy";and hence Logic has been preferred, as of the two the more innocentdesignation. Nevertheless, both originally meant the same thing; andin the last few years they have again been recognised as synonymous.It is a pity that the words have thus been used from of old, and thatI am not quite at liberty to distinguish their meanings. Otherwise, Ishould have preferred to define _Logic_ (from [Greek: logos], "word"and "reason," which are inseparable) as "the science of the laws ofthought, that is, of the method of reason"; and _Dialectic_ (from[Greek: dialegesthai], "to converse"--and every conversationcommunicates either facts or opinions, that is to say, it ishistorical or deliberative) as "the art of disputation," in the modernsense of the word. It it clear, then, that Logic deals with a subjectof a purely _a priori_ character, separable in definition fromexperience, namely, the laws of thought, the process of reason or the[Greek: logos], the laws, that is, which reason follows when it isleft to itself and not hindered, as in the case of solitary thought onthe part of a rational being who is in no way misled. Dialectic, onthe other hand, would treat of the intercourse between two rationalbeings who, because they are rational, ought to think in common, butwho, as soon as they cease to agree like two clocks keeping exactlythe same time, create a disputation, or intellectual contest. Regardedas purely rational beings, the individuals would, I say, necessarilybe in agreement, and their variation springs from the differenceessential to individuality; in other words, it is drawn fromexperience.Logic, therefore, as the science of thought, or the science of theprocess of pure reason, should be capable of being constructed _apriori_. Dialectic, for the most part, can be constructed only _aposteriori_; that is to say, we may learn its rules by an experientialknowledge of the disturbance which pure thought suffers through thedifference of individuality manifested in the intercourse betweentwo rational beings, and also by acquaintance with the means whichdisputants adopt in order to make good against one another their ownindividual thought, and to show that it is pure and objective. Forhuman nature is such that if A. and B. are engaged in thinking incommon, and are communicating their opinions to one another on anysubject, so long as it is not a mere fact of history, and A. perceivesthat B.'s thoughts on one and the same subject are not the same as hisown, he does not begin by revising his own process of thinking, so asto discover any mistake which he may have made, but he assumes thatthe mistake has occurred in B.'s. In other words, man is naturallyobstinate; and this quality in him is attended with certain results,treated of in the branch of knowledge which I should like to callDialectic, but which, in order to avoid misunderstanding, I shall callControversial or Eristical Dialectic. Accordingly, it is the branchof knowledge which treats of the obstinacy natural to man. Eristic isonly a harsher name for the same thing.Controversial Dialectic is the art of disputing, and of disputing insuch a way as to hold one's own, whether one is in the right or thewrong--_per fas et nefas_.[1] A man may be objectively in the right,and nevertheless in the eyes of bystanders, and sometimes in his own,he may come off worst. For example, I may advance a proof of someassertion, and my adversary may refute the proof, and thus appear tohave refuted the assertion, for which there may, nevertheless, beother proofs. In this case, of course, my adversary and I changeplaces: he comes off best, although, as a matter of fact, he is in thewrong.[Footnote 1: According to Diogenes Laertius, v., 28, Aristotle putRhetoric and Dialectic together, as aiming at persuasion, [Greek: topithanon]; and Analytic and Philosophy as aiming at truth. Aristotledoes, indeed, distinguish between (1) _Logic_, or Analytic, as thetheory or method of arriving at true or apodeictic conclusions; and(2) _Dialectic_ as the method of arriving at conclusions that areaccepted or pass current as true, [Greek: endoxa] _probabilia_;conclusions in regard to which it is not taken for granted that theyare false, and also not taken for granted that they are true inthemselves, since that is not the point. What is this but the art ofbeing in the right, whether one has any reason for being so or not, inother words, the art of attaining the appearance of truth, regardlessof its substance? That is, then, as I put it above.Aristotle divides all conclusions into logical and dialectical, in themanner described, and then into eristical. (3) _Eristic_ is the methodby which the form of the conclusion is correct, but the premisses, thematerials from which it is drawn, are not true, but only appear to betrue. Finally (4) _Sophistic_ is the method in which the form of theconclusion is false, although it seems correct. These three lastproperly belong to the art of Controversial Dialectic, as they haveno objective truth in view, but only the appearance of it, and payno regard to truth itself; that is to say, they aim at victory.Aristotle's book on _Sophistic Conclusions_ was edited apart from theothers, and at a later date. It was the last book of his _Dialectic_.]If the reader asks how this is, I reply that it is simply thenatural baseness of human nature. If human nature were not base, butthoroughly honourable, we should in every debate have no other aimthan the discovery of truth; we should not in the least care whetherthe truth proved to be in favour of the opinion which we had begun byexpressing, or of the opinion of our adversary. That we shouldregard as a matter of no moment, or, at any rate, of very secondaryconsequence; but, as things are, it is the main concern. Ourinnate vanity, which is particularly sensitive in reference to ourintellectual powers, will not suffer us to allow that our firstposition was wrong and our adversary's right. The way out of thisdifficulty would be simply to take the trouble always to form acorrect judgment. For this a man would have to think before he spoke.But, with most men, innate vanity is accompanied by loquacity andinnate dishonesty. They speak before they think; and even though theymay afterwards perceive that they are wrong, and that what they assertis false, they want it to seem the contrary. The interest in truth,which may be presumed to have been their only motive when they statedthe proposition alleged to be true, now gives way to the interests ofvanity: and so, for the sake of vanity, what is true must seem false,and what is false must seem true.However, this very dishonesty, this persistence in a proposition whichseems false even to ourselves, has something to be said for it. Itoften happens that we begin with the firm conviction of the truthof our statement; but our opponent's argument appears to refute it.Should we abandon our position at once, we may discover later onthat we were right after all; the proof we offered was false, butnevertheless there was a proof for our statement which was true. Theargument which would have been our salvation did not occur to us atthe moment. Hence we make it a rule to attack a counter-argument, eventhough to all appearances it is true and forcible, in the belief thatits truth is only superficial, and that in the course of the disputeanother argument will occur to us by which we may upset it, or succeedin confirming the truth of our statement. In this way we are almostcompelled to become dishonest; or, at any rate, the temptation to doso is very great. Thus it is that the weakness of our intellect andthe perversity of our will lend each other mutual support; and that,generally, a disputant fights not for truth, but for his proposition,as though it were a battle _pro aris et focis_. He sets to work _perfas et nefas_; nay, as we have seen, he cannot easily do otherwise.As a rule, then, every man will insist on maintaining whatever hehas said, even though for the moment he may consider it false ordoubtful.[1][Footnote 1: Machiavelli recommends his Prince to make use of everymoment that his neighbour is weak, in order to attack him; asotherwise his neighbour may do the same. If honour and fidelityprevailed in the world, it would be a different matter; but as theseare qualities not to be expected, a man must not practise themhimself, because he will meet with a bad return. It is just the samein a dispute: if I allow that my opponent is right as soon as he seemsto be so, it is scarcely probable that he will do the same when theposition is reversed; and as he acts wrongly, I am compelled to actwrongly too. It is easy to say that we must yield to truth, withoutany prepossession in favour of our own statements; but we cannotassume that our opponent will do it, and therefore we cannot doit either. Nay, if I were to abandon the position on which I hadpreviously bestowed much thought, as soon as it appeared that he wasright, it might easily happen that I might be misled by a momentaryimpression, and give up the truth in order to accept an error.]To some extent every man is armed against such a procedure by his owncunning and villainy. He learns by daily experience, and thus comesto have his own _natural Dialectic_, just as he has his own _naturalLogic_. But his Dialectic is by no means as safe a guide as his Logic.It is not so easy for any one to think or draw an inference contraryto the laws of Logic; false judgments are frequent, false conclusionsvery rare. A man cannot easily be deficient in natural Logic, but hemay very easily be deficient in natural Dialectic, which is a giftapportioned in unequal measure. In so far natural Dialectic resemblesthe faculty of judgment, which differs in degree with every man; whilereason, strictly speaking, is the same. For it often happens that ina matter in which a man is really in the right, he is confounded orrefuted by merely superficial arguments; and if he emerges victoriousfrom a contest, he owes it very often not so much to the correctnessof his judgment in stating his proposition, as to the cunning andaddress with which he defended it.Here, as in all other cases, the best gifts are born with a man;nevertheless, much may be done to make him a master of this art bypractice, and also by a consideration of the tactics which may be usedto defeat an opponent, or which he uses himself for a similar purpose.Therefore, even though Logic may be of no very real, practical use,Dialectic may certainly be so; and Aristotle, too, seems to me tohave drawn up his Logic proper, or Analytic, as a foundation andpreparation for his Dialectic, and to have made this his chiefbusiness. Logic is concerned with the mere form of propositions;Dialectic, with their contents or matter--in a word, with theirsubstance. It was proper, therefore, to consider the general form ofall propositions before proceeding to particulars.Aristotle does not define the object of Dialectic as exactly as Ihave done it here; for while he allows that its principal objectis disputation, he declares at the same time that it is also thediscovery of truth.[1] Again, he says, later on, that if, from thephilosophical point of view, propositions are dealt with according totheir truth, Dialectic regards them according to their plausibility,or the measure in which they will win the approval and assent ofothers.[2] He is aware that the objective truth of a proposition mustbe distinguished and separated from the way in which it is pressedhome, and approbation won for it; but he fails to draw a sufficientlysharp distinction between these two aspects of the matter, so as toreserve Dialectic for the latter alone.[3] The rules which he oftengives for Dialectic contain some of those which properly belong toLogic; and hence it appears to me that he has not provided a clearsolution of the problem.[Footnote 1: _Topica_, bk. i., 2.][Footnote 2: _Ib_., 12.][Footnote 3: On the other hand, in his book _De Sophisticis Elenchis_,he takes too much trouble to separate _Dialectic_ from _Sophistic_and _Eristic_, where the distinction is said to consist in this, thatdialectical conclusions are true in their form and their contents,while sophistical and eristical conclusions are false.Eristic so far differs from Sophistic that, while the master ofEristic aims at mere victory, the Sophist looks to the reputation,and with it, the monetary rewards which he will gain. But whether aproposition is true in respect of its contents is far too uncertain amatter to form the foundation of the distinction in question; andit is a matter on which the disputant least of all can arrive atcertainty; nor is it disclosed in any very sure form even by theresult of the disputation. Therefore, when Aristotle speaks of_Dialectic_, we must include in it Sophistic, Eristic, and Peirastic,and define it as "the art of getting the best of it in a dispute," inwhich, unquestionably, the safest plan is to be in the right to beginwith; but this in itself is not enough in the existing dispositionof mankind, and, on the other hand, with the weakness of the humanintellect, it is not altogether necessary. Other expedients arerequired, which, just because they are unnecessary to the attainmentof objective truth, may also be used when a man is objectively in thewrong; and whether or not this is the case, is hardly ever a matter ofcomplete certainty.I am of opinion, therefore, that a sharper distinction should be drawnbetween Dialectic and Logic than Aristotle has given us; that to Logicwe should assign objective truth as far as it is merely formal, andthat Dialectic should be confined to the art of gaining one's point,and contrarily, that Sophistic and Eristic should not be distinguishedfrom Dialectic in Aristotle's fashion, since the difference which hedraws rests on objective and material truth; and in regard to whatthis is, we cannot attain any clear certainty before discussion; butwe are compelled, with Pilate, to ask, _What is truth_? For truthis in the depths, [Greek: en butho hae halaetheia] (a saying ofDemocritus, _Diog. Laert_., ix., 72). Two men often engage in a warmdispute, and then return to their homes each of the other's opinion,which he has exchanged for his own. It is easy to say that in everydispute we should have no other aim than the advancement of truth; butbefore dispute no one knows where it is, and through his opponent'sarguments and his own a man is misled.]We must always keep the subject of one branch of knowledge quitedistinct from that of any other. To form a clear idea of the provinceof Dialectic, we must pay no attention to objective truth, which is anaffair of Logic; we must regard it simply as _the art of getting thebest of it in a dispute_, which, as we have seen, is all the easier ifwe are actually in the right. In itself Dialectic has nothing to dobut to show how a man may defend himself against attacks of everykind, and especially against dishonest attacks; and, in thesame fashion, how he may attack another man's statement withoutcontradicting himself, or generally without being defeated. Thediscovery of objective truth must be separated from the art of winningacceptance for propositions; for objective truth is an entirelydifferent matter: it is the business of sound judgment, reflection andexperience, for which there is no special art.Such, then, is the aim of Dialectic. It has been defined as the Logicof appearance; but the definition is a wrong one, as in that case itcould only be used to repel false propositions. But even when a manhas the right on his side, he needs Dialectic in order to defend andmaintain it; he must know what the dishonest tricks are, in order tomeet them; nay, he must often make use of them himself, so as to beatthe enemy with his own weapons.Accordingly, in a dialectical contest we must put objective truthaside, or, rather, we must regard it as an accidental circumstance,and look only to the defence of our own position and the refutation ofour opponent's.In following out the rules to this end, no respect should be paid toobjective truth, because we usually do not know where the truth lies.As I have said, a man often does not himself know whether he is in theright or not; he often believes it, and is mistaken: both sides oftenbelieve it. Truth is in the depths. At the beginning of a contest eachman believes, as a rule, that right is on his side; in the course ofit, both become doubtful, and the truth is not determined or confirmeduntil the close.Dialectic, then, need have nothing to do with truth, as little as thefencing master considers who is in the right when a dispute leads to aduel. Thrust and parry is the whole business. Dialectic is the art ofintellectual fencing; and it is only when we so regard it that we canerect it into a branch of knowledge. For if we take purely objectivetruth as our aim, we are reduced to mere Logic; if we take themaintenance of false propositions, it is mere Sophistic; and in eithercase it would have to be assumed that we were aware of what was trueand what was false; and it is seldom that we have any clear idea ofthe truth beforehand. The true conception of Dialectic is, then, thatwhich we have formed: it is the art of intellectual fencing used forthe purpose of getting the best of it in a dispute; and, although thename _Eristic_ would be more suitable, it is more correct to call itcontroversial Dialectic, _Dialectica eristica_.Dialectic in this sense of the word has no other aim but to reduceto a regular system and collect and exhibit the arts which most menemploy when they observe, in a dispute, that truth is not on theirside, and still attempt to gain the day. Hence, it would be veryinexpedient to pay any regard to objective truth or its advancement ina science of Dialectic; since this is not done in that original andnatural Dialectic innate in men, where they strive for nothing butvictory. The science of Dialectic, in one sense of the word, is mainlyconcerned to tabulate and analyse dishonest stratagems, in order thatin a real debate they may be at once recognised and defeated. It isfor this very reason that Dialectic must admittedly take victory, andnot objective truth, for its aim and purpose.I am not aware that anything has been done in this direction,although I have made inquiries far and wide.[1] It is, therefore, anuncultivated soil. To accomplish our purpose, we must draw from ourexperience; we must observe how in the debates which often arise inour intercourse with our fellow-men this or that stratagem is employedby one side or the other. By finding out the common elements in tricksrepeated in different forms, we shall be enabled to exhibit certaingeneral stratagems which may be advantageous, as well for our own use,as for frustrating others if they use them.[Footnote 1: Diogenes Laertes tells us that among the numerouswritings on Rhetoric by Theophrastus, all of which have been lost,there was one entitled [Greek: Agonistikon taes peri tous eristikousgogous theorias.] That would have been just what we want.]What follows is to be regarded as a first attempt.THE BASIS OF ALL DIALECTIC.First of all, we must consider the essential nature of every dispute:what it is that really takes place in it.Our opponent has stated a thesis, or we ourselves,--it is all one.There are two modes of refuting it, and two courses that we maypursue.I. The modes are (1) _ad rem_, (2) _ad hominem_ or _ex concessis_.That is to say: We may show either that the proposition is not inaccordance with the nature of things, i.e., with absolute, objectivetruth; or that it is inconsistent with other statements or admissionsof our opponent, i.e., with truth as it appears to him. The lattermode of arguing a question produces only a relative conviction, andmakes no difference whatever to the objective truth of the matter.II. The two courses that we may pursue are (1) the direct, and (2) theindirect refutation. The direct attacks the reason for the thesis; theindirect, its results. The direct refutation shows that the thesis isnot true; the indirect, that it cannot be true.The direct course admits of a twofold procedure. Either we mayshow that the reasons for the statement are false (_nego majorem,minorem_); or we may admit the reasons or premisses, but show that thestatement does not follow from them (_nego consequentiam)_; that is,we attack the conclusion or form of the syllogism.The direct refutation makes use either of the _diversion_ or of the_instance_._(a)_ The _diversion_.--We accept our opponent's proposition as true,and then show what follows from it when we bring it into connectionwith some other proposition acknowledged to be true. We use the twopropositions as the premisses of a syllogism giving a conclusion whichis manifestly false, as contradicting either the nature of things,[1]or other statements of our opponent himself; that is to say, theconclusion is false either _ad rem_ or _ad hominem_.[2] Consequently,our opponent's proposition must have been false; for, while truepremisses can give only a true conclusion, false premisses need notalways give a false one.[Footnote 1: If it is in direct contradiction with a perfectlyundoubted, truth, we have reduced our opponent's position _adabsurdum_.][Footnote 2: Socrates, in _Hippia Maj. et alias_.]_(b) The instance_, or the example to the contrary.--This consists inrefuting the general proposition by direct reference to particularcases which are included in it in the way in which it is stated, butto which it does not apply, and by which it is therefore shown to benecessarily false.Such is the framework or skeleton of all forms of disputation; for tothis every kind of controversy may be ultimately reduced. The whole ofa controversy may, however, actually proceed in the manner described,or only appear to do so; and it may be supported by genuine orspurious arguments. It is just because it is not easy to make outthe truth in regard to this matter, that debates are so long and soobstinate.Nor can we, in ordering the argument, separate actual from apparenttruth, since even the disputants are not certain about it beforehand.Therefore I shall describe the various tricks or stratagems withoutregard to questions of objective truth or falsity; for that is amatter on which we have no assurance, and which cannot be determinedpreviously. Moreover, in every disputation or argument on any subjectwe must agree about something; and by this, as a principle, we must bewilling to judge the matter in question. We cannot argue with thosewho deny principles: _Contra negantem principia non est disputandum_.STRATAGEMS.I.The _Extension_.--This consists in carrying your opponent'sproposition beyond its natural limits; in giving it as general asignification and as wide a sense as possible, so as to exaggerate it;and, on the other hand, in giving your own proposition as restricteda sense and as narrow limits as you can, because the more general astatement becomes, the more numerous are the objections to which it isopen. The defence consists in an accurate statement of the point oressential question at issue.Example 1.--I asserted that the English were supreme in drama. Myopponent attempted _to_ give an instance to the contrary, and repliedthat it was a well-known fact that in music, and consequently inopera, they could do nothing at all. I repelled the attack byreminding him that music was not included in dramatic art, whichcovered tragedy and comedy alone. This he knew very well. What he haddone was to try to generalise my proposition, so that it would applyto all theatrical representations, and, consequently, to opera andthen to music, in order to make certain of defeating me. Contrarily,we may save our proposition by reducing it within narrower limitsthan we had first intended, if our way of expressing it favours thisexpedient.Example 2.--A. declares that the Peace of 1814 gave back theirindependence to all the German towns of the Hanseatic League. B. givesan instance to the contrary by reciting the fact that Dantzig, whichreceived its independence from Buonaparte, lost it by that Peace. A.saves himself thus: "I said 'all German towns,' and Dantzig was inPoland."This trick was mentioned by Aristotle in the _Topica_ (bk. viii., cc.11, 12).Example 3.--Lamarck, in his _Philosophic Zoologique_ (vol. i., p.208), states that the polype has no feeling, because it has no nerves.It is certain, however, that it has some sort of perception; for itadvances towards light by moving in an ingenious fashion from branchto branch, and it seizes its prey. Hence it has been assumed that itsnervous system is spread over the whole of its body in equal measure,as though it were blended with it; for it is obvious that the polypepossesses some faculty of perception without having any separateorgans of sense. Since this assumption refutes Lamarck's position, heargues thus: "In that case all parts of its body must be capable ofevery kind of feeling, and also of motion, of will, of thought. Thepolype would have all the organs of the most perfect animal in everypoint of its body; every point could see, smell, taste, hear, and soon; nay, it could think, judge, and draw conclusions; every particleof its body would be a perfect animal and it would stand higher thanman, as every part of it would possess all the faculties which manpossesses only in the whole of him. Further, there would be no reasonfor not extending what is true of the polype to all monads, the mostimperfect of all creatures, and ultimately to the plants, which arealso alive, etc., etc." By using dialectical tricks of this kind awriter betrays that he is secretly conscious of being in the wrong.Because it was said that the creature's whole body is sensitive tolight, and is therefore possessed of nerves, he makes out that itswhole body is capable of thought.II.The _Homonymy_.--This trick is to extend a proposition to somethingwhich has little or nothing in common with the matter in question butthe similarity of the word; then to refute it triumphantly, and soclaim credit for having refuted the original statement.It may be noted here that synonyms are two words for the sameconception; homonyms, two conceptions which are covered by the sameword. (See Aristotle, _Topica_, bk. i., c. 13.) "Deep," "cutting,""high," used at one moment of bodies at another of tones, arehomonyms; "honourable" and "honest" are synonyms.This is a trick which may be regarded as identical with the sophism_ex homonymia_; although, if the sophism is obvious, it will deceiveno one.  _Every light can be extinguished.  The intellect is a light.  Therefore it can be extinguished_.Here it is at once clear that there are four terms in the syllogism,"light" being used both in a real and in a metaphorical sense. But ifthe sophism takes a subtle form, it is, of course, apt to mislead,especially where the conceptions which are covered by the same wordare related, and inclined to be interchangeable. It is never subtleenough to deceive, if it is used intentionally; and therefore cases ofit must be collected from actual and individual experience.It would be a very good thing if every trick could receive some shortand obviously appropriate name, so that when a man used this or thatparticular trick, he could be at once reproached for it.I will give two examples of the homonymy.Example 1.--A.: "You are not yet initiated into the mysteries of theKantian philosophy."B.: "Oh, if it's mysteries you're talking of, I'll have nothing to dowith them."Example 2.--I condemned the principle involved in the word _honour_as a foolish one; for, according to it, a man loses his honour byreceiving an insult, which he cannot wipe out unless he replies with astill greater insult, or by shedding his adversary's blood or his own.I contended that a man's true honour cannot be outraged by what hesuffers, but only and alone by what he does; for there is no sayingwhat may befall any one of us. My opponent immediately attackedthe reason I had given, and triumphantly proved to me that when atradesman was falsely accused of misrepresentation, dishonesty, orneglect in his business, it was an attack upon his honour, which inthis case was outraged solely by what he suffered, and that he couldonly retrieve it by punishing his aggressor and making him retract.Here, by a homonymy, he was foisting _civic honour_, which isotherwise called _good name_, and which may be outraged by libel andslander, on to the conception of _knightly honour_, also called _pointd'honneur_, which may be outraged by insult. And since an attack onthe former cannot be disregarded, but must be repelled by publicdisproof, so, with the same justification, an attack on the lattermust not be disregarded either, but it must be defeated by stillgreater insult and a duel. Here we have a confusion of two essentiallydifferent things through the homonymy in the word _honour_, and aconsequent alteration of the point in dispute.III.Another trick is to take a proposition which is laid down relatively,and in reference to some particular matter, as though it were utteredwith a general or absolute application; or, at least, to take it insome quite different sense, and then refute it. Aristotle's example isas follows:A Moor is black; but in regard to his teeth he is white; therefore, heis black and not black at the same moment. This is an obvious sophism,which will deceive no one. Let us contrast it with one drawn fromactual experience.In talking of philosophy, I admitted that my system upheld theQuietists, and commended them. Shortly afterwards the conversationturned upon Hegel, and I maintained that his writings were mostlynonsense; or, at any rate, that there were many passages in them wherethe author wrote the words, and it was left to the reader to find ameaning for them. My opponent did not attempt to refute this assertion_ad rem_, but contented himself by advancing the _argumentum adhominem_, and telling me that I had just been praising the Quietists,and that they had written a good deal of nonsense too.This I admitted; but, by way of correcting him, I said that I hadpraised the Quietists, not as philosophers and writers, that is tosay, for their achievements in the sphere of _theory_, but only asmen, and for their conduct in mere matters of _practice_; and that inHegel's case we were talking of theories. In this way I parried theattack.The first three tricks are of a kindred character. They have thisin common, that something different is attacked from that which wasasserted. It would therefore be an _ignoratio elenchi_ to allowoneself to be disposed of in such a manner.For in all the examples that I have given, what the opponent says istrue, but it stands in apparent and not in real contradiction with thethesis. All that the man whom he is attacking has to do is to deny thevalidity of his syllogism; to deny, namely, the conclusion which hedraws, that because his proposition is true, ours is false. In thisway his refutation is itself directly refuted by a denial of hisconclusion, _per negationem consequentiae_. Another trick is to refuseto admit true premisses because of a foreseen conclusion. There aretwo ways of defeating it, incorporated in the next two sections.IV.If you want to draw a conclusion, you must not let it be foreseen, butyou must get the premisses admitted one by one, unobserved, minglingthem here and there in your talk; otherwise, your opponent willattempt all sorts of chicanery. Or, if it is doubtful whether youropponent will admit them, you must advance the premisses of thesepremisses; that is to say, you must draw up pro-syllogisms, and getthe premisses of several of them admitted in no definite order.In this way you conceal your game until you have obtained all theadmissions that are necessary, and so reach your goal by making acircuit. These rules are given by Aristotle in his _Topica_, bk.viii., c. 1. It is a trick which needs no illustration.V.To prove the truth of a proposition, you may also employ previouspropositions that are not true, should your opponent refuse to admitthe true ones, either because he fails to perceive their truth, orbecause he sees that the thesis immediately follows from them. In thatcase the plan is to take propositions which are false in themselvesbut true for your opponent, and argue from the way in which he thinks,that is to say, _ex concessis_. For a true conclusion may followfrom false premisses, but not _vice versa_. In the same fashionyour opponent's false propositions may be refuted by other falsepropositions, which he, however, takes to be true; for it is with himthat you have to do, and you must use the thoughts that he uses. Forinstance, if he is a member of some sect to which you do not belong,you may employ the declared, opinions of this sect against him, asprinciples.[1][Footnote 1: Aristotle, _Topica_ bk. viii., chap. 2.]VI.Another plan is to beg the question in disguise by postulating whathas to be proved, either (1) under another name; for instance, "goodrepute" instead of "honour"; "virtue" instead of "virginity," etc.;or by using such convertible terms as "red-blooded animals" and"vertebrates"; or (2) by making a general assumption covering theparticular point in dispute; for instance, maintaining the uncertaintyof medicine by postulating the uncertainty of all human knowledge. (3)If, _vice versa_, two things follow one from the other, and one is tobe proved, you may postulate the other. (4) If a general propositionis to be proved, you may get your opponent to admit every one of theparticulars. This is the converse of the second.[1][Footnote 1: _Idem_, chap. 11. The last chapter of this work containssome good rules for the practice of Dialectics.]VII.Should the disputation be conducted on somewhat strict and formallines, and there be a desire to arrive at a very clear understanding,he who states the proposition and wants to prove it may proceedagainst his opponent by question, in order to show the truth of thestatement from his admissions. The erotematic, or Socratic, method wasespecially in use among the ancients; and this and some of the tricksfollowing later on are akin to it.[1][Footnote 1: They are all a free version of chap. 15 of Aristotle's_De Sophistici Elenchis_.]The plan is to ask a great many wide-reaching questions at once, so asto hide what you want to get admitted, and, on the other hand, quicklypropound the argument resulting from the admissions; for those who areslow of understanding cannot follow accurately, and do not notice anymistakes or gaps there may be in the demonstration.VIII.This trick consists in making your opponent angry; for when he isangry he is incapable of judging aright, and perceiving wherehis advantage lies. You can make him angry by doing him repeatedinjustice, or practising some kind of chicanery, and being generallyinsolent.IX.Or you may put questions in an order different from that which theconclusion to be drawn from them requires, and transpose them, soas not to let him know at what you are aiming. He can then take noprecautions. You may also use his answers for different or evenopposite conclusions, according to their character. This is akin tothe trick of masking your procedure.X.If you observe that your opponent designedly returns a negative answerto the questions which, for the sake of your proposition, you wanthim to answer in the affirmative, you must ask the converse of theproposition, as though it were that which you were anxious to seeaffirmed; or, at any rate, you may give him his choice of both, sothat he may not perceive which of them you are asking him to affirm.XL.If you make an induction, and your opponent grants you the particularcases by which it is to be supported, you must refrain from asking himif he also admits the general truth which issues from the particulars,but introduce it afterwards as a settled and admitted fact; for, inthe meanwhile, he will himself come to believe that he has admittedit, and the same impression will be received by the audience, becausethey will remember the many questions as to the particulars, andsuppose that they must, of course, have attained their end.XII.If the conversation turns upon some general conception which hasno particular name, but requires some figurative or metaphoricaldesignation, you must begin by choosing a metaphor that is favourableto your proposition. For instance, the names used to denote the twopolitical parties in Spain, _Serviles_ and _Liberates_, are obviouslychosen by the latter. The name _Protestants_ is chosen by themselves,and also the name _Evangelicals_; but the Catholics call them_heretics_. Similarly, in regard to the names of things which admitof a more exact and definite meaning: for example, if your opponentproposes an _alteration_, you can call it an _innovation_, as this isan invidious word. If you yourself make the proposal, it will be theconverse. In the first case, you can call the antagonistic principle"the existing order," in the second, "antiquated prejudice." What animpartial man with no further purpose to serve would call "publicworship" or a "system of religion," is described by an adherent as"piety," "godliness": and by an opponent as "bigotry," "superstition."This is, at bottom, a subtle _petitio principii_. What is sought to beproved is, first of all, inserted in the definition, whence it is thentaken by mere analysis. What one man calls "placing in safe custody,"another calls "throwing into prison." A speaker often betrays hispurpose beforehand by the names which he gives to things. One mantalks of "the clergy"; another, of "the priests."Of all the tricks of controversy, this is the most frequent, and it isused instinctively. You hear of "religious zeal," or "fanaticism"; a"_faux pas_" a "piece of gallantry," or "adultery"; an "equivocal," ora "bawdy" story; "embarrassment," or "bankruptcy"; "through influenceand connection," or by "bribery and nepotism"; "sincere gratitude," or"good pay."XIII.To make your opponent accept a proposition, you must give him thecounter-proposition as well, leaving him his choice of the two; andyou must render the contrast as glaring as you can, so that to avoidbeing paradoxical he will accept the proposition, which is thus madeto look quite probable. For instance, if you want to make him admitthat a boy must do everything that his father tells him to do, ask him"whether in all things we must obey or disobey our parents." Or, ifa thing is said to occur "often," ask whether by "often" you are tounderstand few or many cases; and he will say "many." It is as thoughyou were to put grey next black, and call it white; or next white, andcall it black.XIV.This, which is an impudent trick, is played as follows: When youropponent has answered several of your questions without the answersturning out favourable to the conclusion at which you are aiming,advance the desired conclusion,--although it does not in the leastfollow,--as though it had been proved, and proclaim it in a tone oftriumph. If your opponent is shy or stupid, and you yourself possessa great deal of impudence and a good voice, the trick may easilysucceed. It is akin to the fallacy _non causae ut causae_.XV.If you have advanced a paradoxical proposition and find a difficultyin proving it, you may submit for your opponent's acceptance orrejection some true proposition, the truth of which, however, is notquite palpable, as though you wished to draw your proof from it.Should he reject it because he suspects a trick, you can obtain yourtriumph by showing how absurd he is; should he accept it> you have gotreason on your side for the moment, and must now look about you; orelse you can employ the previous trick as well, and maintain that yourparadox is proved by the proposition which he has accepted. For thisan extreme degree of impudence is required; but experience shows casesof it, and there are people who practise it by instinct.XVI.Another trick is to use arguments _ad hominem_, or _ex concessis_[1]When your opponent makes a proposition, you must try to see whether itis not in some way--if needs be, only apparently--inconsistent withsome other proposition which he has made or admitted, or with theprinciples of a school or sect which he has commended and approved, orwith the actions of those who support the sect, or else of those whogive it only an apparent and spurious support, or with his own actionsor want of action. For example, should he defend suicide, you may atonce exclaim, "Why don't you hang yourself?" Should he maintain thatBerlin is an unpleasant place to live in, you may say, "Why don't youleave by the first train?" Some such claptrap is always possible.[Footnote 1: The truth from which I draw my proof may he either (1) ofan objective and universally valid character; in that case my proof isveracious, _secundum veritatem_; and it is such proof alone that hasany genuine validity. Or (2) it may be valid only for the person towhom I wish to prove my proposition, and with whom I am disputing. Hehas, that is to say, either taken up some position once for all as aprejudice, or hastily admitted it in the course of the dispute; andon this I ground my proof. In that case, it is a proof valid only forthis particular man, _ad kominem. I_ compel my opponent to grantmy proposition, but I fail to establish it as a truth of universalvalidity. My proof avails for my opponent alone, but for no one else.For example, if my opponent is a devotee of Kant's, and I ground myproof on some utterance of that philosopher, it is a proof which initself is only _ad hominem_. If he is a Mohammedan, I may prove mypoint by reference to a passage in the Koran, and that is sufficientfor him; but here it is only a proof _ad hominem_,]XVII.If your opponent presses you with a counter-proof, you will often beable to save yourself by advancing some subtle distinction, which, itis true, had not previously occurred to you; that is, if the matteradmits of a double application, or of being taken in any ambiguoussense.XVIII.If you observe that your opponent has taken up a line of argumentwhich will end in your defeat, you must not allow him to carry it toits conclusion, but interrupt the course of the dispute in time, orbreak it off altogether, or lead him away from the subject, and bringhim to others. In short, you must effect the trick which will benoticed later on, the _mutatio controversiae_. (See sec. xxix.)XIX.Should your opponent expressly challenge you to produce any objectionto some definite point in his argument, and you have nothing much tosay, you must try to give the matter a general turn, and then talkagainst that. If you are called upon to say why a particular physicalhypothesis cannot be accepted, you may speak of the fallibility ofhuman knowledge, and give various illustrations of it.XX.When you have elicited all your premisses, and your opponent hasadmitted them, you must refrain from asking him for the conclusion,but draw it at once for yourself; nay, even though one or other of thepremisses should be lacking, you may take it as though it too had beenadmitted, and draw the conclusion. This trick is an application of thefallacy _non causae ut causae_.XXI.When your opponent uses a merely superficial or sophistical argumentand you see through it, you can, it is true, refute it by settingforth its captious and superficial character; but it is better tomeet him with a counter-argument which is just as superficial andsophistical, and so dispose of him; for it is with victory that youare concerned, and not with truth. If, for example, he adopts an_argumentum ad hominem_, it is sufficient to take the force out of itby a counter _argumentum ad hominem_ or _argumentum ex concessis_;and, in general, instead of setting forth the true state of the caseat equal length, it is shorter to take this course if it lies open toyou.XXII.If your opponent requires you to admit something from which thepoint in dispute will immediately follow, you must refuse to do so,declaring that it is a _petitio principii_ For he and the audiencewill regard a proposition which is near akin to the point in disputeas identical with it, and in this way you deprive him of his bestargument.XXIII.Contradiction and contention irritate a man into exaggerating hisstatement. By contradicting your opponent you may drive him intoextending beyond its proper limits a statement which, at all eventswithin those limits and in itself, is true; and when you refute thisexaggerated form of it, you look as though you had also refuted hisoriginal statement. Contrarily, you must take care not to allowyourself to be misled by contradictions into exaggerating or extendinga statement of your own. It will often happen that your opponent willhimself directly try to extend your statement further than you meantit; here you must at once stop him, and bring him back to the limitswhich you set up; "That's what I said, and no more."XXIV.This trick consists in stating a false syllogism. Your opponent makesa proposition, and by false inference and distortion of his ideas youforce from it other propositions which it does not contain and he doesnot in the least mean; nay, which are absurd or dangerous. It thenlooks as if his proposition gave rise to others which are inconsistenteither with themselves or with some acknowledged truth, and so itappears to be indirectly refuted. This is the _diversion_, and it isanother application of the fallacy _non causae ut causae_.XXV.This is a case of the _diversion_ by means of an _instance to thecontrary_. With an induction ([Greek: epagogae]), a great numberof particular instances are required in order to establish it as auniversal proposition; but with the _diversion_ ([Greek: apagogae]) asingle instance, to which the proposition does not apply, is all thatis necessary to overthrow it. This is a controversial method knownas the _instance_--_instantia_, [Greek: enstasis]. For example, "allruminants are horned" is a proposition which may be upset by thesingle instance of the camel. The _instance_ is a case in which auniversal truth is sought to be applied, and something is inserted inthe fundamental definition of it which is not universally true, and bywhich it is upset. But there is room for mistake; and when this trickis employed by your opponent, you must observe (1) whether the examplewhich he gives is really true; for there are problems of which theonly true solution is that the case in point is not true--for example,many miracles, ghost stories, and so on; and (2) whether it reallycomes under the conception of the truth thus stated; for it may onlyappear to do so, and the matter is one to be settled by precisedistinctions; and (3) whether it is really inconsistent with thisconception; for this again may be only an apparent inconsistency.XXVI.A brilliant move is the _retorsio argumenti_, or turning of thetables, by which your opponent's argument is turned against himself.He declares, for instance, "So-and-so is a child, you must makeallowance for him." You retort, "Just because he is a child, I mustcorrect him; otherwise he will persist in his bad habits."XXVII.Should your opponent surprise you by becoming particularly angry at anargument, you must urge it with all the more zeal; not only because itis a good thing to make him angry, but because it may be presumed thatyou have here put your finger on the weak side of his case, and thatjust here he is more open to attack than even for the moment youperceive.XXVIII.This is chiefly practicable in a dispute between scholars in thepresence of the unlearned. If you have no argument _ad rem_, and noneeither _ad hominem_, you can make one _ad auditores_; that is to say,you can start some invalid objection, which, however, only an expertsees to be invalid. Now your opponent is an expert, but those who formyour audience are not, and accordingly in their eyes he is defeated;particularly if the objection which you make places him in anyridiculous light. People are ready to laugh, and you have the laugherson your side. To show that your objection is an idle one, wouldrequire a long explanation on the part of your opponent, and areference to the principles of the branch of knowledge in question, orto the elements of the matter which you are discussing; and people arenot disposed to listen to it.For example, your opponent states that in the original formation of amountain-range the granite and other elements in its composition were,by reason of their high temperature, in a fluid or molten state; thatthe temperature must have amounted to some 480 deg. Fahrenheit; and thatwhen the mass took shape it was covered by the sea. You reply, by anargument _ad auditores_, that at that temperature--nay, indeed, longbefore it had been reached, namely, at 212 deg. Fahrenheit--the sea wouldhave been boiled away, and spread through the air in the form ofsteam. At this the audience laughs. To refute the objection, youropponent would have to show that the boiling-point depends not only onthe degree of warmth, but also on the atmospheric pressure; and thatas soon as about half the sea-water had gone off in the shape ofsteam, this pressure would be so greatly increased that the rest of itwould fail to boil even at a temperature of 480 deg.. He is debarred fromgiving this explanation, as it would require a treatise to demonstratethe matter to those who had no acquaintance with physics.XXIX.[1][Footnote 1: See sec. xviii.]If you find that you are being worsted, you can make a_diversion_--that is, you can suddenly begin to talk of somethingelse, as though it had a bearing on the matter in dispute, andafforded an argument against your opponent. This may be done withoutpresumption if the diversion has, in fact, some general bearing on thematter; but it is a piece of impudence if it has nothing to do withthe case, and is only brought in by way of attacking your opponent.For example, I praised the system prevailing in China, where there isno such thing as hereditary nobility, and offices are bestowed only onthose who succeed in competitive examinations. My opponent maintainedthat learning, as little as the privilege of birth (of which he had ahigh opinion) fits a man for office. We argued, and he got the worstof it. Then he made a diversion, and declared that in China allranks were punished with the bastinado, which he connected with theimmoderate indulgence in tea, and proceeded to make both of them asubject of reproach to the Chinese. To follow him into all this wouldhave been to allow oneself to be drawn into a surrender of the victorywhich had already been won.The diversion is mere impudence if it completely abandons the point indispute, and raises, for instance, some such objection as "Yes, andyou also said just now," and so on. For then the argument becomes tosome extent personal; of the kind which will be treated of in the lastsection. Strictly speaking, it is half-way between the _argumentumad personam_, which will there be discussed, and the _argumentum adhominem_.How very innate this trick is, may be seen in every quarrel betweencommon people. If one of the parties makes some personal reproachagainst the other, the latter, instead of answering it by refuting it,allows it to stand,--as it were, admits it; and replies by reproachinghis antagonist on some other ground. This is a stratagem like thatpursued by Scipio when he attacked the Carthaginians, not in Italy,but in Africa. In war, diversions of this kind may be profitable; butin a quarrel they are poor expedients, because the reproaches remain,and those who look on hear the worst that can be said of both parties.It is a trick that should be used only _faute de mieux_.XXX.This is the _argumentum ad verecundiam_. It consists in making anappeal to authority rather than reason, and in using such an authorityas may suit the degree of knowledge possessed by your opponent.Every man prefers belief to the exercise of judgment, says Seneca; andit is therefore an easy matter if you have an authority on your sidewhich your opponent respects. The more limited his capacity andknowledge, the greater is the number of the authorities who weigh withhim. But if his capacity and knowledge are of a high order, thereare very few; indeed, hardly any at all. He may, perhaps, admit theauthority of professional men versed in a science or an art or ahandicraft of which he knows little or nothing; but even so he willregard it with suspicion. Contrarily, ordinary folk have a deeprespect for professional men of every kind. They are unaware thata man who makes a profession of a thing loves it not for the thingitself, but for the money he makes by it; or that it is rare for a manwho teaches to know his subject thoroughly; for if he studies it as heought, he has in most cases no time left in which to teach it.But there are very many authorities who find respect with the mob, andif you have none that is quite suitable, you can take one that appearsto be so; you may quote what some said in another sense or in othercircumstances. Authorities which your opponent fails to understand arethose of which he generally thinks the most. The unlearned entertain apeculiar respect for a Greek or a Latin flourish. You may also, shouldit be necessary, not only twist your authorities, but actually falsifythem, or quote something which you have invented entirely yourself. Asa rule, your opponent has no books at hand, and could not use them ifhe had. The finest illustration of this is furnished by the French_cure_, who, to avoid being compelled, like other citizens, to pavethe street in front of his house, quoted a saying which he describedas biblical: _paveant illi, ego non pavebo_. That was quite enough forthe municipal officers. A universal prejudice may also be used as anauthority; for most people think with Aristotle that that may be saidto exist which many believe. There is no opinion, however absurd,which men will not readily embrace as soon as they can be brought tothe conviction that it is generally adopted. Example affects theirthought just as it affects their action. They are like sheep followingthe bell-wether just as he leads them. They would sooner die thanthink. It is very curious that the universality of an opinion shouldhave so much weight with people, as their own experience might tellthem that its acceptance is an entirely thoughtless and merelyimitative process. But it tells them nothing of the kind, because theypossess no self-knowledge whatever. It is only the elect Who Say withPlato: [Greek: tois pollois polla dokei] which means that the publichas a good many bees in its bonnet, and that it would be a longbusiness to get at them.But to speak seriously, the universality of an opinion is no proof,nay, it is not even a probability, that the opinion is right. Thosewho maintain that it is so must assume (1) that length of timedeprives a universal opinion of its demonstrative force, as otherwiseall the old errors which were once universally held to be true wouldhave to be recalled; for instance, the Ptolemaic system would haveto be restored, or Catholicism re-established in all Protestantcountries. They must assume (2) that distance of space has the sameeffect; otherwise the respective universality of opinion among theadherents of Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam will put them in adifficulty.When we come to look into the matter, so-called universal opinion isthe opinion of two or three persons; and we should be persuaded ofthis if we could see the way in which it really arises.We should find that it is two or three persons who, in the firstinstance, accepted it, or advanced and maintained it; and of whompeople were so good as to believe that they had thoroughly tested it.Then a few other persons, persuaded beforehand that the first were menof the requisite capacity, also accepted the opinion. These, again,were trusted by many others, whose laziness suggested to them that itwas better to believe at once, than to go through the troublesome taskof testing the matter for themselves. Thus the number of these lazyand credulous adherents grew from day to day; for the opinion had nosooner obtained a fair measure of support than its further supportersattributed this to the fact that the opinion could only have obtainedit by the cogency of its arguments. The remainder were then compelledto grant what was universally granted, so as not to pass for unrulypersons who resisted opinions which every one accepted, or pertfellows who thought themselves cleverer than any one else.When opinion reaches this stage, adhesion becomes a duty; andhenceforward the few who are capable of forming a judgment hold theirpeace. Those who venture to speak are such as are entirely incapableof forming any opinions or any judgment of their own, being merely theecho of others' opinions; and, nevertheless, they defend them with allthe greater zeal and intolerance. For what they hate in people whothink differently is not so much the different opinions which theyprofess, as the presumption of wanting to form their own judgment; apresumption of which they themselves are never guilty, as they arevery well aware. In short, there are very few who can think, butevery man wants to have an opinion; and what remains but to take itready-made from others, instead of forming opinions for himself?Since this is what happens, where is the value of the opinion even ofa hundred millions? It is no more established than an historicalfact reported by a hundred chroniclers who can be proved to haveplagiarised it from one another; the opinion in the end beingtraceable to a single individual.[1] It is all what I say, what yousay, and, finally, what he says; and the whole of it is nothing but aseries of assertions:[Footnote 1: See Bayle's _Pensees sur les Cometes_, i., p. 10.]  _Dico ego, tu dicis, sed denique dixit et ille;  Dictaque post toties, nil nisi dicta vides_.Nevertheless, in a dispute with ordinary people, we may employuniversal opinion as an authority. For it will generally be found thatwhen two of them are fighting, that is the weapon which both of themchoose as a means of attack. If a man of the better sort has to dealwith them, it is most advisable for him to condescend to the useof this weapon too, and to select such authorities as will make animpression on his opponent's weak side. For, _ex hypoihesi_, he is asinsensible to all rational argument as a horny-hided Siegfried, dippedin the flood of incapacity, and unable to think or judge. Beforea tribunal the dispute is one between authorities alone,--suchauthoritative statements, I mean, as are laid down by legal experts;and here the exercise of judgment consists in discovering what law orauthority applies to the case in question. There is, however, plentyof room for Dialectic; for should the case in question and the law notreally fit each other, they can, if necessary, be twisted until theyappear to do so, or _vice versa_.XXXI.If you know that you have no reply to the arguments which youropponent advances, you may, by a fine stroke of irony, declareyourself to be an incompetent judge: "What you now say passes mypoor powers of comprehension; it may be all very true, but I can'tunderstand it, and I refrain from any expression of opinion on it." Inthis way you insinuate to the bystanders, with whom you are in goodrepute, that what your opponent says is nonsense. Thus, when Kant's_Kritik_ appeared, or, rather, when it began to make a noise in theworld, many professors of the old ecclectic school declared that theyfailed to understand it, in the belief that their failure settled thebusiness. But when the adherents of the new school proved to them thatthey were quite right, and had really failed to understand it, theywere in a very bad humour.This is a trick which may be used only when you are quite sure thatthe audience thinks much better of you that of your opponent. Aprofessor, for instance may try it on a student.Strictly, it is a case of the preceding trick: it is a particularlymalicious assertion of one's own authority, instead of giving reasons.The counter-trick is to say: "I beg your pardon; but, with yourpenetrating intellect, it must be very easy for you to understandanything; and it can only be my poor statement of the matter that isat fault"; and then go on to rub it into him until he understands it_nolens volens_, and sees for himself that it was really his own faultalone. In this way you parry his attack. With the greatest politenesshe wanted to insinuate that you were talking nonsense; and you, withequal courtesy, prove to him that he is a fool.XXXII.If you are confronted with an assertion, there is a short way ofgetting rid of it, or, at any rate, of throwing suspicion on it, byputting it into some odious category; even though the connectionis only apparent, or else of a loose character. You can say,for instance, "That is Manichasism," or "It is Arianism," or"Pelagianism," or "Idealism," or "Spinozism," or "Pantheism," or"Brownianism," or "Naturalism," or "Atheism," or "Rationalism,""Spiritualism," "Mysticism," and so on. In making an objection of thiskind, you take it for granted (1) that the assertion in question isidentical with, or is at least contained in, the category cited--thatis to say, you cry out, "Oh, I have heard that before"; and (2) thatthe system referred to has been entirely refuted, and does not containa word of truth.XXXIII."That's all very well in theory, but it won't do in practice." Inthis sophism you admit the premisses but deny the conclusion, incontradiction with a well-known rule of logic. The assertion isbased upon an impossibility: what is right in theory _must_ workin practice; and if it does not, there is a mistake in the theory;something has been overlooked and not allowed for; and, consequently,what is wrong in practice is wrong in theory too.XXXIV.When you state a question or an argument, and your opponent gives youno direct answer or reply, but evades it by a counter-question or anindirect answer, or some assertion which has no bearing on the matter,and, generally, tries to turn the subject, it is a sure sign that youhave touched a weak spot, sometimes without knowing it. You have, asit were, reduced him to silence. You must, therefore, urge the pointall the more, and not let your opponent evade it, even when you do notknow where the weakness which you have hit upon really lies.XXXV.There is another trick which, as soon as it is practicable, makes allothers unnecessary. Instead of working on your opponent's intellect byargument, work on his will by motive; and he, and also the audience ifthey have similar interests, will at once be won over to your opinion,even though you got it out of a lunatic asylum; for, as a generalrule, half an ounce of will is more effective than a hundredweight ofinsight and intelligence. This, it is true, can be done only underpeculiar circumstances. If you succeed in making your opponent feelthat his opinion, should it prove true, will be distinctly prejudicialto his interest, he will let it drop like a hot potato, and feel thatit was very imprudent to take it up.A clergyman, for instance, is defending some philosophical dogma; youmake him sensible of the fact that it is in immediate contradictionwith one of the fundamental doctrines of his Church, and he abandonsit.A landed proprietor maintains that the use of machinery inagricultural operations, as practised in England, is an excellentinstitution, since an engine does the work of many men. You give himto understand that it will not be very long before carriages are alsoworked by steam, and that the value of his large stud will be greatlydepreciated; and you will see what he will say.In such cases every man feels how thoughtless it is to sanction a lawunjust to himself--_quam temere in nosmet legem sancimus iniquam_! Noris it otherwise if the bystanders, but not your opponent, belong tothe same sect, guild, industry, club, etc., as yourself. Let histhesis be never so true, as soon as you hint that it is prejudicial tothe common interests of the said society, all the bystanders will findthat your opponent's arguments, however excellent they be, are weakand contemptible; and that yours, on the other hand, though they wererandom conjecture, are correct and to the point; you will have achorus of loud approval on your side, and your opponent will be drivenout of the field with ignominy. Nay, the bystanders will believe, as arule, that they have agreed with you out of pure conviction. For whatis not to our interest mostly seems absurd to us; our intellect beingno _siccum lumen_. This trick might be called "taking the tree by itsroot"; its usual name is the _argumentum ab utili_.XXXVI.You may also puzzle and bewilder your opponent by mere bombast; andthe trick is possible, because a man generally supposes that theremust be some meaning in words:  _Gewoehnlich glaubt der Mensch, wenn er nur Worte hoert,  Es muesse sich dabei doch auch was denken lassen_.If he is secretly conscious of his own weakness, and accustomed tohear much that he does not understand, and to make as though he did,you can easily impose upon him by some serious fooling that soundsvery deep or learned, and deprives him of hearing, sight, and thought;and by giving out that it is the most indisputable proof of what youassert. It is a well-known fact that in recent times some philosophershave practised this trick on the whole of the public with the mostbrilliant success. But since present examples are odious, we may referto _The Vicar of Wakefield_ for an old one.XXXVII.Should your opponent be in the right, but, luckily for yourcontention, choose a faulty proof, you can easily manage to refute it,and then claim that you have thus refuted his whole position. Thisis a trick which ought to be one of the first; it is, at bottom, anexpedient by which an _argumentum ad hominem_ is put forward as an_argumentum ad rem_. If no accurate proof occurs to him or to thebystanders, you have won the day. For example, if a man advances theontological argument by way of proving God's existence, you can getthe best of him, for the ontological argument may easily be refuted.This is the way in which bad advocates lose a good case, by trying tojustify it by an authority which does not fit it, when no fitting oneoccurs to them.XXXVIII.A last trick is to become personal, insulting, rude, as soon as youperceive that your opponent has the upper hand, and that you are goingto come off worst. It consists in passing from the subject of dispute,as from a lost game, to the disputant himself, and in some wayattacking his person. It may be called the _argumentum ad personam_,to distinguish it from the _argumentum ad hominem_, which passesfrom the objective discussion of the subject pure and simple to thestatements or admissions which your opponent has made in regard to it.But in becoming personal you leave the subject altogether, and turnyour attack to his person, by remarks of an offensive and spitefulcharacter. It is an appeal from the virtues of the intellect to thevirtues of the body, or to mere animalism. This is a very populartrick, because every one is able to carry it into effect; and so itis of frequent application. Now the question is, What counter-trickavails for the other party? for if he has recourse to the same rule,there will be blows, or a duel, or an action for slander.It would be a great mistake to suppose that it is sufficient not tobecome personal yourself. For by showing a man quite quietly that heis wrong, and that what he says and thinks is incorrect--a processwhich occurs in every dialectical victory--you embitter him more thanif you used some rude or insulting expression. Why is this? Because,as Hobbes observes,[1] all mental pleasure consists in being able tocompare oneself with others to one's own advantage. Nothing is ofgreater moment to a man than the gratification of his vanity, and nowound is more painful than that which is inflicted on it. Hence suchphrases as "Death before dishonour," and so on. The gratification ofvanity arises mainly by comparison of oneself with others, in everyrespect, but chiefly in respect of one's intellectual powers; and sothe most effective and the strongest gratification of it is to befound in controversy. Hence the embitterment of defeat, apart from anyquestion of injustice; and hence recourse to that last weapon,that last trick, which you cannot evade by mere politeness. A cooldemeanour may, however, help you here, if, as soon as your opponentbecomes personal, you quietly reply, "That has no bearing on the pointin dispute," and immediately bring the conversation back to it, andcontinue to show him that he is wrong, without taking any notice ofhis insults. Say, as Themistocles said to Eurybiades--_Strike, buthear me_. But such demeanour is not given to every one.[Footnote 1: _Elementa philosophica de Cive_.]As a sharpening of wits, controversy is often, indeed, of mutualadvantage, in order to correct one's thoughts and awaken new views.But in learning and in mental power both disputants must be tolerablyequal. If one of them lacks learning, he will fail to understand theother, as he is not on the same level with his antagonist. If he lacksmental power, he will be embittered, and led into dishonest tricks,and end by being rude.The only safe rule, therefore, is that which Aristotle mentions in thelast chapter of his _Topica_: not to dispute with the first person youmeet, but only with those of your acquaintance of whom you know thatthey possess sufficient intelligence and self-respect not to advanceabsurdities; to appeal to reason and not to authority, and to listento reason and yield to it; and, finally, to cherish truth, to bewilling to accept reason even from an opponent, and to be just enoughto bear being proved to be in the wrong, should truth lie with him.From this it follows that scarcely one man in a hundred is worth yourdisputing with him. You may let the remainder say what they please,for every one is at liberty to be a fool--_desipere est jus gentium_.Remember what Voltaire says: _La paix vaut encore mieux que laverite_. Remember also an Arabian proverb which tells us that _on thetree of silence there hangs its fruit, which is peace_.ON THE COMPARATIVE PLACE OF INTEREST AND BEAUTY IN WORKS OF ART.In the productions of poetic genius, especially of the epic anddramatic kind, there is, apart from Beauty, another quality which isattractive: I mean Interest.The beauty of a work of art consists in the fact that it holds up aclear mirror to certain _ideas_ inherent in the world in general; thebeauty of a work of poetic art in particular is that it renders theideas inherent in mankind, and thereby leads it to a knowledgeof these ideas. The means which poetry uses for this end arethe exhibition of significant characters and the invention ofcircumstances which will bring about significant situations, givingoccasion to the characters to unfold their peculiarities and show whatis in them; so that by some such representation a clearer and fullerknowledge of the many-sided idea of humanity may be attained. Beauty,however, in its general aspect, is the inseparable characteristicof the idea when it has become known. In other words, everything isbeautiful in which an idea is revealed; for to be beautiful means nomore than clearly to express an idea.Thus we perceive that beauty is always an affair of _knowledge_, andthat it appeals to _the knowing subject_, and not to _the will_;nay, it is a fact that the apprehension of beauty on the part of thesubject involves a complete suppression of the will.On the other hand, we call drama or descriptive poetry interestingwhen it represents events and actions of a kind which necessarilyarouse concern or sympathy, like that which we feel in real eventsinvolving our own person. The fate of the person represented in themis felt in just the same fashion as our own: we await the developmentof events with anxiety; we eagerly follow their course; our heartsquicken when the hero is threatened; our pulse falters as the dangerreaches its acme, and throbs again when he is suddenly rescued. Untilwe reach the end of the story we cannot put the book aside; we lieaway far into the night sympathising with our hero's troubles asthough they were our own. Nay, instead of finding pleasure andrecreation in such representations, we should feel all the pain whichreal life often inflicts upon us, or at least the kind which pursuesus in our uneasy dreams, if in the act of reading or looking at thestage we had not the firm ground of reality always beneath our feet.As it is, in the stress of a too violent feeling, we can find relieffrom the illusion of the moment, and then give way to it again atwill. Moreover, we can gain this relief without any such violenttransition as occurs in a dream, when we rid ourselves of its terrorsonly by the act of awaking.It is obvious that what is affected by poetry of this character is our_will_, and not merely our intellectual powers pure and simple. Theword _interest_ means, therefore, that which arouses the concern ofthe individual will, _quod nostra interest_; and here it is thatbeauty is clearly distinguished from interest. The one is an affairof the intellect, and that, too, of the purest and simplest kind. Theother works upon the will. Beauty, then, consists in an apprehensionof ideas; and knowledge of this character is beyond the range of theprinciple that nothing happens without a cause. Interest, on the otherhand, has its origin nowhere but in the course of events; that is tosay, in the complexities which are possible only through the action ofthis principle in its different forms.We have now obtained a clear conception of the essential differencebetween the beauty and the interest of a work of art. We haverecognised that beauty is the true end of every art, and therefore,also, of the poetic art. It now remains to raise the question whetherthe interest of a work of art is a second end, or a means to theexhibition of its beauty; or whether the interest of it is produced byits beauty as an essential concomitant, and comes of itself as soon asit is beautiful; or whether interest is at any rate compatible withthe main end of art; or, finally, whether it is a hindrance to it.In the first place, it is to be observed that the interest of a workof art is confined to works of poetic art. It does not exist in thecase of fine art, or of music or architecture. Nay, with these formsof art it is not even conceivable, unless, indeed, the interest be ofan entirely personal character, and confined to one or two spectators;as, for example, where a picture is a portrait of some one whom welove or hate; the building, my house or my prison; the music, mywedding dance, or the tune to which I marched to the war. Interest ofthis kind is clearly quite foreign to the essence and purpose of art;it disturbs our judgment in so far as it makes the purely artisticattitude impossible. It may be, indeed, that to a smaller extent thisis true of all interest.Now, since the interest of a work of art lies in the fact that wehave the same kind of sympathy with a poetic representation as withreality, it is obvious that the representation must deceive us for themoment; and this it can do only by its truth. But truth is an elementin perfect art. A picture, a poem, should be as true as nature itself;but at the same time it should lay stress on whatever forms theunique character of its subject by drawing out all its essentialmanifestations, and by rejecting everything that is unessential andaccidental. The picture or the poem will thus emphasize its _idea_,and give us that _ideal truth_ which is superior to nature._Truth_, then, forms the point that is common both to interest andbeauty in a work of art, as it is its truth which produces theillusion. The fact that the truth of which I speak is _ideal truth_might, indeed, be detrimental to the illusion, since it is just herethat we have the general difference between poetry and reality, artand nature. But since it is possible for reality to coincide withthe ideal, it is not actually necessary that this difference shoulddestroy the illusion. In the case of fine arts there is, in the rangeof the means which art adopts, a certain limit, and beyond it illusionis impossible. Sculpture, that is to say, gives us mere colourlessform; its figures are without eyes and without movement; and paintingprovides us with no more than a single view, enclosed within strictlimits, which separate the picture from the adjacent reality. Here,then, there is no room for illusion, and consequently none for thatinterest or sympathy which resembles the interest we have in reality;the will is at once excluded, and the object alone is presented to usin a manner that frees it from any personal concern.It is a highly remarkable fact that a spurious kind of fine artoversteps these limits, produces an illusion of reality, and arousesour interest; but at the same time it destroys the effect which fineart produces, and serves as nothing but a mere means of exhibiting thebeautiful, that is, of communicating a knowledge of the ideas which itembodies. I refer to _waxwork_. Here, we might say, is the dividingline which separates it from the province of fine art. When waxwork isproperly executed, it produces a perfect illusion; but for that veryreason we approach a wax figure as we approach a real man, who, assuch, is for the moment an object presented to our will. That isto say, he is an object of interest; he arouses the will, andconsequently stills the intellect. We come up to a wax figure with thesame reserve and caution as a real man would inspire in us: our willis excited; it waits to see whether he is going to be friendly to us,or the reverse, fly from us, or attack us; in a word, it expects someaction of him. But as the figure, nevertheless, shows no sign of life,it produces the impression which is so very disagreeable, namely, ofa corpse. This is a case where the interest is of the most completekind, and yet where there is no work of art at all. In other words,interest is not in itself a real end of art.The same truth is illustrated by the fact that even in poetry it isonly the dramatic and descriptive kind to which interest attaches; forif interest were, with beauty, the aim of art, poetry of the lyricalkind would, for that very reason, not take half so great a position asthe other two.In the second place, if interest were a means in the production ofbeauty, every interesting work would also be beautiful. That, however,is by no means the case. A drama or a novel may often attract us byits interest, and yet be so utterly deficient in any kind of beautythat we are afterwards ashamed of having wasted our time on it. Thisapplies to many a drama which gives no true picture of the real lifeof man; which contains characters very superficially drawn, or sodistorted as to be actual monstrosities, such as are not to be foundin nature; but the course of events and the play of the action are sointricate, and we feel so much for the hero in the situation in whichhe is placed, that we are not content until we see the knot untangledand the hero rescued. The action is so cleverly governed and guided inits course that we remain in a state of constant curiosity as to whatis going to happen, and we are utterly unable to form a guess; so thatbetween eagerness and surprise our interest is kept active; and as weare pleasantly entertained, we do not notice the lapse of time. Mostof Kotzebue's plays are of this character. For the mob this is theright thing: it looks for amusement, something to pass the time, notfor intellectual perception. Beauty is an affair of such perception;hence sensibility to beauty varies as much as the intellectualfaculties themselves. For the inner truth of a representation, and itscorrespondence with the real nature of humanity, the mob has no senseat all. What is flat and superficial it can grasp, but the depths ofhuman nature are opened to it in vain.It is also to be observed that dramatic representations which dependfor their value on their interest lose by repetition, because they areno longer able to arouse curiosity as to their course, since it isalready known. To see them often, makes them stale and tedious. Onthe other hand, works of which the value lies in their beauty gain byrepetition, as they are then more and more understood.Most novels are on the same footing as dramatic representations ofthis character. They are creatures of the same sort of imagination aswe see in the story-teller of Venice and Naples, who lays a hat on theground and waits until an audience is assembled. Then he spins a talewhich so captivates his hearers that, when he gets to the catastrophe,he makes a round of the crowd, hat in hand, for contributions, withoutthe least fear that his hearers will slip away. Similar story-tellersply their trade in this country, though in a less direct fashion. Theydo it through the agency of publishers and circulating libraries. Thusthey can avoid going about in rags, like their colleagues elsewhere;they can offer the children of their imagination to the public underthe title of novels, short stories, romantic poems, fairy tales, andso on; and the public, in a dressing-gown by the fireside, sits downmore at its ease, but also with a greater amount of patience, to theenjoyment of the interest which they provide.How very little aesthetic value there generally is in productions ofthis sort is well known; and yet it cannot be denied that many of themare interesting; or else how could they be so popular?We see, then, in reply to our second question, that interest does notnecessarily involve beauty; and, conversely, it is true that beautydoes not necessarily involve interest. Significant characters may berepresented, that open up the depths of human nature, and it may allbe expressed in actions and sufferings of an exceptional kind, sothat the real nature of humanity and the world may stand forth inthe picture in the clearest and most forcible lines; and yet no highdegree of interest may be excited in the course of events by thecontinued progress of the action, or by the complexity and unexpectedsolution of the plot. The immortal masterpieces of Shakespeare containlittle that excites interest; the action does not go forward in onestraight line, but falters, as in _Hamlet_, all through the play;or else it spreads out in breadth, as in _The Merchant of Venice_,whereas length is the proper dimension of interest; or the scenes hangloosely together, as in _Henry IV_. Thus it is that Shakespeare'sdramas produce no appreciable effect on the mob.The dramatic requirement stated by Aristotle, and more particularlythe unity of action, have in view the interest of the piece ratherthan its artistic beauty. It may be said, generally, that theserequirements are drawn up in accordance with the principle ofsufficient reason to which I have referred above. We know, however,that the _idea_, and, consequently, the beauty of a work of art, existonly for the perceptive intelligence which has freed itself fromthe domination of that principle. It is just here that we find thedistinction between interest and beauty; as it is obvious thatinterest is part and parcel of the mental attitude which is governedby the principle, whereas beauty is always beyond its range. The bestand most striking refutation of the Aristotelian unities is Manzoni's.It may be found in the preface to his dramas.What is true of Shakespeare's dramatic works is true also of Goethe's.Even _Egmont_ makes little effect on the public, because it containsscarcely any complication or development; and if _Egmont_ fails, whatare we to say of _Tasso_ or _Iphigenia_? That the Greek tragedians didnot look to interest as a means of working upon the public, is clearfrom the fact that the material of their masterpieces was almostalways known to every one: they selected events which had often beentreated dramatically before. This shows us how sensitive was theGreek public to the beautiful, as it did not require the interest ofunexpected events and new stories to season its enjoyment.Neither does the quality of interest often attach to masterpieces ofdescriptive poetry. Father Homer lays the world and humanity before usin its true nature, but he takes no trouble to attract our sympathyby a complexity of circumstance, or to surprise us by unexpectedentanglements. His pace is lingering; he stops at every scene; he putsone picture after another tranquilly before us, elaborating itwith care. We experience no passionate emotion in reading him; ourdemeanour is one of pure perceptive intelligence; he does not arouseour will, but sings it to rest; and it costs us no effort to break offin our reading, for we are not in condition of eager curiosity. Thisis all still more true of Dante, whose work is not, in the propersense of the word, an epic, but a descriptive poem. The same thing maybe said of the four immortal romances: _Don Quixote, Tristram Shandy,La Nouvelle Heloise_, and _Wilhelm Meister_. To arouse our interestis by no means the chief aim of these works; in _Tristram Shandy_ thehero, even at the end of the book, is only eight years of age.On the other hand, we must not venture to assert that the quality ofinterest is not to be found in masterpieces of literature. We have itin Schiller's dramas in an appreciable degree, and consequentlythey are popular; also in the _Oedipus Rex_ of Sophocles. Amongstmasterpieces of description, we find it in Ariosto's _OrlandoFurioso_; nay, an example of a high degree of interest, bound up withthe beautiful, is afforded in an excellent novel by Walter Scott--_TheHeart of Midlothian_. This is the most interesting work of fictionthat I know, where all the effects due to interest, as I have giventhem generally in the preceding remarks, may be most clearly observed.At the same time it is a very beautiful romance throughout; it showsthe most varied pictures of life, drawn with striking truth; and itexhibits highly different characters with great justice and fidelity.Interest, then, is certainly compatible with beauty. That was ourthird question. Nevertheless, a comparatively small admixture of theelement of interest may well be found to be most advantageous as faras beauty is concerned; for beauty is and remains the end of art.Beauty is in twofold opposition with interest; firstly, because itlies in the perception of the idea, and such perception takes itsobject entirely out of the range of the forms enunciated by theprinciple of sufficient reason; whereas interest has its sphere mainlyin circumstance, and it is out of this principle that the complexityof circumstance arises. Secondly, interest works by exciting the will;whereas beauty exists only for the pure perceptive intelligence, whichhas no will. However, with dramatic and descriptive literature anadmixture of interest is necessary, just as a volatile and gaseoussubstance requires a material basis if it is to be preserved andtransferred. The admixture is necessary, partly, indeed, becauseinterest is itself created by the events which have to be devised inorder to set the characters in motion; partly because our minds wouldbe weary of watching scene after scene if they had no concern for us,or of passing from one significant picture to another if we were notdrawn on by some secret thread. It is this that we call interest;it is the sympathy which the event in itself forces us to feel, andwhich, by riveting our attention, makes the mind obedient to the poet,and able to follow him into all the parts of his story.If the interest of a work of art is sufficient to achieve this result,it does all that can be required of it; for its only service is toconnect the pictures by which the poet desires to communicate aknowledge of the idea, as if they were pearls, and interest were thethread that holds them together, and makes an ornament out of thewhole. But interest is prejudicial to beauty as soon as it overstepsthis limit; and this is the case if we are so led away by the interestof a work that whenever we come to any detailed description in anovel, or any lengthy reflection on the part of a character in adrama, we grow impatient and want to put spurs to our author, so thatwe may follow the development of events with greater speed. Epic anddramatic writings, where beauty and interest are both present in ahigh degree, may be compared to the working of a watch, where interestis the spring which keeps all the wheels in motion. If it workedunhindered, the watch would run down in a few minutes. Beauty, holdingus in the spell of description and reflection, is like the barrelwhich checks its movement.Or we may say that interest is the body of a poetic work, and beautythe soul. In the epic and the drama, interest, as a necessary qualityof the action, is the matter; and beauty, the form that requires thematter in order to be visible.PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.In the moment when a great affliction overtakes us, we are hurt tofind that the world about us is unconcerned and goes its own way. AsGoethe says in _Tasso_, how easily it leaves us helpless and alone,and continues its course like the sun and the moon and the other gods:      _... die Welt, wie sie so leicht,  Uns huelflos, einsam laesst, und ihren Weg,  Wie Sonn' und Mond und andre Goetter geht_.Nay more! it is something intolerable that even we ourselves haveto go on with the mechanical round of our daily business, and thatthousands of our own actions are and must be unaffected by the painthat throbs within us. And so, to restore the harmony between ouroutward doings and our inward feelings, we storm and shout, and tearour hair, and stamp with pain or rage.Our temperament is so _despotic_ that we are not satisfied unlesswe draw everything into our own life, and force all the world tosympathise with us. The only way of achieving this would be to win thelove of others, so that the afflictions which oppress our own heartsmight oppress theirs as well. Since that is attended with somedifficulty, we often choose the shorter way, and blab out our burdenof woe to people who do not care, and listen with curiosity, butwithout sympathy, and much oftener with satisfaction.Speech and the communication of thought, which, in their mutualrelations, are always attended by a slight impulse on the part of thewill, are almost a physical necessity. Sometimes, however, the loweranimals entertain me much more than the average man. For, in the firstplace, what can such a man say? It is only conceptions, that is, thedriest of ideas, that can be communicated by means of words; and whatsort of conceptions has the average man to communicate, if he doesnot merely tell a story or give a report, neither of which makesconversation? The greatest charm of conversation is the mimetic partof it,--the character that is manifested, be it never so little. Takethe best of men; how little he can _say_ of what goes on withinhim, since it is only conceptions that are communicable; and yet aconversation with a clever man is one of the greatest of pleasures.It is not only that ordinary men have little to say, but whatintellect they have puts them in the way of concealing and distortingit; and it is the necessity of practising this concealment that givesthem such a pitiable character; so that what they exhibit is not eventhe little that they have, but a mask and disguise. The lower animals,which have no reason, can conceal nothing; they are altogether_naive_, and therefore very entertaining, if we have only an eye forthe kind of communications which they make. They speak not with words,but with shape and structure, and manner of life, and the things theyset about; they express themselves, to an intelligent observer, in avery pleasing and entertaining fashion. It is a varied life that ispresented to him, and one that in its manifestation is very differentfrom his own; and yet essentially it is the same. He sees it in itssimple form, when reflection is excluded; for with the lower animalslife is lived wholly in and for the present moment: it is the presentthat the animal grasps; it has no care, or at least no conscious care,for the morrow, and no fear of death; and so it is wholly taken upwith life and living.       *       *       *       *       *The conversation among ordinary people, when it does not relate to anyspecial matter of fact, but takes a more general character, mostlyconsists in hackneyed commonplaces, which they alternately repeat toeach other with the utmost complacency.[1][Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--This observation is inSchopenhauer's own English.]       *       *       *       *       *Some men can despise any blessing as soon as they cease to possessit; others only when they have obtained it. The latter are the moreunhappy, and the nobler, of the two.       *       *       *       *       *When the aching heart grieves no more over any particular object,but is oppressed by life as a whole, it withdraws, as it were, intoitself. There is here a retreat and gradual extinction of the will,whereby the body, which is the manifestation of the will, is slowlybut surely undermined; and the individual experiences a steadydissolution of his bonds,--a quiet presentiment of death. Hence theheart which aches has a secret joy of its own; and it is this, Ifancy, which the English call "the joy of grief."The pain that extends to life as a whole, and loosens our hold onit, is the only pain that is really _tragic_. That which attaches toparticular objects is a will that is broken, but not resigned; itexhibits the struggle and inner contradiction of the will and of lifeitself; and it is comic, be it never so violent. It is like the painof the miser at the loss of his hoard. Even though pain of the tragickind proceeds from a single definite object, it does not remain there;it takes the separate affliction only as a _symbol_ of life as awhole, and transfers it thither.       *       *       *       *       *_Vexation_ is the attitude of the individual as intelligence towardsthe check imposed upon a strong manifestation of the individual aswill. There are two ways of avoiding it: either by repressing theviolence of the will--in other words, by virtue; or by keepingthe intelligence from dwelling upon the check--in other words, byStoicism.       *       *       *       *       *To win the favour of a very beautiful woman by one's personality aloneis perhaps a greater satisfaction to one's vanity than to anythingelse; for it is an assurance that one's personality is an equivalentfor the person that is treasured and desired and defied above allothers. Hence it is that despised love is so great a pang, especiallywhen it is associated with well-founded jealousy.With this joy and this pain, it is probable that vanity is morelargely concerned than the senses, because it is only the thingsof the mind, and not mere sensuality, that produce such violentconvulsions. The lower animals are familiar with lust, but not withthe passionate pleasures and pains of love.       *       *       *       *       *To be suddenly placed in a strange town or country where the manner oflife, possibly even the language, is very different from our own, is,at the first moment, like stepping into cold water. We are broughtinto sudden contact with a new temperature, and we feel a powerful andsuperior influence from without which affects us uncomfortably. Wefind ourselves in a strange element, where we cannot move with ease;and, over and above that, we have the feeling that while everythingstrikes us as strange, we ourselves strike others in the same way.But as soon as we are a little composed and reconciled to oursurroundings, as soon as we have appropriated some of its temperature,we feel an extraordinary sense of satisfaction, as in bathing in coolwater; we assimilate ourselves to the new element, and cease to haveany necessary pre-occupation with our person. We devote our attentionundisturbed to our environment, to which we now feel ourselvessuperior by being able to view it in an objective and disinterestedfashion, instead of being oppressed by it, as before.       *       *       *       *       *When we are on a journey, and all kinds of remarkable objects pressthemselves on our attention, the intellectual food which we receive isoften so large in amount that we have no time for digestion; and weregret that the impressions which succeed one another so quickly leaveno permanent trace. But at bottom it is the same with travelling aswith reading. How often do we complain that we cannot remember onethousandth part of what we read! In both cases, however, we mayconsole ourselves with the reflection that the things we see and readmake an impression on the mind before they are forgotten, and socontribute to its formation and nurture; while that which we onlyremember does no more than stuff it and puff it out, filling up itshollows with matter that will always be strange to it, and leaving itin itself a blank.       *       *       *       *       *It is the very many and varied forms in which human life is presentedto us on our travels that make them entertaining. But we never seemore than its outside, such as is everywhere open to public view andaccessible to strangers. On the other hand, human life on itsinside, the heart and centre, where it lives and moves and shows itscharacter, and in particular that part of the inner side which couldbe seen at home amongst our relatives, is not seen; we have exchangedit for the outer side. This is why on our travels we see the worldlike a painted landscape, with a very wide horizon, but no foreground;and why, in time, we get tired of it.       *       *       *       *       *One man is more concerned with the impression which he makes uponthe rest of mankind; another, with the impression which the rest ofmankind makes upon him. The disposition of the one is subjective; ofthe other, objective; the one is, in the whole of his existence, morein the nature of an idea which is merely presented; the other, more ofthe being who presents it.       *       *       *       *       *A woman (with certain exceptions which need not be mentioned) will nottake the first step with a man; for in spite of all the beauty she mayhave, she risks a refusal. A man may be ill in mind or body, or busy,or gloomy, and so not care for advances; and a refusal would be a blowto her vanity. But as soon as he takes the first step, and helps herover this danger, he stands on a footing of equality with her, andwill generally find her quite tractable.       *       *       *       *       *The praise with which many men speak of their wives is really givento their own judgment in selecting them. This arises, perhaps, from afeeling of the truth of the saying, that a man shows what he is by theway in which he dies, and by the choice of his wife.       *       *       *       *       *If education or warning were of any avail, how could Seneca's pupil bea Nero?       *       *       *       *       *The Pythagorean[1] principle that _like is known only by like_ isin many respects a true one. It explains how it is that every manunderstands his fellow only in so far as he resembles him, or, atleast, is of a similar character. What one man is quite sure ofperceiving in another is that which is common to all, namely, thevulgar, petty or mean elements of our nature; here every man has aperfect understanding of his fellows; but the advantage which one manhas over another does not exist for the other, who, be the talents inquestion as extraordinary as they may, will never see anything beyondwhat he possesses himself, for the very good reason that this is allhe wants to see. If there is anything on which he is in doubt, it willgive him a vague sense of fear, mixed with pique; because it passeshis comprehension, and therefore is uncongenial to him.[Footnote 1: See Porphyry, _de Vita Pythagorae_.]This is why it is mind alone that understands mind; why works ofgenius are wholly understood and valued only by a man of genius, andwhy it must necessarily be a long time before they indirectly attractattention at the hands of the crowd, for whom they will never, in anytrue sense, exist. This, too, is why one man will look another in theface, with the impudent assurance that he will never see anything buta miserable resemblance of himself; and this is just what he will see,as he cannot grasp anything beyond it. Hence the bold way in which oneman will contradict another. Finally, it is for the same reason thatgreat superiority of mind isolates a man, and that those of high giftskeep themselves aloof from the vulgar (and that means every one); forif they mingle with the crowd, they can communicate only such parts ofthem as they share with the crowd, and so make themselves _common_.Nay, even though they possess some well-founded and authoritativereputation amongst the crowd, they are not long in losing it, togetherwith any personal weight it may give them, since all are blind to thequalities on which it is based, but have their eyes open to anythingthat is vulgar and common to themselves. They soon discover the truthof the Arabian proverb: _Joke with a slave, and he'll show you hisheels_.It also follows that a man of high gifts, in his intercourse withothers, must always reflect that the best part of him is out of sightin the clouds; so that if he desires to know accurately how much hecan be to any one else, he has only to consider how much the man inquestion is to him. This, as a rule, is precious little; and thereforehe is as uncongenial to the other, as the other to him.       *       *       *       *       *Goethe says somewhere that man is not without a vein of veneration. Tosatisfy this impulse to venerate, even in those who have no sensefor what is really worthy, substitutes are provided in the shape ofprinces and princely families, nobles, titles, orders, and money-bags.       *       *       *       *       *Vague longing and boredom are close akin.       *       *       *       *       *When a man is dead, we envy him no more; and we only half envy himwhen he is old.       *       *       *       *       *Misanthropy and love of solitude are convertible ideas.       *       *       *       *       *In chess, the object of the game, namely, to checkmate one's opponent,is of arbitrary adoption; of the possible means of attaining it, thereis a great number; and according as we make a prudent use of them, wearrive at our goal. We enter on the game of our own choice.Nor is it otherwise with human life, only that here the entrance isnot of our choosing, but is forced on us; and the object, which is tolive and exist, seems, indeed, at times as though it were of arbitraryadoption, and that we could, if necessary, relinquish it. Neverthelessit is, in the strict sense of the word, a natural object; that is tosay, we cannot relinquish it without giving up existence itself. If weregard our existence as the work of some arbitrary power outside us,we must, indeed, admire the cunning by which that creative mind hassucceeded in making us place so much value on an object which is onlymomentary and must of necessity be laid aside very soon, and which wesee, moreover, on reflection, to be altogether vanity--in making, Isay, this object so dear to us that we eagerly exert all our strengthin working at it; although we knew that as soon as the game is over,the object will exist for us no longer, and that, on the whole, wecannot say what it is that makes it so attractive. Nay, it seems to bean object as arbitrarily adopted as that of checkmating our opponent'sking; and, nevertheless, we are always intent on the means ofattaining it, and think and brood over nothing else. It is clear thatthe reason of it is that our intellect is only capable of lookingoutside, and has no power at all of looking within; and, since this isso, we have come to the conclusion that we must make the best of it.ON THE WISDOM OF LIFE: APHORISMS.The simple Philistine believes that life is something infinite andunconditioned, and tries to look upon it and live it as though it leftnothing to be desired. By method and principle the learned Philistinedoes the same: he believes that his methods and his principles areunconditionally perfect and objectively valid; so that as soon as hehas found them, he has nothing to do but apply them to circumstances,and then approve or condemn. But happiness and truth are not to beseized in this fashion. It is phantoms of them alone that are sent tous here, to stir us to action; the average man pursues the shadow ofhappiness with unwearied labour; and the thinker, the shadow of truth;and both, though phantoms are all they have, possess in them as muchas they can grasp. Life is a language in which certain truths areconveyed to us; could we learn them in some other way, we should notlive. Thus it is that wise sayings and prudential maxims will nevermake up for the lack of experience, or be a substitute for lifeitself. Still they are not to be despised; for they, too, are a partof life; nay, they should be highly esteemed and regarded as theloose pages which others have copied from the book of truth as it isimparted by the spirit of the world. But they are pages which mustneeds be imperfect, and can never replace the real living voice. Stillless can this be so when we reflect that life, or the book of truth,speaks differently to us all; like the apostles who preached atPentecost, and instructed the multitude, appearing to each man tospeak in his own tongue.       *       *       *       *       *Recognise the truth in yourself, recognise yourself in the truth; andin the same moment you will find, to your astonishment, that the homewhich you have long been looking for in vain, which has filled yourmost ardent dreams, is there in its entirety, with every detail of ittrue, in the very place where you stand. It is there that your heaventouches your earth.       *       *       *       *       *What makes us almost inevitably ridiculous is our serious way oftreating the passing moment, as though it necessarily had all theimportance which it seems to have. It is only a few great minds thatare above this weakness, and, instead of being laughed at, have cometo laugh themselves.       *       *       *       *       *The bright and good moments of our life ought to teach us how to actaright when we are melancholy and dull and stupid, by preserving thememory of their results; and the melancholy, dull, and stupid momentsshould teach us to be modest when we are bright. For we generallyvalue ourselves according to our best and brightest moments; and thosein which we are weak and dull and miserable, we regard as no properpart of us. To remember them will teach us to be modest, humble, andtolerant.Mark my words once for all, my dear friend, and be clever. Men areentirely self-centred, and incapable of looking at things objectively.If you had a dog and wanted to make him fond of you, and fancied thatof your hundred rare and excellent characteristics the mongrel wouldbe sure to perceive one, and that that would be sufficient to make himdevoted to you body and soul--if, I say, you fancied that, you wouldbe a fool. Pat him, give him something to eat; and for the rest, bewhat you please: he will not in the least care, but will be yourfaithful and devoted dog. Now, believe me, it is just the same withmen--exactly the same. As Goethe says, man or dog, it is a miserablewretch:  _Denn ein erbaermlicher Schuft, so wie der Mensch, ist der hund_.If you ask why these contemptible fellows are so lucky, it is justbecause, in themselves and for themselves and to themselves, they arenothing at all. The value which they possess is merely comparative;they exist only for others; they are never more than means; they arenever an end and object in themselves; they are mere bait, set tocatch others.[1] I do not admit that this rule is susceptible of anyexception, that is to say, complete exceptions. There are, it is true,men--though they are sufficiently rare--who enjoy some subjectivemoments; nay, there are perhaps some who for every hundred subjectivemoments enjoy a few that are objective; but a higher state ofperfection scarcely ever occurs. But do not take yourself for anexception: examine your love, your friendship, and consider if yourobjective judgments are not mostly subjective judgments in disguise;consider if you duly recognise the good qualities of a man who is notfond of you. Then be tolerant: confound it! it's your duty. As you areall so self-centred, recognise your own weakness. You know that youcannot like a man who does not show himself friendly to you; you knowthat he cannot do so for any length of time unless he likes you, andthat he cannot like you unless you show that you are friendly to him;then do it: your false friendliness will gradually become a true one.Your own weakness and subjectivity must have some illusion.[Footnote 1: All this is very euphemistically expressed in theSophoclean verse:(Greek: _charis charin gar estin ha tiktous aei_)]This is really an _a priori_ justification of politeness; but I couldgive a still deeper reason for it.       *       *       *       *       *Consider that chance, which, with error, its brother, and folly, itsaunt, and malice, its grandmother, rules in this world; which everyyear and every day, by blows great and small, embitters the life ofevery son of earth, and yours too; consider, I say, that it is to thiswicked power that you owe your prosperity and independence; for itgave you what it refused to many thousands, just to be able to give itto individuals like you. Remembering all this, you will not behave asthough you had a right to the possession of its gifts; but you willperceive what a capricious mistress it is that gives you her favours;and therefore when she takes it into her head to deprive you of someor all of them, you will not make a great fuss about her injustice;but you will recognise that what chance gave, chance has takenaway; if needs be, you will observe that this power is not quite sofavourable to you as she seemed to be hitherto. Why, she might havedisposed not only of what she gave you, but also of your honest andhard-earned gains.But if chance still remains so favourable to you as to give you morethan almost all others whose path in life you may care to examine, oh!be happy; do not struggle for the possession of her presents; employthem properly; look upon them as property held from a capricious lord;use them wisely and well.       *       *       *       *       *The Aristotelian principle of keeping the mean in all things is illsuited to the moral law for which it was intended; but it may easilybe the best general rule of worldly wisdom, the best precept for ahappy life. For life is so full of uncertainty; there are on all sidesso many discomforts, burdens, sufferings, dangers, that a safe andhappy voyage can be accomplished only by steering carefully throughthe rocks. As a rule, the fear of the ills we know drive us into thecontrary ills; the pain of solitude, for example, drives us intosociety, and the first society that comes; the discomforts of societydrive us into solitude; we exchange a forbidding demeanour forincautious confidence and so on. It is ever the mark of folly to avoidone vice by rushing into its contrary:  _Stulti dum vitant vitia in contraria currunt_.Or else we think that we shall find satisfaction in something, andspend all our efforts on it; and thereby we omit to provide for thesatisfaction of a hundred other wishes which make themselves felt attheir own time. One loss and omission follows another, and there is noend to the misery.[Greek: Maeden agan] and _nil admirari_ are, therefore, excellentrules of worldly wisdom.       *       *       *       *       *We often find that people of great experience are the most frank andcordial in their intercourse with complete strangers, in whomthey have no interest whatever. The reason of this is that men ofexperience know that it is almost impossible for people who stand inany sort of mutual relation to be sincere and open with one another;but that there is always more or less of a strain between them, dueto the fact that they are looking after their own interests, whetherimmediate or remote. They regret the fact, but they know that itis so; hence they leave their own people, rush into the arms of acomplete stranger, and in happy confidence open their hearts to him.Thus it is that monks and the like, who have given up the world andare strangers to it, are such good people to turn to for advice.       *       *       *       *       *It is only by practising mutual restraint and self-denial that we canact and talk with other people; and, therefore, if we have to converseat all, it can only be with a feeling of resignation. For if we seeksociety, it is because we want fresh impressions: these come fromwithout, and are therefore foreign to ourselves. If a man fails toperceive this, and, when he seeks the society of others, is unwillingto practise resignation, and absolutely refuses to deny himself, nay,demands that others, who are altogether different from himself,shall nevertheless be just what he wants them to be for the moment,according to the degree of education which he has reached, oraccording to his intellectual powers or his mood--the man, I say, whodoes this, is in contradiction with himself. For while he wants someone who shall be different from himself, and wants him just becausehe is different, for the sake of society and fresh influence, henevertheless demands that this other individual shall preciselyresemble the imaginary creature who accords with his mood, and have nothoughts but those which he has himself.Women are very liable to subjectivity of this kind; but men are notfree from it either.I observed once to Goethe, in complaining of the illusion and vanityof life, that when a friend is with us we do not think the same of himas when he is away. He replied: "Yes! because the absent friend isyourself, and he exists only in your head; whereas the friend who ispresent has an individuality of his own, and moves according to lawsof his own, which cannot always be in accordance with those which youform for yourself."       *       *       *       *       *A good supply of resignation is of the first importance in providingfor the journey of life. It is a supply which we shall have to extractfrom disappointed hopes; and the sooner we do it, the better for therest of the journey.       *       *       *       *       *How should a man be content so long as he fails to obtain completeunity in his inmost being? For as long as two voices alternately speakin him, what is right for one must be wrong for the other. Thus he isalways complaining. But has any man ever been completely at one withhimself? Nay, is not the very thought a contradiction?That a man shall attain this inner unity is the impossible andinconsistent pretension put forward by almost all philosophers.[1] Foras a man it is natural to him to be at war with himself as long ashe lives. While he can be only one thing thoroughly, he has thedisposition to be everything else, and the inalienable possibilityof being it. If he has made his choice of one thing, all the otherpossibilities are always open to him, and are constantly claiming tobe realised; and he has therefore to be continuously keeping themback, and to be overpowering and killing them as long as he wants tobe that one thing. For example, if he wants to think only, and notact and do business, the disposition to the latter is not therebydestroyed all at once; but as long as the thinker lives, he has everyhour to keep on killing the acting and pushing man that is within him;always battling with himself, as though he were a monster whose headis no sooner struck off than it grows again. In the same way, if he isresolved to be a saint, he must kill himself so far as he is a beingthat enjoys and is given over to pleasure; for such he remains as longas he lives. It is not once for all that he must kill himself: hemust keep on doing it all his life. If he has resolved upon pleasure,whatever be the way in which it is to be obtained, his lifelongstruggle is with a being that desires to be pure and free and holy;for the disposition remains, and he has to kill it every hour. And soon in everything, with infinite modifications; it is now one side ofhim, and now the other, that conquers; he himself is the battlefield.If one side of him is continually conquering, the other is continuallystruggling; for its life is bound up with his own, and, as a man, heis the possibility of many contradictions.[Footnote 1: _Audacter licet profitearis, summum bonum esse animiconcordian_.--Seneca.]How is inner unity even possible under such circumstances? It existsneither in the saint nor in the sinner; or rather, the truth is thatno man is wholly one or the other. For it is _men_ they have to be;that is, luckless beings, fighters and gladiators in the arena oflife.To be sure, the best thing he can do is to recognise which part of himsmarts the most under defeat, and let it always gain the victory. Thishe will always be able to do by the use of his reason, which is anever-present fund of ideas. Let him resolve of his own free will toundergo the pain which the defeat of the other part involves. Thisis _character_. For the battle of life cannot be waged free from allpain; it cannot come to an end without bloodshed; and in any casea man must suffer pain, for he is the conquered as well as theconqueror. _Haec est vivendi conditio_.       *       *       *       *       *The clever man, when he converses, will think less of what he issaying that of the person with whom he is speaking; for then he issure to say nothing which he will afterwards regret; he is sure not tolay himself open, nor to commit an indiscretion. But his conversationwill never be particularly interesting.An intellectual man readily does the opposite, and with him the personwith whom he converses is often no more than the mere occasion of amonologue; and it often happens that the other then makes up for hissubordinate _role_ by lying in wait for the man of intellect, anddrawing his secrets out of him.       *       *       *       *       *Nothing betrays less knowledge of humanity than to suppose that, ifa man has a great many friends, it is a proof of merit and intrinsicvalue: as though men gave their friendship according to value andmerit! as though they were not, rather, just like dogs, which love theperson that pats them and gives them bits of meat, and never troublethemselves about anything else! The man who understands how to pat hisfellows best, though they be the nastiest brutes,--that's the man whohas many friends.It is the converse that is true. Men of great intellectual worth, or,still more, men of genius, can have only very few friends; for theirclear eye soon discovers all defects, and their sense of rectitude isalways being outraged afresh by the extent and the horror of them. Itis only extreme necessity that can compel such men not to betray theirfeelings, or even to stroke the defects as if they were beautifuladditions. Personal love (for we are not speaking of the reverencewhich is gained by authority) cannot be won by a man of genius, unlessthe gods have endowed him with an indestructible cheerfulness oftemper, a glance that makes the world look beautiful, or unless he hassucceeded by degrees in taking men exactly as they are; that is tosay, in making a fool of the fools, as is right and proper. On theheights we must expect to be solitary.       *       *       *       *       *Our constant discontent is for the most part rooted in the impulse ofself-preservation. This passes into a kind of selfishness, and makes aduty out of the maxim that we should always fix our minds upon what welack, so that we may endeavour to procure it. Thus it is that we arealways intent on finding out what we want, and on thinking of it;but that maxim allows us to overlook undisturbed the things which wealready possess; and so, as soon as we have obtained anything, we giveit much less attention than before. We seldom think of what we have,but always of what we lack.This maxim of egoism, which has, indeed, its advantages in procuringthe means to the end in view, itself concurrently destroys theultimate end, namely, contentment; like the bear in the fable thatthrows a stone at the hermit to kill the fly on his nose. We ought towait until need and privation announce themselves, instead oflooking for them. Minds that are naturally content do this, whilehypochondrists do the reverse.       *       *       *       *       *A man's nature is in harmony with itself when he desires to be nothingbut what he is; that is to say, when he has attained by experience aknowledge of his strength and of his weakness, and makes use of theone and conceals the other, instead of playing with false coin, andtrying to show a strength which he does not possess. It is a harmonywhich produces an agreeable and rational character; and for the simplereason that everything which makes the man and gives him his mentaland physical qualities is nothing but the manifestation of his will;is, in fact, what he _wills_. Therefore it is the greatest of allinconsistencies to wish to be other than we are.       *       *       *       *       *People of a strange and curious temperament can be happy only understrange circumstances, such as suit their nature, in the same way asordinary circumstances suit the ordinary man; and such circumstancescan arise only if, in some extraordinary way, they happen to meet withstrange people of a character different indeed, but still exactlysuited to their own. That is why men of rare or strange qualities areseldom happy.       *       *       *       *       *All this pleasure is derived from the use and consciousness of power;and the greatest of pains that a man can feel is to perceive thathis powers fail just when he wants to use them. Therefore it will beadvantageous for every man to discover what powers he possesses, andwhat powers he lacks. Let him, then, develop the powers in which he ispre-eminent, and make a strong use of them; let him pursue the pathwhere they will avail him; and even though he has to conquer hisinclinations, let him avoid the path where such powers are requisiteas he possesses only in a low degree. In this way he will often have apleasant consciousness of strength, and seldom a painful consciousnessof weakness; and it will go well with him. But if he lets himself bedrawn into efforts demanding a kind of strength quite different fromthat in which he is pre-eminent, he will experience humiliation; andthis is perhaps the most painful feeling with which a man can beafflicted.Yet there are two sides to everything. The man who has insufficientself-confidence in a sphere where he has little power, and is neverready to make a venture, will on the one hand not even learn how touse the little power that he has; and on the other, in a sphere inwhich he would at least be able to achieve something, there will bea complete absence of effort, and consequently of pleasure. This isalways hard to bear; for a man can never draw a complete blank in anydepartment of human welfare without feeling some pain.       *       *       *       *       *As a child, one has no conception of the inexorable character of thelaws of nature, and of the stubborn way in which everything persistsin remaining what it is. The child believes that even lifeless thingsare disposed to yield to it; perhaps because it feels itself one withnature, or, from mere unacquaintance with the world, believes thatnature is disposed to be friendly. Thus it was that when I was achild, and had thrown my shoe into a large vessel full of milk, I wasdiscovered entreating the shoe to jump out. Nor is a child on itsguard against animals until it learns that they are ill-natured andspiteful. But not before we have gained mature experience do werecognise that human character is unalterable; that no entreaty, orrepresentation, or example, or benefit, will bring a man to give uphis ways; but that, on the contrary, every man is compelled to followhis own mode of acting and thinking, with the necessity of a law ofnature; and that, however we take him, he always remains the same. Itis only after we have obtained a clear and profound knowledge of thisfact that we give up trying to persuade people, or to alter themand bring them round to our way of thinking. We try to accommodateourselves to theirs instead, so far as they are indispensable to us,and to keep away from them so far as we cannot possibly agree.Ultimately we come to perceive that even in matters of mereintellect--although its laws are the same for all, and the subjectas opposed to the object of thought does not really enter intoindividuality--there is, nevertheless, no certainty that the wholetruth of any matter can be communicated to any one, or that any onecan be persuaded or compelled to assent to it; because, as Bacon says,_intellectus humanus luminis sicci non est_: the light of the humanintellect is coloured by interest and passion.       *       *       *       *       *It is just because _all happiness is of a negative character_ that,when we succeed in being perfectly at our ease, we are not properlyconscious of it. Everything seems to pass us softly and gently, andhardly to touch us until the moment is over; and then it is thepositive feeling of something lacking that tells us of the happinesswhich has vanished; it is then that we observe that we have failed tohold it fast, and we suffer the pangs of self-reproach as well as ofprivation.       *       *       *       *       *Every happiness that a man enjoys, and almost every friendship thathe cherishes, rest upon illusion; for, as a rule, with increase ofknowledge they are bound to vanish. Nevertheless, here as elsewhere, aman should courageously pursue truth, and never weary of striving tosettle accounts with himself and the world. No matter what happens tothe right or to the left of him,--be it a chimaera or fancy that makeshim happy, let him take heart and go on, with no fear of the desertwhich widens to his view. Of one thing only must he be quite certain:that under no circumstances will he discover any lack of worth inhimself when the veil is raised; the sight of it would be the Gorgonthat would kill him. Therefore, if he wants to remain undeceived, lethim in his inmost being feel his own worth. For to feel the lack ofit is not merely the greatest, but also the only true affliction;all other sufferings of the mind may not only be healed, but may beimmediately relieved, by the secure consciousness of worth. The manwho is assured of it can sit down quietly under sufferings that wouldotherwise bring him to despair; and though he has no pleasures, nojoys and no friends, he can rest in and on himself; so powerful is thecomfort to be derived from a vivid consciousness of this advantage; acomfort to be preferred to every other earthly blessing. Contrarily,nothing in the world can relieve a man who knows his ownworthlessness; all that he can do is to conceal it by deceiving peopleor deafening them with his noise; but neither expedient will serve himvery long.       *       *       *       *       *We must always try to preserve large views. If we are arrested bydetails we shall get confused, and see things awry. The success or thefailure of the moment, and the impression that they make, should countfor nothing.[1][Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--Schopenhauer, for some reason thatis not apparent, wrote this remark in French.]       *       *       *       *       *How difficult it is to learn to understand oneself, and clearly torecognise what it is that one wants before anything else; what it is,therefore, that is most immediately necessary to our happiness; thenwhat comes next; and what takes the third and the fourth place, and soon.Yet, without this knowledge, our life is planless, like a captainwithout a compass.       *       *       *       *       *The sublime melancholy which leads us to cherish a lively convictionof the worthlessness of everything of all pleasures and of allmankind, and therefore to long for nothing, but to feel that life ismerely a burden which must be borne to an end that cannot be verydistant, is a much happier state of mind than any condition of desire,which, be it never so cheerful, would have us place a value on theillusions of the world, and strive to attain them.This is a fact which we learn from experience; and it is clear, _apriori_, that one of these is a condition of illusion, and the otherof knowledge.Whether it is better to marry or not to marry is a question which invery many cases amounts to this: Are the cares of love more endurablethan the anxieties of a livelihood?       *       *       *       *       *Marriage is a trap which nature sets for us. [1][Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--Also in French.]       *       *       *       *       *Poets and philosophers who are married men incur by that very fact thesuspicion that they are looking to their own welfare, and not to theinterests of science and art.       *       *       *       *       *Habit is everything. Hence to be calm and unruffled is merely toanticipate a habit; and it is a great advantage not to need to formit.       *       *       *       *       *"Personality is the element of the greatest happiness." Since _pain_and _boredom_ are the two chief enemies of human happiness, nature hasprovided our personality with a protection against both. We canward off pain, which is more often of the mind than of the body, by_cheerfulness_; and boredom by _intelligence_. But neither of theseis akin to the other; nay, in any high degree they are perhapsincompatible. As Aristotle remarks, genius is allied to melancholy;and people of very cheerful disposition are only intelligent on thesurface. The better, therefore, anyone is by nature armed against oneof these evils, the worse, as a rule, is he armed against the other.There is no human life that is free from pain and boredom; and it is aspecial favour on the part of fate if a man is chiefly exposed to theevil against which nature has armed him the better; if fate, that is,sends a great deal of pain where there is a very cheerful temper inwhich to bear it, and much leisure where there is much intelligence,but not _vice versa_. For if a man is intelligent, he feels paindoubly or trebly; and a cheerful but unintellectual temper findssolitude and unoccupied leisure altogether unendurable.       *       *       *       *       *In the sphere of thought, absurdity and perversity remain the mastersof this world, and their dominion is suspended only for brief periods.Nor is it otherwise in art; for there genuine work, seldom foundand still more seldom appreciated, is again and again driven out bydullness, insipidity, and affectation.It is just the same in the sphere of action. Most men, says Bias, arebad. Virtue is a stranger in this world; and boundless egoism, cunningand malice, are always the order of the day. It is wrong to deceivethe young on this point, for it will only make them feel later on thattheir teachers were the first to deceive them. If the object isto render the pupil a better man by telling him that others areexcellent, it fails; and it would be more to the purpose to say: Mostmen are bad, it is for you to be better. In this way he would, atleast, be sent out into the world armed with a shrewd foresight,instead of having to be convinced by bitter experience that histeachers were wrong.All ignorance is dangerous, and most errors must be dearly paid. Andgood luck must he have that carries unchastised an error in his headunto his death.[1][Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--This, again, is Schopenhauer's ownEnglish.]       *       *       *       *       *Every piece of success has a doubly beneficial effect upon us when,apart from the special and material advantage which it brings it isaccompanied by the enlivening assurance that the world, fate, or thedaemon within, does not mean so badly with us, nor is so opposed toour prosperity as we had fancied; when, in fine, it restores ourcourage to live.Similarly, every misfortune or defeat has, in the contrary sense, aneffect that is doubly depressing.       *       *       *       *       *If we were not all of us exaggeratedly interested in ourselves, lifewould be so uninteresting that no one could endure it.       *       *       *       *       *Everywhere in the world, and under all circumstances, it is only byforce that anything can be done; but power is mostly in bad hands,because baseness is everywhere in a fearful majority.       *       *       *       *       *Why should it be folly to be always intent on getting the greatestpossible enjoyment out of the moment, which is our only surepossession? Our whole life is no more than a magnified present, and initself as fleeting.       *       *       *       *       *As a consequence of his individuality and the position in which heis placed, everyone without exception lives in a certain state oflimitation, both as regards his ideas and the opinions which he forms.Another man is also limited, though not in the same way; but shouldhe succeed in comprehending the other's limitation he can confuseand abash him, and put him to shame, by making him feel what hislimitation is, even though the other be far and away his superior.Shrewd people often employ this circumstance to obtain a false andmomentary advantage.       *       *       *       *       *The only genuine superiority is that of the mind and character; allother kinds are fictitious, affected, false; and it is good tomake them feel that it is so when they try to show off before thesuperiority that is true.[1][Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--In the original this also is inFrench.]       *       *       *       *       *                _All the world's a stage,  And all the men and women merely players_.Exactly! Independently of what a man really is in himself, he hasa part to play, which fate has imposed upon him from without, bydetermining his rank, education, and circumstances. The most immediateapplication of this truth appears to me to be that in life, as onthe stage, we must distinguish between the actor and his part;distinguish, that is, the man in himself from his position andreputation--- from the part which rank and circumstances have imposedupon him. How often it is that the worst actor plays the king, and thebest the beggar! This may happen in life, too; and a man must be very_crude_ to confuse the actor with his part.       *       *       *       *       *Our life is so poor that none of the treasures of the world can makeit rich; for the sources of enjoyment are soon found to be all veryscanty, and it is in vain that we look for one that will always flow.Therefore, as regards our own welfare, there are only two ways inwhich we can use wealth. We can either spend it in ostentatious pomp,and feed on the cheap respect which our imaginary glory will bring usfrom the infatuated crowd; or, by avoiding all expenditure that willdo us no good, we can let our wealth grow, so that we may have abulwark against misfortune and want that shall be stronger and betterevery day; in view of the fact that life, though it has few delights,is rich in evils.       *       *       *       *       *It is just because our real and inmost being is _will_ that it is onlyby its exercise that we can attain a vivid consciousness of existence,although this is almost always attended by pain. Hence it is thatexistence is essentially painful, and that many persons for whosewants full provision is made arrange their day in accordance withextremely regular, monotonous, and definite habits. By this means theyavoid all the pain which the movement of the will produces; but, onthe other hand, their whole existence becomes a series of scenes andpictures that mean nothing. They are hardly aware that they exist.Nevertheless, it is the best way of settling accounts with life, solong as there is sufficient change to prevent an excessive feeling ofboredom. It is much better still if the Muses give a man some worthyoccupation, so that the pictures which fill his consciousness havesome meaning, and yet not a meaning that can be brought into anyrelation with his will.       *       *       *       *       *A man is _wise_ only on condition of living in a world full of fools.GENIUS AND VIRTUE.When I think, it is the spirit of the world which is striving toexpress its thought; it is nature which is trying to know and fathomitself. It is not the thoughts of some other mind, which I amendeavouring to trace; but it is I who transform that which existsinto something which is known and thought, and would otherwise neithercome into being nor continue in it.In the realm of physics it was held for thousands of years to be afact beyond question that water was a simple and consequently anoriginal element. In the same way in the realm of metaphysics itwas held for a still longer period that the _ego_ was a simple andconsequently an indestructible entity. I have shown, however, that itis composed of two heterogeneous parts, namely, the _Will_, which ismetaphysical in its character, a thing in itself, and the _knowingsubject_, which is physical and a mere phenomenon.Let me illustrate what I mean. Take any large, massive, heavybuilding: this hard, ponderous body that fills so much space exists,I tell you, only in the soft pulp of the brain. There alone, in thehuman brain, has it any being. Unless you understand this, you can gono further.Truly it is the world itself that is a miracle; the world of materialbodies. I looked at two of them. Both were heavy, symmetrical, andbeautiful. One was a jasper vase with golden rim and golden handles;the other was an organism, an animal, a man. When I had sufficientlyadmired their exterior, I asked my attendant genius to allow me toexamine the inside of them; and I did so. In the vase I found nothingbut the force of gravity and a certain obscure desire, which took theform of chemical affinity. But when I entered into the other--howshall I express my astonishment at what I saw? It is more incrediblethan all the fairy tales and fables that were ever conceived.Nevertheless, I shall try to describe it, even at the risk of findingno credence for my tale.In this second thing, or rather in the upper end of it, called thehead, which on its exterior side looks like anything else--a body inspace, heavy, and so on--I found no less an object than the wholeworld itself, together with the whole of the space in which all ofit exists, and the whole of the time in which all of it moves,and finally everything that fills both time and space in all itsvariegated and infinite character; nay, strangest sight of all, Ifound myself walking about in it! It was no picture that I saw; it wasno peep-show, but reality itself. This it is that is really and trulyto be found in a thing which is no bigger than a cabbage, and which,on occasion, an executioner might strike off at a blow, and suddenlysmother that world in darkness and night. The world, I say, wouldvanish, did not heads grow like mushrooms, and were there not alwaysplenty of them ready to snatch it up as it is sinking down intonothing, and keep it going like a ball. This world is an idea whichthey all have in common, and they express the community of theirthought by the word "objectivity."In the face of this vision I felt as if I were Ardschuna when Krishnaappeared to him in his true majesty, with his hundred thousand armsand eyes and mouths.When I see a wide landscape, and realise that it arises by theoperation of the functions of my brain, that is to say, of time,space, and casuality, on certain spots which have gathered on myretina, I feel that I carry it within me. I have an extraordinarilyclear consciousness of the identity of my own being with that of theexternal world.Nothing provides so vivid an illustration of this identity as a_dream_. For in a dream other people appear to be totally distinctfrom us, and to possess the most perfect objectivity, and a naturewhich is quite different from ours, and which often puzzles,surprises, astonishes, or terrifies us; and yet it is all our ownself. It is even so with the will, which sustains the whole of theexternal world and gives it life; it is the same will that is inourselves, and it is there alone that we are immediately conscious ofit. But it is the intellect, in ourselves and in others, which makesall these miracles possible; for it is the intellect which everywheredivides actual being into subject and object; it is a hall ofphantasmagorical mystery, inexpressibly marvellous, incomparablymagical.The difference in degree of mental power which sets so wide a gulfbetween the genius and the ordinary mortal rests, it is true, uponnothing else than a more or less perfect development of the cerebralsystem. But it is this very difference which is so important, becausethe whole of the real world in which we live and move possesses anexistence only in relation to this cerebral system. Accordingly, thedifference between a genius and an ordinary man is a total diversityof world and existence. The difference between man and the loweranimals may be similarly explained.When Momus was said to ask for a window in the breast, it was anallegorical joke, and we cannot even imagine such a contrivance tobe a possibility; but it would be quite possible to imagine that theskull and its integuments were transparent, and then, good heavens!what differences should we see in the size, the form, the quality,the movement of the brain! what degrees of value! A great mind wouldinspire as much respect at first sight as three stars on a man'sbreast, and what a miserable figure would be cut by many a one whowore them!Men of genius and intellect, and all those whose mental andtheoretical qualities are far more developed than their moraland practical qualities--men, in a word, who have more mind thancharacter--are often not only awkward and ridiculous in matters ofdaily life, as has been observed by Plato in the seventh book of the_Republic_, and portrayed by Goethe in his _Tasso_; but they areoften, from a moral point of view, weak and contemptible creatures aswell; nay, they might almost be called bad men. Of this Rousseau hasgiven us genuine examples. Nevertheless, that better consciousnesswhich is the source of all virtue is often stronger in them than inmany of those whose actions are nobler than their thoughts; nay, itmay be said that those who think nobly have a better acquaintance withvirtue, while the others make a better practice of it. Full of zealfor the good and for the beautiful, they would fain fly up to heavenin a straight line; but the grosser elements of this earth opposetheir flight, and they sink back again. They are like born artists,who have no knowledge of technique, or find that the marble is toohard for their fingers. Many a man who has much less enthusiasm forthe good, and a far shallower acquaintance with its depths, makes abetter thing of it in practice; he looks down upon the noble thinkerswith contempt, and he has a right to do it; nevertheless, he does notunderstand them, and they despise him in their turn, and not unjustly.They are to blame; for every living man has, by the fact of hisliving, signed the conditions of life; but they are still more to bepitied. They achieve their redemption, not on the way of virtue, buton a path of their own; and they are saved, not by works, but byfaith.Men of no genius whatever cannot bear solitude: they take no pleasurein the contemplation of nature and the world. This arises from thefact that they never lose sight of their own will, and thereforethey see nothing of the objects of the world but the bearing of suchobjects upon their will and person. With objects which have no suchbearing there sounds within them a constant note: _It is nothing tome_, which is the fundamental base in all their music. Thus all thingsseem to them to wear a bleak, gloomy, strange, hostile aspect. It isonly for their will that they seem to have any perceptive faculties atall; and it is, in fact, only a moral and not a theoretical tendency,only a moral and not an intellectual value, that their life possesses.The lower animals bend their heads to the ground, because all thatthey want to see is what touches their welfare, and they can nevercome to contemplate things from a really objective point of view. Itis very seldom that unintellectual men make a true use of their erectposition, and then it is only when they are moved by some intellectualinfluence outside them.The man of intellect or genius, on the other hand, has more of thecharacter of the eternal subject that knows, than of the finitesubject that wills; his knowledge is not quite engrossed andcaptivated by his will, but passes beyond it; he is the son, _not ofthe bondwoman, but of the free_. It is not only a moral but alsoa theoretical tendency that is evinced in his life; nay, it mightperhaps be said that to a certain extent he is beyond morality. Ofgreat villainy he is totally incapable; and his conscience is lessoppressed by ordinary sin than the conscience of the ordinary man,because life, as it were, is a game, and he sees through it.The relation between _genius_ and _virtue_ is determined by thefollowing considerations. Vice is an impulse of the will so violentin its demands that it affirms its own life by denying the life ofothers. The only kind of knowledge that is useful to the will is theknowledge that a given effect is produced by a certain cause. Geniusitself is a kind of knowledge, namely, of ideas; and it is a knowledgewhich is unconcerned with any principle of causation. The man who isdevoted to knowledge of this character is not employed in the businessof the will. Nay, every man who is devoted to the purely objectivecontemplation of the world (and it is this that is meant by theknowledge of ideas) completely loses sight of his will and itsobjects, and pays no further regard to the interests of his ownperson, but becomes a pure intelligence free of any admixture of will.Where, then, devotion to the intellect predominates over concern forthe will and its objects, it shows that the man's will is not theprincipal element in his being, but that in proportion to hisintelligence it is weak. Violent desire, which is the root of allvice, never allows a man to arrive at the pure and disinterestedcontemplation of the world, free from any relation to the will, suchas constitutes the quality of genius; but here the intelligenceremains the constant slave of the will.Since genius consists in the perception of ideas, and men of genius_contemplate_ their object, it may be said that it is only the eyewhich is any real evidence of genius. For the contemplative gaze hassomething steady and vivid about it; and with the eye of genius it isoften the case, as with Goethe, that the white membrane over the pupilis visible. With violent, passionate men the same thing may alsohappen, but it arises from a different cause, and may be easilydistinguished by the fact that the eyes roll. Men of no genius at allhave no interest in the idea expressed by an object, but only in therelations in which that object stands to others, and finally to theirown person. Thus it is that they never indulge in contemplation, orare soon done with it, and rarely fix their eyes long upon anyobject; and so their eyes do not wear the mark of genius which I havedescribed. Nay, the regular Philistine does the direct opposite ofcontemplating--he spies. If he looks at anything it is to pry intoit; as may be specially observed when he screws up his eyes, which hefrequently does, in order to see the clearer. Certainly, no real manof genius ever does this, at least habitually, even though he isshort-sighted.What I have said will sufficiently illustrate the conflict betweengenius and vice. It may be, however, nay, it is often the case, thatgenius is attended by a strong will; and as little as men of geniuswere ever consummate rascals, were they ever perhaps perfect saintseither.Let me explain. Virtue is not exactly a positive weakness of the will;it is, rather, an intentional restraint imposed upon its violencethrough a knowledge of it in its inmost being as manifested in theworld. This knowledge of the world, the inmost being of which iscommunicable only in _ideas_, is common both to the genius and to thesaint. The distinction between the two is that the genius reveals hisknowledge by rendering it in some form of his own choice, and theproduct is Art. For this the saint, as such, possesses no directfaculty; he makes an immediate application of his knowledge to his ownwill, which is thus led into a denial of the world. With the saintknowledge is only a means to an end, whereas the genius remains atthe stage of knowledge, and has his pleasure in it, and reveals it byrendering what he knows in his art.In the hierarchy of physical organisation, strength of will isattended by a corresponding growth in the intelligent faculties. Ahigh degree of knowledge, such as exists in the genius, presupposes apowerful will, though, at the same time, a will that is subordinateto the intellect. In other words, both the intellect and the willare strong, but the intellect is the stronger of the two. Unless, ashappens in the case of the saint, the intellect is at once applied tothe will, or, as in the case of the artist, it finds its pleasures ina reproduction of itself, the will remains untamed. Any strength thatit may lose is due to the predominance of pure objective intelligencewhich is concerned with the contemplation of ideas, and is not, asin the case of the common or the bad man, wholly occupied with theobjects of the will. In the interval, when the genius is no longerengaged in the contemplation of ideas, and his intelligence is againapplied to the will and its objects, the will is re-awakened in allits strength. Thus it is that men of genius often have very violentdesires, and are addicted to sensual pleasure and to anger. Greatcrimes, however, they do not commit; because, when the opportunity ofthem offers, they recognise their idea, and see it very vividly andclearly. Their intelligence is thus directed to the idea, and so gainsthe predominance over the will, and turns its course, as with thesaint; and the crime is uncommitted.The genius, then, always participates to some degree in thecharacteristics of the saint, as he is a man of the samequalification; and, contrarily, the saint always participates to somedegree in the characteristics of the genius.The good-natured character, which is common, is to be distinguishedfrom the saintly by the fact that it consists in a weakness of will,with a somewhat less marked weakness of intellect. A lower degree ofthe knowledge of the world as revealed in ideas here suffices to checkand control a will that is weak in itself. Genius and sanctity arefar removed from good-nature, which is essentially weak in all itsmanifestations.Apart from all that I have said, so much at least is clear. Whatappears under the forms of time, space, and casuality, and vanishesagain, and in reality is nothing, and reveals its nothingness bydeath--this vicious and fatal appearance is the will. But what doesnot appear, and is no phenomenon, but rather the noumenon; whatmakes appearance possible; what is not subject to the principle ofcausation, and therefore has no vain or vanishing existence, butabides for ever unchanged in the midst of a world full of suffering,like a ray of light in a storm,--free, therefore, from all pain andfatality,--this, I say, is the intelligence. The man who is moreintelligence than will, is thereby delivered, in respect of thegreatest part of him, from nothingness and death; and such a man is inhis nature a genius.By the very fact that he lives and works, the man who is endowedwith genius makes an entire sacrifice of himself in the interestsof everyone. Accordingly, he is free from the obligation to make aparticular sacrifice for individuals; and thus he can refuse manydemands which others are rightly required to meet. He suffers andachieves more than all the others.The spring which moves the genius to elaborate his works is not fame,for that is too uncertain a quality, and when it is seen at closequarters, of little worth. No amount of fame will make up for thelabour of attaining it:  _Nulla est fama tuum par oequiparare laborem_.Nor is it the delight that a man has in his work; for that too isoutweighed by the effort which he has to make. It is, rather, aninstinct _sui generis_; in virtue of which the genius is driven toexpress what he sees and feels in some permanent shape, without beingconscious of any further motive.It is manifest that in so far as it leads an individual to sacrificehimself for his species, and to live more in the species than inhimself, this impulse is possessed of a certain resemblance withsuch modifications of the sexual impulse as are peculiar to man. Themodifications to which I refer are those that confine this impulse tocertain individuals of the other sex, whereby the interests of thespecies are attained. The individuals who are actively affected bythis impulse may be said to sacrifice themselves for the species,by their passion for each other, and the disadvantageous conditionsthereby imposed upon them,--in a word, by the institution of marriage.They may be said to be serving the interests of the species ratherthan the interests of the individual.The instinct of the genius does, in a higher fashion, for the idea,what passionate love does for the will. In both cases there arepeculiar pleasures and peculiar pains reserved for the individuals whoin this way serve the interests of the species; and they live in astate of enhanced power.The genius who decides once for all to live for the interests of thespecies in the way which he chooses is neither fitted nor called uponto do it in the other. It is a curious fact that the perpetuation of aman's name is effected in both ways.In music the finest compositions are the most difficult to understand.They are only for the trained intelligence. They consist of longmovements, where it is only after a labyrinthine maze that thefundamental note is recovered. It is just so with genius; it is onlyafter a course of struggle, and doubt, and error, and much reflectionand vacillation, that great minds attain their equilibrium. It is thelongest pendulum that makes the greatest swing. Little minds soon cometo terms with themselves and the world, and then fossilise; but theothers flourish, and are always alive and in motion.The essence of genius is a measure of intellectual power far beyondthat which is required to serve the individual's will. But it is ameasure of a merely relative character, and it may be reached bylowering the degree of the will, as well as by raising that of theintellect. There are men whose intellect predominates over theirwill, and are yet not possessed of genius in any proper sense. Theirintellectual powers do, indeed, exceed the ordinary, though not to anygreat extent, but their will is weak. They have no violent desires;and therefore they are more concerned with mere knowledge than withthe satisfaction of any aims. Such men possess talent; they areintelligent, and at the same time very contented and cheerful.A clear, cheerful and reasonable mind, such as brings a man happiness,is dependent on the relation established between his intellect and hiswill--a relation in which the intellect is predominant. But genius anda great mind depend on the relation between a man's intellect and thatof other people--a relation in which his intellect must exceed theirs,and at the same time his will may also be proportionately stronger.That is the reason why genius and happiness need not necessarily existtogether.When the individual is distraught by cares or pleasantry, or torturedby the violence of his wishes and desires, the genius in him isenchained and cannot move. It is only when care and desire are silentthat the air is free enough for genius to live in it. It is then thatthe bonds of matter are cast aside, and the pure spirit--the pure,knowing subject--remains. Hence, if a man has any genius, let himguard himself from pain, keep care at a distance, and limit hisdesires; but those of them which he cannot suppress let him satisfy tothe full. This is the only way in which he will make the best use ofhis rare existence, to his own pleasure and the world's profit.To fight with need and care or desires, the satisfaction of which isrefused and forbidden, is good enough work for those who, werethey free of would have to fight with boredom, and so take to badpractices; but not for the man whose time, if well used, will bearfruit for centuries to come. As Diderot says, he is not merely a moralbeing.Mechanical laws do not apply in the sphere of chemistry, nor dochemical laws in the sphere in which organic life is kindled. In thesame way, the rules which avail for ordinary men will not do for theexceptions, nor will their pleasures either.It is a persistent, uninterrupted activity that constitutes thesuperior mind. The object to which this activity is directed is amatter of subordinate importance; it has no essential bearing on thesuperiority in question, but only on the individual who possesses it.All that education can do is to determine the direction which thisactivity shall take; and that is the reason why a man's nature is somuch more important than his education. For education is to naturalfaculty what a wax nose is to a real one; or what the moon and theplanets are to the sun. In virtue of his education a man says, notwhat he thinks himself, but what others have thought and he haslearned as a matter of training; and what he does is not what hewants, but what he has been accustomed to do.The lower animals perform many intelligent functions much better thanman; for instance, the finding of their way back to the place fromwhich they came, the recognition of individuals, and so on. In thesame way, there are many occasions in real life to which the genius isincomparably less equal and fitted than the ordinary man. Nay more:just as animals never commit a folly in the strict sense of the word,so the average man is not exposed to folly in the same degree as thegenius.The average man is wholly relegated to the sphere of _being_; thegenius, on the other hand, lives and moves chiefly in the sphere of_knowledge_. This gives rise to a twofold distinction. In the firstplace, a man can be one thing only, but he may _know_ countlessthings, and thereby, to some extent, identify himself with them, byparticipating in what Spinoza calls their _esse objectivum_. In thesecond place, the world, as I have elsewhere observed, is fine enoughin appearance, but in reality dreadful; for torment is the conditionof all life.It follows from the first of these distinctions that the life of theaverage man is essentially one of the greatest boredom; and thus wesee the rich warring against boredom with as much effort and as littlerespite as fall to the poor in their struggle with need and adversity.And from the second of them it follows that the life of the averageman is overspread with a dull, turbid, uniform gravity; whilst thebrow of genius glows with mirth of a unique character, which, althoughhe has sorrows of his own more poignant than those of the average man,nevertheless breaks out afresh, like the sun through clouds. It iswhen the genius is overtaken by an affliction which affects others aswell as himself, that this quality in him is most in evidence; forthen he is seen to be like man, who alone can laugh, in comparisonwith the beast of the field, which lives out its life grave and dull.It is the curse of the genius that in the same measure in which othersthink him great and worthy of admiration, he thinks them small andmiserable creatures. His whole life long he has to suppress thisopinion; and, as a rule, they suppress theirs as well. Meanwhile, heis condemned to live in a bleak world, where he meets no equal, as itwere an island where there are no inhabitants but monkeys and parrots.Moreover, he is always troubled by the illusion that from a distance amonkey looks like a man.Vulgar people take a huge delight in the faults and follies of greatmen; and great men are equally annoyed at being thus reminded of theirkinship with them.The real dignity of a man of genius or great intellect, the traitwhich raises him over others and makes him worthy of respect, is atbottom the fact, that the only unsullied and innocent part of humannature, namely, the intellect, has the upper hand in him? andprevails; whereas, in the other there is nothing but sinful will,and just as much intellect as is requisite for guiding his steps,---rarely any more, very often somewhat less,--and of what use is it?It seems to me that genius might have its root in a certain perfectionand vividness of the memory as it stretches back over the events ofpast life. For it is only by dint of memory, which makes our life inthe strict sense a complete whole, that we attain a more profound andcomprehensive understanding of it.***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ESSAYS OF ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER;THE ART OF CONTROVERSY********** This file should be named 10731.txt or 10731.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/7/3/10731Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

WeyantThe Centralia ConspiracyBy Ralph Chaplin[Illustration: cover]  A Tongue of Flame  The martyr cannot be dishonored. Every lash inflicted is a tongue of  flame; every prison a more illustrious abode; every burned book or house  enlightens the world; every suppressed or expunged word reverberates  through the earth from side to side. The minds of men are at last  aroused; reason looks out and justifies her own, and malice finds all  her work is ruin. It is the whipper who is whipped and the tyrant who is  undone.--Emerson.Murder or Self-Defense?This booklet is not an apology for murder. It is an honest effort tounravel the tangled mesh of circumstances that led up to the Armistice Daytragedy in Centralia, Washington. The writer is one of those who believethat the taking of human life is justifiable only in self-defense. Eventhen the act is a horrible reversion to the brute--to the low plane ofsavagery. Civilization, to be worthy of the name, must afford othermethods of settling human differences than those of blood letting.The nation was shocked on November 11, 1919, to read of the killing offour American Legion men by members of the Industrial Workers of the Worldin Centralia. The capitalist newspapers announced to the world that theseunoffending paraders were killed in cold blood--that they were murderedfrom ambush without provocation of any kind. If the author were convincedthat there was even a slight possibility of this being true, he would notraise his voice to defend the perpetrators of such a cowardly crime.But there are two sides to every question and perhaps the newspaperspresented only one of these. Dr. Frank Bickford, an ex-service man whoparticipated in the affair, testified at the coroner's inquest that theLegion men were attempting to raid the union hall when they were killed.Sworn testimony of various eyewitnesses has revealed the fact that some ofthe "unoffending paraders" carried coils of rope and that others werearmed with such weapons as would work the demolition of the hall andbodily injury to its occupants. These things throw an entirely differentlight on the subject. If this is true it means that the union loggersfired only in self-defense and not with the intention of committing wantonand malicious murder as has been stated. Now, as at least two of the unionmen who did the shooting were ex-soldiers, it appears that the tragedymust have resulted from something more than a mere quarrel between loggersand soldiers. There must be something back of it all that the publicgenerally doesn't know about.There is only one body of men in the Northwest who would hate a union hallenough to have it raided--the lumber "interests." And now we get at thekernel of the matter, which is the fact that the affair was the outgrowthof a struggle between the lumber trust and its employees--betweenOrganized Capital and Organized Labor.A Labor CaseAnd so, after all, the famous trial at Montesano was not a murder trialbut a labor trial in the strict sense of the word. Under the law, it mustbe remembered, a man is not committing murder in defending his life andproperty from the felonious assault of a mob bent on killing anddestruction. There is no doubt whatever but what the lumber trust hadplotted to "make an example" of the loggers and destroy their hall on thisoccasion. And this was not the first time that such atrocities had beenattempted and actually committed. Isn't it peculiar that, out of manysimilar raids, you only heard of the one where the men defendedthemselves? Self-preservation is the first law of nature, but thepreservation of its holy profits is the first law of the lumber trust. Theorganized lumber workers were considered a menace to the super-prosperityof a few profiteers--hence the attempted raid and the subsequent killing.What is more significant is the fact the raid had been carefully plannedweeks in advance. There is a great deal of evidence to prove this point.There is no question that the whole affair was the outcome of astruggle--a class struggle, if you please--between the union loggers andthe lumber interests; the former seeking to organize the workers in thewoods and the latter fighting this movement with all the means at itsdisposal.In this light the Centralia affair does not appear as an isolated incidentbut rather an incident in an eventful industrial conflict, little knownand less understood, between the lumber barons and loggers of the PacificNorthwest. This viewpoint will place Centralia in its proper perspectiveand enable one to trace the tragedy back to the circumstances andconditions that gave it birth.But was there a conspiracy on the part of the lumber interests to commitmurder and violence in an effort to drive organized labor from its domain?Weeks of patient investigating in and around the scene or the occurrencehas convinced the present writer that such a conspiracy has existed. Aconsiderable amount of startling evidence has been unearthed that hashitherto been suppressed. If you care to consider Labor's version of thisunfortunate incident you are urged to read the following truthful accountof this almost unbelievable piece of mediaeval intrigue and brutality.The facts will speak for themselves. Credit them or not, but read!The Forests of the NorthwestThe Pacific Northwest is world famed for its timber. The first whiteexplorers to set foot upon its fertile soil were awed by the magnitude andgrandeur of its boundless stretches of virgin forests. Nature has neverendowed any section of our fair world with such an immensity of kinglytrees. Towering into the sky to unthinkable heights, they stand as livingmonuments to the fecundity of natural life. Imagine, if you can, the vastwide region of the West coast, hills, slopes and valleys, covered withmillions of fir, spruce and cedar trees, raising their verdant crests ahundred, two hundred or two hundred and fifty feet into the air.When Columbus first landed on the uncharted continent these trees werealready ancient. There they stood, straight and majestic with green andfoam-flecked streams purling here and there at their feet, crowning therugged landscape with superlative beauty, overtopped only by thesnow-capped mountains--waiting for the hand of man to put them to themultitudinous uses of modern civilization. Imagine, if you can, the firstexplorer, gazing awe-stricken down those "calm cathedral isles," wonderingat the lavish bounty of our Mother Earth in supplying her children withsuch inexhaustible resources.But little could the first explorer know that the criminal clutch of Greedwas soon to seize these mighty forests, guard them from the human racewith bayonets, hangman's ropes and legal statutes; and use them,robber-baron like, to exact unimaginable tribute from the men and women ofthe world who need them. Little did the first explorer dream that the daywould come when individuals would claim private ownership of that whichprolific nature had travailed through centuries to bestow upon mankind.But that day has come and with it the struggle between master and man thatwas to result in Centralia--or possibly many Centralias.Lumber--A Basic IndustryIt seems the most logical thing in the world to believe that the naturalresources of the Earth, upon which the race depends for food, clothing andshelter, should be owned collectively by the race instead of being theprivate property of a few social parasites. It seems that reason wouldpreclude the possibility of any other arrangement, and that it would beconsidered as absurd for individuals to lay claim to forests, mines,railroads and factories as it would be for individuals to lay claim to theownership of the sunlight that warms us or to the air we breathe. But thepoor human race, in its bungling efforts to learn how to live in ourbeautiful world, appears destined to find out by bitter experience thatthe private ownership of the means of life is both criminal anddisastrous.Lumber is one of the basic industries--one of the industries mankind nevercould have done without. The whole structure of what we call civilizationis built upon wooden timbers, ax-hewn or machine finished as the case maybe. Without the product of the forests humanity would never have learnedthe use of fire, the primitive bow and arrow or the bulging galleys ofancient commerce. Without the firm and fibrous flesh of the mightymonarchs of the forest men might never have had barges for fishing orweapons for the chase; they would not have had carts for their oxen orkilns for the fashioning of pottery; they would not have had dwellings,temples or cities; they would not have had furniture nor fittings norroofs above their heads. Wood is one of the most primitive andindispensable of human necessities. Without its use we would still begroping in the gloom and misery of early savagery, suffering from the coldof outer space and defenseless in the midst of a harsh and hostileenvironment.From Pioneer to ParasiteSo it happened that the first pioneers in the northern were forced to baretheir arms and match their strength with the wooded wilderness. At firstthe subjugation of the forests was a social effort. The lives and futureprosperity of the settlers must be made secure from the raids of theIndians and the inclemency of the elements. Manfully did these men laboruntil their work was done. But this period did not last long, for the tideof emigration was sweeping westward over the sun-baked prairies to thepromised land in the golden West.[Illustration: Fir and Spruce TreesThe wood of the West coast abound with tall fir trees. Practically allhigh grade spruce comes from this district also. Spruce was a warnecessity and the lumber trust profiteered unmercifully on the government.U.S. prisons are full of loggers who struck for the 8 hour day in 1917.]Towns sprang up like magic, new trees were felled, sawmills erected andhuge logs in ever increasing numbers were driven down the foaming torrentseach year at spring time. The country was new, the market for lumberconstantly growing and expanding. But the monopolist was unknown and thelynch-mobs of the lumber trust still sleeping in the womb of the Future.So passed the not unhappy period when opportunity was open to everyone,when freedom was dear to the hearts of all. It was at this time that thespirit of real Americanism was born, when the clean, sturdy name "America"spelled freedom, justice and independence. Patriotism in these days wasnot a mask for profiteers and murderers were not permitted to hide theirbloody hands in the folds of their nation's flag.But modern capitalism was creeping like a black curse upon the land.Stealing, coercing, cajoling, defrauding, it spread from its plague-centerin Wall St., leaving misery, class antagonism and resentment in its trial.The old free America of our fathers was undergoing a profound change.Equality of opportunity was doomed. A new social alignment was beingcreated. Monopoly was loosed upon the land. Fabulous fortunes were beingmade as wealth was becoming centered into fewer and fewer hands. Moderncapitalism was entrenching itself for the final and inevitable strugglefor world domination. In due time the social parasites of the East,foreseeing that the forests of Maine, Michigan and Wisconsin could notlast forever, began to look to the woods of the Northwest with covetouseyes.[Illustration: Cedar Trees of the NorthwestWith these giants the logger daily matches his strength and skill. Theprofit-greedy lumber trust has wasted enough trees of smaller size tosupply the world with wood for years to come.]Stealing the People's Forest LandThe history of the acquisition of the forests of Washington, Montana,Idaho, Oregon and California is a long, sordid story of thinly veiledrobbery and intrigue. The methods of the lumber barons in invading andseizing its "holdings" did not differ greatly, however, from those of thesteel and oil kings, the railroad magnates or any of the other industrialpotentates who acquired great wealth by pilfering America and peonizingits people. The whole sorry proceeding was disgraceful, high-handed andtreacherous, and only made possible by reason of the blindness of thegenerous American people, drugged with the vanishing hope of "success" andtoo confident of the continued possession of its blood-bought liberties.And do the lumber barons were unhindered in their infamous work ofdebauchery, bribery, murder and brazen fraud.As a result the monopoly of the Northwestern woods became an establishedfact. The lumber trust came into "its own." The new social alignment wascomplete, with the idle, absentee landlord at one end and the migratoryand possessionless lumber jack at the other. The parasites hadappropriated to themselves the standing timber of the Northwest; but thebrawny logger whose labor had made possible the development of theindustry was given, as his share of the spoils, a crumby "bindle" and arebellious heart. The masters had gained undisputed control of the timberof the country, three quarters of which is located in the Northwest; butthe workers who felled the trees, drove the logs, dressed, finished andloaded the lumber were left in the state of helpless dependency from whichthey could only extricate themselves by means of organization. And it isthis effort to form a union and establish union headquarters that led tothe tragedy at Centralia.The lumber barons had not only achieved a monopoly of the woods but aperfect feudal domination of the woods as well. Within their domain banks,ships, railways and mills bore their private insignia-and politicians,Employers' Associations, preachers, newspapers, fraternal orders andjudges and gun-men were always at their beck and call. The power theywield is tremendous and their profits would ransom a kingdom. Naturallythey did not intend to permit either power or profits to be menaced by amass of weather-beaten slaves in stag shirts and overalls. And so thestruggle waxed fiercer just as the lumberjack learned to contendsuccessfully for living conditions and adequate remuneration. It was theold, old conflict of human rights against property rights. Let us see howthey compared in strength.The Triumph of MonopolyThe following extract from a document entitled "The Lumber Industry," bythe Honorable Herbert Knox Smith and published by the U.S. Department ofCommerce (Bureau of Corporations) will give some idea of the holdings andinfluence of the lumber trust:"Ten monopoly groups, aggregating only one thousand, eight hundred and twoholders, monopolized one thousand, two hundred and eight billion eighthundred million (1,208,800,000,000) board feet of standing timber--each afoot square and an inch thick. These figures are so stupendous that theyare meaningless without a hackneyed device to bring their meaning home.These one thousand, eight hundred and two timber business monopolists heldenough standing timber; an indispensable natural resource, to yield theplanks necessary (over and above manufacturing wastage) to make a floatingbridge more than two feet thick and more than five miles wide from NewYork to Liverpool. It would supply one inch planks for a roof over France,Germany and Italy. It would build a fence eleven miles high along ourentire coast line. All monopolized by one thousand, eight hundred and twoholders, or interests more or less interlocked. One of those interests--agrant of only three holders--monopolized at one time two hundred andthirty-seven billion, five hundred million (237,500,000,000) feet whichwould make a column one foot square and three million miles high. Althoughcontrolled by only three holders, that interest comprised over eightpercent of all the standing timber in the United States at that time."The above illuminating figures, quoted from "The I.W.A. in the LumberIndustry," by James Rowan, will give some idea of the magnitude and powerof the lumber trust.[Illustration: "Topping a Tree"After one of these huge trees is "topped" it is called a "spar tree"--verynecessary in a certain kind of logging operations. As soon as thechopped-off portion falls, the trunk vibrates rapidly from side to sidesometimes shaking the logger to certain death below.]Opposing this colossal aggregation of wealth and cussedness were thethousands of hard-driven and exploited lumberworkers in the woods andsawmills. These had neither wealth nor influence--nothing but their hard,bare hands and a growing sense of solidarity. And the masters of theforests were more afraid of this solidarity than anything else in theworld--and they fought it more bitterly, as events will show. Centralia isonly one of the incidents of this struggle between owner and worker. Butlet us see what this hated and indispensable logger-the productive andhuman basis of the lumber industry, the man who made all these thingspossible, is like.The Human Element--"The Timber Beast"Lumber workers are, by nature of their employment, divided into twocategories--the saw-mill hand and the logger. The former, like hisbrothers in the Eastern factories, is an indoor type while the latter isessentially a man of the open air. Both types are necessary to theproduction of finished lumber, and to both union organization is animperative necessity.Sawmill work is machine work--rapid, tedious and often dangerous. There isthe uninteresting repetition of the same act of motions day in and dayout. The sights, sounds and smells of the mill are never varied. The factthat the mill is permanently located tends to keep mill workers groupedabout the place of their employment. Many of them, especially in theshingle mills, have lost fingers or hands in feeding the lumber to thescreaming saws. It has been estimated that fully a half of these men aremarried and remain settled in the mill communities. The other half,however, are not nearly so migratory as the lumberjack. Sawmill workersare not the "rough-necks" of the industry. They are of the moreconservative "home-guard" element and characterized by the psychology ofall factory workers.The logger, on the other hand, (and it is with him our narrative ischiefly concerned), is accustomed to hard and hazardous work in the openwoods. His occupation makes him of necessity migratory. The camp,following the uncut timber from place to place, makes it impossible forhim to acquire a family and settle down. Scarcely one out of ten has everdared assume the responsibility of matrimony. The necessity of shippingfrom a central point in going from one job to another usually forces amigratory existence upon the lumberjack in spite of his best intentions tolive otherwise.What Is a Casual Laborer?The problem of the logger is that of the casual laborer in general.Broadly speaking, there are three distinct classes of casual laborers:First, the "harvest stiff" of the middle West who follows the ripeningcrops from Kansas to the Dakotas, finding winter employment in the North,Middle Western woods, in construction camps or on the ice fields. Thenthere is the harvest worker of "the Coast" who garners the fruit, hops andgrain, and does the canning of California, Washington and Oregon, findingout-of-season employment wherever possible. Finally there is theNorthwestern logger, whose work, unlike that of the Middle Western "jack"is not seasonal, but who is compelled nevertheless to remain migratory. Asa rule, however, his habitat is confined, according to preference or forceof circumstances, to either the "long log" country of Western Washingtonand Oregon as well as California, or to the "short log" country of EasternWashington and Oregon, Northern Idaho and Western Montana. Minnesota,Michigan, and Wisconsin are in what is called the "short log" region.[Illustration: A Logger of the Pacific NorthwestThis is a type of the men who work in the "long log" region of the Westcoast. His is a man's sized job, and his efforts to organize and betterthe working conditions in the lumber industry have been manly efforts--andbitterly opposed.]As a rule the logger of the Northwest follows the woods to the exclusionof all other employment. He is militantly a lumberjack and is inclined tobe a trifle "patriotic" and disputatious as to the relative importance ofhis own particular branch of the industry. "Long loggers," for instance,view with a suspicion of disdain the work of "short loggers" and viceversa."Lumber-Jack" The Giant KillerBut the lumber-jack is a casual worker and he is the finished product ofmodern capitalism. He is the perfect proletarian type--possessionless,homeless, and rebellious. He is the reverse side of the gilded medal ofpresent day society. On the one side is the third generation idlerich--arrogant and parasitical, and on the other, the actual producer,economically helpless and denied access to the means of production unlesshe "beg his lordly fellow worm to give him leave to toil," as Robert Burnshas it.The logger of the Northwest has his faults. He is not any more perfectthan the rest of us. The years of degradation and struggle he has enduredin the woods have not failed to leave their mark upon him. But, as thewage workers go, he is not the common but the uncommon type both asregards physical strength and cleanliness and mental alertness. He isgenerous to a fault and has all the qualities Lincoln and Whitman loved inmen.In the first place, whether as faller, rigging man or on the "drive," hiswork is muscular and out of doors. He must at all times conquer the forestand battle with the elements. There is a tang and adventure to his laborin the impressive solitude of the woods that gives him a steady eye, astrong arm and a clear brain. Being constantly close to the great greenheart of Nature, he acquires the dignity and independence of the savagerather than the passive and unresisting submission of the factory worker.The fact that he is free from family ties also tends to make him ready foran industrial frolic or fight at any time. In daily matching his prowessand skill with the products of the earth he feels in a way, that the woods"belong" to him and develops a contempt for the unseen and unknownemployers who kindly permit him to enrich them with his labor. He isconstantly reminded of the glaring absurdity of the private ownership ofnatural resources. Instinctively he becomes a rebel against the injusticeand contradictions of capitalist society.Dwarfed to ant-like insignificance by the verdant immensity around him,the logger toils daily with ax, saw and cable. One after another forestgiants of dizzy height crash to the earth with a sound like thunder. In ashort time they are loaded on flat cars and hurried across thestump-dotted clearing to the river, whence they are dispatched to thenoisy, ever-waiting saws at the mill. And always the logger knows in hisheart that this is not done that people may have lumber for their needs,but rather that some overfed parasite may first add to his holy dividends.Production for profit always strikes the logger with the full force ofobjective observation. And is it any wonder, with the process ofexploitation thus naked always before his eyes, that he should have beenamong the very first workers to challenge the flimsy title of the lumberbarons to the private ownership of the woods?The Factory Worker and the Lumber-JackWithout wishing to disparage the ultimate worth of either; it might bewell to contrast for a moment the factory worker of the East with thelumber-jack of the Pacific Northwest. To the factory hand the master'sclaim to the exclusive title of the means of production is not soevidently absurd. Around him are huge, smoking buildings filled withroaring machinery--all man-made. As a rule he simply takes for grantedthat his employers--whoever they are--own these just as he himself owns,for instance, his pipe or his furniture. Only when he learns, fromthoughtful observation or study, that such things are the appropriatedproducts of the labor of himself and his kind, does the truth dawn uponhim that labor produces all and is entitled to its own.[Illustration: Logging OperationsLook around you at the present moment and you will see wood used for manydifferent purposes. Have you ever stopped to think where the raw materialcomes from or what the workers are like who produce it? Here is a scenefrom a lumber camp showing the loggers at their daily tasks. The lumbertrust is willing that these men should work-but not organize.]It must be admitted that factory life tends to dispirit and cow theworkers who spend their lives in the gloomy confines of the modern mill orshop. Obedient to the shrill whistle they pour out of their clustered greydwellings in the early morning. Out of the labor ghettos they swarm andinto their dismal slave-pens. Then the long monotonous, daily "grind," andhome again to repeat the identical proceeding on the following day. Almostalways, tired, trained to harsh discipline or content with low comfort;they are all too liable to feel that capitalism is invincibly colossal andthat the possibility of a better day is hopelessly remote. Most of themare unacquainted with their neighbors. They live in small family orboarding house units and, having no common meeting place, realize onlywith difficulty the mighty potency of their vast numbers. To themorganization appears desirable at times but unattainable. The dickeringconservatism of craft unionism appeals to their cautious natures. They actonly en masse, under awful compulsion and then their release of repressedslave emotion is sudden and terrible.Not so with the weather-tanned husky of the Northwestern woods. His joblife is a group life. He walks to his daily task with his fellow workers.He is seldom employed for long away from them. At a common table he eatswith them, and they all sleep in common bunk houses. The trees themselvesteach him to scorn his master's adventitious claim to exclusive ownership.The circumstances of his daily occupation show him the need of classsolidarity. His strong body clamours constantly for the sweetness andcomforts of life that are denied him, his alert brain urges him toorganize and his independent spirit gives him the courage and tenacity toachieve his aims. The union hall is often his only home and the One BigUnion his best-beloved. He is fond of reading and discussion. He resentsindustrial slavery as an insult. He resented filth, overwork and poverty,he resented being made to carry his own bundle of blankets from job tojob; he gritted his teeth together and fought until he had ground theseobnoxious things under his iron-caulked heel. The lumber trust hated himjust in proportion as he gained and used his industrial power; but neithercurses, promises nor blows could make him budge. He knew what he wantedand he knew how to get what he wanted. And his boss didn't like it verywell.The lumber-jack is secretive and not given to expressed emotion--exceptingin his union songs. The bosses don't like his songs either. But the loggerisn't worried a bit. Working away in the woods every day, or in his bunkat night, he dreams his dream of the world as he thinks it should be--that"wild wobbly dream" that every passing day brings closer torealization--and he wants all who work around him to share his vision andhis determination to win so that all will be ready and worthy to live inthe New Day that is dawning.In a word the Northwestern lumber-jack was too human and too stubborn everto repudiate his red-blooded manhood at the behest of his masters andbecome a serf. His union meant to him all that he possessed or hoped togain. Is it any wonder that he endured the tortures of hell during theperiod of the war rather than yield his Red Card--or that he is stilldetermined and still undefeated? Is it any wonder the lumber barons hatedhim, and sought to break his spirit with brute force and legal cunning--orthat they conspired to murder it at Centralia with mob violence--andfailed?Why the Loggers OrganizedThe condition of the logger previous to the period of organization beggarsdescription. Modern industrial autocracy seemed with him to develop itsmost inhuman characteristics. The evil plant of wage slavery appeared tobear its most noxious blossoms in the woods.The hours of labor were unendurably long, ten hours being the generalrule--with the exception of the Grays Harbor district, where the eleven oreven twelve hour day prevailed. In addition to this men were compelled towalk considerable distances to and from their work and meals through thewet brush.Not infrequently the noon lunch was made almost impossible because of theorder to be back on the job when work commenced. A ten hour stretch ofarduous labor, in a climate where incessant rain is the rule for at leastsix months of the year, was enough to try the strength and patience ofeven the strongest. The wages too were pitiably inadequate.The camps themselves, always more or less temporary affairs, were inferiorto the cow-shed accommodations of a cattle ranch. The bunk house wereover-crowded, ill-smelling and unsanitary. In these ramshackle affairs theloggers were packed like sardines. The bunks were arranged tier over tierand nearly always without mattresses. They were uniformly vermin-infestedand sometimes of the "muzzle-loading" variety. No blankets were furnished,each logger being compelled to supply his own. There were no facilitiesfor bathing or the washing and drying of sweaty clothing. Lighting andventilation were of course, always poor.In addition to these discomforts the unorganized logger was charged amonthly hospital fee for imaginary medical service. Also it was nearlyalways necessary to pay for the opportunity of enjoying these privilegesby purchasing employment from a "job shark" or securing the good graces ofa "man catcher." The former often had "business agreements" with the campforeman and, in many cases, a man could not get a job unless he had aticket from a labor agent in some shipping point.It may be said that the conditions just described were more prevalent insome parts of the lumber country than in others. Nevertheless, theseprevailed pretty generally in all sections of the industry before theworkers attempted to better them by organizing. At all events such werethe conditions the lumber barons sought with all their power to preserveand the loggers to change.Organization and the Opening StruggleA few years before the birth of the Industrial workers of the World thelumber workers had started to organize. By 1905, when the above mentionedunion was launched, lumber-workers were already united in considerablenumbers in the old Western afterwards the American Labor Union. Thisorganization took steps to affiliate with the Industrial Workers of theWorld and was thus among the very first to seek a larger share of life inthe ranks of that militant and maligned organization. Strike followedstrike with varying success and the conditions of the loggers beganperceptibly to improve.Scattered here and there in the cities of the Northwest were many localsof the Industrial Workers of the World. Not until 1912, however, werethese consolidated into a real industrial unit. For the first time asufficient number of loggers and saw mill men were organized to be groupedinto an integral part of the One Big Union. This was done with reasonablesuccess. In the following year the American Federation of Labor attempteda similar task but without lasting results, the loggers preferring theindustrial to the craft form of organization. Besides this, they werepredisposed to sympathize with the ideal of solidarity and IndustrialDemocracy for which their own union had stood from the beginning.The "timber beast" was starting to reap the benefits of his organizedpower. Also he was about to feel the force and hatred of the "interests"arrayed against him. He was soon to learn that the path of labor unionismis strewn with more rocks than roses. He was making an earnest effort toemerge from the squalor and misery of peonage and was soon to see that hisoverlords were satisfied to keep him right where he had always been.Strange to say, almost the first really important clash occurred in thevery heart of the lumber trust's domain, in the little city of Aberdeen,Grays Harbor County--only a short distance from Centralia, of mob fame![Illustration: Eugene Barnett(After the man-hunt)Coal miner.

Upon reaching home Barnett, fearful of the mob, took to thewoods with his rifle. He surrendered to the posse only after he hadconvinced himself that their purpose was not to lynch him.]This was in 1912. A strike had started in the saw mills over demands of a2.50 daily wage. Some of the saw mill workers were members of theIndustrial Workers of the World. They were supported by the union loggersof Western Washington. The struggle was bitterly contested and lasted forseveral weeks. The lumber trust bared its fangs and struck viciously atthe workers in a manner that has since characterized its tactics in alllabor disputes.The jails of Aberdeen and adjoining towns were filled with strikers.Picket lines were broken up and the pickets arrested. When the wives ofthe strikers with babies in their arms, took the places of theirimprisoned husbands, the fire hose was turned on them with great force, inmany instances knocking them to the ground. Loggers and sawmill men alikewere unmercifully beaten. Many were slugged by mobs with pick handles,taken to the outskirts of the city and told that their return would be theoccasion of a lynching. At one time an armed mob of business men draggednearly four hundred strikers from their homes or boarding houses, herdedthem into waiting boxcars, sealed up the doors and were about to deportthem en masse. The sheriff, getting wind of this unheard-of proceeding,stopped it at the last moment. Many men were badly scarred by beatingsthey received. One logger was crippled for life by the brutal treatmentaccorded him.But the strikers won their demands and conditions were materiallyimproved. The Industrial Workers of the World continued to grow in numbersand prestige. This event may be considered the beginning of the labormovement on Grays Harbor that the lumber trust sought finally to crushwith mob violence on a certain memorable day in Centralia seven yearslater.Following the Aberdeen strike one or two minor clashes occurred. Thelumber workers were usually successful. During this period they werequietly but effectually spreading One Big Union propaganda throughout thecamps and mills in the district. Also they were organizing their fellowworkers in increasing numbers into their union. The lumber trust, smartingunder its last defeat, was alarmed and alert.[Illustration: Bert FaulknerAmerican. Logger. 21 years of age. Member of the Industrial Workers of theWorld since 1917. Was in the hall when raid occurred. Faulkner personallyknew Grimm, McElfresh and a number of others who marched in the parade. Heis an ex-soldier himself. The prosecution used a great deal of pressure tomake this boy turn state's evidence. He refused stating that he would tellnothing but the truth. At the last moment he was discharged from the caseafter being held in jail four months.]A Massacre and a New LawBut no really important event occurred until 1916. At this time the unionloggers, organized in the Industrial Workers of the World, had started adrive for membership around Puget Sound. Loggers and mill hands were eagerfor the message of Industrial Unionism. Meetings were well attended andthe sentiment in favor of the organization was steadily growing. The A.F.of L. shingle weavers and longshoremen were on strike and had asked theI.W.W. to help them secure free speech in Everett. The ever-watchfullumber interests decided the time to strike had again arrived. The eventsof "Bloody Sunday" are too well known to need repeating here. Suffice tosay that after a summer replete with illegal beatings and jailings fivemen were killed in cold blood and forty wounded in a final desperateeffort to drive the union out of the city of Everett, Washington. Theseunarmed loggers were slaughtered and wounded by the gunfire of a gang ofbusiness men and plug-uglies of the lumber interests. True to form, thelumber trust had every union man in sight arrested and seventy-fourcharged with the murder of a gunman who had been killed by the cross-fireof his own comrades. None of the desperadoes who had done the actualmurdering was ever prosecuted or even reprimanded. The charge against themembers of the Industrial Workers of the World was pressed. The case wastried in court and the Industrialists declared "not guilty." GeorgeVanderveer was attorney for the defense.The lumber interests were infuriated at their defeat, and from this timeon the struggle raged in deadly earnest. Almost everything from mob law toopen assassination had been tried without avail. The execrated One BigUnion idea was gaining members and power every day. The situation wastruly alarming. Their heretofore trustworthy "wage plugs" were showingunmistakable symptoms of intelligence. Workingmen were waking up. Theywere, in appalling numbers, demanding the right to live like men.Something must be done something new and drastic--to split asunder thison-coming phalanx of industrial power.But the gun-man-and-mob method was discarded, temporarily at least, infavor of the machinations of lumber trust tools in the law making bodies.Big Business can make laws as easily as it can break them--and with aslittle impunity. So the notorious Washington "Criminal Syndicalism" lawwas devised. This law, however, struck a snag. The honest-minded governorof the state, recognizing its transparent character and far-reachingeffects, promptly vetoed the measure. After the death of Governor Listerthe criminal syndicalism law was passed, however, by the next StateLegislature. Since that time it has been used against the AmericanFederation of Labor, the Industrial Workers of the World, the SocialistParty and even common citizens not affiliated with any of theseorganizations. The criminal syndicalism law registers the high water markof reaction. It infringes more on the liberties of the people than any ofthe labor-crushing laws that blackened Russia during the dynasty of theRomanoffs. It would disgrace the anti-Celestial legislation of Hell.The Eight Hour Day and "Treason"Nineteen hundred and seventeen was an eventful year. It was then thegreatest strike in the history of the lumber industry occurred-the strikefor the eight hour day. For years the logger and mill hand had foughtagainst the unrestrained greed of the lumber interests. Step by step, inthe face of fiercest opposition, they had fought for the right to livelike men; and step by step they had been gaining. Each failure or successhad shown them the weakness or the strength of their union. They had beenconsolidating their forces as well as learning how to use them. The lumbertrust had been making huge profits the while, but the lumber workers werestill working ten hours or more and the logger was still packing his dirtyblankets from job to job. Dissatisfaction with conditions was wider andmore prevalent then ever before. Then came the war.As soon as this country had taken its stand with the allied imperialiststhe price of lumber, needed for war purposes, was boosted to sky highfigures. From 16.00 to 116.00 per thousand feet is quite a jump; butrecent disclosures show that the Government paid as high as 1200.00 perthousand for spruce that private concerns were purchasing for less thanone tenth of that sum. Gay parties with plenty of wild women and harddrink are alleged to have been instrumental in enabling the "patriotic"lumber trust to put these little deals across. Due to the duplicity ofthis same bunch of predatory gentlemen the airplane and ship buildingprogram of the United States turned out to be a scandal instead of asuccess. Out of 21,000 feet of spruce delivered to a Massachusettsfactory, inspectors could only pass 400 feet as fit for use. Keep thesefacts and figures in mind when you read about what happened to the"disloyal" lumber workers during the war-and afterwards.[Illustration: Mrs. Elmer Smith and Baby GirlMrs. Elmer Smith is the cultured daughter of a Washington judge.

Mrs. Smith prefers, however, to stick with her rebellawyer whom she loves and admires.]Discontent had been smouldering in the woods for a long time. It was soonfanned to a flame by the brazen profiteering of the lumber trust. Theloggers had been biding their time--rather sullenly it is true--for theday when the wrongs they had endured so patiently and so long might berectified. Their quarrel with the lumber interests was an old one. Thetime was becoming propitious.In the early summer of 1917 the strike started. Sweeping through the shortlog country it spread like wild-fire over nearly all the Northwesternlumber districts. The tie-up was practically complete. The industry wasparalyzed. The lumber trust, its mouth drooling in anticipation of themany millions it was about to make in profits, shattered high heaven withits cries of rage. Immediately its loyal henchmen in the Wilsonadministration rushed to the rescue. Profiteering might be condoned,moralized over or winked at, but militant labor unionism was a menace tothe government and the prosecution of the war. It must be crushed. For wasit not treacherous and treasonable for loggers to strike for livingconditions when Uncle Sam needed the wood and the lumber interests themoney? So Woodrow Wilson and his coterie of political troglodytes from theslave-owning districts of the old South, started out to teach militantlabor a lesson. Corporation lawyers were assembled. Indictments were madeto order. The bloodhounds of the Department of "Justice" were unleashed.Grand Juries of "patriotic" business men were impaneled and did theirexpected work not wisely but too well. All the gun-men and stool-pigeonsof Big Business got busy. And the opera bouffe of "saving our form ofgovernment" was staged.Industrial Heretics and the White TerrorFor a time it seemed as though the strikers would surely be defeated. Theonslaught was terrific, but the loggers held out bravely. Workers werebeaten and jailed by the hundreds. Men were herded like cattle inblistering "bull-pens," to be freed after months of misery, looking morelike skeletons than human beings. Ellensburg and Yakima will never beforgotten in Washington. One logger was even burned to death while lockedin a small iron-barred shack that had been dignified with the title of"jail." In the Northwest even the military were used and the bayonet ofthe soldier could be seen glistening beside the cold steel of the hiredthug. Union halls were raided in all parts of the land. Thousands ofworkers were deported. Dozens were tarred and feathered and mobbed. Somewere even taken out in the dead of night and hanged to railway bridges.Hundreds were convicted of imaginary offenses and sent to prison for termsfrom one to twenty years. Scores were held in filthy jails for as long astwenty-six months awaiting trial. The Espionage Law, which never convicteda spy, and the Criminal Syndicalism Laws, which never convicted acriminal, were used savagely and with full force against the workers intheir struggle for better conditions. By means of newspaper-made warhysteria the profiteers of Big Business entrenched themselves in publicopinion. By posing as "100% Americans" (how stale and trite the phrase hasbecome from their long misuse of it!) these social parasites sought toconvince the nation that they, and not the truly American unionists whosebacks they were trying to break, were working for the best interests ofthe American people. Our form of government, forsooth, must be saved. Ourinstitutions must be rescued from the clutch of the "reds." Thus was thewar-frenzy of their dupes lashed to madness and the guarantees of theconstitution suspended as far as the working class was concerned.So all the good, wise and noisy men of the nation were induced by diversemeans to cry out against the strikers and their union. The worst passionsof the respectable people were appealed to. The hoarse blood-cry of themob was raised. It was echoed and re-echoed from press and pulpit. Thevery air quivered from its reverberations. Lynching parties became"respectable." Indictments were flourished. Hand-cuffs flashed. Theclinking feet of workers going to prison rivaled the sound of the soldiersmarching to war. And while all this was happening, a certain paunchylittle English Jew with moth-eaten hair and blotchy jowls the accreditedhead of a great labor union glared through his thick spectacles and noddedhis perverse approval. But the lumber trust licked its fat lips and leeredat its swollen dividends. All was well and the world was being made "safefor democracy!"[Illustration: Britt SmithAmerican. Logger. 35 years old. Had followed the woods for twenty years.Smith made his home in the hall that was raided and was secretary of theUnion. When the mob broke into the jail and seized Wesley Everest totorture and lynch him they cried, "We've got Britt Smith!" Smith was theman they wanted and it was to break his neck that ropes were carried inthe "parade." Not until Everest's body was brought back to the city jailwas it discovered that the mob had lynched the wrong man.]Autocracy vs. UnionismThis unprecedented struggle was really a test of strength betweenindustrial autocracy and militant unionism. The former was determined torestore the palmy days of peonage for all time to come, the latter tofight to the last ditch in spite of hell and high water. The lumber trustsought to break the strike of the loggers and destroy their organization.In the ensuing fracas the lumber barons came out only second best--andthey were bad losers. After the war-fever had died down--one year afterthe signing of the Armistice--they were still trying in Centralia toattain their ignoble ends by means of mob violence.But at this time the ranks of the strikers were unbroken. The heads of theloggers were "bloody but unbowed." Even at last, when compelled to yieldto privation and brute force and return to work, they turned defeat tovictory by "carrying the strike onto the job." As a body they refused towork more than eight hours. Secretary of War Baker and President Wilsonhad both vainly urged the lumber interests to grant the eight hour day.The determined industrialists gained this demand, after all else hadfailed, by simply blowing a whistle when the time was up. Most of theirother demands were won as well. In spite of even the Disque despotism,mattresses, clean linen and shower baths were reluctantly granted as thefruits of victory.But even as these lines are written the jails and prisons of America arefilled to overflowing with men and women whose only crime is loyalty tothe working class. The war profiteers are still wallowing in luxury. Nonehas ever been placed behind the bars. Before he was lynched in Butte,Frank Little had said, "I stand for the solidarity of labor." That wasenough. The vials of wrath were poured on his head for no other reason.And for no other reason was the hatred of the employing class directed atthe valiant hundreds who now rot in prison for longer terms than thosemeted out to felons. William Haywood and Eugene Debs are behind steel barstoday for the same cause. The boys at Centralia were conspired againstbecause they too stood "for the solidarity of labor." It is simply lyingand camouflage to attempt to trace such persecutions to any other source.These are things America will be ashamed of when she comes to her senses.Such gruesome events are paralleled in no country save the Germany ofKaiser Wilhelm or the Russia of the Czar.This picture of labor persecution in free America--terrible but true--willserve as a background for the dramatic history of the events leading up tothe climactic tragedy at Centralia on Armistice Day, 1919.While in Washington...All over the state of Washington the mobbing, jailing and tar andfeathering of workers continued the order of the day until long after thecessation of hostilities in Europe. The organization had always urged anddisciplined its members to avoid violence as an unworthy weapon. Usuallythe loggers have left their halls to the mercy of the mobs when they knewa raid was contemplated. Centralia is the one exception. Here the outragesheaped upon them could be no longer endured.In Yakima and Sedro Woolley, among other places in 1918, union men werestripped of their clothing, beaten with rope ends and hot tar applied tothe bleeding flesh. They were then driven half naked into the woods. A manwas hanged at night in South Montesano about this time and another hadbeen tarred and feathered. As a rule the men were taken unaware beforebeing treated in this manner. In one instance a stationary delegate of theIndustrial Workers of the World received word that he was to be"decorated" and rode out of town on a rail. He slit a pillow open andplaced it in the window with a note attached stating that he knew of theplan; would be ready for them, and would gladly supply his own feathers.He did not leave town either on a rail or otherwise.In Seattle, Tacoma and many other towns, union halls and print shops wereraided and their contents destroyed or burned. In the former city in 1919,men, women and children were knocked insensible by policemen anddetectives riding up and down the sidewalks in automobiles, striking toright and left with "billy" and night stick as they went. These wereaccompanied by auto trucks filled with hidden riflemen and an armored tankbristling with machine guns. A peaceable meeting of union men was beingdispersed.[Illustration: Loren RobertsAmerican. Logger. 19 years old. Loren's mother said of him at the trial:"Loren was a good boy, he brought his money home regularly for threeyears. After his father took sick he was the only support for his fatherand me and the three younger ones." The father was a sawyer in a mill anddied of tuberculosis after an accident had broken his strength. This boy,the weakest of the men on trial, was driven insane by the unspeakable"third degree" administered in the city jail. One of the lumber trustlawyers was in the jail at the time Roberts signed his so-called"confession." "Tell him to quit stalling," said a prosecutor toVanderveer, when Roberts left the witness stand. "You cur!" replied thedefense attorney in a low voice, "you know who is responsible for thisboy's condition." Roberts was one of the loggers on Seminary Hill.]In Centralia, Aberdeen and Montesano, in Grays Harbor County, the strugglewas more local but not less intense. No fewer than twenty-five loggers ondifferent occasions were taken from their beds at night and treated to tarand feathers. A great number were jailed for indefinite periods onindefinite charges. As an additional punishment these were frequentlylocked in their cells and the fire hose played on their drenched andshivering bodies. "Breech of jail discipline" was the reason given forthis "cruel and unusual" form of lumber trust punishment.In Aberdeen and Montesano there were several raids and many deportationsof the tar and feather variety. In Aberdeen in the fall of 1917 during a"patriotic" parade, the battered hall of the union loggers was againforcibly entered in the absence of its owners. Furniture, office fixtures,Victrola and books were dumped into the street and destroyed. In the townof Centralia, about a year before the tragedy, the Union Secretary waskidnapped and taken into the woods by a mob of well dressed business men.He was made to "run the gauntlet" and severely beaten. There was a strongsentiment in favor of lynching him on the spot, but one of the mobobjected saying it would be "too raw." The victim was then escorted to theoutskirts of the city and warned not to return under pain of usualpenalty. On more than one occasion loggers who had expressed themselves infavor of the Industrial Workers of the World, were found in the morningdangling from trees in the neighborhood. No explanation but that of"suicide" was ever offered. The whole story of the atrocities perpetratedduring these days of the White Terror, in all probability, will never bepublished. The criminals are all well known but their influence is toopowerful to ever make it expedient to expose their crimes. Besides, whowould care to get a gentleman in trouble for killing a mere "Wobbly"? Thefew instances noted above will, however, give the reader some slight ideaof the gruesome events that were leading inevitably to that grim day inCentralia in November, 1919.Weathering the StormThrough it all the industrialists clung to their Red Cards and to the OneBig Union for which they had sacrificed so much. Time after time, withincomparable patience, they would refurnish and reopen their beleagueredhalls, heal up the wounds of rope, tar or "billy" and proceed with thework of organization as though nothing had happened. With union cards orcredentials hidden in their heavy shoes they would meet secretly in thewoods at night. Here they would consult about members who had been mobbed,jailed or killed, about caring for their families--if they had any--aboutcarrying on the work of propaganda and laying plans for the futureprogress of their union. Perhaps they would take time to chant a rebelsong or two in low voices. Then, back on the job again to "line up theslaves for the New Society!"Through a veritable inferno of torment and persecution these men hadrefused to be driven from the woods or to give up their union--theIndustrial Workers of the World. Between the two dreadful alternatives ofpeonage or persecution they chose the latter--and the lesser. Can youimagine what their peonage must have been like?Sinister CentraliaBut Centralia was destined to be the scene of the most dramatic portion ofthe struggle between the entrenched interests and the union loggers. Herethe long persecuted industrialists made a stand for their lives and foughtto defend their own, thus giving the glib-tongued lawyers of theprosecution the opportunity of accusing them of "wantonly murderingunoffending paraders" on Armistice Day.Centralia in appearance is a creditable small American city--the kind ofcity smug people show their friends with pride from the rose-scentedtranquility of a super-six in passage. The streets are wide and clean, thebuildings comfortable, the lawns and shade trees attractive. Centralia issomewhat of a coquette but she is as sinister and cowardly as she ispretty. There is a shudder lurking in every corner and a nameless fearsucks the sweetness out of every breeze. Song birds warble at theoutskirts of the town but one is always haunted by the cries of the humanbeings who have been tortured and killed within her confines.A red-faced business man motors leisurely down the wet street. He shouts alaughing greeting to a well dressed group at the curb who respond in kind.But the roughly dressed lumberworkers drop their glances in passing oneanother. The Fear is always upon them. As these lines are written severalhundred discontented shingle-weavers are threatened with deportation ifthey dare to strike. They will not strike, for they know too well theconsequences. The man-hunt of a few months ago is not forgotten and theterror of it grips their hearts whenever they think of opposing the willof the Moloch that dominates their every move.Around Centralia are wooded hills; men have been beaten beneath them andlynched from their limbs. The beautiful Chehalis River flows near by;Wesley Everest was left dangling from one of its bridges. But Centralia isprovokingly pretty for all that. It is small wonder that the lumber trustand its henchmen wish to keep it all for themselves.Well tended roads lead in every direction, bordered with clearings ofworked out camps and studded with occasional tree stumps of great age andtruly prodigious size. At intervals are busy saw mills with thousands offeet of odorous lumber piled up in orderly rows. In all directionsstretches the pillared immensity of the forests. The vistas through thetrees seen enchanted rather than real--unbelievable green and of form anddepth that remind one of painted settings for a Maeterlinck fable ratherthan matter-of-fact timber land.The High Priests of Labor HatredPractically all of this land is controlled by the trusts; much of it bythe Eastern Railway and Lumber Company, of which F.B. Hubbard is the head.The strike of 1917 almost ruined this worthy gentleman. He has always beena strong advocate of the open shop, but during the last few years he haspermitted his rabid labor-hatred to reach the point of fanaticism. ThisHubbard figures prominently in Centralia's business, social and mobcircles. He is one of the moving spirits in the Centralia conspiracy. TheEastern Railway and Lumber Company, besides large tracts of land, ownssaw-mills, coal mines and a railway. The Centralia newspapers are itsmouthpieces while the Chamber of Commerce and the Elks' Club are itsgeneral headquarters. The Farmers' & Merchants' Bank is its localcitadel of power. In charge of this bank is a sinister character, oneUhlman, a German of the old school and a typical Prussian junker. At onetime he was an officer in the German army but at present is a "100%American"--an easy metamorphosis for a Prussian in these days. His nativeborn "brother-at-arms" is George Dysart whose son led the posses in theman-hunt that followed the shooting. In Centralia this bank and its Hundictator dominates the financial, political and social activities of thecommunity. Business men, lawyers, editors, doctors and local authoritiesall kow-tow to the institution and its Prussian president. And woe be toany who dare do otherwise! The power of the "interests" is a vengefulpower and will have no other power before it. Even the mighty arm of thelaw becomes palsied in its presence.[Illustration: Lumberworkers Union Hall, Raided in 1918The first of the two halls to be wrecked by Centralia's terrorists. Thispicture was not permitted to be introduced as evidence of the conspiracyto raid the new hall. Judge Wilson didn't want the jury to know anythingabout this event.]The Farmers' & Merchants' Bank is the local instrumentality of theinvisible government that holds the nation in its clutch. Kaiser Uhlmanhas more influence than the city mayor and more power than the policeforce. The law has always been a little thing to him and his clique. Theinscription on the shield of this bank is said to read "To hell with theConstitution; this is Lewis County." As events will show, this inspiringmaxim has been faithfully adhered to. One of the mandates of thisdelectable nest of highbinders is that no headquarters of the Union of thelumber workers shall ever be permitted within the sacred precincts of thecity of Centralia.The Loved and Hated Union HallNow the loggers, being denied the luxury of home and family life, have butthree places they can call "home." The bunkhouse in the camp, the cheaprooming house in town and the Union Hall. This latter is by far the bestloved of all. It is here the men can gather around a crackling wood fire,smoke their pipes and warm their souls with the glow of comradeship. Herethey can, between jobs or after work, discuss the vicissitudes of theirdaily lives, read their books and magazines and sing their songs ofsolidarity, or merely listen to the "tinned" humor or harmony of themuch-prized Victrola. Also they here attend to affairs of theirUnion--line up members, hold business and educational meetings and aweekly "open forum." Once in awhile a rough and wholesome "smoker" isgiven. The features of this great event are planned for weeks in advanceand sometimes talked about for months afterwards.[Illustration: The Scene of the Armistice Day TragedyThis is what was left of the Union hall the loggers tried to defend onNovember 11th. Three of the raiders, Grimm, McElfresh and Cassagranda,were killed in the immediate vicinity of the doorway. Several others werewounded while attempting to rush the doors.]These halls are at all times open to the public and inducements are madeto get workers to come in and read a thoughtful treatise on Industrialquestions. The latch-string is always out for people who care to listen toa lecture on economics or similar subjects. Inside the hall there isusually a long reading-table littered with books, magazines or papers. Ina rack or case at the wall are to be found copies of the "Seattle UnionRecord," "The Butte Daily Bulletin," "The New Solidarity," "The IndustrialWorker," "The Liberator," "The New Republic" and "The Nation." Alwaysthere is a shelf of thumb-worn books on history, science, economics andsocialism. On the walls are lithographs or engravings of noted championsof the cause of Labor, a few photographs of local interest and the monthlyBulletins and Statements of the Union. Invariably there is a blackboardwith jobs, wages and hours written in chalk for the benefit of men seekingemployment. There are always a number of chairs in the room and a roll topdesk for the secretary. Sometimes at the end of the hall is a plankrostrum--a modest altar to the Goddess of Free Speech and open discussion.This is what the loved and hated I.W.W. Halls are like--the halls thathave been raided and destroyed by the hundreds during the last threeyears.Remember, too, that in each of these raids the union men were not theaggressors and that there was never any attempt at reprisal. In spite ofthe fact that the lumber workers were within their legal right to keepopen their halls and to defend them from felonious attack, it had neverhappened until November 11, that active resistance was offered themarauders. This fact alone speaks volumes for the long-suffering patienceof the logger and for his desire to settle his problems by peaceable meanswherever possible. But the Centralia raid was the straw that broke thecamel's back. The lumber trust went a little too far on this occasion andit got the surprise of its life. Four of its misguided dupes paid fortheir lawlessness with their lives, and a number of others were wounded.There has not since been a raid on a union hall in the NorthwesternDistrict.It is well that workingmen and women throughout the country shouldunderstand the truth about the Armistice Day tragedy in Centralia and thecircumstances that led up to it. But in order to know why the hall wasraided it is necessary first to understand why this, and all similarhalls, are hated by the oligarchies of the woods.The issue contested is whether the loggers have the right to organizethemselves into a union, or whether they must remain chattels--mere hewersof wood and helpless in the face of the rapacity of their industrialoverlords--or whether they have the right to keep open their halls andpeacefully to conduct the affairs of their union. The lumber workerscontend that they are entitled by law to do these things and the employersassert that, law or no law, they shall not do so. In other words, it is aquestion of whether labor organization shall retain its foothold in thelumber industry or be "driven from the woods."Pioneers of UnionismIt is hard for workers in most of the other industries--especially in theEast--to understand the problems, struggles and aspirations of the huskyand unconquerable lumber workers of the Northwest. The reason is that theaverage union man takes his union for granted. He goes to his unionmeetings, discusses the affairs of his craft, industry or class, and hecarries his card--all as a matter of course. It seldom enters his mindthat the privileges and benefits that surround him and the protection heenjoys are the result of the efforts and sacrifices of the namelessthousands of pioneers that cleared the way. But these unknown heroes ofthe great struggle of the classes did precede him with their loyal heartsand strong hands; otherwise workers now organized would have to start thelong hard battle at the beginning and count their gains a step at a time,just as did the early champions of industrial organization, or as theloggers of the West Coast are now doing.The working class owes all honor and respect to the first men who plantedthe standard of labor solidarity on the hostile frontier of unorganizedindustry. They were the men who made possible all things that came afterand all things that are still to come. They were the trail blazers. It iseasier to follow them than to have gone before them--or with them. Theyestablished the outposts of unionism in the wilderness of Industrialautocracy. Their voices were the first to proclaim the burning message ofLabor's power, of Labor's mission and of Labor's ultimate emancipation.Their breasts were the first to receive the blows of the enemy; theirunprotected bodies were shielding the countless thousands to follow. Theywere the forerunners of the solidarity of Toil. They fought in a good andgreat cause; for without solidarity, Labor would have attained nothingyesterday, gained nothing today nor dare to hope for anything tomorrow.[Illustration: Seminary HallThe Union hall looks out on this hill, with Tower avenue and an alleybetween. It is claimed that loggers, among others Loren Roberts, BertBland and the missing Ole Hanson, fired at the attacking mob from thisposition.]The Block House and the Union HallIn the Northwest today the rebel lumberjack is a pioneer. Just as ourfathers had to face the enmity of the Indians, so are these men calledupon to face the fury of the predatory interests that have usurped therichest timber resources of the richest nation in the world. Just outsideCentralia stands a weatherbeaten landmark. It is an old, brown dilapidatedblock house of early days. In many ways it reminds one of the battered andwrecked union halls to be found in the heart of the city.The evolution of industry has replaced the block house with the union hallas the embattled center of assault and defense. The weapons are no longerthe rifle and the tomahawk but the boycott and the strike. The frontier isno longer territorial but industrial. The new struggle is as portentous asthe old. The stakes are larger and the warfare even more bitter.The painted and be-feathered scalp-hunter of the Sioux or Iroquois werenot more heartless in maiming, mutilating and killing their victims thanthe "respectable" profit-hunters of today--the type of men who conceivedthe raid on the Union Hall in Centralia on Armistice Day--and whofiendishly tortured and hanged Wesley Everest for the crime of defendinghimself from their inhuman rage. It seems incredible that such deeds couldbe possible in the twentieth century. It is incredible to those who havenot followed in the bloody trail of the lumber trust and who are notfamiliar with its ruthlessness, its greed and its lust for power.As might be expected the I.W.W. Halls in Washington were hated by thelumber barons with a deep and undying hatred. Union halls were a standingchallenge to their hitherto undisputed right to the complete domination ofthe forests. Like the blockhouses of early days, these humble meetingplaces were the outposts of a new and better order planted in thestronghold of the old. And they were hated accordingly. The thieves whohad invaded the resources of the nation had long ago seized the woods andstill held them in a grip of steel. They were not going to tolerate theencroachments of the One Big Union of the lumber workers. Events willprove that they did not hesitate at anything to achieve their purposes.The First Centralia HallIn the year 1918 a union hall stood on one of the side streets inCentralia. It was similar to the halls that have just been described. Thiswas not, however, the hall in which the Armistice Day tragedy took place.You must always remember that there were two halls raided in Centralia;one in 1918 and another in 1919. The loggers did not defend the first halland many of them were manhandled by the mob that wrecked it. The loggersdid defend the second and were given as reward a hanging, a speedy, fairand impartial conviction and sentences of from 25 to 40 years. No memberof the mob has ever been punished or even taken to task for this misdeed.Their names are known to everybody. They kiss their wives and babies atnight and go to church on Sundays. People tip their hats to them on thestreet. Yet they are a greater menace to the institutions of this countrythan all the "reds" in the land. In a world where Mammon is king the kingcan do no wrong. But the question of "right" or "wrong" did not concernthe lumber interests when they raided the Union hall in 1918. "Yes, weraided the hall, what are you going to do about it," is the position theytake in the matter.During the 1917 strike the two lumber trust papers in Centralia, the "Hub"and the "Chronicle" were bitter in their denunciation of the strikers.Repeatedly they urged that most drastic and violent measures be taken bythe authorities and "citizens" to break the strike, smash the union andpunish the strikers. The war-frenzy was at its height and these miserablesheets went about their work like Czarist papers inciting a pogrom. Thelumber workers were accused of "disloyalty," "treason,""anarchy"--anything that would tend to make their cause unpopular. TheAbolitionists were spoken about in identical terms before the civil war.As soon as the right atmosphere for their crime had been created theemployers struck and struck hard.It was in April, 1918. Like many other cities in the land Centralia wasconducting a Red Cross drive. Among the features of this event were abazaar and a parade.The profits of the lumber trust were soaring to dizzy heights at this timeand their patriotism was proportionately exalted.There was the usual brand of hypocritical and fervid speechmaking. Theflag was waved, the Government was lauded and the Constitution praised.Then, after the war-like proclivities of the stay-at-home heroes had beensufficiently worked upon; flag, Government and Constitution were forgottenlong enough for the gang to go down the street and raid the "wobbly" hall.Dominating the festivities was the figure of F.B. Hubbard, at that timePresident of the Employers' Association of the State of Washington. Thisis neither Hubbard's first nor last appearance as a terrorist andmob-leader--usually behind the scenes, however, or putting in a lastminute appearance.[Illustration: Avalon Hotel, CentraliaFrom this point Elsie Hornbeck claimed she identified Eugene Barnett inthe open window with a rifle. Afterwards she admitted that heridentification was based only on a photograph shown her by theprosecution. This young lady nearly fainted on the witness stand whiletrying to patch her absurd story together.]The 1918 RaidIt had been rumored about town that the Union Hall was to be wrecked onthis day but the loggers at the hall were of the opinion that the businessmen, having driven their Secretary out of town a short time previously,would not dare to perpetrate another atrocity so soon afterwards. In thisthey were sadly mistaken.Down the street marched the parade, at first presenting no unusualappearance. The Chief of Police, the Mayor and the Governor of the Statewere given places of honor at the head of the procession. Company G of theNational Guard and a gang of broad-cloth hoodlums disguised as "Elks" madeup the main body of the marchers. But the crafty and unscrupulous Hubbardhad laid his plans in advance with characteristic cunning. The parade,like a scorpion, carried its sting in the rear.Along the main avenue went the guardsmen and the gentlemen of the ElksClub. So far nothing extraordinary had happened. Then the processionswerved to a side street. This must be the right thing for the line ofmarch had been arranged by the Chamber of Commerce itself. A couple ofblocks more and the parade had reached the intersection of First Streetand Tower Avenue. What happened then the Mayor and Chief of Policeprobably could not have stopped even had the Governor himself ordered themto do so. From somewhere in the line of march a voice cried out, "Let'sraid the I.W.W. Hall!" And the crowd at the tail end of the processionbroke ranks and leaped to their work with a will.In a short time the intervening block that separated them from the UnionHall was covered. The building was stormed with clubs and stones. Everywindow was shattered and every door was smashed, the very sides of thebuilding were torn off by the mob in its blind fury. Inside the rioterstore down the partitions and broke up chairs and pictures. The union menwere surrounded, beaten and driven to the street where they were forced towatch furniture, records, typewriter and literature demolished and burnedbefore their eyes. An American flag hanging in the hall, was torn down anddestroyed. A Victrola and a desk were carried to the street withconsiderable care. The former was auctioned off on the spot for thebenefit of the Red Cross. James Churchill, owner of a glove factory, wonthe machine. He still boasts of its possession. The desk was appropriatedby F.B. Hubbard himself. This was turned over to an expressman and cartedto the Chamber of Commerce. A small boy picked up the typewriter case andstarted to take it to a nearby hotel office. One of the terroristsdetected the act and gave warning. The mob seized the lad, took him to anearby light pole and threatened to lynch him if he did not tell themwhere books and papers were secreted which somebody said had been carriedaway by him. The boy denied having done this, but the hoodlums went intothe hotel, ransacked and overturned everything. Not finding what theywanted, they left a notice that the proprietor would have to take the signdown from his building in just twenty-four hours. Then the mob surgedaround the unfortunate men who had been found in the Union hall. Withcuffs and blows these were dragged to waiting trucks where they werelifted by the ears to the body of the machine and knocked prostrate one ata time. Sometimes a man would be dropped to the ground just after he hadbeen lifted from his feet. Here he would lay with ear drums bursting andwrithing from the kicks and blows that had been freely given. Like allsimilar mobs this one carried ropes, which were placed about the necks ofthe loggers. "Here's and I.W.W." yelled someone. "What shall we do withhim?" A cry was given to "lynch him!" Some were taken to the city jail andthe rest were dumped unceremoniously on the other side of the county line.Since that time the wrecked hall has remained tenantless and unrepaired.Grey and gaunt like a house in battle-scarred Belgium, it stands a mutetestimony of the labor-hating ferocity of the lumber trust. Repeatedefforts have since been made to destroy the remains with fire. The defensehad tried without avail to introduce a photograph of the ruin as evidenceto prove that the second hall was raided in a similar manner on ArmisticeDay, 1919. Judge Wilson refused to permit the jury to see either thephotographs or the hall. But in case of another trial...?Evidently the lumber trust thought it better to have all traces of itsprevious crime obliterated.The raid of 1918 did not weaken the lumber workers' Union in Centralia. Onthe contrary it served to strengthen it. But not until more than a yearhad passed were the loggers able to establish a new headquarters. Thishall was located next door to the Roderick Hotel on Tower Avenue, betweenSecond and Third Streets. Hardly was this hall opened when threats werecirculated by the Chamber of Commerce that it, like the previous one, wasmarked for destruction. The business element was lined up solid indenunciation of and opposition to the Union Hall and all that it stoodfor. But other anti-labor matters took up their attention and it was sometime before the second raid was actually accomplished.There was one rift in the lute of lumber trust solidarity in Centralia.Business and professional men had long been groveling in sycophanticservility at the feet of "the clique." There was only one notableexception.A Lawyer--and a ManA young lawyer had settled in the city a few years previous to theArmistice Day tragedy. Together with his parents and four brothers he hadleft his home in Minnesota to seek fame and fortune in the woods ofWashington. He had worked his way through McAlester College and the LawSchool of the University of Minnesota. He was young, ambitious, red-headedand husky, a loving husband and the proud father of a beautiful baby girl.Nature had endowed him with a dangerous combination of gifts,--a brilliantmind and a kind heart. His name was just plain Smith--Elmer Smith--and hecame from the old rugged American stock.Smith started to practice law in Centralia, but unlike his brotherattorneys, he held to the assumption that all men are equal under thelaw--even the hated I.W.W. In a short time his brilliant mind and kindheart had won him as much hatred from the lumber barons as love from thedown-trodden,--which is saying a good deal. The "interests" studied theyoung lawyer carefully for awhile and soon decided that he could beneither bullied or bought. So they determined to either break his spiritor to break his neck. Smith is at present in prison charged with murder.This is how it happened:Smith established his office in the First Guarantee Bank Building whichwas quite the proper thing to do. Then he began to handle law suits forwage-earners, which was altogether the reverse. Caste rules in Centralia,and Elmer Smith was violating its most sacred mandataries by giving the"working trash" the benefit of his talents instead of people really worthwhile.Warren O. Grimm, who was afterwards shot while trying to break into theUnion Hall with the mob, once cautioned Smith of the folly and danger ofsuch a course. "You'll get along all right," said he, "if you will come inwith us." Then he continued:"How would you feel if one of your clients would come up to you in public,slap you on the back and say 'Hello, Elmer?'""Very proud," answered the young lawyer.[Illustration: Elmer SmithAttorney at law. Old American stock--born on a homestead in North Dakota.By championing the cause of the "under-dog" in Centralia Smith broughtdown on himself the wrath of the lumber trust. He defended many union menin the courts, and at one time sought to prosecute the kidnappers of TomLassiter. Smith is the man Warren O. Grimm told would get along all right,"if you come in with us." He bucked the lumber trust instead and landed inprison on a trumped-up murder charge. Smith was found "not guilty" by thejury, but immediately re-arrested on practically the same charge. He isnot related to Britt Smith.][Illustration: Wesley EverestLogger. American (old Washington pioneer stock). Joined the IndustrialWorkers of the World in 1917. A returned soldier. Earnest, sincere, quiet,he was the "Jimmy Higgins" of the Centralia branch of the LumberworkersUnion. Everest was mistaken for Britt Smith, the Union secretary, whom themob had started out to lynch. He was pursued by a gang of terrorists andunmercifully manhandled. Later--at night--he was taken from the city jailand hanged to a bridge. In the automobile, on the way to the lynching, hewas unsexed by a human fiend--a well known Centralia business man--whoused a razor on his helpless victim. Even the lynchers were forced toadmit that Everest was the most "dead game" man they had ever seen.]Some months previous Smith had taken a case for an I.W.W. logger. He wonit. Other cases in which workers needed legal advice came to him. He tookthem. A young girl was working at the Centralia "Chronicle." She wasreceiving a weekly wage of three dollars which is in defiance of theminimum wage law of the state for women. Smith won the case. Also hecollected hundreds of dollars in back wages for workers whom the companieshad sought to defraud. Workers in the clutches of loan sharks wereextricated by means of the bankruptcy laws, hitherto only used by theirmasters. An automobile firm was making a practice of replacing Fordengines with old ones when a machine was brought in for repairs. One ofthe victims brought his case to Smith. and a lawsuit followed. This was anunheard-of proceeding, for heretofore such little business tricks had beenkept out of court by common understanding.A worker, formerly employed by a subsidiary of the Eastern Lumber &Railway Company, had been deprived of his wages on a technicality of thelaw by the corporation attorneys. This man had a large family and hardcircumstances were forced upon them by this misfortune. One of his littlegirls died from what the doctor called malnutrition--plain starvation.Smith filed suit and openly stated that the lawyers of the corporationwere responsible for the death of the child. The indignation of thebusiness and professional element blazed to white heat. A suit for libeland disbarment proceedings were started against him. Nothing could be donein this direction as Smith had not only justice but the law on his side.His enemies were waiting with great impatience for a more favorableopportunity to strike him down. Open threats were beginning to be heardagainst him.A Union lecturer came to town. The meeting was well attended. A vigilancecommittee of provocateurs and business men was in the audience. At theclose of the lecture those gentlemen started to pass the signal foraction. Elmer Smith sauntered down the aisle, shook hands with the speakerand told him he would walk to the train with him.The following morning the door to Smith's office was ornamented with acardboard sign. It read: "Are you an American? You had better say so.Citizens' Committee." This was lettered in lead pencil. Across the bottomwere scrawled these words: "No more I.W.W. meetings for you."In 1918 an event occurred which served further to tighten the noose aboutthe stubborn neck of the young lawyer. On this occasion the terrorists ofthe city perpetrated another shameful crime against the working class--andthe law.Blind Tom--A Blemish on AmericaTom Lassiter made his living by selling newspapers at a little stand on astreet corner. Tom is blind, a good soul and well liked by the loggers.But Tom has vision enough to see that there is something wrong with thehideous capitalist system we live under; and so he kept papers on salethat would help enlighten the workers. Among these were the "Seattle UnionRecord," "The Industrial Worker" and "Solidarity." To put it plainly, Tomwas a thorn in the side of the local respectability because of his modestefforts to make people thing. And his doom had also been sealed.Early in June the newsstand was broken into and all his clothing,literature and little personal belongings were taken to a vacant lot andburned. A warning sign was left on a short pole stuck in the ashes. Themessage, "You leave town in 24 hours, U.S. Soldiers, Sailors and Marines,"was left on the table in his room.With true Wobbly determination, Lassiter secured a new stock of papers andimmediately re-opened his little stand. About this time a Centraliabusiness man, J.H. Roberts by name, was heard to say "This man (Lassiter)is within his legal rights and if we can't do anything by law we'll takethe law into our own hands." This is precisely what happened.On the afternoon of June 30th, Blind Tom was crossing Tower Avenue withhesitating steps when, without warning, two business men seized hisgroping arms and yelled in his ear, "We'll get you out of town this time!"Lassiter called for help. The good Samaritan came along in the form of abrute-faced creature known as W.R. Patton, a rich property owner of thecity. This Christian gentleman sneaked up behind the blind man and lungedhim forcibly into a waiting Oakland automobile. The machine is owned byCornelius McIntyre who is said to have been one of the kidnapping party."Shut up or I'll smash your mouth so you can't yell," said one of hisassailants as Lassiter was forced, still screaming for help, into the car.Turning to the driver one of the party said, "Step on her and let's getout of here." About this time Constable Luther Patton appeared on thescene. W.R. Patton walked over to where the constable stood and shouted tothe bystanders, "We'll arrest the first person that objects, interferes orgets too loud.""A good smash on the jaw would do more good," suggested the kind-heartedofficial."Well, we got that one pretty slick and now there are two more we have toget," stated W.R. Patton, a short time afterwards.Blind Tom was dropped helpless in a ditch just over the county line. Hewas picked up by a passing car and eventually made his way to Olympia,capital of the state. In about a week he was back in Centralia. But beforehe could again resume his paper selling he was arrested on a charge of"criminal syndicalism." He is now awaiting conviction at Chehalis.Before his arrest, however, Lassiter engaged Elmer Smith as his attorney.Smith appealed to County Attorney Herman Allen for protection for hisclient. After a half-hearted effort to locate the kidnappers--who wereknown to everybody--this official gave up the task saying he was "Too busyto bother with the affair, and, besides, the offense was only 'thirddegree assault' which is punishable with a fine of but one dollar andcosts." The young lawyer did not waste any more time with the Countyauthorities. Instead he secured sworn statements of the facts in the caseand submitted them to the Governor. These were duly acknowledged andplaced on file in Olympia. But up to date no action has been taken by theexecutive to prosecute the criminals who committed the crime."Handle these I.W.W. cases if you want to," said a local attorney to ElmerSmith, counsel for one of the banks, "but sooner or later they're allgoing to be hanged or deported anyway."[Illustration: Where Barnett's Rifle Was Supposed to Have Been FoundEugene Barnett was said to have left his rifle under this sign-board as hefled from the scene of the shooting. It would have been much easier tohide a gun in the tall brush in the foreground. In reality Barnett did nothave a rifle on November 11th and was never within a mile of this place.Prosecutor Cunningham said he had "been looking all over for that rifle"when it was turned over to him by a stool pigeon. Strangely enoughCunningham knew the number of the gun before he placed hands on it.]Smith was feathering a nest for himself--feathering it with steel andstone and a possible coil of hempen rope. The shadow of the prison barswas falling blacker on his red head with every passing moment. Hisfearless championing of the cause of the "under dog" had won him theimplacable hatred of his own class. To them his acts of kindness andhumanity were nothing less than treason. Smith had been ungrateful to theclique that had offered him every inducement to "come in with us". Alawyer with a heart is as dangerous as a working man with his brains.Elmer Smith would be punished all right; it would just be a matter oftime.The indifference of the County and State authorities regarding thekidnapping of blind Tom gave the terrorists renewed confidence in theefficacy and "legality" of their methods. Also it gave them a hint as tothe form their future depredations were to take. And so, with the impliedapproval of everyone worth considering, they went about their plottingwith still greater determination and a soothing sense of security.The Conspiracy DevelopsThe cessation of hostilities in Europe deprived the gangsters of the cloakof "patriotism" as a cover for their crimes. But this cloak was tooconvenient to be discarded so easily. "Let the man in uniform do it" wasan axiom that had been proved both profitable and safe. Then came theorganization of the local post of the American Legion and the now famousCitizen's Protective League--of which more afterwards.With the signing of the Armistice, and the consequent almost imperceptiblelifting of the White Terror that dominated the country, the organizationof the loggers began daily to gather strength. The Chamber of Commercebegan to growl menacingly, the Employers' Association to threaten and thelumber trust papers to incite open violence. And the American Legion beganto function as a "cats paw" for the men behind the scenes.Why should the beautiful city of Centralia tolerate the hated Union hallany longer? Other halls had been raided, men had been tarred and featheredand deported--no one had ever been punished! Why should the good citizensof Centralia endure a lumberworkers headquarters and their despised unionitself right in the midst of their peaceful community? Why indeed! Thematter appeared simple enough from any angle. So then and there theconspiracy was hatched that resulted in the tragedy on Armistice Day. Butthe forces at work to bring about this unhappy conclusion were far fromlocal. Let us see what these were like before the actual details of theconspiracy are recounted.There were three distinct phases of this campaign to "rid the woods of theagitators." These three phases dovetail together perfectly. Each one is aperfect part of a shrewdly calculated and mercilessly executed conspiracyto commit constructive murder and unlawful entry. The diabolical planitself was designed to brush aside the laws of the land, trample theConstitution underfoot and bring about an unparalleled orgy of unbridledlabor hatred and labor repression that would settle the question ofunionism for a long time.The Conspiracy--And a SnagFirst of all comes the propaganda stage with the full force of theeditorial virulence of the trust-controlled newspapers directed againstlabor in favor of "law and order," i.e., the lumber interests. All themachinery of newspaper publicity was used to vilify the lumber worker andto discredit his Union. Nothing was left unsaid that would tend to produceintolerance and hatred or to incite mob violence. This is not only true ofCentralia, but of all the cities and towns located in the lumber district.Centralia happened to be the place where the tree of anti-labor propagandafirst bore its ghastly fruit. Space does not permit us to quote thecountless horrible things the I.W.W. was supposed to stand for and to beconstantly planning to do. Statements from the lips of General Wood andyoung Roosevelt to the effect that citizens should not argue withBolshevists but meet them "head on" were very conspicuously displayed onall occasions. Any addle-headed mediocrity, in or out of uniform, who hadanything particularly atrocious to say against the labor movement ingeneral or the "radicals" in particular, was afforded every opportunity todo so. The papers were vying with one another in devising effectual, ifsomewhat informal, means of dealing with the "red menace."Supported by, and partly the result of this barrage of lies,misrepresentation and incitation, came the period of attempted repressionby "law". This was probably the easiest thing of all because the grip ofBig Business upon the law-making and law-enforcing machinery of the nationis incredible. At all events a state's "criminal syndicalism law" had beenconveniently passed and was being applied vigorously against union men,A.F. of L. and I.W.W. alike, but chiefly against the Lumber Workers'Industrial Union, No. 500, of the Industrial Workers of the World, thebasic lumber industry being the largest in the Northwest and the growingpower of the organized lumberjack being therefore more to be feared.[Illustration: His Uncle Planned ItDale Hubbard, killed in self-defense by Wesley Everest, Armistice Day,1919. F. Hubbard, a lumber baron and uncle of the dead man, is held tohave been the instigator of the plot in which his nephew was shot. Hubbardwas martyrized by the lumber trust's determination "to let the men inuniform do it."]No doubt the lumber interests had great hope that the execution of thesemade-to-order laws would clear up the atmosphere so far as the lumbersituation was concerned. But they were doomed to a cruel and surprisingdisappointment.A number of arrests were made in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana andeven Nevada. Fifty or sixty men all told were arrested and their trialsrushed as test cases. During this period from April 25th to October 28th,1919, the lumber trust saw with chagrin and dismay each of the state casesin turn either won outright by the defendants or else dismissed in therealization that it would be impossible to win them. By October 28thGeorge F. Vanderveer, chief attorney for the defense, declared there werenot a single member of the I.W.W. in custody in Washington, Idaho orMontana under this charge. In Seattle, Washington, an injunction wasobtained restraining the mayor from closing down the new Union hall inthat city under the new law. Thus it appeared that the nefarious plan ofthe employers and their subservient lawmaking adjuncts, to outlaw thelumber workers Union and to penalize the activities of its members, was tobe doomed to an ignominious failure.Renewed Efforts--Legal and OtherwiseFurious at the realization of their own impotency the "interests" launchedforth upon a new campaign. This truly machiavellian scheme was devised tomake it impossible for accused men to secure legal defense of any kind.All labor cases were to be tried simultaneously, thus making it impossiblefor the defendants to secure adequate counsel. George F. Russell,Secretary-Manager of the Washington Employers' Association, addressedmeetings over the state urging all Washington Prosecuting Attorneys toorganize that this end might be achieved. It is reported that GovernorHart, of Washington, looked upon the scheme with favor when it was broughtto his personal attention by Mr. Russell.However, the fact remains that the lumber trust was losing and that itwould have to devise even more drastic measures if it were to hope toescape the prospect of a very humiliating defeat. And, all the while theorganization of the lumber workers continued to grow.In Washington the situation was becoming more tense, momentarily. Manytowns in the heart of the lumber district had passed absurd criminalsyndicalism ordinances. These prohibited membership in the I.W.W.; made itunlawful to rent premises to the organization or to circulate itsliterature. The Employers' Association had boasted that it was due to itsefforts that these ordinances had been passed. But still they were facedwith the provocative and unforgettable fact, that the I.W.W. was no moredead than the cat with the proverbial nine lives. Where halls had beenclosed or raided the lumber workers were transacting their union affairsright on the job or in the bunkhouses, just as though nothing hadhappened. What was more deplorable a few Union halls were still open anddoing business at the same old stand. Centralia was one of these; drasticmeasures must be applied at once or loggers in other localities might beencouraged to open halls also. As events prove these measures weretaken--and they were drastic.The Employers Show Their FangsThat the Employers' Association was assiduously preparing its members foraction suitable for the situation is evidenced by the following quotationsfrom the official bulletin addressed privately "to Members of theEmployers' Association of Washington". Note them carefully; they arepublished as "suggestions to members" over the written signature of GeorgeF. Russell Secretary-Manager:June 25th, 1918.--"Provide a penalty for idleness ... Common labor nowworks a few days and then loafs to spend the money earned ... Activeprosecution of the I.W.W. and other radicals."April 30th, 1919.--"Keep business out of the control of radicals andI.W.W.... Overcome agitation ...

(!!!)[Illustration: Arthur McElfreshA Centralia druggist. His wife warned him not to march to the unionheadquarters because "she knew he'd get hurt." McElfresh is the man saidto have been shot inside the hall when the mob burst through the door.]December 31st, 1919. "Get rid of all the I.W.W. and all other un-Americanorganizations ... Deport the radicals or use the rope as at Centralia.Until we get rid of the I.W.W. and radicals we don't expect to do much inthis country ... Keep cleaning up on the I.W.W.... Don't let it die down... Keep up public sentiment..."These few choice significant morsels of one hundred percent (on thedollar) Americanism are quoted almost at random from the private bulletinsof the officials of the Iron Heel in the state of Washington. Here you canread their sentiments in their own words; you can see how dupes andhirelings were coached to perpetrate the crime of Centralia, and as manyother similar crimes as they could get away with. Needless to say theseilluminating lines were not intended for the perusal of the working class.But now that we have obtained them and placed them before your eyes youcan draw your own conclusion. There are many, many more records germane tothis case that we would like to place before you, but the Oligarchy hasclosed its steel jaws upon them and they are at present inaccessible. Menare still afraid to tell the truth in Centralia. Some day the workers maylearn the whole truth about the inside workings of the Centraliaconspiracy. Be that as it may the business interests of the Northwestlumber country stand bloody handed and doubly damned, black with guilt andfoul with crime; convicted before the bar of public opinion, by their ownstatements and their own acts.Failure and DesperationLet us see for a moment how the conspiracy of the lumber barons operatedto achieve the unlawful ends for which it was designed. Let us see howthey were driven by their own failure at intrigue to adopt methods sobrutal that they would have disgraced the head-hunter; how they tried togain with murder-lust what they had failed to gain lawfully and withpublic approval.The campaign of lies and slander inaugurated by their private newspapersfailed to convince the workers of the undesirability of labororganization. In spite of the armies of editors and news-whelps assembledto its aid, it served only to lash to a murderous frenzy the low instinctsof the anti-labor elements in the community. The campaign of legalrepression, admittedly instituted by the Employers' Association, failedalso in spite of the fact that all the machinery of the state fromdog-catcher down to Governor was at its beck and call on all occasions andfor all purposes.Having made a mess of things with these methods the lumber barons threwall scruples to the winds--if they ever had any--threw aside allpretension of living within the law. They started out, mad-dog like, torent, wreck and destroy the last vestige of labor organization from thewoods of the Northwest, and furthermore, to hunt down union men andmartyrize them with the club, the gun, the rope and the courthouse.It was to cover up their own crimes that the heartless beasts of BigBusiness beat the tom-toms of the press in order to lash the "patriotism"of their dupes and hirelings into hysteria. It was to hide their owninfamy that the loathsome war dance was started that developed perceptiblyfrom uncomprehending belligerency into the lawless tumult of mobs, raidsand lynching! And it will be an everlasting blot upon the fair name ofAmerica that they were permitted to do so.The Centralia tragedy was the culmination of a long series of unpunishedatrocities against labor. What is expected of men who have been treated asthese men were treated and who were denied redress or protection under thelaw? Every worker in the Northwest knows about the wrongs lumberworkershave endured--they are matters of common knowledge. It was commonknowledge in Centralia and adjoining towns that the I.W.W. hall was to beraided on Armistice Day. Yet eight loggers have been sentenced fromtwenty-five to forty years in prison for the crime of defending themselvesfrom the mob that set out to murder them! But let us see how theconspiracy was operating in Centralia to make the Armistice Day tragedyinevitable.The Maelstrom--And Four MenCentralia was fast becoming the vortex of the conspiracy that was rushingto its inevitable conclusion. Event followed event in rapid succession,straws indicating the main current of the flood tide of labor-hatred. TheCommercial Club was seething with intrigue like the court of old Franceunder Catherine de Medici; only this time it was Industrial Unionisminstead of Huguenots who were being Marked for a new night of St.Bartholomew. The heresy to be uprooted was belief in industrial instead ofreligious freedom; but the stake and the gibbet were awaiting the New Ideajust as they had the old.The actions of the lumber interests were now but thinly veiled and theirevil purpose all too manifest. The connection between the Employers'Association of the state and its local representatives in Centralia hadbecome unmistakably evident. And behind these loomed the giganticsilhouette of the Employers' Association of the nation--the colossal"invisible government"--more powerful at times than the Government itself.More and more stood out the naked brutal fact that the purpose of all thisplotting was to drive the union loggers from the city and to destroy theirhall. The names of the men actively interested in this movement came tolight in spite of strenuous efforts to keep them obscured. Four of thesestand out prominently in the light of the tragedy that followed: George F.Russell, F.B. Hubbard, William Scales and last, but not least, Warren O.Grimm.[Illustration: Warren O. GrimmWarren O. Grimm, killed at the beginning of the rush on the I.W.W. hall.At another raid on an I.W.W. hall in 1918 Grimm was said by witnesses tohave been leading the mob, "holding two American flags and dancing like awhirling dervish." His life-long friend, Frank Van Gilder, testified: "Istood less than two feet from Grimm when he was shot. He doubled up, puthis hands to his stomach and said to me: 'My God, I'm shot.'" "What did youdo then?" "I turned and left him."]The first named, George F. Russell, is a hired Manager for the WashingtonEmployers' Association, whose membership employs between 75,000 and 80,000workers in the state. Russell is known to be a reactionary of the mostpronounced type. He is an avowed union smasher and a staunch upholder ofthe open shop principle, which is widely advertised as the "American plan"in Washington. Incidentally he is an advocate of the scheme to importChinese and Japanese cooley labor as a solution of the "high wage andarrogant unionism" problem.F. B. Hubbard, is a small-bore Russell, differing from his chief only inthat his labor hatred is more fanatical and less discreet. Hubbard washard hit by the strike in 1917 which fact has evidently won him thesignificant title of "a vicious little anti-labor reptile." He is the manwho helped to raid the 1918 Union Hall in Centralia and who appropriatedfor himself the stolen desk of the Union Secretary. His nephew DaleHubbard was shot while trying to lynch Wesley Everest.William Scales is a Centralia business man and a virulent sycophant. He isa parochial replica of the two persons mentioned above. Scales was in theQuartermaster's Department down on the border during the trouble withMexico. Because he was making too much money out of Uncle Sam's groceries,he was relieved of his duties quite suddenly and discharged from theservice. He was fortunate in making France instead of Fort Leavenworth,however, and upon his return, became an ardent proselyte of Russell andHubbard and their worthy cause. Also he continued in the grocery business.[Illustration: Hizzoner, The JedgeIn his black robe, like a bird of prey, he perched above the courtroom andruled always adversely to the cause of labor. Appointed to try men accusedof killing other men whom he had previously eulogized Judge John M. Wilsondid not disappoint those who appointed him. In open court Vanderveer toldhim. In open court Vanderveer told this man: "There was a time when Ithought your rulings were due to ignorance of the law. That will no longerexplain them."]Warren O. Grimm came from a good family and was a small town aristocrat.His brother is city attorney at Centralia. Grimm was a lawyer, a collegeathlete and a social lion. He had been with the American forces in Siberiaand his chief bid for distinction was a noisy dislike for the Worker's& Peasants' Republic of Russia, and the I.W.W. which he termed the"American Bolsheviki". During the 1918 raid on the Centralia hall Grimm issaid to have been dancing around "like a whirling dervish" and waving theAmerican flag while the work of destruction was going on. Afterwards hebecame prominent in the American Legion and was the chief "cat's paw" forthe lumber interests who were capitalizing the uniform to gain their ownunholy ends. Personally he was a clean-cut modern young man.Shadows Cast BeforeOn June 26th, the following notice appeared conspicuously on the firstpage of the Centralia Hub:Meeting of Business Men Called for Friday Evening"Business men and property owners of Centralia are urged to attend ameeting tomorrow in the Chamber of Commerce rooms to meet the officers ofthe Employers' Association of the state to discuss ways and means ofbettering the conditions which now confront the business and propertyinterests of the state. George F. Russell, Secretary-Manager, says in hisnote to business men: 'We need your advice and your co-operation insupport of the movement for the defense of property and property rights.It is the most important question before the public today.'"At this meeting Mr. Russell dwelt on the statement that the "radicals"were better organized than the property interests. Also he pointed out theneed of a special organization to protect "rights of property" from theencroachments of all "foes of the government". The Non-Partisan League,the Triple Alliance and the A.F. of L. were duly condemned. The speakerthen launched out into a long tirade against the Industrial Workers of theWorld which was characterized as the most dangerous organization inAmerica and the one most necessary for "good citizens" to crush. Needlessto state the address was chock full of 100% Americanism. It amply made upin forcefulness anything it lacked in logic.So the "Citizens' Protective League" of Centralia was born. From the firstit was a law unto itself--murder lust wearing the smirk ofrespectability--Judge Lynch dressed in a business suit. The advent of thisinfamous league marks the final ascendancy of terrorism over theConstitution in the city of Centralia. The only things still needed were asecret committee, a coil of rope and an opportunity.F.B. Hubbard was the man selected to pull off the "rough stuff" and at thesame time keep the odium of crime from smirching the fair names of theconspirators. He was told to "perfect his own organization". Hubbard waseminently fitted for his position by reason of his intense labor-hatredand his aptitude for intrigue.The following day the Centralia Daily Chronicle carried the followingsignificant news item:BUSINESS MEN OF COUNTY ORGANIZERepresentatives From Many Communities Attend Meeting inChamber of Commerce, Presided Over Secretary of Employers' Association."The labor situation was thoroughly discussed this afternoon at a meetingheld in the local Chamber of Commerce which was attended by representativebusiness men from various parts of Lewis County."George F. Russell, Secretary of the Employers' Association, ofWashington, presided at the meeting."A temporary organization was effected with F. B. Hubbard, President ofthe Eastern Railway & Lumber Company, as chairman. He was empowered toperfect his own organization. A similar meeting will be held in Chehalisin connection with the noon luncheon of the Citizens' Club on that day."[Illustration: "Special Prosecutor"C.D. Cunningham, attorney for F.B. Hubbard and various lumber interests,took charge of the prosecution immediately. He was the father of much ofthe "third degree" methods used on witnesses. Vanderveer offered to proveat the trial that Cunningham was at the jail when Wesley Everest wasdragged out, brutally mutilated and then lynched.]The city of Centralia became alive with gossip and speculation about thisnew move on the part of the employers. Everybody knew that the whole thingcentered around the detested hall of the Union loggers. Curiosity seekersbegan to come In from all parts of the county to have a peep at this hallbefore it was wrecked. Business men were known to drive their friends fromthe new to the old hall in order to show what the former would look likein a short time. People in Centralia generally knew for a certainty thatthe present hall would go the way of its predecessor. It was just aquestion now as to the time and circumstances of the event.Warren O. Grimm had done his bit to work up sentiment against the unionloggers and their hall. Only a month previously--on Labor Day, 1919,--hehad delivered a "labor" speech that was received with great enthusiasm bya local clique of business men. Posing as an authority on Bolshevism onaccount of his Siberian service Grimm had elaborated on the dangers ofthis pernicious doctrine. With a great deal of dramatic emphasis he hadurged his audience to beware of the sinister influence of "the AmericanBolsheviki--the Industrial Workers of the World."A few days before the hall was raided Elmer Smith called at Grimm's officeon legal business. Grimm asked him, by the way, what he thought of hisLabor Day speech. Smith replied that he thought it was "rotten" and thathe couldn't agree with Grimm's anti-labor conception of Americanism. Smithpointed to the deportation of Tom Lassiter as an example of the"Americanism" he considered disgraceful. He said also that he thought freespeech was one of the fundamental rights of all citizens."I can't agree with you," replied Grimm. "That's the proper way to treatsuch a fellow."The New Black HundredOn October 19th the Centralia Hub published an item headed "EmployersCalled to Discuss Handling of 'Wobbly' Problem." This article urges allemployers to attend, states that the meeting will be held in the Elk'sClub and mentioned the wrecking of the Union Hall in 1918. On thefollowing day, October 20th, three weeks before the shooting, this meetingwas held at the hall of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks--thenow famous Elks' Club of Centralia. The avowed purpose of this meeting wasto "deal with the I.W.W. problem." The chairman was William Scales, atthat time Commander of the Centralia Post of the American Legion. TheI.W.W. Hall was the chief topic of discussion. F.B. Hubbard opened up bysaying that the I.W.W. was a menace and should be driven out of town.Chief of Police Hughes, however, cautioned them against such a course. Heis reported to have said that "the I.W.W. is doing nothing wrong inCentralia--is not violating any law--and you have no right to drive themout of town in this manner." The Chief of Police then proceeded to tellthe audience that he had taken up the matter of legally evicting theindustrialists with City Attorney C.E. Grimm, a brother of Warren O.Grimm, who is said to have told them, "Gentlemen, there is no law by whichyou can drive the I.W.W. out of town." City Commissioner Saunders andCounty Attorney Allen had spoken to the same effect. The latter, Allen,had gone over the literature of the organization with regard to violenceand destruction and had voluntarily dismissed a "criminal syndicalist"case without trial for want of evidence.[Illustration: Lewis County's Legal ProstituteHerman Allen, prosecuting attorney of Lewis County. He stood at the cornerduring the raid and received papers stolen from the hall. There is norecord of his having protested against any illegal action. He turned overhis office to the special Prosecutors and acted as their tool throughout.During the entire trial he never appeared as an active participant.]Hubbard was furious at this turn of affairs and shouted to Chief of PoliceHughes: "It's a damned outrage that these men should be permitted toremain in town! Law or no law, if I were Chief of Police they wouldn'tstay here twenty-four hours.""I'm not in favor of raiding the hall myself," said Scales. "But I'mcertain that if anybody else wants to raid the I.W.W. Hall there is nojury in the land will ever convict them."After considerable discussion the meeting started to elect a committee todeal with the situation. First of all an effort was made to get aworkingman elected as a member to help camouflage its very evidentcharacter and make people believe that "honest labor" was also desirous ofridding the town of the hated I.W.W. Hall. A switchman named Henry, amember of the Railway Brotherhood, was nominated. When he indignantlydeclined, Hubbard, red in the face with rage, called him a "damned skunk."The Inner CircleScales then proceeded to tell the audience in general and the cityofficials in particular that he would himself appoint a committee "whoseinner workings were secret," and see if he could not get around the matterthat way. The officers of the League were then elected. The President wasCounty Coroner David Livingstone, who afterwards helped to lynch WesleyEverest. Dr. Livingstone made his money from union miners. William Scaleswas vice president and Hubbard was treasurer. The secret committee wasthen appointed by Hubbard. As its name implies it was an undergroundaffair, similar to the Black Hundreds of Old Russia. No record of any ofits proceedings has ever come to light, but according to best availableknowledge, Warren O. Grimm, Arthur McElfresh, B.S. Cromier and one or twoothers who figured prominently in the raid, were members. At all events onNovember 6th, five days before the shooting, Grimm was elected Commanderof the Centralia Post of the American Legion, taking the place of Scales,who resigned in his favor. Scales evidently was of the opinion that aSiberian veteran and athlete was better fitted to lead the "shock troops"than a mere counter-jumper like himself. There is no doubt but the secretcommittee had its members well placed in positions of strategic importancefor the coming event.The following day the Tacoma News Tribune carried a significant editorialon the subject of the new organization:"At Centralia a committee of citizens has been formed that takes the mindback to the old days of vigilance committees of the West, which did somuch to force law-abiding citizenship upon certain lawless elements. It iscalled the Centralia Protective Association, and its object is to combatI.W.W. activities in that city and the surrounding country. It invites tomembership all citizens who favor the enforcement of law and order ... Itis high time for the people who do believe in the lawful and orderlyconduct of affairs to take the upper hand ... Every city and town might,with profit, follow Centralia's example."The reference to "law and orderly conduct of affairs" has taken a somewhatironical twist, now that Centralia has shown the world what she considerssuch processes to be.No less significant was an editorial appearing on the same Date in theCentralia Hub:"If the city is left open to this menace, we will soon find ourselves atthe mercy of an organized band of outlaws bent on destruction. What are wegoing to do about it?" And, referring to the organization of the "secretcommittee," the editorial stated: "It was decided that the inner workingsof the organization were to be kept secret, to more effectively combat abody using similar tactics." The editorial reeks with lies; but it wasnecessary that the mob spirit should be kept at white heat at all times.Newspaper incitation has never been punished by law, yet it is directlyresponsible for more murders, lynching and raids than any other one forcein America.[Illustration: The Stool PigeonTom Morgan, who turned state's evidence. There is an historical precedentfor Morgan. Judas acted similarly, but Judas later had the manhood to goout and hang himself. Morgan left for "parts unknown."]The Plot Leaks OutBy degrees the story of the infamous secret committee and its diabolicalplan leaked out, adding positive confirmation to the many already creditedrumors in circulation. Some of the newspapers quite openly hinted that theI.W.W. Hall was to be the object of the brewing storm. Chief of PoliceHughes told a member of the Lewis County Trades Council, William T.Merriman by name, that the business men were organizing to raid the halland drive its members out of town. Merriman, in turn carried the statementto many of his friends and brother unionists. Soon the prospective raidwas the subject of open discussion,--over the breakfast toast, on thestreet corners, in the camps and mills--every place.So common was the knowledge in fact that many of the craft organizationsin Centralia began to discuss openly what they should do about it. Theyrealized that the matter was one which concerned labor and many memberswanted to protest and were urging their unions to try to do something. Atthe Lewis County Trades Council the subject was brought up for discussionby its president, L. F. Dickson. No way of helping the loggers was found,however, if they would so stubbornly try to keep open their headquartersin the face of such opposition. Harry Smith, a brother of Elmer Smith, theattorney, was a delegate at this meeting and reported to his brother thediscussion that took place.Secretary Britt Smith and the loggers at the Union hall were not by anymeans ignorant of the conspiracy being hatched against them. Day by daythey had followed the development of the plot with breathless interest andnot a little anxiety. They knew from bitter experience how union men werehandled when they were trapped in their halls. But they would notentertain the idea of abandoning their principles and seeking personalsafety. Every logging camp for miles around knew of the danger also. Theloggers there had gone through the hell of the organization period and hadfelt the wrath of the lumber barons. Some of them felt that the statementof Secretary of Labor Wilson as to the attitude of the Industrial Workersof the World towards "overthrowing the government," and "violence anddestruction" would discourage the terrorists from attempting such aflagrant and brutal injustice as the one contemplated.[Illustration: "Oily" AbelSuave and slimy as a snake; without any of the kindlier traits of nature,W.H. Abel, sounded the gamut of rottenness in his efforts to convict theaccused men without the semblance of a fair trial. Abel is notoriousthroughout Washington as the hireling of the lumber interests. In 1917 heprosecuted "without fee" all laboring men on strike and is attorney forthe Cosmopolis "penitentiary" so called on account of the brutality withwhich it treats employes. Located in one of the small towns of the stateAbel has made a fortune prosecuting labor cases for the specialinterests.]Regarding the deportation of I.W.W.'s for belonging to an organizationwhich advocates such things, Secretary of Labor Wilson had stated a shorttime previously: "An exhaustive study into the by-laws and practices ofthe I.W.W. has thus far failed to disclose anything that brings it withinthe class of organizations referred to."Other of the loggers were buoyed up with the many victories won in thecourts on "criminal syndicalism" charges and felt that the raid would betoo "raw" a thing for the lumber interests even to consider. All weresecure in the knowledge and assurance that they were violating no law inkeeping open their hall. And they wanted that hall kept open.Of course the question of what was to be done was discussed at theirbusiness meetings. When news reached them on November 4th of thecontemplated "parade" they decided to publish a leaflet telling theCitizens of Centralia about the justice and legality of their position,the aims of their organization and the real reason for the intense hatredwhich the lumber trust harbored against them. Such leaflet was drawn up bySecretary Britt Smith and approved by the membership. It was an honest,outspoken appeal for public sympathy and support. This leaflet--word forword as it was printed and circulated in Centralia--is reprinted below:To the Citizens of Centralia We Must Appeal[Illustration: The Chief FinkFrank P. Christensen, who was the "fixer" for the prosecution. AsAssistant Attorney General he used his office to intimidate witnesses andin the effort to cover up actions of the mob. He is reported to have beenresponsible for the recovery and burial of Everest's body, saying: "We'vegot to bring in that body and bury it. If the wobs ever find out what wasdone and get it they'll raise hell and make capital of it."]"To the law abiding citizens of Centralia and to the working class ingeneral: We beg of you to read and carefully consider the following:"The profiteering class of Centralia have of late been waving the flag ofour country in an endeavor to incite the lawless element of our city toraid our hall and club us out of town. For this purpose they have inspirededitorials in the Hub, falsely and viciously attacking the I.W.W., hopingto gain public approval for such revolting criminality. These profiteersare holding numerous secret meetings to that end, and covertly invitingreturned service men to do their bidding. In this work they are ablyassisted by the bankrupt lumber barons of southwest Washington who led themob that looted and burned the I.W.W. hall a year ago."These criminal thugs call us a band of outlaws bent on destruction. Thisthey do in an attempt to hide their own dastardly work in burning our halland destroying our property. They say we are a menace; and we are a menaceto all mobocrats and pilfering thieves. Never did the I.W.W. burn publicor private halls, kidnap their fellow citizens, destroy their property,club their fellows out of town, bootleg or act in any ways aslaw-breakers. These patriotic profiteers throughout the country havefalsely and with out any foundation whatever charged the I.W.W. with everycrime on the statute books. For these alleged crimes thousands of us havebeen jailed in foul and filthy cells throughout this country, oftenwithout charge, for months and in some cases, years, and when releasedre-arrested and again thrust in jail to await a trial that is nevercalled. The only convictions of the I.W.W. were those under the espionagelaw, where we were forced to trial before jurors, all of whom were atpolitical and industrial enmity toward us, and in courts hostile to theworking class. This same class of handpicked courts and juries alsoconvicted many labor leaders, socialists, non-partisans, pacifists, guiltyof no crime save that of loyalty to the working class."By such courts Jesus the Carpenter was slaughtered upon the charge that'he stirreth up the people.' Only last month 25 I.W.W. were indicted inSeattle as strike leaders, belonging to an unlawful organization,attempting to overthrow the government and other vile things under thesyndicalist law passed by the last legislature. To exterminate the'wobbly' both the court and jury have the lie to every charge. The courtheld them a lawful organization and their literature was not disloyal norinciting to violence, though the government had combed the country fromChicago to Seattle for witnesses, and used every pamphlet taken from theirhall in government raids."In Spokane 13 members were indicted in the Superior Court for wearing theI.W.W. button and displaying their emblem. The jury unanimously acquittedthem and the court held it no crime."In test cases last month both in the Seattle and Everett Superior Courts,the presiding judge declared the police had no authority in law to closetheir halls and the padlocks were ordered off and the halls opened."Many I.W.W. in and around Centralia went to France and fought and bledfor the democracy they never secured. They came home to be threatened withmob violence by the law and order outfit that pilfered every nickelpossible from their mothers and fathers while they were fighting in thetrenches in the thickest of the fray."Our only crime is solidarity, loyalty to the working class and justice tothe oppressed.""Let the Men in Uniform Do It"On November 6th, the Centralia Post of the American Legion met with acommittee from the Chamber of Commerce to arrange for a parade-another"patriotic" parade. The first anniversary of the signing of the armisticewas now but a few days distant and Centralia felt it incumbent uponherself to celebrate. Of course the matter was brought up rathercircumspectly, but knowing smiles greeted the suggestion. One business manmade a motion that the brave boys wear their uniforms. This was agreedupon.The line of march was also discussed. As the union hall was a little offthe customary parade route, Scales suggested that their course lead pastthe hall "in order to show them how strong we are." It was intimated thata command "eyes right" would be given as the legionaries and business menpassed the union headquarters. This was merely a poor excuse of the secretcommitteemen to get the parade where they needed it. But many innocent menwere lured into a "lynching bee" without knowing that they were being ledto death by a hidden gang of broad-cloth conspirators who were plotting atmurder. Lieutenant Cormier, who afterwards blew the whistle that was thesignal for the raid, endorsed the proposal of Scales as did Grimm andMcElfresh--all three of them secret committeemen.Practically no other subject but the "parade" was discussed at thismeeting. The success of the project was now assured for it had placed intothe hands of the men who alone could arrange to "have the men in uniformdo it." The men in uniform had done it once before and people knew what toexpect.The day following this meeting the Centralia Hub published an announcementof the coming event stating that the legionaires had "voted to wearuniforms." The line of march was published for the first time. Any doubtsabout the real purpose of the parade vanished when people read that theprecession was to march from the City Park to Third street and Toweravenue and return. The union hall was on Tower between Second and Thirdstreets, practically at the end of the line of march and plainly theobjective of the demonstrators.[Illustration: Bridge from which Everest Was HangedFrom this bridge, over the Chehalis river, Wesley Everest was leftdangling by a mob of business men. Automobile parties visited this spot atdifferent times during the night and played their headlights on the corpsein order better to enjoy the spectacle.]"Decent Labor"--Hands Off!A short time after the shooting a virulent leaflet was issued by theMayor's office stating that the "plot to kill had been laid two or threeweeks before the tragedy," and that "the attack (of the loggers) waswithout justification or excuse." Both statements are bare faced lies. Themeeting was held the 6th and the line of march made public of the 7th. Theloggers could not possibly have planned a week and a half previously toshoot into a parade they knew nothing about and whose line of march hadnot yet been disclosed. It was proved in court that the union men armedthemselves at the very last moment, after everything else had failed andthey had been left helpless to face the alternative of being driven out oftown or being lynched.About this time eyewitnesses declare coils of rope were being purchased ina local hardware store. This rope is all cut up into little pieces now andmost of it is dirty and stained. But many of Centralia's best familiesprize their souvenir highly. They say it brings good luck to a family.A few days after the meeting just described William Dunning, vicepresident of the Lewis County Trades and Labor Assembly, met Warren Grimmon the street. Having fresh in his mind a recent talk about the raid inthe Labor Council meetings, and being well aware of Grimm's standing andinfluence, Dunning broached the subject."We've been discussing the threatened raid on the I.W.W. hall," he said."Who are you, an I.W.W.?" asked Grimm.Dunning replied stating that he was vice president of the Labor Assemblyand proceeded to tell Grimm the feeling of his organization on thesubject."Decent labor ought to keep its hands off," was Grimm's laconic reply.The Sunday before the raid a public meeting was held in the union hall.About a hundred and fifty persons were in the audience, mostly working menand women of Centralia. A number of loggers were present, dressed in theinvariable mackinaw, stagged overalls and caulked shoes. John Foss, anI.W.W. ship builder from Seattle, was the speaker. Secretary Britt Smithwas chairman. Walking up and down the isle, selling the union's pamphletsand papers was a muscular and sun-burned young man with a rough, honestface and a pair of clear hazel eyes in which a smile was always twinkling.He wore a khaki army coat above stagged overalls of a slightly darkershade,--Wesley Everest, the ex-soldier who was shortly to be mutilated andlynched by the mob."I Hope to Jesus Nothing Happens"The atmosphere of the meeting was already tainted with the Terror. Nerveswere on edge. Every time any newcomer would enter the door the audiencewould look over their shoulders with apprehensive glances. At theconclusion of the meeting the loggers gathered around the secretary andasked him the latest news about the contemplated raid. For reply BrittSmith handed them copies of the leaflet "We Must Appeal" and told of theefforts that had been made and were being made to secure legal protectionand to let the public know the real facts in the case."If they raid the hall again as they did in 1918 the boys won't stand forit," said a logger."If the law won't protect us we've got a right to protect ourselves,"ventured another."I hope to Jesus nothing happens," replied the secretary.Wesley Everest laid down his few unsold papers, rolled a brown papercigarette and smiled enigmatically over the empty seats in the generaldirection of the new One Big Union label on the front window. His closestfriends say he was never afraid of anything in all his life.None of these men knew that loggers from nearby camps, having heard of thepurchase of the coils of rope, were watching the hall night and day to seethat "nothing happens."The next day, after talking things over with Britt Smith, Mrs. McAllister,wife of the proprietor of the Roderick hotel from whom the loggers rentedthe hall, went to see Chief of Police Hughes. This is how she told of theinterview:"I got worried and I went to the Chief. I says to him 'Are you going toprotect my property?' Hughes says, 'We'll do the best we can for you, butas far as the wobblies are concerned they wouldn't last fifteen minutes ifthe business men start after them. The business men don't want anywobblies in this town.'"The day before the tragedy Elmer Smith dropped in at the Union hall towarn his clients that nothing could now stop the raid. "Defend it if youchoose to do so," he told them. "The law gives you that right."It was on the strength of this remark, overheard by the stool-pigeon,Morgan, and afterwards reported to the prosecution, that Elmer Smith washailed to prison charged with murder in the first degree. His enemies hadbeen certain all along that his incomprehensible delusion about the lawbeing the same for the poor man as the rich would bring its ownpunishment. It did; there can no longer be any doubt on the subject.[Illustration: Carting Away Wesley Everest's Body for BurialAfter the mutilated body had been cut down in laid in the river for twodays. Then it was taken back to the city jail where it remained for twodays more--as an object lesson--in plain view of the comrades of themurdered boy. Everest was taken from this building to be lynched. Duringthe first week after the tragedy this jail witnessed scenes of torture andhorror that equaled the worst days of the Spanish inquisition.]The Scorpion's StingNovember 11th was a raw, gray day; the cold sunlight barely penetratingthe mist that hung over the city and the distant tree-clad hills. The"parade" assembled at the City Park. Lieutenant Cormier was marshal.Warren Grimm was commander of the Centralia division. In a very short timehe had the various bodies arranged to his satisfaction. At the head of theprocession was the "two-fisted" Centralia bunch. This was followed by onefrom Chehalis, the county seat, and where the parade would logically havebeen held had its purpose been an honest one. Then came a few sailors andmarines and a large body of well dressed gentlemen from the Elks. Theschool children who were to have marched did not appear. At the very endwere a couple of dozen boy scouts and an automobile carrying pretty girlsdressed in Red Cross uniforms. Evidently this parade, unlike the one of1918, did not, like a scorpion, carry its sting in the rear. But waituntil you read how cleverly this part of it had been arranged!The marchers were unduly silent and those who knew nothing of the lawlessplan of the secret committee felt somehow that something must be wrong.City Postmaster McCleary and a wicked-faced old man named Thompson wereseen carrying coils of rope. Thompson is a veteran of the Civil War and aminister of God. On the witness stand he afterwards swore he picked up therope from the street and was carrying it "as a joke." It turned out thatthe "joke" was on Wesley Everest."Be ready for the command 'eyes right' or 'eyes left' when we pass the'reviewing stand'," Grimm told the platoon commanders just as the paradestarted.The procession covered most of the line of march without incident. Whenthe union hall was reached there was some craning of necks but no outburstof any kind. A few of the out-of-town paraders looked at the placecuriously and several business men were seen pointing the hall out totheir friends. There were some dark glances and a few long noses but nodemonstration."When do we reach the reviewing stand?" asked a parader, named Joe Smith,of a man marching beside him."Hell, there ain't any reviewing stand," was the reply. "We're going togive the wobbly hall 'eyes right' on the way back."The head of the columns reached Third avenue and halted. A command of'about face' was given and the procession again started to march past theunion hall going in the opposite direction. The loggers inside feltgreatly relieved as they saw the crowd once more headed for the city. Butthe Centralia and Chehalis contingents, that had headed the parade, wasnow in the rear--just where the "scorpion sting" of the 1918 parade hadbeen located! The danger was not yet over."Let's go! At 'em, boys!"The Chehalis division had marched past the hall and the Centralia divisionwas just in front of it when a sharp command was given. The latter stoppedsquarely in front of the hall but the former continued to march.Lieutenant Cormier of the secret committee was riding between the twocontingents on a bay horse. Suddenly he placed his fingers to his mouthand gave a shrill whistle. Immediately there was a hoarse cry of "Let'sgo-o-o! At 'em, boys!" About sixty feet separated the two contingents atthis time, the Chehalis men still continuing the march. Cromier spurredhis horse and overtook them. "Aren't you boys in on this?" he shouted.At the words "Let's go," the paraders from both ends and the middle of theCentralia contingent broke ranks and started on the run for the unionheadquarters. A crowd of soldiers surged against the door. There was acrashing of glass and a splintering of wood as the door gave way. A few ofthe marauders had actually forced their way into the hall. Then there wasa shot, three more shots ... and a small volley. From Seminary hill andthe Avalon hotel rifles began to crack.[Illustration: Elks Club, CentraliaIt was here that the Centralia conspiracy was hatched and the notorious"secret committee" appointed to do the dirty work.]The mob stopped suddenly, astounded at the unexpected opposition. Out ofhundreds of halls that had been raided during the past two years this wasthe first time the union men had attempted to defend themselves. It hadevidently been planned to stampede the entire contingent into the attackby having the secret committeemen take the lead from both ends and themiddle. But before this could happen the crowd, frightened at the shotsstarted to scurry for cover. Two men were seen carrying the limp figure ofa soldier from the door of the hall. When the volley started they droppedit and ran. The soldier was a handsome young man, named Arthur McElfresh.He was left lying in front of the hall with his feet on the curb and hishead in the gutter. The whole thing had been a matter of seconds."I Had No Business Being There"Several men had been wounded. A pool of blood was widening in front of thedoorway. A big man in officer's uniform was seen to stagger away bentalmost double and holding his hands over his abdomen. "My God, I'm shot!"he had cried to the soldier beside him. This was Warren O. Grimm; theother was his friend, Frank Van Gilder. Grimm walked unassisted to therear of a nearby soft drink place from whence he was taken to a hospital.He died a short time afterwards. Van Gilder swore on the witness standthat Grimm and himself were standing at the head of the columns of"unoffending paraders" when his friend was shot. He stated that Grimm hadbeen his life-long friend but admitted that when his "life-long friend"received his mortal wound that he (Van Gilder), instead of acting like ahero in no man's land, had deserted him in precipitate haste. Too many eyewitnesses had seen Grimm stagger wounded from the doorway of the hall tosuit the prosecution. Van Gilder knew at which place Grimm had been shotbut it was necessary that he be placed at a convenient distance from thehall. It is reported on good authority that Grimm, just before he died inthe hospital, confessed to a person at his bedside: "It served me right, Ihad no business being there."A workingman, John Patterson, had come down town on Armistice Day with histhree small children to watch the parade. He was standing thirty-five feetfrom the door of the hall when the raid started. On the witness standPatterson told of being pushed out of the way by the rush before theshooting began. He saw a couple of soldiers shot and saw Grimm staggeraway from the doorway wounded in the abdomen. The testimony of Dr.Bickford at the corner's inquest under oath was as follows:"I spoke up and said I would lead if enough would follow, but before Icould take the lead there were many ahead of me. Someone next to me puthis foot against the door and forced it open, after which a shower ofbullets poured through the opening about us." Dr. Bickford is an A.E.F.man and one of the very few legionaires who dared to tell the truth aboutthe shooting. The Centralia business element has since tried repeatedly toruin him.In trying to present the plea of self defense to the court, Defenseattorney Vanderveer stated:"There was a rush, men reached the hall under the command of Grimm, andyet counsel asks to have shown a specific overt act of Grimm before we canpresent the plea of self-defense. Would he have had the men wait withtheir lives at stake? The fact is that Grimm was there and in defendingthemselves these men shot. Grimm was killed because he was there. Theycould not wait. Your honor, self defense isn't much good after a man isdead."The prosecution sought to make a point of the fact that the loggers hadfired into a street in which there were innocent bystanders as well asparaders. But the fact remains that the only men hit by bullets were thosewho were in the forefront of the mob.Through the Hall WindowHow the raid looked from the inside of the hall can best be described fromthe viewpoint of one of the occupants, Bert Faulkner, a union logger andex-service man. Faulkner described how he had dropped in at the hall onArmistice Day and stood watching the parade from the window. In words allthe more startling for their sheer artlessness he told of the events whichfollowed: First the grimacing faces of the business men, then as thesoldiers returned, a muffled order, the smashing of the window, with thesplinters of glass falling against the curtain, the crashing open of thedoor ... and the shots that "made his ears ring," and made him run forshelter to the rear of the hall, with the shoulder of his overcoat tornwith a bullet. Then how he found himself on the back stairs covered withrifles and commanded to come down with his hands in the air. Finally howhe was frisked to the city jail in an automobile with a business manstanding over him armed with a piece of gas pipe.Eugene Barnett gave a graphic description of the raid as he saw it fromthe office of the adjoining Roderick hotel. Barnett said he saw the linego past the hotel. The business men were ahead of the soldiers and as thisdetachment passed the hotel returning the soldiers still were going north.The business men were looking at the hall and pointing it out to thesoldiers. Some of them had their thumbs to their noses and others weresaying various things.[Illustration: City Park, CentraliaAt this place the parade assembled that started out to raid the Union halland lynch its secretary.]"When the soldiers turned and came past I saw a man on horseback ridepast. He was giving orders which were repeated along the line by another.As the rider passed the hotel he gave a command and the second man said:'Bunch up, men!'"When this order came the men all rushed for the hall. I heard glassbreak. I heard a door slam. There was another sound and then shootingcame. It started from inside the hall."As I saw these soldiers rush the hall I jumped up and threw off my coat.I thought there would be a fight and I was going to mix in. Then came theshooting, and I knew I had no business there."Later Barnett went home and remained there until his arrest the next day.In the union hall, besides Bert Faulkner, were Wesley Everest, Roy Becker,Britt Smith, Mike Sheehan, James McInerney and the "stool pigeon," these,with the exception of Faulkner and Everest, remained in the hall until theauthorities came to place them under arrest. They had after the firstfurious rush of their assailants, taken refuge in a big and long disusedice box in the rear of the hall. Britt Smith was unarmed, his revolverbeing found afterwards, fully loaded, in his roll-top desk. After theirarrest the loggers were taken to the city jail which was to be the sceneof an inquisition unparalleled in the history of the United States. Afterthis, as an additional punishment, they were compelled to face the farceof a "fair trial" in a capitalistic court.Wesley EverestBut Destiny had decided to spare one man the bitter irony of judicialmurder. Wesley Everest still had a pocket full of cartridges and aforty-four automatic that could speak for itself.This soldier-lumberjack had done most of the shooting in the hall. He heldoff the mob until the very last moment, and, instead of seeking refuge inthe refrigerator after the "paraders" had been dispersed, he ran out ofthe back door, reloading his pistol as he went. It is believed by manythat Arthur McElfresh was killed inside the hall by a bullet fired byEverest.In the yard at the rear of the hall the mob had already reorganized for anattack from that direction. Before anyone knew what had happened Everesthad broken through their ranks and scaled the fence. "Don't follow me andI won't shoot," he called to the crowd and displaying the still smokingblue steel pistol in his hand."There goes the secretary!" yelled someone, as the logger started at topspeed down the alley. The mob surged in pursuit, collapsing the boardfence before them with sheer force of numbers. There was a rope in thecrowd and the union secretary was the man they wanted. The chase thatfollowed probably saved the life, not only of Britt Smith, but theremaining loggers in the hall as well.Running pell-mell down the alley the mob gave a shout of exaltation asEverest slowed his pace and turned to face them. They stopped cold,however, as a number of quick shots rang out and bullets whistled andzipped around them. Everest turned in his tracks and was off again like aflash, reloading his pistol as he ran. The mob again resumed the pursuit.The logger ran through an open gateway, paused to turn and again fire athis pursuers; then he ran between two frame dwellings to the open street.When the mob again caught the trail they were evidently under theimpression that the logger's ammunition was exhausted. At all events theytook up the chase with redoubled energy. Some men in the mob had riflesand now and then a pot-shot would be taken at the fleeing figure. Themarksmanship of both sides seems to have been poor for no one appears tohave been injured.Dale HubbardThis kind of running fight was kept up until Everest reached the river.Having kept off his pursuers thus far the boy started boldly for thecomparative security of the opposite shore, splashing the water violentlyas he waded out into the stream. The mob was getting closer all the time.Suddenly Everest seemed to change his mind and began to retrace his stepsto the shore. Here he stood dripping wet in the tangled grasses to awaitthe arrival of the mob bent on his destruction. Everest had lost his hatand his wet hair stuck to his forehead. His gun was now so hot he couldhardly hold it and the last of his ammunition was in the magazine. Eyewitnesses declare his face still wore a quizzical, half bantering smilewhen the mob overtook him. With the pistol held loosely in his rough handEverest stood at bay, ready to make a last stand for his life. Seeing himthus, and no doubt thinking his last bullet had been expended, the mobmade a rush for its quarry."Stand back!" he shouted. "If there are 'bulls' in the crowd, I'll submitto arrest; otherwise lay off of me."[Illustration: Blind Tom LassiterTom Lassiter is the blind news dealer who Was kidnapped and deported outof town in June, 1919, by a gang of business men. His stand was raided andthe contents burned in the street. He had been selling The Seattle UnionRecord, The Industrial Worker and Solidarity. County attorney Allen saidhe couldn't help to apprehend the criminals and would only charge themwith third degree assault if they were found. The fine would be one dollarand costs! Lassiter is now in jail in Chehalis charged with "criminalsyndicalism."]No attention was paid to his words. Everest shot from the hip fourtimes,--then his gun stalled. A group of soldiers started to run in hisdirection. Everest was tugging at the gun with both hands. Raising itsuddenly he took careful aim and fired. All the soldiers but one waveredand stopped. Everest fired twice, both bullets taking effect. Two moreshots were fired almost point blank before the logger dropped hisassailant at his feet. Then he tossed away the empty gun and the mobsurged upon him.The legionaire who had been shot was Dale Hubbard, a nephew of F.B.Hubbard, the lumber baron. He was a strong, brave and misguided youngman--worthy of a nobler death."Let's Finish the Job!"Everest attempted a fight with his fists but was overpowered and severelybeaten. A number of men clamoured for immediate lynching, but sanercouncil prevailed for the time and he was dragged through the streetstowards the city jail. When the mob was half a block from this place the"hot heads" made another attempt to cheat the state executioner. A wave offury seemed here to sweep the crowd. Men fought with one another for achance to strike, kick or spit in the face of their victim. It was an orgyof hatred and blood-lust. Everest's arms were pinioned, blows, kicks andcurses rained upon him from every side. One business man clawed strips ofbleeding flesh from his face. A woman slapped his battered cheek with awell groomed hand. A soldier tried to lunge a hunting rifle at thehelpless logger; the crowd was too thick. He bumped them aside with thebutt of the gun to get room. Then he crashed the muzzle with full forceinto Everest's mouth. Teeth were broken and blood flowed profusely.A rope appeared from somewhere. "Let's finish the job!" cried a voice. Therope was placed about the neck of the logger. "You haven't got guts enoughto lynch a man in the daytime," was all he said.At this juncture a woman brushed through the crowd and took the rope fromEverest's neck. Looking into the distorted faces of the mob she criedindignantly, "You are curs and cowards to treat a man like that!"There may be human beings in Centralia after all.Wesley Everest was taken to the city jail and thrown without ceremony uponthe cement floor of the "bull pen." In the surrounding cells were hiscomrades who had been arrested in the union hall. Here he lay in a wetheap, twitching with agony. A tiny bright stream of blood gathered at hisside and trailed slowly along the floor. Only an occasional quivering moanescaped his torn lips as the hours slowly passed by."Here Is Your Man"Later, at night, when it was quite dark, the lights of the jail weresuddenly snapped off. At the same instant the entire city was plunged indarkness. A clamour of voices was heard beyond the walls. There was ahoarse shout as the panel of the outer door was smashed in. "Don't shoot,men," said the policemen on guard, "Here is your man." It was night now,and the business men had no further reason for not lynching the supposedsecretary. Everest heard their approaching foot steps in the dark. Hearose drunkenly to meet them. "Tell the boys I died for my class," hewhispered brokenly to the union men in the cells. These were the lastwords he uttered in the jail. There were sounds of a short struggle and ofmany blows. Then a door slammed and, in a short time the lights wereswitched on. The darkened city was again illuminated at the same moment.Outside three luxurious automobiles were purring them selves out of sightin the darkness.The only man who had protested the lynching at the last moment was WilliamScales. "Don't kill him, men," he is said to have begged of the mob. Butit was too late. "If you don't go through with this you're an I.W.W. too,"they told him. Scales could not calm the evil passions he had helped toarouse.But how did it happen that the lights were turned out at such an opportunetime? Could it be that city officials were working hand in glove with thelynch mob?Defense Attorney Vanderveer offered to prove to the court that such wasthe case. He offered to prove this was a part of the greater conspiracyagainst the union loggers and their hall,--offered to prove it point bypoint from the very beginning. Incidentally Vanderveer offered to provethat Earl Craft, electrician in charge of the city lighting plant, hadleft the station at seven o'clock on Armistice day after securely lockingthe door; and that while Craft was away the lights of the city were turnedoff and Wesley Everest taken out and lynched. Furthermore, he offered toprove that when Craft returned, the lights were again turned on and thecity electrician, his assistant and the Mayor of Centralia were in thebuilding with the door again locked.These offers were received by his honor with impassive judicial dignity,but the faces of the lumber trust attorneys were wreathed with smiles atthe audacity of the suggestion. The corporation lawyers very politelyregistered their objections which the judge as politely sustained.The Night of HorrorsAfter Everest had been taken away the jail became a nightmare--as full ofhorrors as a madman's dream. The mob howled around the walls until late inthe night. Inside, a lumber trust lawyer and his official assistants wereadministering the "third degree" to the arrested loggers, to make them"confess." One at a time the men were taken to the torture chamber, and soterrible was the ordeal of this American Inquisition that some were almostbroken--body and soul. Loren Roberts had the light in his brain snuffedout. Today he is a shuffling wreck. He is not interested in things anymore. He is always looking around with horror-wide eyes, talking of"voices" and "wires" that no one but himself knows anything about. Thereis no telling what they did to the boy, but he signed the "confession."Its most incriminating statement must have contained too much truth forthe prosecution. It was never used in court.When interviewed by Frank Walklin of the Seattle Union Record the loggerstold the story in their own way:"I have heard tales of cruelty," said James McInerney, "but I believe whatwe boys went through on those nights can never be equaled. I thought itwas my last night on earth and had reconciled myself to an early death ofsome kind, perhaps hanging. I was taken out once by the mob, and a ropewas placed around my neck and thrown over a cross-bar or something."I waited for them to pull the rope. But they didn't. I heard voices inthe mob say, 'That's not him,' and then I was put back into the jail."John Hill Lamb, another defendant, related how several times a gun waspoked through his cell window by some one who was aching to get a pot shotat him. Being ever watchful he hid under his bunk and close to the wallwhere the would-be murderer could not see him.Britt Smith and Roy Becker told with bated breath about Everest as he layhalf-dead in the corridor, in plain sight of the prisoners in the cells onboth sides. The lights went out and Everest, unconscious and dying, wastaken out. The men inside could hear the shouts of the mob diminishing asEverest was hurried to the Chehalis River bridge.[Illustration: Bert BlandLogger. American. (Brother of O.C. Bland.) One of the men who fired fromSeminary Hill. Bland has worked all his life in the woods. He joined theIndustrial Workers of the World during the great strike of 1917. BertBland took to the hills after the shooting and was captured a week laterduring the man hunt.]None of the prisoners was permitted to sleep that night; the fear of deathwas kept upon them constantly, the voices outside the cell windows tellingof more lynchings to come. "Every time I heard a footstep or the clankingof keys," said Britt Smith, "I thought the mob was coming after more ofus. I didn't sleep, couldn't sleep; all I could do was strain my ears forthe mob I felt sure was coming." Ray Becker, listening at Britt's side,said: "Yes, that was one hell of a night." And the strain of that nightseems to linger in their faces; probably it always will remain--theexpression of a memory that can never be blotted out.When asked if they felt safer when the soldiers arrived to guard theCentralia jail, there was a long pause, and finally the answer was "Yes.""But you must remember," offered one, "that they took 'em out at Tulsafrom a supposedly guarded jail; and we couldn't know from where we werewhat was going on outside.""For ten days we had no blankets," said Mike Sheehan. "It was coldweather, and we had to sleep uncovered on concrete floors. In those tendays I had no more than three hours sleep.""The mob and those who came after the mob wouldn't let us sleep. Theywould come outside our windows and hurl curses at us, and tell each of usit would be our turn next. They brought in Wesley Everest and laid him onthe corridor floor; he was bleeding from his ears and mouth and nose, wascurled in a heap and groaning. And men outside and inside kept up the din.I tried to sleep; I was nearly mad; my temples kept pounding likesledge-hammers. I don't know how a man can go through all that andlive--but we did."All through the night the prisoners could hear the voices of the mob undertheir cell windows. "Well, we fixed that guy Everest all right," some onewould say. "Now we'll get Roberts." Then the lights would snap off, therewould be a shuffling, curses, a groan and the clanking of a steel door.All the while they were being urged to "come clean" with a statement thatwould clear the lumber trust of the crime and throw the blame onto itsvictims. McInerney's neck was scraped raw by the rope of the mob but herepeatedly told them to "go to hell!" Morgan, the stool-pigeon, escapedthe torture by immediate acquiescence. Someone has since paid his fare Toparts unknown. His "statement" didn't damage the defense.[Illustration: Ray BeckerLogger, American born. Twenty-five years of age.

Defendedhimself inside the hall with an Ivor Johnson, 38, until his ammunition wasexhausted. He surrendered to the authorities--not the mob.]The Human FiendBut with the young logger who had been taken out into the night thingswere different. Wesley Everest was thrown, half unconscious, into thebottom of an automobile. The hands of the men who had dragged him therewere sticky and red. Their pant legs were sodden from rubbing against thecrumpled figure at their feet. Through the dark streets sped the threemachines. The smooth asphalt became a rough road as the suburbs werereached. Then came a stretch of open country, with the Chehalis riverbridge only a short distance ahead. The cars lurched over the uneven roadwith increasing speed, their headlights playing on each other or on thedarkened highway.Wesley Everest stirred uneasily. Raising himself slowly on one elbow heswung weakly with his free arm, striking one of his tormentors full in theface. The other occupants immediately seized him and bound his hands andfeet with rope. It must have been the glancing blow from the fist of thelogger that gave one of the gentlemen his fiendish inspiration. Reachingin his pocket he produced a razor. For a moment he fumbled over the nowlimp figure in the bottom of the car. His companions looked on with stolidacquiescence. Suddenly there was a piercing scream of pain. The figuregave a convulsive shudder of agony. After a moment Wesley Everest said ina weak voice: "For Christ's sake, men; shoot me--don't let me suffer likethis."On the way back to Centralia, after the parade rope had done Its deadlywork, the gentlemen of the razor alighted from the car in front of acertain little building. He asked leave to wash his hands. They were asred as a butcher's. Great clots of blood were adhering to his sleeves."That's about the nastiest job I ever had to do," was his casual remark ashe washed himself in the cool clear water of the Washington hills. Thename of this man is known to nearly everybody in Centralia. He is still atlarge.The headlight of the foremost car was now playing on the slender steelframework of the Chehalis river bridge. This machine crossed over andstopped, the second one reached the middle of the bridge and stopped whilethe third came to a halt when it had barely touched the plankwork on thenear side. The well-dressed occupants of the first and last cars alightedand proceeded at once to patrol both approaches to the bridge.Lynching--An American InstitutionWesley Everest was dragged out of the middle machine. A rope was attachedto a girder with the other end tied in a noose around his neck. His almostlifeless body was hauled to the side of the bridge. The headlights of twoof the machines threw a white light over the horrible scene. Just as thelynchers let go of their victim the fingers of the half dead logger clungconvulsively to the planking of the bridge. A business man stamped on themwith a curse until the grip was broken. There was a swishing sound; then asudden crunching jerk and the rope tied to the girder began to writhe andtwist like a live thing. This lasted but a short time. The lynchers peeredover the railing into the darkness. Then they slowly pulled up the deadbody, attached a longer rope and repeated the performance. This did notseem to suit them either, so they again dragged the corpse through therailings and tied a still longer rope around the horribly broken neck ofthe dead logger. The business men were evidently enjoying their work, andbesides, the more rope the more souvenirs for their friends, who wouldprize them highly.This time the knot was tied by a young sailor. He knew how to tie a goodknot and was proud of the fact. He boasted of the stunt afterwards to aman he thought as beastly as himself. In all probability he never dreamedhe was talking for publication. But he was.The rope had now been lengthened to about fifteen feet. The broken andgory body was kicked through the railing for the last time. The knot onthe girder did not move any more. Then the lynchers returned to theirluxurious cars and procured their rifles. A headlight flashed the danglingfigure into ghastly relief. It was riddled with volley after volley. Theman who fired the first shot boasted of the deed afterwards to a brotherlodge member. He didn't know he was talking for publication either.On the following morning the corpse was cut down by an unknown hand. Itdrifted away with the current. A few hours later Frank Christianson, atool of the lumber trust from the Attorney General's office, arrived inCentralia. "We've got to get that body," this worthy official declared,"or the wobs will find it and raise hell over its condition."The corpse was located after a search. It was not buried, however, butcarted back to the city jail, there to be used as a terrible object lessonfor the benefit of the incarcerated union men. The unrecognizable form wasplaced in a cell between two of the loggers who had loved the lynched boyas a comrade and a friend. Something must be done to make the union menadmit that they, and not the lumber interests, had conspired to commitmurder. This was the final act of ruthlessness. It was fruitful inresults. One "confession," one Judas and one shattered mind were theresult of their last deed of fiendish terrorism.[Illustration: The Burial of the Mob's VictimNo undertaker would handle Everest's body. The autopsy was performed by aman from Portland, who hung the body up by the heels and played a hose onit. The men lowering the plank casket into the grave are Union loggers whohad been caught in the police drag net and taken from jail for thispurpose.]No undertaker could be found to bury Everest's body, so after two days itwas dropped into a hole in the ground by four union loggers who had beenarrested on suspicion and were released from jail for this purpose. The"burial" is supposed to have taken place in the new cemetery; the bodybeing carried thither in an auto truck. The union loggers who really dugthe grave declare, however, that the interment took place at a desolatespot "somewhere along a railroad track." Another body was seen, coveredwith ashes in a cart, being taken away for burial on the morning of thetwelfth. There are persistent rumors that more than one man was lynched onthe eve of Armistice day. A guard of heavily armed soldiers had charge ofthe funeral. The grave has since been obliterated. Rumor has it that thebody has since been removed to Camp Lewis. No one seems to know why orwhen."As Comical as a Corner"An informal inquest was held in the city jail. A man from Portlandperformed the autopsy, that is, he hung the body up by the heels andplayed a water hose on it. Everest was reported by the corner's jury tohave met his death at the hands of parties unknown. It was here that Dr.Bickford let slip the statement about the hall being raided before theshooting started. This was the first inkling of truth to reach the public.Coroner Livingstone, in a jocular mood, reported the inquest to a meetingof gentlemen at the Elks' Club. In explaining the death of the unionlogger, Dr. Livingstone stated that Wesley Everest had broken out of jail,gone to the Chehalis river bridge and jumped off with a rope around hisneck. Finding the rope too short he climbed back and fastened on a longerone; jumped off again, broke his neck and then shot himself full of holes.Livingstone's audience, appreciative of his tact and levity, laughed longand hearty. Business men still chuckle over the joke in Centralia. "Asfunny as a funeral" is no longer the stock saying in this humorous littletown; "as comical as a coroner" is now the approved form.The Man-HuntActing on the theory that "a strong offensive is the best defense," theterrorists took immediate steps to conceal all traces of their crime andto shift the blame onto the shoulders of their victims. The capitalistpress did yeoman service in this cause by deluging the nation with averitable avalanche of lies.For days the district around Centralia and the city itself were at themercy of a mob. The homes of all workers suspected of being sympathetic toLabor were spied upon or surrounded and entered without warrant. Doorswere battered down at times, and women and children abused and insulted.Heavily armed posses were sent out in all directions in search of "reds."All roads were patrolled by armed business men in automobiles. A strictmail and wire censorship was established. It was the open season for"wobblies" and intimidation was the order of the day. The White Terror wassupreme.An Associated Press reporter was compelled to leave town hastily withoutbag or baggage because he inadvertently published Dr. Bickford'sindiscreet remark about the starting of the trouble. Men and women did notdare to think, much less think aloud. Some of them in the district arestill that way.To Eugene Barnett's little home came a posse armed to the teeth. Theyasked for Barnett and were told by his young wife that he had gone up thehill with his rifle. Placing a bayonet to her breast they demandedentrance. The brave little woman refused to admit them until they hadshown a warrant. Barnett surrendered when he had made sure he was to bearrested and not mobbed.O.C. Bland, Bert Bland, John Lamb and Loren Roberts were also apprehendedin due time. Two loggers, John Doe Davis and Ole Hanson, who were said tohave also fired on the mob, have not yet been arrested. A vigorous searchis still being made for them in all parts of the country. It is believedby many that one of these men was lynched like Everest on the night ofNovember 11th.[Illustration: Court House at Montesano--And a Little "Atmosphere"The trial was held on the third floor of the building as you look at thepicture. The soldiers were sent for over the head of the judge by one ofthe lumber trust attorneys of the prosecution. Their only purpose was tocreate the proper "atmosphere" for an unjust conviction.]Hypocrisy and TerrorThe reign of terror was extended to cover the entire West coast. Over athousand men and women were arrested in the state of Washington alone.Union halls were closed and kept that way. Labor papers were suppressedand many men have been given sentences of from one to fourteen years forhaving in their possession copies of periodicals which contained littleelse but the truth about the Centralia tragedy. The Seattle Union Recordwas temporarily closed down and its stock confiscated for daring to hintthat there were two sides to the story. During all this time thecapitalist press was given full rein to spread its infamous poison. Thegeneral public, denied the true version of the affair, was shuddering overits morning coffee at the thought of I.W.W. desperadoes shooting downunoffending paraders from ambush. But the lumber interests were chortlingwith glee and winking a suggestive eye at their high priced lawyers whowere making ready for the prosecution. Jurymen were shortly to be drawnand things were "sitting pretty," as they say in poker.Adding a characteristic touch to the rotten hypocrisy of the situationcame a letter from Supreme Court Judge McIntosh to George Dysart, whoseson was in command of a posse during the manhunt. This remarkable documentis as follows:  Kenneth Mackintosh, Judge  The Supreme Court, State of Washington  Olympia.  George Dysart, Esq.,  Centralia, Wash.  My Dear Dysart:  November 13, 1919.  I want to express to you my appreciation of the high character of  citizenship displayed by the people of Centralia in their agonizing  calamity. We are all shocked by the manifestation of barbarity on the  part of the outlaws, and are depressed by the loss of lives of brave  men, but at the same time are proud of the calm control and loyalty to  American ideals demonstrated by the returned soldiers and citizens. I am  proud to be an inhabitant of a state which contains a city with the  record which has been made for Centralia by its law-abiding citizens.  Sincerely,  (Signed) Kenneth MacKintosh."Patriotic" Union SmashingNot to be outdone by this brazen example of judicial perversion, AttorneyGeneral Thompson, after a secret conference of prosecuting attorneys,issued a circular of advice to county prosecutors. In this document thesuggestion was made that officers and members of the Industrial Workers ofthe World in Washington be arrested by the wholesale under the "criminalsyndicalism" law and brought to trial simultaneously so that they mightnot be able to secure legal defense. The astounding recommendation wasalso made that, owing to the fact that juries had been "reluctant toconvict," prosecutors and the Bar Association should co-operate inexamining jury panels so that "none but courageous and patrioticAmericans" secure places on the juries.This effectual if somewhat arbitrary plan was put into operation at once.Since the tragedy at Centralia dozens of union workers have been convictedby "courageous and patriotic" juries and sentenced to serve from one tofourteen years in the state penitentiary. Hundreds more are awaitingtrial. The verdict at Montesano is now known to everyone. Truly the livesof the four Legion boys which were sacrificed by the lumber interests infurtherance of their own murderous designs, were well expended. Theinvestment was a profitable one and the results are no doubt highlygratifying.But just the same the despicable plot of the Attorney General is anobvious effort to defeat the purpose of the courts and obtain unjustconvictions by means of what is termed "jury fixing." There may be honoramong thieves but there is plainly none among the public servants theyhave working for them![Illustration: Mike SheenanBorn in Ireland. 64 years old. Has been a union man for over fifty years,having joined his grandfather's union when he was only eight. Has beenthrough many strikes and has been repeatedly black-hated, beaten and evenexiled. He was a stoker in the Navy during the Spanish War. Mike Sheehanwas arrested in the Union hall, went through the horrible experience inthe city jail and was found "not guilty" by the jury. Like Elmer Smith, hewas re-arrested on another similar charge and thrown back in jail.]The only sane note sounded during these dark days, outside of thestartling statement of Dr. Bickford, came from Montana. Edward Bassett,commander of the Butte Post of the American Legion and an over-seasveteran, issued a statement to the labor press that was truly remarkable:"The I.W.W. in Centralia, Wash., who fired upon the men that wereattempting to raid the I.W.W. headquarters, were fully justified in theiract."Mob rule in this country must be stopped, and when mobs attack the homeof a millionaire, of a laborer, or of the I.W.W., it is not only the rightbut the duty of the occupants to resist with every means in their power.If the officers of the law can not stop these raids, perhaps theresistance of the raided may have that effect."Whether the I.W.W. is a meritorious organization or not, whether it isunpopular or otherwise, should have absolutely nothing to do with thecase. The reports of the evidence at the coroner's jury show that theattack was made before the firing started. If that is true, I commend theboys inside for the action that they took."The fact that there were some American Legion men among the paraders whoeverlastingly disgraced themselves by taking part in the raid, does notaffect my judgment in the least. Any one who becomes a party to a mob bentupon unlawful violence, cannot expect the truly patriotic men of theAmerican Legion to condone his act."Vanderveer's Opening SpeechDefense Attorney George Vanderveer hurried across the continent fromChicago to take up the legal battle for the eleven men who had beenarrested and charged with the murder of Warren O. Grimm. The lumberinterests had already selected six of their most trustworthy tools asprosecutors. It is not the purpose of the present writer to give adetailed story of this "trial"--possibly one of the greatest travesties onjustice ever staged. This incident was a very important part of theCentralia conspiracy but a hasty sketch, such as might be portrayed inthese pages, would be an inadequate presentation at best. It might bewell, therefore, to permit Mr. Vanderveer to tell of the case as he toldit to the jury in his opening and closing arguments. Details of the trialitself can be found in other booklets by more capable authors.Vanderveer's opening address appears in part below:May it please the court and gentlemen of the jury:--As you have alreadysensed from our examination of you and from a question which I propoundedto counsel at the close of his statement yesterday, the big question inthis case is, who was the aggressor, who started the battle? Was it on theone side a deliberately planned murderous attack upon innocent marchers,or was it on the other side a deliberately planned wicked attack upon theI.W.W., which they merely resisted? That, I say, is the issue. I askedcounsel what his position would be in order that you might know it, andthat he said was his position, that he would stand and fall and be judgedby it, and I say to you now that is our position, and we will stand orfall and be judged by that issue.In order that you may properly understand this situation, and the thingsthat led up to it, the motives underlying it, the manner in which it wasplanned and executed, I want to go just a little way back of theoccurrence on November 11th, and state to you in rough outline thesituation that existed in Centralia, the objects that were involved inthis case, the things each are trying to accomplish and the way each wentabout it. There has been some effort on the part of the state to make itappear it is not an I.W.W. trial. I felt throughout that the I.W.W. issuemust come into this case, and now that they have made their openingstatement, I say unreservedly it is here in this case, not because we wantto drag it in here, but because it can't be left out. To conceal from yougentlemen that it is an I.W.W. issue would be merely to conceal the truthfrom you and we, on our part, don't want to do that now or at any timehereafter.The I.W.W. is at the bottom of this. Not as an aggressor, however. It is alabor organization, organized in Chicago in 1905, and it is because of thephilosophy for which it stands and because of certain tactics which itevolves that this thing arose.[Illustration: James McInerneyLogger. Born in County Claire, Ireland. Joined the Industrial Workers ofthe World in 1916. Was wounded on the steamer "Verona" when the lumbertrust tried to exterminate the union lumberworkers with bullets atEverett, Washington. McInerney was one of those trapped in the hall. Hesurrendered to officers of the law. While in the city jail his neck wasworn raw with a hangman's rope in an effort to make him "confess" that theloggers and not the mob had started the trouble. McInerney told them to"go to hell." He is Irish and an I.W.W. and proud of being both.]A Labor Movement on TrialThe I.W.W. is the representative in this country of the labor movement ofthe rest of the world It is the representative in the United States of theidea that capitalism is wrong: that no man has a right, moral orotherwise, to exploit his fellow men, the idea that our industrial effortsshould be conducted not for the profits of any individual but should beconducted for social service, for social welfare. So the I.W.W. saysfirst, that the wage system is wrong and that it means to abolish thatwage system. It says that it intends to do this, not by political action,not by balloting, but by organization on the industrial or economicalfield, precisely as employers, precisely as capital is organized on thebasis of the industry, not on the basis of the tool. The I.W.W. saysindustrial evolution has progressed to that point there the tool no longerenforces craftsmanship. In the place of a half dozen or dozen who wereemployed, each a skilled artisan, employed to do the work, you have amachine process to do that work and it resulted in the organization of theindustry on an industrial basis. You have the oil industry, controlled bythe Standard Oil; you have the lumber industry, controlled by theLumbermen's Association of the South and West, and you have the steel andcopper industry, all organized on an industrial basis resulting in afusing, or corporation, or trust of a lot of former owners. Now the I.W.W.say if they are to compete with our employers, we must compete with ouremployers as an organization, and as they are organized so we must protectour organization, as they protect themselves. And so they propose toorganize into industrial unions; the steel workers and the coal miners,and the transportation workers each into its own industrial unit.This plan of organization is extremely distasteful to the employersbecause it is efficient; because it means a new order, a new system in thelabor world in this country. The meaning of this can be gathered, in somemeasure, from the recent experiences in the steel strike of this country,where they acted as an industrial unit; from the recent experiences in thecoal mining industry, where they acted as an industrial unit. Instead ofhaving two or three dozen other crafts, each working separately, theyacted as an industrial unit. When the strike occurred it paralyzedindustry and forced concessions to the demands of the workers. That is thefirst thing the I.W.W. stands for and in some measure and in part explainsthe attitude capital has taken all over the country towards it.In the next place it says that labor should organize on the basis of somefundamental principle; and labor should organize for something more than amere bartering and dickering for fifty cents a day or for some shortertime, something of that sort. It says that the system is fundamentallywrong and must be fundamentally changed before you can look for someimprovement. Its philosophy is based upon government statistics which showthat in a few years in this country our important industries have creptinto more than two-thirds of our entire wealth. Seventy-five per cent ofthe workers in the basic industry are unable to send their children toschool. Seventy-one per cent of the heads of the families in our basicindustries are unable to provide a decent living for their familieswithout the assistance of the other members. Twenty-nine per cent of ourlaborers are able to live up to the myth that he is the head of thefamily. The results of these evils are manifold. Our people are not beingraised in decent vicinities. They are not being raised and educated. Theirhealth is not being cared for; their morals are not being cared for. Iwill show you that in certain of our industries where the wages are lowand the hours are long, that the children of the working people die at therate of 300 to 350 per thousand inhabitants under the age of one yearbecause of their undernourishment, lack of proper housing and lack ofproper medical attention and because the mothers of these children beforethey are born and when the children are being carried in the mother's wombthat they are compelled to go into the industries and work and work andwork, and before the child can receive proper nourishment the mother iscompelled to go back into the industry and work again. The I.W.W.'s saythere must be a fundamental change and that fundamental change must be inthe line of reorganization of industry, for public service, so that thepurpose shall be that we will work to live and not merely live to work.Work for service rather than work for profit.[Illustration: James McInerney(After he had undergone the "Third degree".)McInerney had a rope around his neck nearly all night before this picturewas taken. One end of the rope had been pulled taut over a beam by histormentors. McInerney had told them to "go to hell." "It's no use tryingto get anything out of a man like that," was the final decision of theinquisitors.]To Kill an Ideal...Some time in September, counsel told you, the I.W.W., holding thesebeliefs, opened a hall in Centralia. Back of that hall was a living room,where Britt Smith lived, kept his clothes and belongings and made hishome. From then on the I.W.W. conducted a regular propaganda meeting everySaturday night. These propaganda meetings were given over to a discussionof these industrial problems and beliefs. From that district there weredispatched into nearby lumber camps and wherever there were working peopleto whom to carry this message--there were dispatched organizers who wentout, made the talks in the camps briefly and sought to organize them intothis union, at least to teach them the philosophy of this labor movement.Because that propaganda is fatal to those who live by other people's work,who live by the profits they wring from labor, it excited intenseopposition on the part of employers and business people of Centralia andabout the time this hall was opened we will show you that people fromSeattle, where they maintain their headquarters for these labor fights,came into Centralia and held meetings. I don't know what they call thisnew thing they were seeking to organize--it is in fact a branch of theMerchants' and Manufacturers' Association of the United States, a nationalorganization whose sole purpose is to fight and crush and beat labor. Itwas in no sense a local movement because it started in Seattle and it wasorganized by people from Seattle, and the purpose was to organize inCentralia an organization of business men to combat this new laborphilosophy. Whether in the mouths of the I.W.W., or Nonpartisan League, orthe Socialists, it did not make any difference; to brand anybody as atraitor, un-American, who sought to tell the truth about our industrialconditions.The Two RaidsIn the fall of 1918, the I.W.W. had a hall two blocks and a half from thishall, at the corner of First and B streets. There was a Red Cross parade,and that hall was wrecked, just as was this hall. These profiteeringgentlemen never overlook an opportunity to capitalize on a patrioticevent, and so they capitalized the Red Cross parade that day just as theycapitalized the Armistice Day parade on November 11, and in exactly thesame way as on November 11.And that day, when the tail-end of the parade of the Red Cross passed themain avenue, it broke off and went a block out of its way and attacked theI.W.W. hall, a good two-story building. And they broke it into splinters.The furniture, records, the literature that belongs to these boys,everything was taken out into the street and burned.[Illustration: O. C. BlandLogger. American. Resident of Centralia for a number of years. Has workedin woods and mills practically all his life. Has a wife and sevenchildren. Bland was in the Arnold hotel at the time of the raid. He wasarmed but had cut his hand on broken glass before he had a chance toshoot. Since his arrest and conviction his family has undergone severehardships. The defense is making an effort to raise enough funds to keepthe helpless wives and children of the convicted men in the comforts oflife.]Now, what was contemplated on Armistice Day? The I.W.W. did as you woulddo; it judged from experience.Patience No Longer a VirtueWhen the paraders smashed the door in, the I.W.W.'s, as every lover offree speech and every respecter of his person--they had appealed to thecitizens, they had appealed to the officers, and some of their members hadbeen tarred and feathered, beaten up and hung--they said in thought:"Patience has ceased to be a virtue." And if the law will not protect us,and the people won't protect us, we will protect ourselves. And they did.And in deciding this case, I want each of you, members of the jury, to askyourself what would you have done?There had been discussions of this character in the I.W.W. hall, and sohave there been discussions everywhere. There had never been a plot laidto murder anybody, nor to shoot anybody in any parade. I want you to askyourself: "Why would anybody want to shoot anybody in a parade," and toparticularly ask yourself why anyone would want to shoot upon soldiers?He who was a soldier himself, Wesley Everest, the man who did most of theshooting, and the man whom they beat until he was unconscious and whomthey grabbed from the street and put a rope around his neck, the man whomthey nearly shot to pieces, and the man whom they hung, once dropping himten feet, and when what didn't kill him lengthened the rope to 15 feet anddropped him again--why would one soldier want to kill another soldier, orsoldiers, who had never done him nor his fellows any harm?I exonerate the American Legion as an organization of the responsibilityof this. For I say they didn't know about it. The day will come when theywill realize that they have been mere catspaws in the hands of theCentralia commercial interests. That is the story. I don't know what theverdict will be today, but the verdict ten years hence will be the verdictin the Lovejoy case; that these men were within their rights and that theyfought for a cause, that these men fought for liberty. They fought forthese things for which we stand and for which all true lovers of libertystand, and those who smashed them up are the real enemies of our country.This is a big case, counsel says, the biggest case that has ever beentried in this country, but the biggest thing about these big things isfrom beginning to end it has been a struggle on the one side for idealsand on the other side to suppress those ideals. This thing was startedwith Hubbard at its head. It is being started today with Hubbard at itshead in this courtroom, and I don't believe you will fall for it.Vanderveer's Closing ArgumentThere are only two real issues in this case. One is the question: Who wasthe aggressor in the Armistice Day affray? The other is: Was EugeneBarnett in the Avalon hotel window when that affray occurred?We have proven by unimpeachable witnesses that there was a raid on theI.W.W. hall in Centralia on November 11--a raid, in which the businessinterests of the city used members of the American Legion as catspaws. Wehave shown that Warren O. Grimm, for the killing of whom these defendantsare on trial, actually took park in that raid, and was in the very doorwayof the hall when the attack was made, despite the attempts of theprosecution to place Grimm 100 feet away when he was shot.We have proven a complete alibi for Eugene Barnett through unshaken andundisputable witnesses. He was not in the Avalon hotel during the riot; hewas in the Roderick hotel lobby; he had no gun and he took no part in theshooting.In my opening statement, I said I would stand or fall on the issue of: Whowas the aggressor on Armistice Day? I have stood by that promise, andstand by it now.Mr. Abel, specially hired prosecutor in this trial, made the same promise.So did Herman Allen, the official Lewis county prosecutor, who has been soingloriously shoved aside by Mr. Abel and his colleague, Mr. Cunningham,ever since the beginning here. But a few days ago, when the defense waspiling up evidence showing that there was a raid on the I.W.W. hall by theparaders, Mr. Abel backed down.Why Were the Shots Fired?I was careful in the beginning to put him on record on that point; allalong I knew that he and Mr. Allen would back down on the issue of who wasthe aggressor; they could not uphold their contention that the ArmisticeDay paraders were fired upon in cold blood while engaged in lawful andpeaceful action.What possible motive could these boys have had for firing upon innocentmarching soldiers? It is true that the marchers were fired upon; thatshots were fired by some of these defendants; but why were the shotsfired?[Illustration: John LambLogger. American. Joined the Industrial Workers of the World in 1917. Lambwas in the Arnold Hotel with O.C. Bland during the raid on the hall.Neither of them did any shooting. John Lamb has lived for years inCentralia. He is married and has five children who are left dependentsince the conviction.]There is only one reason why--they were defending their own legal propertyagainst unlawful invasion and attack; they were defending the dwellingplace of Britt Smith, their secretary.And they had full right to defend their lives and that property and thathome against violence or destruction; they had a right to use force, ifnecessary, to effect that defense. The law gives them that right; and itaccrues to them also from all of the wells of elementary justice.The law says that when a man or group of men have reason to fear attackfrom superior numbers, they may provide whatever protection they may deemnecessary to repel such an attack. And it says also that if a man who isin bad company when such an attack is made happens to be killed by thedefenders, those defenders are not to be considered guilty of that man'sdeath.So they had the troops come, to blow bugles and drill in the streets wherethe jury could see; their power, however wielded, was great enough tocause Governor Hart to send the soldiers here without consulting the trialjudge or the sheriff, whose function it was to preserve law and orderhere--and you know, I am sure, that law and order were adequatelypreserved here before the troops came."Fearful of the Truth"They tried the moth-eaten device of arresting our witnesses for allegedperjury, hoping to discredit those witnesses thus in your eyes becausethey knew they couldn't discredit them in any regular nor legitimate way.Fearful of the truth, the guilty ones at Centralia deliberately framed upevidence to save themselves from blame--to throw the responsibility forthe Armistice Day horror onto other men. But they bungled the frame-upbadly. No bolder nor cruder fabrication has ever been attempted than theridiculous effort to fasten the killing of Warren Grimm upon EugeneBarnett.[Illustration: Court Room in which the Farcical "Trial" Took PlaceThis garish room in the court house at Montesano was the scene of theattempted "judicial murder" that followed the lynching. The judge alwaysentered his chambers through the door under the word "Transgression": thejury always left through the door over which "Instruction" appears. Inthis room the lumber trust attorneys attempted to build a gallows ofperjured testimony on which to break the necks of innocent men.]These conspirators were clumsy enough in their planning to drive theI.W.W. out of town; their intent was to stampede the marching soldiersinto raiding the I.W.W. hall. But how much more clumsy was the frame-upafterward--the elaborate fixing of many witnesses to make it appear thatGrimm was shot at Tower avenue and Second street when he actually was shotin front of the hall; and to make it appear that Ben Casagranda and EarlWatts were shot around the corner on Second street, when they wereactually shot on Tower avenue, close to the front of the hall.These conspirators were clumsy enough in their planning to drive theI.W.W. out of town; their intent was to stampede the marching soldiersinto raiding the I.W.W. hall. But how much more clumsy was the frame-upafterward--the elaborate fixing of many witnesses to make it appear thatGrimm was shot at Tower avenue and Second street when he actually was shotin front of the hall; and to make it appear that Ben Casagranda and EarlWatts were shot around the corner on Second street, when they wereactually shot on Tower avenue, close to the front of the hall.Then, you will remember, I compelled Elsie Hornbeck to admit that she hadbeen shown photographs of Barnett by the prosecution. She would not havetold this fact, had I not trapped her into admitting it; that was obviousto everybody in this courtroom that day.You have heard the gentlemen of the prosecution assert that this is amurder trial, and not a labor trial. But they have been careful to ask allour witnesses whether they were I.W.W. members, whether they belonged toany labor union, and whether they were sympathetic towards workers ontrial for their lives. And when the answer to any of these questions wasyes, they tried to brand the witness as one not worthy of belief. Theirpolicy and thus browbeating working people who were called as witnesses isin keeping with the tactics of the mob during the days when it heldCentralia in its grasp.You know, even if the detailed story has been barred from the record, ofthe part F.R. Hubbard, lumber baron, played in this horror at Centralia.You have heard from various witnesses that the lumber mill owned byHubbard's corporation, the Eastern Railway and Lumber Company, is anotorious non-union concern. And you have heard it said that W.A. Abel,the special prosecutor here, has been an ardent and active labor-baiterfor years.Hubbard wanted to drive the I.W.W. out of Centralia. Why did he want todrive them out? He said they were a menace. And it is true that they werea menace, and are a menace--to those who exploit the workers who producethe wealth for the few to enjoy.Why Were Ropes Carried?Was there a raid on the hall before the shooting? Dr. Frank Bickford, areputable physician, appeared here and repeated under oath what he hadsworn to at the coroner's inquest--that when the parade stopped, heoffered to lead a raid on the hall if enough would follow,--but thatothers pushed ahead of him, forced open the door, and then the shots camefrom inside.And why did the Rev. H.W. Thompson have a rope? Thompson believes inhanging men by the neck until they are dead. When the state Employers'Association and others wanted the hanging law in Washington revived notlong ago, the Reverend Thompson lectured in many cities and towns inbehalf of that law. And he has since lectured widely against the I.W.W.Did he carry a rope in the parade because he owned a cow and a calf? Orwhat?Why did the prosecution need so many attorneys here, if it had the factsstraight? Why were scores of American Legion members imported here to sitat the trial at a wage of 4 per day and expenses?They have told you this was a murder trial, and not a labor trial. Butvastly more than the lives of ten men are the stakes in the big gamblehere; for the right of workers to organize for the bettering of their owncondition is on trial; the right of free assemblage is on trial; democracyand Americanism are on trial.In our opening statement, we promised to prove various facts; and we haveproven them, in the main; if there are any contentions about which theevidence remains vague, this circumstance exists only because His Honorhas seen fit to rule out certain testimony which is vital to the case, andwe believed, and still believe, was entirely material and properlyadmissible.But is there any doubt in your minds that there was a conspiracy to raidthe I.W.W. hall, and to run the Industrial Workers of the World out oftown? Even if the court will not allow you to read the handbill issued bythe I.W.W., asking protection from the citizens of Centralia have you anydoubt that the I.W.W. had reason to fear an attack from Warren Grimm andhis fellow marchers? And have you any doubt that there was a raid on thehall?When I came into this case I knew that we were up against tremendous odds.Terror was loose in Centralia; prejudice and hatred against the I.W.W. wasbeing systematically and sweepingly spread in Grays Harbor county andthroughout the whole Northwest; and intimidation or influence of some sortwas being employed against every possible witness and talesman.[Illustration: George VanderveerThis man single handed opposed six high priced lumber trust prosecutors inthe famous trial at Montesano. Vanderveer is a man of wide experience anddeep social vision. He was at one time prosecuting attorney for KingCounty, Washington. The lumber trust has made countless threats to "gethim." "A lawyer with a heart is as dangerous as a workingman withbrains."]Not only were unlimited money and other resources of the Lewis Countycommercial interests banded against us, but practically all the attorneysup and down the Pacific coast had pledged themselves not to defend anyI.W.W., no matter how great nor how small the charge he faced. Ourinvestigators were arrested without warrant; solicitors for our defensefund met with the same fate.And when the trial date approached, the judge before whom this case isbeing heard admitted that a fair trial could not be had here, because ofthe surging prejudice existent in this community. Then, five days later,the court announced that the law would not permit a second change ofvenue, and that the trial must go ahead in Montesano.In the face of these things, and in the face of all the atmosphere ofviolence and bloodthirstiness which the prosecution has sought to throwaround these defendants, I am placing our case in your hands; I amintrusting to you gentlemen to decide upon the fate of ten humanbeings--whether they shall live or die or be shut away from their fellowsfor months or years.But I am asking you much more than that--I am asking you to decide thefate of organized labor in the Northwest; whether its fundamental rightsare to survive or be trampled underfoot.The Lumber Trust Wins the JuryOn Saturday evening, March 13th, the jury brought in its final verdict ofguilty. In the face of the very evident ability of the lumber interests,to satisfy its vengeance at will, any other verdict would have beensuicidal--for the jury.The prosecution was out for blood and nothing less than blood. Day by daythey had built the structure of gallows right there in the courtroom. Theybuilt a scaffolding on which to hang ten loggers--built it of lies andthreats and perjury. Dozens of witnesses from the Chamber of Commerce andthe American Legion took the stand to braid a hangman's rope of untruthfultestimony. Some of these were members of the mob; on their white hands theblood of Wesley Everest was hardly dry. And they were not satisfied withsending their victims to prison for terms of from 25 to 40 years, theywanted the pleasure of seeing their necks broken. But they failed. Twoverdicts were returned; his honor refused to accept the first; nointelligent man can accept the second.Here is the way the two verdicts compare with each other: Elmer Smith andMike Sheehan were declared not guilty and Loren Roberts insane, in boththe first and second verdicts. Britt Smith, O.C. Bland, James McInerney,Bert Bland and Ray Becker were found guilty of murder in the second degreein both instances, but Eugene Barnett and John Lamb were at first declaredguilty of manslaughter, or murder "in the third degree" in the jury'sfirst findings, and guilty of second degree murder in the second.The significant point is that the state made its strongest argumentagainst the four men whom the jury practically exonerated of the charge ofconspiring to murder. More significant is the fact that the whole verdictcompletely upsets the charge of conspiracy to murder under which the menwere tried. The difference between first and second degree murder is thatthe former, first degree, implies premeditation while the other, seconddegree, means murder that is not premeditated. Now, how in the world canmen be found guilty of conspiring to murder without previouspremeditation? The verdict, brutal and stupid as it is, shows the weaknessand falsity of the state's charge more eloquently than anything thedefense has ever said about it.But Labor Says, "Not Guilty!"But another jury had been watching the trial. Their verdict came as asurprise to those who had read the newspaper version of the case. Nosooner had the twelve bewildered and frightened men in the jury box paidtribute to the power of the Lumber Trust with a ludicrous and tragicverdict than the six workingmen of the Labor Jury returned their verdictalso. Those six men represented as many labor organizations in the PacificNorthwest with a combined membership of many thousands of wage earners.The last echoes of the prolonged legal battle had hardly died away whenthese six men sojourned to Tacoma to ballot, deliberate and to reach theirdecision about the disputed facts of the case. At the very moment when thetrust-controlled newspapers, frantic with disappointment, were againraising the blood-cry of their pack, the frank and positive statement ofthese six workers came like a thunderclap out of a clear sky,--"NotGuilty!"The Labor Jury had studied the development of the case with earnestattention from the beginning. Day by day they had watched with increasingastonishment the efforts of the defense to present, and of the prosecutionand the judge to exclude, from the consideration of the trial jury, thethings everybody knew to be true about the tragedy at Centralia. Day byday the sordid drama had been unfolded before their eyes. Day by day theconviction had grown upon them that the loggers on trial for their liveswere being railroaded to the gallows by the legal hirelings of the LumberTrust. The Labor Jury was composed of men with experience in the labormovement. They had eyes to see through a maze of red tape and legalmummery to the simple truth that was being hidden or obscured. The LumberTrust did not fool these men and it could not intimidate them. They hadthe courage to give the truth to the world just as they saw it. They wereconvinced in their hearts and minds that the loggers on trial wereinnocent. And they would have been just as honest and just as fearless hadtheir convictions been otherwise.It cannot be said that the Labor Jury was biased in favor of thedefendants or of the I.W.W. If anything, they were predisposed to believethe defendants guilty and their union an outlaw organization. It must beremembered that all the labor jury knew of the case was what it had readin the capitalist newspapers prior to their arrival at the scene of thetrial. These men were not radicals but representative working men--membersof conservative unions--who had been instructed by their organizations toobserve impartially the progress of the trial and to report back to theirunions the result of their observations. Read their report:Labor's VerdictLabor Temple, Tacoma, March 15, 1920, 1:40 p.m.The Labor Jury met in the rooms of the Labor Temple and organized,electing P. K. Mohr as foreman.Present: J.A. Craft, W.J. Beard, Otto Newman, Theodore Mayer, E.W. Thralland P.K. Mohr.1. On motion a secret ballot of guilty or not guilty was taken, the countresulting in a unanimous "Not Guilty!"2. Shall we give our report to the press? Verdict, "Yes."[Illustration: Labor's Silent JuryW.J. Beard, Central Labor Council, Tacoma: Paul K. Mohr, Central LaborCouncil, Seattle: Theodore Meyer, Central Labor Council, Everett: E.W.Thrall, Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, Centralia: John A. Craft, MetalTrades Council, Seattle.]3. Was there a conspiracy to raid the I.W.W. hall on the part of thebusiness interests of Centralia? Verdict, "Yes."There was evidence offered by the defense to show that the businessinterests held a meeting at the Elk's Club on October 20, 1919, at whichways and means to deal with the I.W.W. situation were discussed. F.B.Hubbard, Chief of Police Hughes and William Scales, commander of theAmerican Legion at Centralia, were present. Prosecuting Attorney Allen wasquoted as having said, "There is no law that would let you run the I.W.W.out of town." Chief of Police Hughes said, "You cannot run the I.W.W. outof town; they have violated no law." F.G. Hubbard said, "It's a damnshame; if I was chief I would have them out of town in 24 hours." WilliamScales, presiding at the meeting, said that although he was not in favorof a raid, there was no American jury that would convict them if they did,or words to that effect. He then announced that he would appoint a secretcommittee to deal with the I.W.W. situation.4. Was the I.W.W. hall unlawfully raided? Verdict, "Yes." The evidenceintroduced convinces us that an attack was made before a shot was fired.5. Had the defendants a right to defend their hall. Verdict, "yes." On aformer occasion the I.W.W. hall was raided, furniture destroyed andstolen, ropes placed around their necks and they were otherwise abused anddriven out of town by citizens, armed with pick handles.6. Was Warren O. Grimm a party to the conspiracy of raiding the I.W.W.hall? Verdict, "Yes." The evidence introduced convinces us that Warren O.Grimm participated in the raid of the I.W.W. hall.7. To our minds the most convincing evidence that Grimm was in front ofand raiding the I.W.W. hall with others, is the evidence of State WitnessVan Gilder who testified that he stood at the side of Grimm at theintersection of Second street and Tower avenue, when, according to histestimony, Grimm was shot. This testimony was refuted by five witnesseswho testified that they saw Grimm coming wounded from the direction of theI.W.W. hall. It is not credible that Van Gilder, who was a personal andintimate friend of Grimm, would leave him when he was mortally wounded, towalk half a block alone and unaided.8. Did the defendants get a fair and impartial trial? Verdict, "No." Themost damaging evidence of a conspiracy by the business men of Centralia,of a raid on the I.W.W. hall, was ruled out by the court and not permittedto go to the jury. This was one of the principal issues that the defensesought to establish.Also the calling of the federal troops by Prosecuting Attorney Allen wasfor no other reason than to create atmosphere. On interviewing the judge,sheriff and prosecuting attorney, the judge and the sheriff informed usthat in their opinion the troops were not needed and that they werebrought there without their consent or knowledge. In the interview Mr.Allen promised to furnish the substance of the evidence which in hisopinion necessitated the presence of the troops the next morning, but onthe following day he declined the information. He, however, did say thathe did not fear the I.W.W., but was afraid of violence by the AmericanLegion. This confession came after he was shown by us the fallacy of theI.W.W. coming armed to interfere with the verdict. Also the presence ofthe American Legion in large numbers in court.Theodore Meyer, Everett Central Labor Council; John O. Craft, SeattleMetal Trades Council; E.W.

On March 17th, the Seattle Central Labor Council votedunanimously to send the verdict to all of the Central Labor Assemblies ofthe United States and Canada.Not only are the loggers vindicated in defending their property and livesfrom the felonious assault of the Armistice Day mob, but the conspiracy ofthe business interests to raid the hall and the raid itself wereestablished. The participation of Warren O. Grimm is also accepted asproved beyond doubt. Doubly significant is the statement about the "fairand impartial trial" that is supposed to be guaranteed all men under ourconstitution.Nothing could more effectively stamp the seal of infamy upon the wholesickening rape of justice than the manly outspoken statements of these sixlabor jurors. Perhaps the personalities of these men might prove ofinterest:E. W. Thrall, of the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, Centralia, is an oldtime and trusted member of his union. As will be noticed, he comes fromCentralia, the scene of the tragedy.Otto Newman, of the Central Labor Council, Portland, Oregon, has ablyrepresented his union in the C.L.C. for some time.W.J. Beard is organizer for the Central Labor Council in Tacoma,Washington. He is an old member of the Western Federation of Miners andremembers the terrible times during the strikes at Tulluride.John O. Craft is president of Local 40, International Union of SteamOperating Engineers, of which union he has been a member for the last tenyears. Mr. Craft has been actively connected with unions affiliated withthe A.F. of L. since 1898.Theodore Meyer was sent by the Longshoremen of Everett, Washington. Since1903 he has been a member of the A.F. of L.; prior to that time being amember of the National Sailors and Firemen's Union of Great Britain andIreland, and of the Sailors' Union of Australia.P. K. Mohr represents the Central Labor Council of Seattle and is one ofthe oldest active members in the Seattle unions. Mr. Mohr became a chartermember of the first Bakers' Union in 1889 and was its first presidingofficer. He was elected delegate to the old Western Central Labor Councilin 1890. At one time Mr. Mohr was president of the Seattle Labor Council.At the present time he is president of the Bakers' Union.Such are the men who have studied the travesty on justice in the greatlabor trial at Montesano. "Not Guilty" is their verdict. Does it meananything to you?Wesley EverestTorn and defiant as a wind-lashed reed,Wounded, he faced you as he stood at bay;You dared not lynch him in the light of day,But on your dungeon stones you let him bleed;Night came ... and you black vigilants of Greed,...Like human wolves, seized hand upon your prey,Tortured and killed ... and, silent, slunk awayWithout one qualm of horror at the deed.Once ... long ago ... do you remember howYou hailed Him king for soldiers to deride--You placed a scroll above His bleeding browAnd spat upon Him, scourged Him, crucified...?A rebel unto Caesar--then as now--Alone, thorn-crowned, a spear wound in His side!--R.C. in "N.Y.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.

"You couldnot but know my feelings towards those two men--I will not call themgentlemen--whose company you have again forced upon me. You must beaware that your father has shut the door of this house against them.""My father has shut the door against better men than they are," said theyouth carelessly; "witness my own uncles Henry and George."The lip of the lady quivered, the indignant colour rose even to hertemples; she attempted to speak, but her voice failed her, and sheturned aside to hide her emotion."Well, mother, I did not mean to vex you," said Philip, who was ratherweak in purpose than hardened in evil; "it _was_ a shame to bring Jonesand Wildrake here, but--but you see I couldn't help it." And he playeduneasily with his gold-headed riding-whip, while his eye avoided meetingthat of his mother."They have acquired some strange influence, some mysterious hold overyou," answered the lady. "It cannot be," she added anxiously, "that youhave broken your promise,--that they have drawn you again to thegaming-table,--that you are involved in debt to these men?"Philip whistled an air and sauntered up to the window.Lady Grange pressed her hand over her eyes, and a sigh, a very heavysigh, burst from her bosom. Philip heard, and turned impatiently round."There's no use in making the worst of matters," said he; "what's donecan't be helped; and my debts, such as they are, won't ruin a rich manlike my father.""It is not that which I fear," said the mother faintly, with a terribleconsciousness that her son,--her hope, her pride, the delight of herheart,--had entered on a course which, if persevered in, must end in hisruin both of body and soul. "I tremble at the thought of the miserywhich you are bringing on yourself. These men are making you theirvictim: they are blinding your eyes; they are throwing a net around you,and you have not the resolution to break from the snare.""They are very pleasant, jovial fellows!" cried Philip, trying to hideunder an appearance of careless gaiety the real annoyance which he feltat the words of his mother."I've asked them to dine here to-day and--""I shall not appear at the table," said Lady Grange, drawing herself upwith dignity; "and if your father should arrive--""Oh! he won't arrive to-night; he never travels so late.""But, Philip," said the lady earnestly again laying her cold hand on hisarm. She was interrupted by her wayward and undutiful son."Mother, there's no use in saying anything more on the subject; it onlyworries you, and puts me out of temper. I can't, and I won't be uncivilto my friends;" and turning hastily round, Philip quitted the apartment."Friends!" faintly echoed Lady Grange, as she saw the door close behindher misguided son. "Oh!" she exclaimed, throwing herself on a sofa, andburying her face, "was there ever a mother--ever a woman so unhappy asI am!"Her cup was indeed very bitter; it was one which the luxuries thatsurrounded her had not the least power to sweeten. Her husband was a manpossessing many noble qualities both of head and heart; but the fatallove of gold, like those petrifying springs which change living twigsto dead stone, had made him hardened, quarrelsome, and worldly. It haddrawn him away from the worship of his God; for there is deep truth inthe declaration of the apostle, that the covetous man is _an idolater_.It was this miserable love of gold which had induced Sir Gilbert tobreak with the family of his wife, and separate her from those to whomher loving heart still clung with the fondest affection. Lady Grangeyearned for a sight of her early home; but gold had raised a barrierbetween her and the companions of her childhood. And what had thepossession of gold done for the man who made it his idol? It had putsnares in the path of his only son; it had made the weak-minded buthead-strong youth be entrapped by the wicked for the sake of his wealth,as the ermine is hunted down for its rich fur. It had given to himselfheavy responsibilities, for which he would have to answer at the bar ofHeaven; for from him unto whom much has been given, much at the last daywill be required.Yes, Lady Grange was very miserable. And how did she endeavourto lighten the burden of her misery? Was it by counting over herjewels,--looking at the costly and beautiful things which adorned herdwelling,--thinking of her carriages and horses and glittering plate, orthe number of her rich and titled friends? No; she sought comfort whereWidow Green had sought it when her child lay dangerously ill, and therewas neither a loaf on her shelf nor a penny in her purse. The rich ladydid what the poor one had done,--she fell on her knees and with tearspoured out her heart to the merciful Father of all. She told him hersorrows, she told him her fears; she asked him for that help which sheso much required. Her case was a harder one than the widow's. A visitfrom the clergyman, a present from a benevolent friend, God's blessingon a simple remedy, had soon changed Mrs. Green's sorrow into joy.The anguish of Lady Grange lay deeper; her faith was more sorely tried;her fears were not for the bodies but the souls of those whom sheloved;--and where is the mortal who can give us a cure for the diseaseof sin?While his mother was weeping and praying, Philip was revelling anddrinking. Fast were the bottles pushed round, and often were the glassesrefilled. The stately banqueting-room resounded with laughter andmerriment; and as the evening advanced, with boisterous song. It waslate before the young men quitted the table; and then, heated with wine,they threw the window wide open, to let the freshness of the night aircool their fevered temples.Beautiful looked the park in the calm moonlight. Not a breath stirredthe branches of the trees, their dark shadows lay motionless on thegreen sward: perfect silence and stillness reigned around. But the holyquietness of nature was rudely disturbed by the voices of the revellers.With the conversation that passed I shall not soil my pages. The windowopened into a broad stone balcony, and seating themselves upon itsparapet, the young men exchanged stories and jests. After many salliesof so-called wit, Wildrake rallied Philip on the quantity of wine whichhe had taken, and betted that he could not walk steadily from the oneend of the balcony to the other. Philip, with that insane pride whichcan plume itself on being _mighty to mingle strong drink_, maintainedthat his head was as clear and his faculties as perfect as though he hadtasted nothing but water; and declared that he could walk round the edgeof the parapet with as steady a step as he would tread the gravel-pathin the morning!Wildrake laughed, and dared him to do it: Jones betted ten to one thathe could not."Done!" cried Philip, and sprang up on the parapet in a moment."Come down again!" called out Wildrake, who had enough of sense left toperceive the folly and danger of the wager.Philip did not appear to hear him. Attempting to balance himself by hisarms, with a slow and unsteady step he began to make his way along thelofty and narrow edge.The two young men held their breath. To one who with unsteady feet walksthe slippery margin of temptation, the higher his position, the greaterhis danger; the loftier his elevation, the more perilous a fall!"He will never get to the end!" said Jones, watching with some anxietythe movements of his companion.The words had scarcely escaped his lips when they received a startlingfulfilment. Philip had not proceeded half way along the parapet when aslight sound in the garden below him attracted his attention. He glanceddown for a moment; and there, in the cold, clear moonlight, gazingsternly upon him, he beheld his father! The sudden start of surprisewhich he gave threw the youth off his balance,--he staggered back, losthis footing, stretched out his hands wildly to save himself, and fellwith a loud cry to the ground!All was now confusion and terror. There were the rushing of footstepshither and thither, voices calling, bells loudly ringing, and, aboveall, the voice of a mother's anguish, piercing to the soul! Jones andWildrake hurried off to the stables, saddled their horses themselves,and dashed off at full speed to summon a surgeon, glad of any excuseto make their escape from the place.The unfortunate Philip was raised from the ground, and carried into thehouse. His groans showed the severity of his sufferings. The slightestmotion was to him torture, and an hour of intense suspense ensued beforethe arrival of the surgeon. Lady Grange made a painful effort to becalm. She thought of everything, did all that she could do for therelief of her son, and even strove to speak words of comfort and hopeto her husband, who appeared almost stupified by his sorrow. Prayer wasstill her support--prayer, silent, but almost unceasing.The surgeon arrived,--the injuries received by the sufferer wereexamined, though it was long before Philip, unaccustomed to pain andincapable of self-control, would permit necessary measures to be taken.His resistance greatly added to his sufferings. He had sustained acompound fracture of his leg, besides numerous bruises and contusions.The broken bone had to be set, and the pale mother stood by, longing, inthe fervour of her unselfish love, that she could endure the agony inthe place of her son. The pampered child of luxury shrank sensitivelyfrom pain, and the thought that he had brought all his misery uponhimself by his folly and disobedience rendered it yet more intolerable.When the surgeon had at length done his work, Lady Grange retired withhim to another apartment, and, struggling to command her choking voice,asked him the question on the reply to which all her earthly happinessseemed to hang,--whether he had hope that the life of her boy might bespared."I have every hope", said the surgeon, cheerfully, "if we can keep downthe fever." Then, for the first time since she had seen her son liebleeding before her, the mother found the relief of tears.Through the long night she quitted not the sufferer's pillow, bathinghis fevered brow, relieving his thirst, whispering comfort to histroubled spirit. Soon after daybreak Philip sank into a quiet,refreshing sleep; and Lady Grange, feeling as if a mountain's weight hadbeen lifted from her heart, hurried to carry the good news to her husband.She found him in the spacious saloon, pacing restlessly to and fro. Hisbrow was knit, his lips compressed; his disordered dress and haggardcountenance showed that he, too, had watched the live-long night."He sleeps at last, Gilbert, thank God!" Her face brightened as shespoke; but there was no corresponding look of joy on that of her husband."Gilbert, the doctor assures me that there is every prospect of ourdear boy's restoration!""And to what is he to be restored?" said the father gloomily; "topoverty--misery--ruin!"Lady Grange stood mute with surprise scarcely believing the evidence ofher senses almost deeming that the words must have been uttered in adream. But it was no dream, but one of those strange, stern realitieswhich we meet with in life. Her husband indeed stood before her a ruinedman! A commercial crash, like those which have so often reduced the richto poverty, coming almost as suddenly as the earthquake which shakes thenatural world, had overthrown all his fortune! The riches in which hehad trusted had taken to themselves wings and flown away.Here was another startling shock, but Lady Grange felt it far less thanthe first. It seemed to her that if her son were only spared to her, shecould bear cheerfully any other trial. When riches had increased, shehad not set her heart upon them; she had endeavoured to spend them as agood steward of God and to lay up treasure in that blessed place wherethere is no danger of its ever being lost. Sir Gilbert was far morecrushed than his wife was by this misfortune. He saw his idol brokenbefore his eyes, and where was he to turn for comfort? Everything uponwhich his eye rested was a source of pain to him; for must he not partwith all, leave all in which his heart had delighted, all in which hissoul had taken pride? He forgot that poverty was only forestalling by afew years the inevitable work of death!The day passed wearily away. Philip suffered much pain, was weak andlow, and bitterly conscious how well he had earned the misery which hewas called on to endure. It was a mercy that he was experiencing, beforeit was too late, that _thorns and snares are in the way of the froward_.He liked his mother to read the Bible to him, just a few verses at atime, as he had strength to bear it; and in this occupation she herselffound the comfort which she needed. Sir Gilbert, full of his owntroubles, scarcely ever entered the apartment of his son.Towards evening a servant came softly into the sick-room, bringinga sealed letter for her lady. There was no post-mark upon it, andthe girl informed her mistress that the gentleman who had broughtit was waiting in the garden for a reply. The first glance at thehand-writing, at the well-known seal, brought colour to the cheek ofthe lady. But it was a hand-writing which she had been forbidden toread; it was a seal which she must not break! She motioned to the maidto take her place beside the invalid who happened at that moment to besleeping and with a quick step and a throbbing heart she hurried awayto find her husband.He was in his study, his arms resting on his open desk, and his headbowed down upon them. Bills and papers, scattered in profusion on thetable, showed what had been the nature of the occupation which he hadnot had the courage to finish. He started from his posture of despairas his wife laid a gentle touch on his shoulder; and, without utteringa word, she placed the unopened letter in his hand.My reader shall have the privilege of looking over Sir Gilbert'sshoulder, and perusing the contents of that letter:--     "Dearest Sister,--We have heard of your trials, and warmly     sympathize in your sorrow. Let Sir Gilbert know that we have placed     at his banker's, after having settled it upon you, double the sum     which caused our unhappy differences. Let the past be forgotten;     let us again meet as those should meet who have gathered together     round the same hearth, mourned over the same grave, and shared joys     and sorrows together, as it is our anxious desire to do now. I     shall be my own messenger, and shall wait in person to receive your     reply.--Your ever attached brother,     "HENRY LATOUR."A few minutes more and Lady Grange was in the arms of her brother; whileSir Gilbert was silently grasping the hand of one whom, but formisfortune, he would never have known as a friend.All the neighbourhood pitied the gentle lady, the benefactress of thepoor, when she dismissed her servants, sold her jewels, and quittedher beautiful home to seek a humbler shelter. Amongst the hundreds whocrowded to the public auction of the magnificent furniture and plate,which had been the admiration of all who had seen them, many thoughtwith compassion of the late owners, reduced to such sudden poverty,though the generosity of the lady's family had saved them from wantor dependence.And yet truly, never since her marriage had Lady Grange been less anobject of compassion.Her son was slowly but surely recovering, and his preservation frommeeting sudden death unprepared was to her a source of unutterablethankfulness. Her own family appeared to regard her with even moretender affection than if no coldness had ever arisen between them; andtheir love was to her beyond price. Even Sir Gilbert's harsh, worldlycharacter, was somewhat softened by trials, and by the unmeritedkindness which he met with from those whom, in his prosperity, hehad slighted and shunned. Lady Grange felt that her prayers had beenanswered indeed, though in a way very different from what she had hopedor expected. The chain by which her son had been gradually drawn downtowards rum, by those who sought his company for the sake of his money,had been suddenly snapped by the loss of his fortune. The weak youthwas left to the guidance of those to whom his welfare was really dear.Philip, obliged to rouse himself from his indolence, and exert himselfto earn his living, became a far wiser and more estimable man than hewould ever have been as the heir to a fortune; and he never forgot thelesson which pain, weakness, and shame had taught him,--that the way ofevil is also the way of sorrow. _Thorns and snares are in the way ofthe froward._    Who Wisdom's path forsakes,      Leaves all true joy behind:    He who the peace of others breaks,      No peace himself shall find.    Flowers above and thorns below,    Little pleasure, lasting woe,--    Such is the fate that sinners know!    The drunkard gaily sings      Above his foaming glass;    But shame and pain the revel brings,      Ere many hours can pass.    Flowers above and thorns below,    Little pleasure, lasting woe,--    Such is the fate that sinners know!    The thief may count his gains;--      If he the sum could see    Of future punishment and pains,      Sad would his reckoning be!    Flowers above and thorns below,    Little pleasure, lasting woe,--    Such is the fate that sinners know!    The Sabbath-breaker spurns      What Wisdom did ordain:    God's rest to Satan's use he turns,--      A blessing to a bane.    Flowers above and thorns below,    Little pleasure, lasting woe,--    Such is the fate which sinners know!    O Lord, to thee we pray;      Do thou our faith increase;    Help us to walk in Wisdom's way,--      The only way of peace:    For flowers above and thorns below,    Little pleasure, lasting woe,--    Such is the fate which sinners know!THE SAILOR'S RESOLVE.     "An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in     transgression."--PROV. xxix. 22.The old sailor Jonas sat before the fire with his pipe in his mouth,looking steadfastly into the glowing coals. Not that, following afavourite practice of his little niece, he was making out red-hotcastles and flaming buildings in the grate, or that his thoughts were inany way connected with the embers: he was doing what it would be well ifwe all sometimes did,--looking into himself, and reflecting on what hadhappened in relation to his own conduct."So," thought he, "here am I, an honest old fellow,--I may say it, withall my faults; and one who shrinks from falsehood more than from fire;and I find that I, with my bearish temper, am actually driving thoseabout me into it--teaching them to be crafty, tricky, and cowardly! Iknew well enough that my gruffness plagued others, but I never saw howit _tempted_ others until now; tempted them to meanness, I would say,for I have found a thousand times that _an angry man stirreth upstrife_, and that a short word may begin a long quarrel. I am afraidthat I have not thought enough on this matter. I've looked on bad temperas a very little sin, and I begin to suspect that it is a great one,both in God's eyes and in the consequences that it brings. Let me seeif I can reckon up its evils! It makes those miserable whom one wouldwish to make happy; it often, like an adverse gale, forces them toback, instead of steering straight for the port. It dishonours one'sprofession, lowers one's flag, makes the world mock at the religionwhich can leave a man as rough and rugged as a heathen savage. It'sdirectly contrary to the Word of God,--it's wide as east from west ofthe example set before us! Yes, a furious temper is a very evil thing;I'd give my other leg to be rid of mine!" and in the warmth of hisself-reproach the sailor struck his wooden one against the hearth withsuch violence as to make Alie start in terror that some fierce explosionwas about to follow."Well, I've made up my mind as to its being an evil--a great evil,"continued Jonas, in his quiet meditation; "the next question is, howis the evil to be got rid of? There's the pinch! It clings to one likeone's skin. It's one's nature,--how can one fight against nature? Andyet, I take it, it's the very business of faith to conquer our evilnature. As I read somewhere, any dead dog can float with the stream;it's the living dog that swims against it. I mind the trouble I hadabout the wicked habit of swearing, when first I took to trying to serveGod and leave off my evil courses. Bad words came to my mouth as naturalas the very air that I breathed. What did I do to cure myself of thatevil? Why, I resolved again and again, and found that my resolutionswere always snapping like a rotten cable in a storm; and I was drivenfrom my anchorage so often, that I almost began to despair. Then Iprayed hard to be helped; and I said to myself, 'God helps those whohelp themselves, and maybe if I determine to do something that I shouldbe sorry to do every time that an oath comes from my mouth, it wouldassist me to remember my duty.' I resolved to break my pipe the firsttime that I swore; and I've never uttered an oath from that day to this,not even in my most towering passions! Now I'll try the same cure again;not to punish a sin, but to prevent it. If I fly into a fury, I'll breakmy pipe! There Jonas Colter, I give you fair warning!" and the oldsailor smiled grimly to himself, and stirred the fire with an air ofsatisfaction.Not one rough word did Jonas utter that evening; indeed he wasremarkably silent, for the simplest way of saying nothing evil, hethought, was to say nothing at all. Jonas looked with much pleasureat his pipe when he put it on the mantle-piece for the night. "You'veweathered this day, old friend," said he; "we'll be on the look outagainst squalls to-morrow."The next morning Jonas occupied himself in his own room with his phials,and his nephew and niece were engaged in the kitchen in preparing forthe Sunday school, which their mother made, them regularly attend. Thedoor was open between the two rooms and as the place was not large,Jonas heard every word that passed between Johnny and Alie almost aswell as if he had been close beside them._Johnny_. I say, Alie--_Alie_. Please, Johnny, let me learn this quietly. If I do not know itmy teacher will be vexed. My work being behind-hand yesterday has put mequite back with my tasks. You know that I cannot learn so fast as you do._Johnny_. Oh! you've plenty of time. I want you to do something for me.Do you know that I have lost my new ball?_Alie_. Why, I saw you take it out of your pocket yesterday, just afterwe crossed the stile on our way back from the farm._Johnny_. That's it! I took it out of my pocket, and I never put it inagain. I want you to go directly and look for the ball. That stile isonly three fields off, you know. You must look carefully along the pathall the way; and lose no time, or some one else may pick it up._Alie_. Pray, Johnny, don't ask me to go into the fields._Johnny_. I tell you, you have plenty of time for your lessons._Alie_. It is not that, but--_Johnny_. Speak out, will you?_Alie_. You know--there are--cows!Johnny burst into a loud, coarse laugh of derision. "You miserablelittle coward!" he cried; "I'd like to see one chasing you round themeadow! How you'd scamper! how you'd scream! rare fun it would be,--ha!ha! ha!""Rare fun would it be, sir!" exclaimed an indignant voice, as Jonasstumped from the next room, and, seizing his nephew by the collar of hisjacket, gave him a hearty shake; "rare fun would it be,--and what do youcall this? You dare twit your sister with cowardice!--you who sneakedoff yesterday like a fox because you had not the spirit to look an oldman in the face!--you who bully the weak and cringe to the strong!--youwho have the manners of a bear with the heart of a pigeon!" Everysentence was accompanied by a violent shake, which almost took thebreath from the boy; and Jonas, red with passion, concluded his speechby flinging Johnny from him with such force that, but for the wallagainst which he staggered, he must have fallen to the ground.The next minute Jonas walked up to the mantle-piece, and exclaiming, ina tone of vexation, "Run aground again!" took his pipe, snapped it intwo, and flung the pieces into the fire! He then stumped back to hisroom, slamming the door behind him."The old fury!" muttered the panting Johnny between his clenched teeth,looking fiercely towards his uncle's room."To break his own pipe!" exclaimed Alie. "I never knew him do anythinglike that before, however angry he might be!"Johnny took down his cap from its peg, and, in as ill humour as canwell be imagined, went out to search for his ball. He took what revengehe could on his formidable uncle, while amusing himself that afternoonby looking over his "Robinson Crusoe." Johnny was fond of his pencil,though he had never learned to draw; and the margins of his books wereoften adorned with grim heads or odd figures by his hand. There wasa picture in "Robinson Crusoe" representing a party of cannibals,as hideous as fancy could represent them, dancing around their fire.Johnny diverted his mind and gratified his malice by doing his best soto alter the foremost figure as to make him appear with a wooden leg,while he drew on his head a straw hat, unmistakably like that of the oldsailor, and touched up the features so as to give a dim resemblance tohis face. To prevent a doubt as to the meaning of the sketch, Johnnyscribbled on the side of the picture,--    "In search of fierce savages no one need roam;    The fiercest and ugliest, you'll find him at home!"He secretly showed the picture to Alie."O Johnny! how naughty! What would uncle say if he saw it?""We might look out for squalls indeed! but uncle never by any chancelooks at a book of that sort.""I think that you had better rub out the pencilling as fast as you can,"said Alie."Catch me rubbing it out!" cried Johnny; "it's the best sketch that everI drew, and as like the old savage as it can stare!"Late in the evening their mother returned from Brampton, where she hadbeen nursing a sick lady. Right glad were Johnny and Alie to see hersooner than they had ventured to expect. She brought them a few oranges,to show her remembrance of them. Nor was the old sailor forgotten;carefully she drew from her bag and presented to him a new pipe.The children glanced at each other. Jonas took the pipe with a curiousexpression on his face, which his sister was at a loss to understand."Thank'ee kindly," he said; "I see it'll be a case of--    "'If ye try and don't succeed,    Try, try, try again.'"What he meant was a riddle to every one else present, although not tothe reader.The "try" was very successful on that evening and the following day.Never had Johnny and Alie found their uncle so agreeable. His manneralmost approached to gentleness,--it was a calm after a storm."Uncle is so very good and kind," said Alie to her brother, as theywalked home from afternoon service, "that I wonder how you can bear tohave that naughty picture still in your book. He is not in the leastlike a cannibal, and it seems quite wrong to laugh at him so.""I'll rub it all out one of these days," replied Johnny; "but I mustshow it first to Peter Crane. He says that I never hit on a likeness: ifhe sees that, he'll never say so again!"The next morning Jonas occupied himself with gathering wild flowers andherbs in the fields. He carried them into his little room, where Johnnyheard him whistling "Old Tom Bowling," like one at peace with himselfand all the world.Presently Jonas called to the boy to bring him a knife from the kitchen;a request made in an unusually courteous tone of voice, and with which,of course, Johnny immediately complied.He found Jonas busy drying his plants, by laying them neatly between thepages of a book, preparatory to pressing them down. What was the terrorof Johnny when he perceived that the book whose pages Jonas was turningover for this purpose was no other than his "Robinson Crusoe"!"Oh! if I could only get it out of his hands before he comes to thathorrid picture! Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?" thought thebewildered Johnny. "Uncle, I was reading that book," at last he musteredcourage to say aloud."You may read it again to-morrow," was the quiet reply of Jonas."Perhaps he will not look at that picture," reflected Johnny. "I wishthat I could see exactly which part of the book he is at! He looks tooquiet a great deal for any mischief to have been done yet! Dear! dear!I would give anything to have that 'Robinson Crusoe' at the bottom ofthe sea! I do think that my uncle's face is growing very red!--yes! theveins on his forehead are swelling! Depend on't he's turned over tothose unlucky cannibals, and will be ready to eat me like one of them!I'd better make off before the thunder-clap comes!""Going to sheer off again, Master Johnny?" said the old sailor, in avery peculiar tone of voice, looking up from the open book on which hisfinger now rested."I've a little business," stammered out Johnny."Yes, a little business with me, which you'd better square before youhoist sail. Why, when you made such a good figure of this savage, didyou not clap jacket and boots on this little cannibal beside him, andmake a pair of 'em 'at home'? I suspect you and I are both in the sameboat as far as regards our tempers, my lad!"Johnny felt it utterly impossible to utter a word in reply."I'm afraid," pursued the seaman, closing the book, "that we've both hada bit too much of the savage about us,--too much of the dancing roundthe fire. But mark me, Jack,--we learn even in that book that a savage,a cannibal _may_ be tamed; and we learn from something far better, thatprinciple,--the noblest principle which can govern either the young orthe old,--_may_, ay, and _must_, put out the fire of fierce anger in ourhearts, and change us from wild beasts to men! So I've said my say,"added Jonas with a smile; "and in token of my first victory over my oldfoe, come here, my boy, and give us your hand!""O uncle, I am so sorry!" exclaimed Johnny, with moistened eyes, as hefelt the kindly grasp of the old man."Sorry are you? and what were you on Saturday when I shook you as a catshakes a rat?""Why, uncle, I own that I was angry.""Sorry now, and angry then? So it's clear that the mild way has the besteffect, to say nothing of the example." And Jonas fell into a fit ofmusing.All was fair weather and sunshine in the home on that day, and on manydays after. Jonas had, indeed, a hard struggle to subdue his temper, andoften felt fierce anger rising in his heart, and ready to boil over inwords of passion or acts of violence; but Jonas, as he had endeavouredfaithfully to serve his Queen, while he fought under her flag, broughtthe same earnest and brave sense of duty to bear on the trials of dailylife. He never again forgot his resolution, and every day that passedmade the restraint which he laid upon himself less painful and irksometo him.If the conscience of any of my readers should tell him that, by hisunruly temper, he is marring the peace of his family, oh! let him notneglect the evil as a small one, but, like the poor old sailor in mystory, resolutely struggle against it. For _an angry man stirreth upstrife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression._    There is sin in commencing strife;      Sin in the thoughtless jest        Or angry burst,        Which awakens first      The ire in a brother's breast!    There is sin in stirring up strife,      In fanning the smouldering flame,        By scornful eye,        Or proud reply,      Or anger-stirring name.    There is sin in keeping up strife,      Dark, soul-destroying sin.        Who cherishes hate        May seek heaven's gate,      But never can enter in.    For peace is the Christian's joy,      And love is the Christian's life;        He's bound for a home        Where hate cannot come,      Nor the shadow of sin or strife!***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FALSE FRIENDS, AND THE SAILOR'SRESOLVE********** This file should be named 14543.txt or 14543.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/4/5/4/14543Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

W. JacobsTHREE AT TABLEThe talk in the coffee-room had been of ghosts and apparitions, andnearly everybody present had contributed his mite to the stock ofinformation upon a hazy and somewhat thread-bare subject.  Opinionsranged from rank incredulity to childlike faith, one believer going sofar as to denounce unbelief as impious, with a reference to the Witch ofEndor, which was somewhat marred by being complicated in an inexplicablefashion with the story of Jonah."Talking of Jonah," he said solemnly, with a happy disregard of the factthat he had declined to answer several eager questions put to him on thesubject, "look at the strange tales sailors tell us.""I wouldn't advise you to believe all those," said a bluff, clean-shavenman, who had been listening without speaking much.  "You see when asailor gets ashore he's expected to have something to tell, and hisfriends would be rather disappointed if he had not.""It's a well-known fact," interrupted the first speaker firmly, "thatsailors are very prone to see visions.""They are," said the other dryly, "they generally see them in pairs, andthe shock to the nervous system frequently causes headache next morning.""You never saw anything yourself?"  suggested an unbeliever."Man and boy," said the other, "I've been at sea thirty years, and theonly unpleasant incident of that kind occurred in a quiet Englishcountryside.""And that?"  said another man."I was a young man at the time," said the narrator, drawing at his pipeand glancing good-humouredly at the company.  "I, had just come back fromChina, and my own people being away I went down into the country toinvite myself to stay with an uncle.  When I got down to the place Ifound it closed and the family in the South of France; but as they weredue back in a couple of days I decided to put up at the Royal George,a very decent inn, and await their return."The first day I passed well enough; but in the evening the dulness ofthe rambling old place, in which I was the only visitor, began to weighupon my spirits, and the next morning after a late breakfast I set outwith the intention of having a brisk day's walk."I started off in excellent spirits, for the day was bright and frosty,with a powdering of snow on the iron-bound roads and nipped hedges, andthe country had to me all the charm of novelty.  It was certainly flat,but there was plenty of timber, and the villages through which I passedwere old and picturesque."I lunched luxuriously on bread and cheese and beer in the bar of a smallinn, and resolved to go a little further before turning back.  When atlength I found I had gone far enough, I turned up a lane at right anglesto the road I was passing, and resolved to find my way back by anotherroute.  It is a long lane that has no turning, but this had several, eachof which had turnings of its own, which generally led, as I found bytrying two or three of them, into the open marshes.  Then, tired oflanes, I resolved to rely upon the small compass which hung from my watchchain and go across country home."I had got well into the marshes when a white fog, which had been forsome time hovering round the edge of the ditches, began gradually tospread.  There was no escaping it, but by aid of my compass I was savedfrom making a circular tour and fell instead into frozen ditches orstumbled over roots in the grass.  I kept my course, however, until atfour o'clock, when night was coming rapidly up to lend a hand to the fog,I was fain to confess myself lost."The compass was now no good to me, and I wandered about miserably,occasionally giving a shout on the chance of being heard by some passingshepherd or farmhand.  At length by great good luck I found my feet on arough road driven through the marshes, and by walking slowly and tappingwith my stick managed to keep to it.  I had followed it for some distancewhen I heard footsteps approaching me."We stopped as we met, and the new arrival, a sturdy-looking countryman,hearing of my plight, walked back with me for nearly a mile, and puttingme on to a road gave me minute instructions how to reach a village somethree miles distant."I was so tired that three miles sounded like ten, and besides that, alittle way off from the road I saw dimly a lighted window.  I pointed itout, but my companion shuddered and looked round him uneasily."'You won't get no good there,' he said, hastily."'Why not?' I asked."'There's a something there, sir,' he replied, 'what 'tis I dunno, butthe little 'un belonging to a gamekeeper as used to live in these partssee it, and it was never much good afterward.  Some say as it's a poormad thing, others says as it's a kind of animal; but whatever it is, itain't good to see.'"'Well, I'll keep on, then,' I said.  'Goodnight.'"He went back whistling cheerily until his footsteps died away in thedistance, and I followed the road he had indicated until it divided intothree, any one of which to a stranger might be said to lead straight on.I was now cold and tired, and having half made up my mind walked slowlyback toward the house."At first all I could see of it was the little patch of light at thewindow. I made for that until it disappeared suddenly, and I found myselfwalking into a tall hedge. I felt my way round this until I came to asmall gate, and opening it cautiously, walked, not without some littlenervousness, up a long path which led to the door. There was no light andno sound from within. Half repenting of my temerity I shortened my stickand knocked lightly upon the door."I waited a couple of minutes and then knocked again, and my stick wasstill beating the door when it opened suddenly and a tall bony old woman,holding a candle, confronted me."'What do you want?' she demanded gruffly."'I've lost my way,' I said, civilly; 'I want to get to Ashville.'"'Don't know it,' said the old woman."She was about to close the door when a man emerged from a room at theside of the hall and came toward us.  An old man of great height andbreadth of shoulder."'Ashville is fifteen miles distant,' he said slowly."'If you will direct me to the nearest village, I shall be grateful,' Iremarked."He made no reply, but exchanged a quick, furtive glance with the woman.She made a gesture of dissent."'The nearest place is three miles off,' he said, turning to me andapparently trying to soften a naturally harsh voice; 'if you will give methe pleasure of your company, I will make you as comfortable as I can.'"I hesitated.  They were certainly a queer-looking couple, and the gloomyhall with the shadows thrown by the candle looked hardly more invitingthan the darkness outside."'You are very kind,' I murmured, irresolutely, 'but--'"'Come in,' he said quickly; 'shut the door, Anne.'"Almost before I knew it I was standing inside and the old woman,muttering to herself, had closed the door behind me.  With a queersensation of being trapped I followed my host into the room, and takingthe proffered chair warmed my frozen fingers at the fire."'Dinner will soon be ready,' said the old man, regarding me closely. 'Ifyou will excuse me.'"I bowed and he left the room.  A minute afterward I heard voices; hisand the old woman's, and, I fancied, a third.  Before I had finished myinspection of the room he returned, and regarded me with the same strangelook I had noticed before."'There will be three of us at dinner,' he said, at length. 'We two andmy son.'"I bowed again, and secretly hoped that that look didn't run in thefamily."'I suppose you don't mind dining in the dark,' he said, abruptly."'Not at all,' I replied, hiding my surprise as well as I could, 'butreally I'm afraid I'm intruding. If you'll allow me--'"He waved his huge gaunt hands. 'We're not going to lose you now we'vegot you,' he said, with a dry laugh.  'It's seldom we have company, andnow we've got you we'll keep you.  My son's eyes are bad, and he can'tstand the light.  Ah, here is Anne.'"As he spoke the old woman entered, and, eyeing me stealthily, began tolay the cloth, while my host, taking a chair the other side of thehearth, sat looking silently into the fire.  The table set, the old womanbrought in a pair of fowls ready carved in a dish, and placing threechairs, left the room.  The old man hesitated a moment, and then, risingfrom his chair, placed a large screen in front of the fire and slowlyextinguished the candles."'Blind man's holiday,' he said, with clumsy jocosity, and groping hisway to the door opened it.  Somebody came back into the room with him,and in a slow, uncertain fashion took a seat at the table, and thestrangest voice I have ever heard broke a silence which was fast becomingoppressive."'A cold night,' it said slowly."I replied in the affirmative, and light or no light, fell to with anappetite which had only been sharpened by the snack in the middle of theday.  It was somewhat difficult eating in the dark, and it was evidentfrom the behaviour of my invisible companions that they were as unused todining under such circumstances as I was.  We ate in silence until theold woman blundered into the room with some sweets and put them with acrash upon the table."'Are you a stranger about here?' inquired the curious voice again."I replied in the affirmative, and murmured something about my luck instumbling upon such a good dinner."'Stumbling is a very good word for it,' said the voice grimly.  'Youhave forgotten the port, father.'"'So I have,' said the old man, rising.  'It's a bottle of the"Celebrated" to-day; I will get it myself.'"He felt his way to the door, and closing it behind him, left me alonewith my unseen neighbour.  There was something so strange about the wholebusiness that I must confess to more than a slight feeling of uneasiness."My host seemed to be absent a long time.  I heard the man opposite laydown his fork and spoon, and half fancied I could see a pair of wild eyesshining through the gloom like a cat's."With a growing sense of uneasiness I pushed my chair back.  It caughtthe hearthrug, and in my efforts to disentangle it the screen fell overwith a crash and in the flickering light of the fire I saw the face ofthe creature opposite.  With a sharp catch of my breath I left my chairand stood with clenched fists beside it.  Man or beast, which was it?The flame leaped up and then went out, and in the mere red glow of thefire it looked more devilish than before."For a few moments we regarded each other in silence; then the dooropened and the old man returned.  He stood aghast as he saw the warmfirelight, and then approaching the table mechanically put down a coupleof bottles."'I beg your pardon,' said I, reassured by his presence, 'but I haveaccidentally overturned the screen.  Allow me to replace it.'"'No,' said the old man, gently, 'let it be."'We have had enough of the dark.  I'll give you a light.'"He struck a match and slowly lit the candles.  Then--I saw that the manopposite had but the remnant of a face, a gaunt wolfish face in which oneunquenched eye, the sole remaining feature, still glittered.  I wasgreatly moved, some suspicion of the truth occurring to me."'My son was injured some years ago in a burning house,' said the oldman.  'Since then we have lived a very retired life.  When you came tothe door we--' his voice trembled, 'that is-my son---'"'I thought," said the son simply, 'that it would be better for me not tocome to the dinner-table.  But it happens to be my birthday, and myfather would not hear of my dining alone, so we hit upon this foolishplan of dining in the dark.  I'm sorry I startled you.'"'I am sorry,' said I, as I reached across the table and gripped hishand, 'that I am such a fool; but it was only in the dark that youstartled me.'"From a faint tinge in the old man's cheek and a certain pleasantsoftening of the poor solitary eye in front of me I secretlycongratulated myself upon this last remark."'We never see a friend,' said the old man, apologetically, 'and thetemptation to have company was too much for us.  Besides, I don't knowwhat else you could have done.'"'Nothing else half so good, I'm sure,' said I."'Come,' said my host, with almost a sprightly air.  'Now we know eachother, draw our chairs to the fire and let's keep this birthday in aproper fashion.'"He drew a small table to the fire for the glasses and produced a box ofcigars, and placing a chair for the old servant, sternly bade her to sitdown and drink.  If the talk was not sparkling, it did not lack forvivacity, and we were soon as merry a party as I have ever seen.  Thenight wore on so rapidly that we could hardly believe our ears when in alull in the conversation a clock in the hall struck twelve."'A last toast before we retire,' said my host, pitching the end of hiscigar into the fire and turning to the small table."We had drunk several before this, but there was something impressive inthe old man's manner as he rose and took up his glass.  His tall figureseemed to get taller, and his voice rang as he gazed proudly at hisdisfigured son."'The health of the children my boy saved!' he said, and drained hisglass at a draught."End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Three at Table, by W.W.

IN THE MACHINETHE ROLL-CALLPART ICHAPTER ITHE NEW LODGINGIIn the pupils' room of the offices of Lucas & Enwright, architects,Russell Square, Bloomsbury, George Edwin Cannon, an articled pupil,leaned over a large drawing-board and looked up at Mr. Enwright, thehead of the firm, who with cigarette and stick was on his way out afterwhat he called a good day's work. It was past six o'clock on an eveningin early July 1901. To George's right was an open door leading to theprincipals' room, and to his left another open door leading to morerooms and to the staircase. The lofty chambers were full of lassitude;but round about George, who was working late, there floated the tonicvapour of conscious virtue. Haim, the factotum, could be seen and heardmoving in his cubicle which guarded the offices from the stairs. In therooms shortly to be deserted and locked up, and in the decline of theday, the three men were drawn together like survivors."I gather you're going to change your abode," said Mr. Enwright, havingstopped."Did Mr. Orgreave tell you, then?" George asked."Well, he didn't exactly tell me...."John Orgreave was Mr. Enwright's junior partner; and for nearly twoyears, since his advent in London from the Five Towns, George had livedwith Mr. and Mrs. Orgreave at Bedford Park. The Orgreaves, too, sprangfrom the Five Towns. John's people and George's people were closelyentwined in the local annals.Pupil and principal glanced discreetly at one another, exchanging insilence vague, malicious, unutterable critical verdicts upon both JohnOrgreave and his wife."Well, I am!" said George at length."Where are you going to?""Haven't settled a bit," said George. "I wish I could live in Paris.""Paris wouldn't be much good to you yet," Mr. Enwright laughedbenevolently."I suppose it wouldn't. Besides, of course----"George spoke in a tone of candid deferential acceptance, which flatteredMr. Enwright very much, for it was the final proof of the prestige whichthe grizzled and wrinkled and peculiar Fellow and Member of the Councilof the Royal Institute of British Architects had acquired in theestimation of that extremely independent, tossing sprig, George EdwinCannon. Mr. Enwright had recently been paying a visit to Paris, andGeorge had been sitting for the Intermediate Examination. "You can joinme here for a few days after the exam., if you care to," Mr. Enwrighthad sent over. It was George's introduction to the Continent, and thecircumstances of it were almost ideal. For a week the deeply experiencedconnoisseur of all the arts had had the fine, eager, responsive virginmind in his power. Day after day he had watched and guided it amidentirely new sensations. Never had Mr. Enwright enjoyed himself morepurely, and at the close he knew with satisfaction that he had put Parisin a proper perspective for George, and perhaps saved the youth fromyears of groping misapprehension. As for George, all his preconceivednotions about Paris had been destroyed or shaken. In the quadrangles ofthe Louvre, for example, Mr. Enwright, pointing to the under part of thestone bench that foots so much of the walls, had said: "Look at thatcurve." Nothing else. No ecstasies about the sculptures of Jean Goujonand Carpeaux, or about the marvellous harmony of the East facade! But aflick of the cane towards the half-hidden moulding! And George had feltwith a thrill what an exquisite curve and what an original curve andwhat a modest curve that curve was. Suddenly and magically his eyes hadbeen opened. Or it might have been that a deceitful mist had rolled awayand the real Louvre been revealed in its esoteric and sole authenticbeauty...."Why don't you try Chelsea?" said Mr. Enwright over his shoulder,proceeding towards the stairs."I was thinking of Chelsea.""You were!" Mr. Enwright halted again for an instant. "It's the onlyplace in London where the structure of society is anything like Paris.Why, dash it, in the King's Road the grocers know each other'sbusiness!" Mr. Enwright made the last strange remark to the outer door,and vanished."Funny cove!" George commented tolerantly to Mr. Haim, who passedthrough the room immediately afterwards to his nightly task ofcollecting and inspecting the scattered instruments on the principal'saugust drawing-board.But Mr. Haim, though possibly he smiled ever so little, would notcompromise himself by an endorsement of the criticism of his employer.George was a mere incident in the eternal career of Mr. Haim at Lucas &Enwright's.When the factotum came back into the pupils' room, George stood upstraight and smoothed his trousers and gazed admiringly at his elegantbright socks."Let me see," said George in a very friendly manner. "_You_ livesomewhere in Chelsea, don't you?""Yes," answered Mr. Haim."Whereabouts, if it isn't a rude question?""Well," said Mr. Haim, confidentially and benignantly, captivated byGeorge's youthful charm, "it's near the Redcliffe Arms." He mentionedthe Redcliffe Arms as he might have mentioned the Bank, PiccadillyCircus, or Gibraltar. "Alexandra Grove. No. 8. To tell you the truth, Iown the house.""The deuce you do!""Yes. The leasehold, that is, of course. No freeholds knocking aboutloose in that district!"George saw a new and unsuspected Mr. Haim. He was impressed. And he wasglad that he had never broken the office tradition of treating Mr. Haimwith a respect not usually accorded to factotums. He saw aproperty-owner, a tax-payer, and a human being behind the spectacles ofthe shuffling, rather shabby, ceremonious familiar that pervaded thoserooms daily from before ten till after six. He grew curious about aliving phenomenon that hitherto had never awakened his curiosity."Were you really looking for accommodation?" demanded Mr. Haim suavely.George hesitated. "Yes.""Perhaps I have something that might suit you."Events, disguised as mere words, seemed to George to be pushing himforward."I should like to have a look at it," he said. He had to say it; therewas no alternative.Mr. Haim raised a hand. "Any evening that happens to be convenient.""What about to-night, then?""Certainly," Mr. Haim agreed. For a moment George apprehended that Mr.Haim was going to invite him to dinner. But Mr. Haim was not going toinvite him to dinner. "About nine, shall we say?" he suggested, with acourtliness softer even than usual.Later, George said that he would lock up the office himself and leavethe key with the housekeeper."You can't miss the place," said Mr. Haim on leaving. "It's between theWorkhouse and the Redcliffe."IIAt the corner dominated by the Queen's Elm, which on the great routefrom Piccadilly Circus to Putney was a public-house and halt second onlyin importance to the Redcliffe Arms, night fell earlier than it ought tohave done, owing to a vast rain-cloud over Chelsea. A few dropsdescended, but so warm and so gently that they were not like real rain,and sentimentalists could not believe that they would wet. People,arriving mysteriously out of darkness, gathered sparsely on thepavements, lingered a few moments, and were swallowed by omnibuses thatbore them obscurely away. At intervals an individual got out of anomnibus and adventured hurriedly forth and was lost in the gloom. Theomnibuses, all white, trotted on an inward curve to the pavement,stopped while the conductor, with hand raised to the bell-string,murmured apathetically the names of streets and of public-houses, andthen they jerked off again on an outward curve to the impatient doubleting of the bell. To the east was a high defile of hospitals, and to thewest the Workhouse tower faintly imprinted itself on the sombre sky.The drops of rain grew very large and heavy, and the travellers, insteadof waiting on the kerb, withdrew to the shelter of the wall of theQueen's Elm. George was now among the group, precipitated like the rest,as it were, out of the solution of London. George was of the age whichdoes not admit rain or which believes that it is immune from the usualconsequences of exposure to rain. When advised, especially by women, todefend himself against the treacheries of the weather, he alwaysprotested confidently that he would 'be all right.' Thus with a stickand a straw hat he would affront terrible dangers. It was a species ofvalour which the event often justified. Indeed he generally was allright. But to-night, afoot on the way from South Kensington Station in aregion quite unfamiliar to him, he was intimidated by the slappingmenace of the big drops. Reality faced him. His scared thought ran:"Unless I do something at once I shall get wet through." Impossible toappear drenched at old Haim's! So he had abandoned all his pretensionsto a magical invulnerability, and rushed under the eave of the Queen'sElm to join the omnibus group.He did not harmonize with the omnibus group, being both too elegant andtoo high-spirited. His proper role in the circumstances would have beento 'jump into a hansom'; but there were no empty hansoms, and moreover,for certain reasons of finance, he had sworn off hansoms until a givendate. He regarded the situation as 'rather a lark,' and he somehow knewthat the group understood and appreciated and perhaps resented hissuperior and tolerant attitude. An omnibus rolled palely into theradiance of the Queen's Elm lamp, the horses' flanks and the loftydriver's apron gleaming with rain. He sprang towards the vehicle; thewhole group sprang. "Full inside!" snapped the conductor inexorably.Ting, ting! It was gone, glimmering with its enigmatic load into thedistance. George turned again to the wall, humiliated. It seemed wrongthat the conductor should have included him with the knot of commonomnibus-travellers and late workers. The conductor ought to havedifferentiated.... He put out a hand. The rain had capriciously ceased!He departed gaily and triumphantly. He was re-endowed with the magicalinvulnerability.The background of his mind was variegated. The incidents of thetremendous motor-car race from Paris to Berlin, which had finishednearly a week earlier, still glowed on it. And the fact that King EdwardVII had driven in a car from Pall Mall to Windsor Castle in sixtyminutes was beautifully present. Then, he was slightly worriedconcerning the Mediterranean Fleet. He knew nothing about it, but as agood citizen he suspected in idle moments, like a number of other goodcitizens, that all was not quite well with the Mediterranean Fleet. Asfor the war, he had only begun to be interested in the war within thelast six months, and already he was sick of it. He knew that the Boershad just wrecked a British military train, and his attitude towards suchmethods of fighting was rather severe and scornful; he did not regardthem as 'war.' However, the apparent permanence of the war wassplendidly compensated by the victory of the brothers Doherty over theAmerican lawn-tennis champions in the Gentlemen's Doubles at Wimbledon.Who could have expected the brothers to win after the defeat of R.H. byMr. Gore in the Singles? George had most painfully feared that theAmericans would conquer, and their overthrowing by the twin brothersindicated to George, who took himself for a serious student of affairs,that Britain was continuing to exist, and that the new nationalself-depreciative, yearning for efficiency might possibly be ratherabsurd after all.In the midst of these and similar thoughts, and of innumerable minorthoughts about himself, in the very centre of his mind and occupyingnearly the whole of it, was the vast thought, the obsession, of his ownpotential power and its fulfilment. George's egotism was terrific, andas right as any other natural phenomenon. He had to get on. Much moneywas included in his scheme, but simply as a by-product. He had to be agreat architect, and--equally important--he had to be publiclyrecognized as a great architect, and recognition could not come withoutmoney. For him, the entire created universe was the means to his end. Hewould not use it unlawfully, but he would use it. He was using it, aswell as he yet knew how, and with an independence that was as completeas it was unconscious. In regard to matters upon which his instinct hadnot suggested a course of action, George was always ready enough to betaught; indeed his respect for an expert was truly deferential. But whenhis instinct had begun to operate he would consult nobody and considernobody, being deeply sure that infallible wisdom had been granted tohim. (Nor did experience seem to teach him.) Thus, in the affair of aLondon lodging, though he was still two years from his majority and hadno resources save the purse of his stepfather, Edwin Clayhanger, he haddecided to leave the Orgreaves without asking or even informing hisparents. In his next letter home he would no doubt inform them,casually, of what he meant to do or actually had done, and if objectionsfollowed he would honestly resent them.A characteristic example of his independence had happened when at theunripe age of seventeen he left the Five Towns for London. Upon hismother's marriage to Edwin Clayhanger his own name had been informallychanged for him to Clayhanger. But a few days before the day ofdeparture he had announced that, as Clayhanger was not his own name andthat he preferred his own name, he should henceforth be known as'Cannon,' his father's name. He did not invite discussion. Mr.Clayhanger had thereupon said to him privately and as one man of theworld to another: "But you aren't really entitled to the name Cannon,sonny." "Why?" "Because your father was what's commonly known as abigamist, and his marriage with your mother was not legal. I thought I'dtake this opportunity of telling you. You needn't say anything to yourmother--unless of course you feel you must." To which George hadreplied: "No, I won't. But if Cannon was my father's name I think I'llhave it all the same." And he did have it. The bigamy of his father didnot apparently affect him. Upon further inquiry he learnt that hisfather might be alive or might be dead, but that if alive he was inAmerica.The few words from Mr. Enwright about Chelsea had sufficed to turnChelsea into Elysium, Paradise, almost into Paris. No other quarter ofLondon was inhabitable by a rising architect. As soon as Haim had goneGeorge had begun to look up Chelsea in the office library, and as Mr.Enwright happened to be an active member of the Society for the Surveyof the Memorials of Greater London, the library served him well. In anhour and a half he had absorbed something of the historical topographyof Chelsea. He knew that the Fulham Road upon which he was now walkingwas a boundary of Chelsea. He knew that the Queen's Elm public-house hadits name from the tradition that Elizabeth had once sheltered from ashower beneath an elm tree which stood at that very corner. He knew thatChelsea had been a 'village of palaces,' and what was the function ofthe Thames in the magnificent life of that village. The secret residenceof Turner in Chelsea, under the strange _alias_ of Admiral Booth,excited George's admiration; he liked the idea of hidden retreats andsplendid, fanciful pseudonyms. But the master-figure of Chelsea forGeorge was Sir Thomas More. He could see Sir Thomas More walking in hismajestic garden by the river with the King's arm round his neck, andHolbein close by, and respectful august prelates and a nagging wife inthe background. And he could see Sir Thomas More taking his barge forthe last journey to the Tower, and Sir Thomas More's daughter comingback in the same barge with her father's head on board. Curious! Heenvied Sir Thomas More."Darned bad tower for a village of palaces!" he thought, not of theTower of London, but of the tower of the Workhouse which he was nowapproaching. He thought he could design an incomparably better towerthan that. And he saw himself in the future, the architect of vastmonuments, strolling in a grand garden of his own at evening with otherdistinguished and witty persons.But there were high-sounding names in the history of Chelsea besidesthose of More and Turner. Not names of people! Cremorne and Ranelagh!Cremorne to the west and Ranelagh to the east. The legend of thesevanished resorts of pleasure and vice stirred his longings and hissense of romantic beauty--especially Ranelagh with its Rotunda. (Hewanted, when the time came, to be finely vicious, as he wanted to beeverything. An architect could not be great without being everything.)He projected himself into the Rotunda, with its sixty windows, itscountless refreshment-boxes, its huge paintings, and the orchestra inthe middle, and the expensive and naughty crowd walking round and roundand round on the matting, and the muffled footsteps and the swish oftrains on the matting, and the specious smiles and whispers, and theblare of the band and the smell of the lamps and candles.... Earl'sCourt was a poor, tawdry, unsightly thing after that.When he had passed under the Workhouse tower he came to a side streetwhich, according to Haim's description of the neighbourhood, ought tohave been Alexandra Grove. The large lamp on the corner, however, gaveno indication, nor in the darkness could any sign be seen on the blindwall of either of the corner houses in Fulham Road. Doubtless in daytimethe street had a visible label, but the borough authorities evidentlybelieved that night endowed the stranger with powers of divination.George turned hesitant down the mysterious gorge, which had two dimlamps of its own, and which ended in a high wall, whereat could bedescried unattainable trees--possibly the grove of Alexandra. Silenceand a charmed stillness held the gorge, while in Fulham Road not ahundred yards away omnibuses and an occasional hansom rattled along inan ordinary world. George soon decided that he was not in AlexandraGrove, on account of the size of the houses. He could not conceive Mr.Haim owning one of them. They stood lofty in the gloom, in pairs,secluded from the pavement by a stucco garden-wall and low bushes. Theywere double-fronted, and their doors were at the summits of flights ofblanched steps that showed through the bars of iron gates. They hadthree stories above a basement. Still, he looked for No. 8. But just asthe street had no name, so the houses had no numbers. No. 16 alone couldbe distinguished; it had figures on its faintly illuminated fanlight. Hewalked back, idly counting.Then, amid the curtained and shuttered facades, he saw, across the road,a bright beam from a basement. He crossed and peeped through a gate, andan interior was suddenly revealed to him. Near the window of a room sata young woman bending over a table. A gas-jet on a bracket in the wall,a few inches higher than her head and a foot distant from it, threw astrong radiance on her face and hair. The luminous living picture,framed by the window in blackness, instantly entranced him. All thesplendid images of the past faded and were confuted and invalidated anddestroyed by this intense reality so present and so near to him.(Nevertheless, for a moment he thought of her as the daughter of SirThomas More.) She was drawing. She was drawing with her whole mind andheart. At intervals, scarcely moving her head, she would glance aside ata paper to her left on the table.... She seemed to search it, to dragsome secret out of it, and then she would resume her drawing. She wasneither dark nor fair; she was comely, perhaps beautiful; she hadbeautiful lips, and her nose, behind the nostrils, joined the cheek in alovely contour, like a tiny bulb. Yes, she was superb. But what masteredhim was less her fresh physical charm than the rapt and extreme vitalityof her existing.... He knew from her gestures and the tools on the tablethat she could be no amateur. She was a professional. He thought:Chelsea!... Marvellous place, Chelsea! He ought to have found that outlong ago. He imagined Chelsea full of such pictures--the only true homeof beauty and romance.Then the impact of a single idea startled his blood. He went hot. Heflushed. He had tingling sensations all down his back, and in his legsand in his arms. It was as though he had been caught in a dubioussituation. Though he was utterly innocent, he felt as though he hadsomething to be ashamed of. The idea was: she resembled old Haim,facially! Ridiculous idea! But she did resemble old Haim, particularlyin the lobal termination of the nose. And in the lips too. And there wasa vague, general resemblance. Absurd! It was a fancy.... He would nothave cared for anybody to be watching him then, to surprise him watchingher. He heard unmistakable footsteps on the pavement. A policeman darklyapproached. Policemen at times can be very apposite. George moved hisgaze and looked with admirable casualness around."Officer, is this Alexandra Grove?" (His stepfather had taught him toaddress all policemen as 'officer.')"It is, sir.""Oh! Well, which is No. 8? There're no numbers.""You couldn't be much nearer to it, sir," said the policeman dryly, andpointed to a large number, fairly visible, on the wide gate-post. Georgehad not inspected the gate-post."Oh! Thanks!"He mounted the steps, and in the thick gloom of the portico fumbled forthe bell and rang it. He was tremendously excited and expectant andapprehensive and puzzled. He heard rain flatly spitting in big drops onthe steps. He had not noticed till then that it had begun again. Thebell jangled below. The light in the basement went out. He flushed anew.He thought, trembling: "She's coming to the door herself!"III"It had occurred to me some time ago," said Mr. Haim, "that if ever youshould be wanting rooms I might be able to suit you.""Really!" George murmured. After having been shown into the room by theyoung woman, who had at once disappeared, he was now recovering from thenervousness of that agitating entry and resuming his normal demeanour ofan experienced and well-balanced man of the world. He felt relieved thatshe had gone, and yet he regretted her departure extremely, and hopedagainst fear that she would soon return."Yes!" said Mr. Haim, as it were triumphantly, like one who hadwhispered to himself during long years: "The hour will come." The hourhad come.Mr. Haim was surprising to George. The man seemed much older in his ownparlour than at the office--his hair thinner and greyer, and his facemore wrinkled. But the surprising part of him was that he had a home andwas master in it, and possessed interests other than those of the firmof Lucas & Enwright. George had never until that day conceived the manapart from Russell Square. And here he was smoking a cigarette in aneasy-chair and wearing red morocco slippers, and being called 'father'by a really stunning creature in a thin white blouse and a blue skirt.The young girl, opening the front door, had said: "Do you want to seefather?" And instantly the words were out George had realized that shemight have said: "_Did_ you want to see father?" ... in the idiom of theshop-girl or clerk, and that if she had said 'did' he would have beengravely disappointed and hurt. But she had not. Of course she had not!Of course she was incapable of such a locution, and it was silly of himto have thought otherwise, even momentarily. She was an artist. Entirelydifferent from the blonde and fluffy Mrs. John Orgreave--(and a goodthing too, for Mrs. John with her eternal womanishness had got on hisnerves)--Miss Haim was without doubt just as much a lady, and probably ajolly sight more cultured, in the true sense. Yet Miss Haim had not inthe least revealed herself to him in the hall as she indicated thedepository for his hat and stick and opened the door of thesitting-room. She had barely smiled. Indeed she had not smiled. She hadnot mentioned the weather. On the other hand, she had not been prim orrepellent. She had revealed nothing of herself. Her one feat had been tostimulate mightily his curiosity and his imagination concerningher--rampant enough even before he entered the house!The house--what he saw of it--suited her and set her off, and, as shewas different from Mrs. John, so was the house different from thepolished, conventional abode of Mrs. John at Bedford Park. To George'staste it knocked Bedford Park to smithereens. In the parlour, forinstance, an oak chest, an oak settee, an oak gate-table, one tapestriedeasy chair, several rush-bottomed chairs, a very small brass fender, aself-coloured wall-paper of warm green, two or three old engravings inmaple-wood or tarnished gilt frames, several small portraits inmaple-wood frames, brass candlesticks on the mantelpiece and no clock,self-coloured brown curtains across the windows (two windows oppositeeach other at either end of the long room), sundry rugs on thedark-stained floor, and so on! Not too much furniture, and not too muchsymmetry either. An agreeable and original higgledy-piggledyness! Theroom was lighted by a fairly large oil-lamp, with a paper shadehand-painted in a design of cupids--delightful personal design, rough,sketchy, adorable! She had certainly done it.George sat on the oak settle, fronting the old man in the easy chair. Itwas a hard, smooth oak settle; it had no upholstering nor cushion; butGeorge liked it."May I smoke?" asked George."Please do. Please do," said Mr. Haim, who was smoking a cigarettehimself, with courteous hospitality. However, it was a match and not acigarette that he offered to George, who opened his own dandiacal case."I stayed rather late at the office to-night," said George, as he blewout those great clouds with which young men demonstrate to the worldthat the cigarette is actually lighted. And as Mr. Haim, who wasaccustomed to the boastings of articled pupils, made no comment, Georgeproceeded, lolling on the settle and showing his socks: "You know, Ilike Chelsea. I've always had a fancy for it." He was just about tocontinue cosmopolitanly: "It's the only part of London that's likeParis. The people in the King's Road," etc., when fortunately heremembered that Mr. Haim must have overheard these remarks of Mr.Enwright, and ceased, rather awkwardly. Whereupon Mr. Haim suggestedthat he should see the house, and George said eagerly that he shouldlike to see the house."We've got one bedroom more than we want," Mr. Haim remarked as he ledGeorge to the hall."Oh yes!" said George politely.The hall had a small bracket-lamp, which Mr. Haim unhooked, and then heopened a door opposite to the door of the room which they had quitted."Now this is a bedroom," said he, holding the lamp high.George was startled. A ground-floor bedroom would have been unthinkableat Bedford Park. Still, in a flat.... Moreover, the idea had piquancy.The bedroom was sparsely furnished. Instead of a wardrobe it had acorner curtained off with cretonne."A good-sized room," said Mr. Haim."Very," said George. "Two windows, too, like the drawing-room." Thenthey went upstairs to the first floor, and saw two more bedrooms, eachwith two windows. One of them was Miss Haim's; there was a hat hung onthe looking-glass, and a table with a few books on it. They did not goto the second floor. The staircase to the second floor was boarded up atthe point where it turned."That's all there is," said Mr. Haim on the landing. "The studio peoplehave the second floor, but they don't use my front door." He spoke thelast words rather defiantly."I see," said George untruthfully, for he was mystified. But the mysterydid not trouble him.There was no bathroom, and this did not trouble him either, though atBedford Park he could never have seriously considered a house without abathroom."You could have your choice of ground floor or first floor," said Mr.Haim confidentially, still on the landing. He moved the lamp about, andthe shadows moved accordingly on the stairs."Oh, I don't mind in the least," George answered. "Whichever would suityou best.""We could give you breakfast, and use of sitting-room," Mr. Haimproceeded in a low tone. "But no other meals.""That would be all right," said George cheerfully. "I often dine intown. Like that I can get in a bit of extra work at the office, yousee.""Except on Sundays," Mr. Haim corrected himself. "You'd want your mealson Sundays, of course. But I expect you're out a good deal, what withone thing or another.""Oh, I am!" George concurred.The place was perfect, and he was determined to establish himself in it.Nothing could baulk him. A hitch would have desolated him completely."I may as well show you the basement while I'm about it," said Mr. Haim."Do!" said George ardently.They descended. The host was very dignified, as invariably at theoffice, and his accent never lapsed from the absolute correctness of aneducated Londoner. His deportment gave distinction and safety even tothe precipitous and mean basement stairs, which were of stone worn as bythe knees of pilgrims in a crypt. All kinds of irregular pipes ran aboutalong the ceiling of the basement; some were covered by ancient layersof wall-paper and some were not; some were painted yellow, and some werepainted grey, and some were not painted. Mr. Haim exhibited first thekitchen. George saw a morsel of red amber behind black bars, a whitedeal table and a black cat crouched on a corner of the table, a chair,and a tea-cloth drying over the back thereof. He liked the scene; itreminded him of the Five Towns, and showed reassuringly--if he neededreassurance, which he did not--that all houses are the same at heart.Then Mr. Haim, flashing a lamp-ray on the coal-hole and the area door ashe turned, crossed the stone passage into the other basement room."This is our second sitting-room," said Mr. Haim, entering.There she was at work, rapt, exactly as George had seen her from theoutside. But now he saw the right side of her face instead of the left.It was wonderful to him that within the space of a few minutes he shouldhave developed from an absolute stranger to her into an acquaintance ofthe house, walking about in it, peering into its recesses, disturbingits secrets, which were hers. But she remained as mysterious, aswithdrawn and intangible, as ever. And then she shifted round suddenlyon the chair, and her absorbed, intent face softened into a mostbeautiful, simple smile--a smile of welcome. An astonishing andcelestial change!... She was not one of those queer girls, as perhapsshe might have been. She was a girl of natural impulses. He smiled back,uplifted."My daughter designs bookbindings," said Mr. Haim. "Happens to be verybusy to-night on something urgent."He advanced towards her, George following."Awfully good!" George murmured enthusiastically, and quite sincerely,though he was not at all in a condition to judge the design. Strange,that he should come to the basement of an ordinary stock-size house inAlexandra Grove to see bookbindings in the making! This was a design fora boy's book. He had possessed many such books. But it had neveroccurred to him that the gay bindings of them were each the result ofindividual human thought and labour. He pulled at his cigarette.There was a sound of pushing and rattling outside."What's that?" exclaimed Mr. Haim."It's the area door. I bolted it. I dare say it's Mrs. Lobley," said thegirl indifferently.Mr. Haim moved sharply."Why did you bolt it, Marguerite? No, I'll go myself."He picked up the lamp, which he had put down, and shuffled quickly outin his red morocco slippers, closing the door.Marguerite? Yes, it suited her; and it was among the most romantic ofnames. It completed the picture. She now seemed to be listening andwaiting, her attention on the unseen area door. He felt shy and yetvery happy alone with her. Voices were distinctly heard. Who was Mrs.Lobley? Was Mr. Haim a little annoyed with his daughter, and wasMarguerite exquisitely defiant? Time hung. The situation was slightlyawkward, he thought. And it was obscure, alluring.... He stood there,below the level of the street, shut in with those beings unknown,provocative, and full of half-divined implications. And all Chelsea wasaround him and all London around Chelsea."Father won't be a moment," said the girl. "It's only the charwoman.""Oh! That's quite all right," he answered effusively, and turning to thedesign: "The outlining of that lettering fairly beats me, you know.""Not really!... I get that from father, of course."Mr. Haim was famous in the office as a letterer.She sat idly glancing at her own design, her plump, small hands lying inthe blue lap. George compared her, unspeakably to her advantage, withthe kind, coarse young woman at the chop-house, whom he had asked totelephone to the Orgreaves for him, and for whom he had been consciousof a faint penchant."I can't colour it by gaslight," said Marguerite Haim. "I shall have todo that in the morning."He imagined her at work again early in the morning. Within a week or sohe might be living in this house with this girl. He would be,--watchingher life! Seducing prospect, scarcely credible! He remembered havingheard when he first went to Lucas & Enwright's that old Haim was awidower."Do excuse me," said Mr. Haim, urgently apologetic, reappearing.A quarter of an hour later, George had left the house, having acceptedMr. Haim's terms without the least argument. In five days he was to bean inmate of No. 8 Alexandra Grove. The episode presented itself to himas a vast, romantic adventure, staggering and enchanting. His luckcontinued, for the rain-cloud was spent. He got into an Earl's Courtbus. The dimly perceived travellers in it seemed all of them in a newsense to be romantic and mysterious.... "Yes," he thought, "I did saygood-night to her, but I didn't shake hands."CHAPTER IIMARGUERITEIMore than two months later George came into the office in Russell Squarean hour or so after his usual time. He had been to South KensingtonMuseum to look up, for professional purposes, some scale drawings ofarchitectural detail which were required for a restaurant then rising inPiccadilly under the direction of Lucas & Enwright. In his room Mr.Everard Lucas was already seated. Mr. Lucas was another articled pupilof the firm; being a remote cousin of the late senior partner, he hadentered on special terms. Although a year older than George he was lessadvanced, for whereas George had passed the Intermediate, Mr. Lucas hadnot. But in manly beauty, in stylishness, in mature tact, and especiallyin persuasive charm, he could beat George."Hallo!" Lucas greeted. "How do you feel? Fit?""Fit?" said George enthusiastically "I feel so fit I could push in theside of a house.""What did I tell you?" said Lucas.George rubbed his hand all over Lucas's hair, and Lucas thereupon seizedGeorge's other hand and twisted his arm, and a struggle followed. Inthis way they would often lovingly salute each other of a morning. Lucashad infected George with the craze for physical exercises as a remedyfor all ills and indiscretions, including even late nights and excessivesmoking. The competition between them to excel in the quality of fitnesswas acute, and sometimes led to strange challenges. After a littlediscussion about springing from the toes, Lucas now accused George'stoes of a lack of muscularity, and upon George denying the charge, heasserted that George could not hang from the mantelpiece by his toes.They were both men of the world, capable of great heights of dignity,figures in an important business, aspirants to a supremeart and profession. They were at that moment in a beautifullate-eighteenth-century house of a stately and renowned square, and in aroom whose proportions and ornament admittedly might serve as anexemplar to the student; and not the least lovely feature of the roomwas the high carved mantelpiece. The morning itself was historic, for itwas the very morning upon which, President McKinley having expired,Theodore Roosevelt ascended the throne and inaugurated a new era.Nevertheless, such was their peculiar time of life that George, a minutelater, was as a fact hanging by his toes from the mantelpiece, whileLucas urged him to keep the blood out of his head. George had stood onhis hands on a box and lodged his toes on the mantelpiece, and thenraised his hands--and Lucas had softly pushed the box away. George'swatch was dangling against his flushed cheek."Put that box back, you cuckoo!" George exploded chokingly.Then the door opened and Mr. Enwright appeared. Simultaneously someshillings slipped out of George's pocket and rolled about the floor. Thehour was Mr. Enwright's customary hour of arrival, but he had no fairexcuse for passing through that room instead of proceeding along thecorridor direct to the principals' room. His aspect, as he gazed atGeorge's hair and at the revealed sateen back of George's waistcoat, wasunusual. Mr. Enwright commonly entered the office full of an intense andaggrieved consciousness of his own existence--of his insomnia, of thereaction upon himself of some client's stupidity, of the necessity ofgoing out again in order to have his chin lacerated by his favourite andhated Albanian barber. But now he had actually forgotten himself."What _is_ this?" he demanded.Lucas having quickly restored the box, George subsided dangerouslythereon, and arose in a condition much disarrayed and confused, andbeheld Mr. Enwright with shame."I--I was just looking to see if the trap of the chimney was shut," saidGeorge. It was foolish in the extreme, but it was the best he could do,and after all it was a rather marvellous invention. Lucas sat down andmade no remark."You might respect the mantelpiece," said Mr. Enwright bitterly, andwent into the principals' room, where John Orgreave could be hearddictating letters. George straightened his clothes and picked up hismoney, and the two men of the world giggled nervously at each other.Mr. Haim next disturbed them. The shabby, respectable old man smiledvaguely, with averted glance."I think he's heard the result," said he.Both men knew that 'he' was Mr. Enwright, and that the 'result' was theresult of the open competition for the L150,000 Law Courts which a proudprovincial city proposed to erect for itself. The whole office hadworked very hard on the drawings for that competition throughout thesummer, while cursing the corporation which had chosen so unusual a datefor sending-in day. Even Lucas had worked. George's ideas for certaindetails, upon which he had been engaged on the evening of hisintroduction to Mr. Haim's household, had been accepted by Mr. Enwright.As for Mr. Enwright, though the exigencies of his beard, and his regularmorning habit of inveighing against the profession at great length, andhis inability to decide where he should lunch, generally prevented himfrom beginning the day until three o'clock in the afternoon, Mr.Enwright had given many highly concentrated hours of creative energy tothe design. And Mr. Haim had adorned the sheets with the finestlettering. The design was held to be very good. The principals knew theidentity of all the other chief competitors and their powers, and theyknew also the idiosyncrasies of the Assessor; and their expert andimpartial opinion was that the Lucas & Enwright design ought to win andwould win. This view, indeed, was widespread in the arcana of thearchitectural world. George had gradually grown certain of victory. Andyet, at Mr. Haim's words, his hopes sank horribly away."Have we won?" he asked sharply."That I can't say, Mr. Cannon," answered Haim."Well, then, how do you know he's heard? Has he told you?""No," said the factotum mysteriously. "But I think he's heard." And uponthis Mr. Haim slouched off quite calmly. Often he had assisted at theadvent of such vital news in the office--news obtained in advance by theprincipals through secret channels--and often the news had been bad. Butthe firm's calamities seemed never to affect the smoothness of Mr.Haim's earthly passage.The door into the principals' room opened, and Mr. Enwright's headshowed. The gloomy, resenting eyes fixed George for an instant."Well, you've lost that competition," said Mr. Enwright, and he steppedinto full view. His unseen partner had ceased to dictate, and theshorthand-clerk could be heard going out by the other door."No!" said George, in a long, outraged murmur. The news seemedincredible and quite disastrous; and yet at the same time had he not, inone unvisited corner of his mind, always foreknown it? Suddenly he wasdistressed, discouraged, disillusioned about the whole of life. Hethought that Everard Lucas, screwing up a compass, was strangelyunmoved. But Mr. Enwright ignored Lucas."Who's got it?" George asked."Whinburn.""That chap!... Where are _we_?""Nowhere.""Not placed?""Not in it. Skelting's second. And Grant third. I shouldn't have mindedso much if Grant had got it. There was something to be said for hisscheme. I knew _we_ shouldn't get it. I knew that perfectly well--notwith Corver assessing."George wondered that his admired principal should thus state the exactopposite of what he had so often affirmed during the last few weeks.People were certainly very queer, even the best of them. The perceptionof this fact added to his puzzled woe."But Whinburn's design is grotesque!" he protested borrowing one of Mr.Enwright's adjectives."Of course it is.""Then why does Sir Hugh Corver go and give him the award? Surely he mustknow----""Know!" Mr. Enwright growled, destroying Sir Hugh and his reputation andhis pretensions with one single monosyllable."Then why did they make him Assessor--that's what I can't understand.""It's quite simple," rasped Mr. Enwright. "They made him assessorbecause he's got so much work to do it takes him all his time to trotabout from one job to another on his blooming pony. They made himassessor because his pony's a piebald pony. Couldn't you think of thatfor yourself? Or have you been stone deaf in this office for two years?It stands to reason that a man who's responsible for all the largestnew eyesores in London would impress any corporation. Clever chap,Corver! Instead of wasting his time in travel and study, he made aspeciality of learning how to talk to committees. And he was always fullof ideas like the piebald pony, ever since I knew him.""It's that facade that did for us," broke in another voice. JohnOrgreave stood behind Mr. Enwright. He spoke easily; he was not ruffledby the immense disappointment, though the mournful greatness of thetopic had drawn him irresistibly into the discussion. John Orgreave hadgrown rather fat and coarse. At one period, in the Five Towns, he hadbeen George's hero. He was so no longer. George was still fond of him,but he had torn him down from the pedestal and established Mr. Enwrightin his place. George in his heart now somewhat patronized the placidOrgreave, regarding him as an excellent person who comprehended naughtthat was worth comprehending, and as a husband who was the dupe of hiswife."You couldn't have any other facade," Mr. Enwright turned on him,"unless you're absolutely going to ignore the market on the other sideof the Square. Whinburn's facade is an outrage--an outrage. Give me acigarette. I must run out and get shaved."While Mr. Enwright was lighting the cigarette, George reflected indesolation upon the slow evolving of the firm's design for the LawCourts. Again and again in the course of the work had he been struckinto a worshipping enthusiasm by the brilliance of Mr. Enwright'sinvention and the happy beauty of his ideas. For George there was onlyone architect in the world; he was convinced that nobody could possiblyrival Mr. Enwright, and that no Law Courts ever had been conceived equalto those Law Courts. And he himself had contributed something to thecreation. He had dreamed of the building erected and of being able tostand in front of some detail of it and say to himself: "That was mynotion, that was." And now the building was destroyed before its birth.It would never come into existence. It was wasted. And the prospect forthe firm of several years' remunerative and satisfying labour hadvanished. But the ridiculous, canny Whinburn would be profitablyoccupied, and his grotesque building would actually arise, and peoplewould praise it, and it would survive for centuries--at any rate for acentury.Mr. Enwright did not move."It's no use regretting the facade, Orgreave," he said suddenly."There's such a thing as self-respect.""I don't see that self-respect's got much to do with it," Orgreavereplied lightly.("Of course you don't," George thought. "You're a decent sort, but youdon't see, and you never will see. Even Lucas doesn't see. I alone see."And he felt savage and defiant.)"Better shove my self-respect away into this cupboard, I suppose!" saidMr. Enwright, with the most acrid cynicism, and he pulled open one doorof a long, low cupboard whose top formed a table for portfolios, dustyillustrated books, and other accumulations.The gesture was dramatic, and none knew it better than Mr. Enwright. Thecupboard was the cupboard which contained the skeleton. It was full ofdesigns rejected in public competitions. There they lay, piles and pilesof them, the earliest dating from the late seventies. The cupboard wascrammed with the futility of Enwright's genius. It held monuments enoughto make illustrious a score of cities. Lucas & Enwright was a successfulfirm. But, confining itself chiefly to large public works, it could notescape from the competition system; and it had lost in far morecompetitions than it had won. It was always, and always would be, at themercy of an Assessor. The chances had always been, and always would be,against the acceptance of its designs, because they had the fatalquality of originality combined with modest adherence to the classicaltradition. When they conquered, it was by sheer force. George glanced atthe skeleton, and he was afraid. Something was very wrong witharchitecture. He agreed with Mr. Enwright's tiresomely reiterated axiomthat it was the Cinderella of professions and the chosen field ofghastly injustice. He had embraced architecture; he had determined tofollow exactly in the footsteps of Mr. Enwright; he had sworn tosucceed. But could he succeed? Suppose he failed! Yes, his faithfaltered. He was intensely, miserably afraid. He was the most seriousman in Russell Square. Astounding that only a few minutes ago he hadhung triumphantly by his feet from the mantelpiece!Mr. Enwright kicked-to the door of the cupboard."Look here," he said to his partner, "I shan't be back just yet. I haveto go and see Bentley. I'd forgotten it."Nobody was surprised at this remark. Whenever Mr. Enwright wasinconveniently set back he always went off to visit Bentley, thearchitect of the new Roman Catholic Cathedral at Westminster, on theplea of an urgent appointment."_You_ had a look at the cathedral lately?" he demanded of George as heleft."No, I haven't," said George, who, by reason of a series ofunaccountable omissions, and of the fullness of his life as an architectand a man of the world, had never seen the celebrated cathedral at all."Well," said Mr. Enwright sarcastically, "better take just a glance atit--some time--before they've spoilt the thing with decorations. There'sa whole lot of 'em only waiting till Bentley's out of the way to beginand ruin it."IIBefore the regular closing hour of the office the two articled pupilshad left and were walking side by side through Bloomsbury. They skirtedthe oval garden of Bedford Square, which, lying off the main track tothe northern termini, and with nothing baser in it than a consulate orso, took precedence in austerity and selectness over Russell Square,which had consented to receive a grand hotel or 'modern caravanserai'and a shorthand school. Indeed the aspect of Bedford Square, where thegreat institution of the basement and area still flourished inperfection, and wealthy menials with traditional manners lived sensuallyin caves beneath the spacious, calm salons of their employers anddupes,--the aspect of Bedford Square gave the illusion that evolutionwas not, and that Bloomsbury and the whole impressive structure ofBritish society could never change. Still, from a more dubiousBloomsbury, demure creatures with inviting, indiscreet eyes were alreadytraversing the prim flags of Bedford Square on their way to theevening's hard diplomacy. Mr. Lucas made quiet remarks about theirqualities, but George did not respond."Look here, old man," said Lucas, "there's no use in all this gloom. Youmight think Lucas & Enwright had never put up a building in their lives.Just as well to dwell now and then on what they have done instead of onwhat they haven't done. We're fairly busy, you know. Besides----"He spoke seriously, tactfully, with charm, and he had a beautiful voice."Quite right! Quite right!" George willingly agreed, swinging his stickand gazing straight ahead. And he thought: "This chap has got his headscrewed on. He's miles wiser than I am, and he's really nice. I couldnever be nice like that."In a moment they were at the turbulent junction of Tottenham Court Roadand Oxford Street, where crowds of Londoners, deeply unconscious oftheir own vulgarity, and of the marvellous distinction of BedfordSquare, and of the moral obligation to harmonize socks with neckties,were preoccupying themselves with omnibuses and routes, and constitutingthe spectacle of London. The high-heeled, demure creatures were lost inthis crowd, and Lucas and George were lost in it."Well," said Lucas, halting on the pavement. "You're going down to thecathedral.""It'll please the old cock," answered George, anxious to disavow anyhigher motive. "You aren't coming?"Lucas shook his head. "I shall just go and snatch a hasty".... 'Cup oftea' was the unuttered end of the sentence."Puffin's?"Lucas nodded. Puffin's was a cosy house of sustenance in a half-newstreet on the site of the razed slums of St. Giles's. He would notfrequent the orthodox tea-houses, which were all alike and which hadother serious disadvantages. He adventured into the unusual, and couldalways demonstrate that what he found was subtly superior to anythingelse."That affair still on?" George questioned."It's not off.""She's a nice little thing--that I will say.""It all depends," Lucas replied sternly. "I don't mind telling you shewasn't so jolly nice on Tuesday.""Wasn't she?" George raised his eyebrows.Lucas silently scowled, and his handsomeness vanished for an instant."However----" he said.As George walked alone down Charing Cross Road, he thought: "That girlwill have to look out,"--meaning that in his opinion Lucas was not a manto be trifled with. Lucas was a wise and an experienced man, and knewthe world. And what he did could not be other than right. This notioncomforted George, who had a small affair of his own, which he had notyet even mentioned to Lucas. Delicacy as well as diffidence hadprevented him from doing so. It was a very different affair from any ofLucas's, and he did not want Lucas to misesteem it; neither did he wantLucas to be under the temptation to regard him as a ninny.Not the cathedral alone had induced George to leave the office early.The dissembler had reflected that if he called in a certain conventionaltea-shop near Cambridge Circus at a certain hour he would probably meetMarguerite Haim. He knew that she had an appointment with one of hercustomers, a firm of bookbinders, that afternoon, and that on similaroccasions she had been to the tea-shop. In fact he had already oncedeliciously taken tea with her therein. To-day he was disappointed, tothe extent of the tea, for he met her as she was coming out of the shop.Their greetings were rather punctilious, but beneath superficialformalities shone the proofs of intimacy. They had had largeopportunities to become intimate, and they had become intimate. Theimmediate origin of and excuse for the intimacy was a lampshade. Georgehad needed a lampshade for his room, and she had offered to paint one.She submitted sketches. But George also could paint a bit. Hencediscussions, conferences, rival designs, and, lastly, an agreement upona composite design. Before long, the lampshade craze increasing invirulence, they had between them re-lampshaded the entire house. Thenthe charming mania expired; but it had done its work. During the summerholiday George had written twice to Marguerite, and he had thoughtpleasurably about her the whole time. He had hoped that she would openthe door for him upon his return, and that when he saw her again hewould at length penetrate the baffling secret of her individuality. Shehad opened the door for him, exquisitely, but the secret had not yieldeditself. It was astonishing to George, how that girl could combine thecandours of honest intimacy with a profound reserve."Were you going in there for tea?" she asked, looking up at him gravely."No," he said. "I don't want any tea. I have to wend my way to the RomanCatholic Cathedral--you know, the new one, near Victoria. I suppose youwouldn't care to see it?""I should love to," she answered, with ingenuous eagerness. "I think itmight do me good."A strange phrase, he thought! What did she mean?"Would you mind walking?" she suggested."Let me take that portfolio, then."So they walked. She had her usual serious expression, as it were full ofthe consciousness of duty. It made him think how reliable she wouldalways be. She held herself straight and independently, and herappearance was very simple and very trim. He considered it wrong that agirl with such beautiful lips should have to consult callousbookbinders and accept whatever they chose to say. To him she was like alovely and valiant martyr. The spectacle of her was touching. However,he could not have dared to hint at these sentiments. He had to pretendthat her exposure to the stresses of the labour-market was quite naturaland right. Always he was careful in his speech with her. When he got toknow people he was apt to be impatient and ruthless; for example, toJohn Orgreave and his wife, and to his mother and stepfather, andsometimes even to Everard Lucas. He would bear them down. But he wasrestrained from such freedoms with Enwright, and equally with MargueriteHaim. She did not intimidate him, but she put him under a spell.Crossing Piccadilly Circus he had a glimpse of the rising walls and thescaffolding of the new restaurant. He pointed to the building without aword. She nodded and smiled.In the Mall, where the red campanile of the cathedral was firstdescried, George began to get excited. And he perceived that Margueritesympathetically responded to his excitement. She had never even noticedthe campanile before, and the reason was that the cathedral happened notto be on the route between Alexandra Grove and her principal customers.Suddenly, out of Victoria Street, they came up against the vast form ofthe Byzantine cathedral. It was hemmed in by puny six-story blocks offlats, as ancient cathedrals also are hemmed in by the dwellings oftownsfolk. But here, instead of the houses having gathered about thecathedral, the cathedral had excavated a place for itself amid thehouses. Tier above tier the expensively curtained windows of darkdrawing-rooms and bedrooms inhabited by thousands of the well-to-doblinked up at the colossal symbol that dwarfed them all. George knewthat he was late. If the watchman's gate was shut for the night he wouldlook a fool. But his confidence in his magic power successfully to runrisks sustained him in a gallant and assured demeanour. The gate in thehoarding that screened the west front was open. With a large gesture hetipped the watchman a shilling, and they passed in like princes. Thetransition to the calm and dusty interior was instantaneous and almostoverwhelming. Immense without, the cathedral seemed still more immensewithin. On one side of the nave was a steam-engine; on the other somesort of a mill; and everywhere lay in heaps the wild litter ofconstruction, among which moved here and there little parties of apronedpygmies engaged silently and industriously on sub-contracts; the mainarmy of labourers had gone. The walls rose massively clear out of thewhite-powdered confusion into arches and high domes; and the floor ofthe choir, and a loftier floor beyond that, also rose clear.Perspectives ended in shadow and were illimitable, while the afternoonlight through the stone grille of the western windows made luminousspaces in the gloom.The sensation of having the mysterious girl at his elbow in thatwonder-striking interior was magnificent.He murmured, with pride:"Do you know this place has the widest nave of any cathedral in theworld? It's a much bigger cathedral than St. Paul's. In fact I'm notsure if it isn't the biggest in England.""You know," he said again, "in the whole of the nineteenth century onlyone cathedral was built in England.""Which was that?""Truro.... And you could put Truro inside this and leave a margin allround. Mr. Enwright says this is the last cathedral that ever will bebuilt, outside America."They gazed, more and more aware of a solemn miracle."It's marvellous--marvellous!" he breathed.After a few moments, glancing at her, a strong impulse to beconfidential mastered him. He was obliged to tell that girl."I say, we've lost that competition--for the Law Courts."He smiled, but the smile had no effect."Oh!" She positively started.He saw that her eyes had moistened, and he looked quickly away, asthough he had seen something that he ought not to have seen. She cared!She cared a great deal! She was shocked by the misfortune to the firm,by the injustice to transcendent merit! She knew nothing whatever aboutany design in the competition. But it was her religion that the Lucas &Enwright design was the best, and by far the best. He had implanted thedogma, and he felt that she was ready to die for it. Mystery droppedaway from her. Her soul stood bare to him. He was so happy and so proudthat the intensity of his feeling dismayed him. But he was enheartenedtoo, and courage to surmount a thousand failures welled up in him asfrom an unimagined spring."I wonder who that is?" she said quietly and ordinarily, as if aterrific event had not happened.On the highest floor, at the other extremity of the cathedral, in frontof the apse, a figure had appeared in a frock-coat and a silk hat. Thefigure stood solitary, gazing around in the dying light."By Jove! It's Bentley! It's the architect!"George literally trembled. He literally gave a sob. The vision ofBentley within his masterpiece, of Bentley whom Enwright himselfworshipped, was too much for him. Renewed ambition rushed through him inelectric currents. All was not wrong with the world of architecture.Bentley had succeeded. Bentley, beginning life as an artisan, hadsucceeded supremely. And here he stood on the throne of his triumph.Genius would not be denied. Beauty would conquer despite everything.What completed the unbearable grandeur of the scene was that Bentley hadcancer of the tongue, and was sentenced to death. Bentley's friends knewit; the world of architecture knew it; Bentley knew it.... "Shall I tellher?" George thought. He looked at her; he looked at the vessel which hehad filled with emotion. He could not speak. A highly sensitive decency,an abhorrence of crudity, restrained him. "No," he decided, "I can'ttell her now. I'll tell her some other time."IIIWith no clear plan as to his dinner he took her back to Alexandra Grove.The dusk was far advanced. Mounting the steps quickly Marguerite rangthe bell. There was no answer. She pushed up the flap of theletter-aperture and looked within."Have you got your latchkey?" she asked, turning round on George."Father's not come home--his hat's not hanging up. He promised mecertain that he would be here at six-thirty at the latest. Otherwise Ishould have taken the big key."She did not show resentment against her father; nor was there impatiencein her voice. But she seemed to be firmly and impassively judging herfather, as his equal, possibly even as somewhat his superior. And Georgeadmired the force of her individuality. It flattered him that a being soindependent and so strong should have been so meltingly responsive tohim in the cathedral.An adventurous idea occurred to him in a flash and he impulsivelyadopted it. His latchkey was in his pocket, but if the house door wasonce opened he would lose her--he would have to go forth and seek hisdinner and she would remain in the house; whereas, barred out of thehouse, she would be bound to him--they would be thrust together intoexquisite contingencies, into all the deep potentialities of darkLondon."Dash it!" he said, first fumbling in one waistcoat pocket, and thenledging the portfolio against a step and fumbling in both waistcoatpockets simultaneously. "I must have left it in my other clothes."It is doubtful whether his conscience troubled him. But he had a veryexciting sense of risk and of romance and of rapture, as though he haddone something wonderful and irremediable."Ah! Well!" she murmured, instantly acquiescent, and without the leasthesitation descended the steps.How many girls (he demanded) would or could have made up their minds andfaced the situation like that? Her faculty of decision was simplymasculine! He looked at her in the twilight and she was inimitable,unparalleled. And yet by virtue of the wet glistening of her eyes in thecathedral she had somehow become mystically his! He. permitted himselfthe suspicion: "Perhaps she guesses that I'm only pretending about thelatchkey." The suspicion which made her an accessory to his crime didnot lower her in his eyes. On the contrary, the enchanting naughtinesswith which it invested her only made her variety more intoxicant andperfection more perfect. His regret was that the suspicion was not acertainty.Before a word could be said as to the next move, a figure in a grey suitand silk hat, and both arms filled with packages, passed in front of thegate and then halted."Oh! It's Mr. Buckingham Smith!" exclaimed Marguerite. "Mr. BuckinghamSmith, we're locked out till father comes." She completed the tale ofthe mishap, to George's equal surprise and mortification.Mr. Buckingham Smith, with Mr. Alfred Prince, was tenant of the studioat the back of No. 8. He raised his hat as well as an occupied arm wouldallow."Come and wait in the studio, then," he suggested bluntly."You know Mr. Cannon, don't you?" said Marguerite, embarrassed.George and Mr. Buckingham Smith had in fact been introduced to oneanother weeks earlier in the Grove by Mr. Haim. Thereafter Mr.Buckingham Smith had, as George imagined, saluted George with a kind ofjealous defiance and mistrust, and the acquaintance had not progressed.Nor, by the way, had George's dreams been realized of entering deeplyinto the artistic life of Chelsea. Chelsea had been no more welcomingthan Mr. Buckingham Smith. But now Mr. Buckingham Smith grew affable andneighbourly. Behind the man's inevitable insistence that George shouldaccompany Miss Haim into the studio was a genuine, eager hospitality.The studio was lofty and large, occupying most of the garden space ofNo. 8. Crimson rep curtains, hung on a thick, blackened brass rod,divided it into two unequal parts. By the wall nearest the house astaircase ran up to a door high in the gable, which door communicated bya covered bridge with the second floor of No. 8, where the artists hadbedrooms. The arrangement was a characteristic example of the manner inwhich building was added to building in London contrary to the intentionof the original laying-out, and George in his expert capacity wonderedhow the plans had been kept within the by-laws of the borough, and bywhat chicane the consent of the ground-landlord had been obtained.Mr. Alfred Prince, whom also George knew slightly, was trimming a hugeoil-lamp which depended by a wire from the scarcely visible apex of theroof. When at length the natural perversity of the lamp had beenmastered and the metal shade replaced, George got a general view of theimmense and complex disorder of the studio. It was obviously verydirty--even in the lamplight the dust could be seen in drifts on themoveless folds of the curtains--it was a pigsty; but it was romanticwith shadowed spaces, and gleams of copper and of the pale arms of theetching-press, and glimpses of pictures; and the fellow desired a studioof his own! He was glad, now, that Mr. Buckingham Smith had invited themin. He had wanted to keep Marguerite Haim to himself; but it was worthwhile to visit the studio, and it was especially worth while to watchher under the illumination of the lamp."Lucky we have a clean tablecloth," said Mr. Buckingham Smith, openinghis packages and setting a table. "Brawn, Miss Haim! And beer, MissHaim! That is to say, Pilsener. From the only place in Chelsea where youcan get it."And his packages really did contain brawn and beer (four bottles of thePilsener); also bread and a slice of butter. The visitors learnt thatthey had happened on a feast, a feast which Mr. Buckingham Smith hadconceived and ordained, a feast to celebrate the triumph of Mr. AlfredPrince. An etching by Mr. Prince had been bought by Vienna. Mr.Buckingham Smith did not say that the etching had been bought by anyparticular gallery in Vienna. He said 'by Vienna,' giving the idea thatall Vienna, every man, woman, and child in that distant and enlightenedcity where etchings were truly understood, had combined for thepossession of a work by Mr. Prince. Mr. Buckingham Smith opined thatsoon every gallery in Europe would be purchasing examples of AlfredPrince. He snatched from a side-table and showed the identical authenticletter from Vienna to Mr. Alfred Prince, with its official heading,foreign calligraphy, and stilted English. The letter was verycomplimentary.In George's estimation Mr. Prince did not look the part of an etcher ofcontinental renown. He was a small, pale man, with a small brown beard,very shabby, and he was full of small nervous gestures. He had theinnocently-red nose which pertains to indigestion. His trousers baggedhorribly at the knees, and he wore indescribable slippers. He saidlittle, in an extremely quiet, weak voice. His eyes, however, werelively and attractive. He was old, probably at least thirty-five. Mr.Buckingham Smith made a marked contrast to him. Tall, with newishclothes, a powerful voice and decisive gestures, Mr. Buckingham Smithdominated, though he was younger than his friend. He tried to please,and he mingled the grand seigneurial style with the abrupt. It was hewho played both the parlourmaid and the host. He forced Marguerite tohave some brawn, serving her with a vast portion; but he could not forceher to take Pilsener."Now, Mr. Cannon," he said, pouring beer into a glass with an up-and-downmotion of the bottle so as to put a sparkling head on the beer."No, thank you," said George decidedly. "I won't have beer."Mr. Buckingham Smith gazed at him challengingly out of his black eyes."Oh! But you've got to," he said. It was as if he had said: "I amgenerous. I love to be hospitable, but I am not going to have myhospitality thwarted, and you needn't think it."George accepted the beer and joined in the toasting of Mr. AlfredPrince's health."Old chap!" Mr. Buckingham Smith greeted his chum, and then to Georgeand Marguerite, informingly and seriously: "One of the best."It was during the snack that Mr. Buckingham Smith began to display theetchings of Mr. Alfred Prince, massed in a portfolio. He extolled themwith his mouth half-full of brawn, or between two gulps of Pilsener.They impressed George deeply--they were so rich and dark and austere."Old Princey boy's one of the finest etchers in Europe to-day, if youask me," said Mr. Buckingham Smith off-handedly, and with the air ofstating the obvious. And George thought that Mr. Prince was. Theetchings were not signed 'Alfred Prince,' but just 'Prince,' which wasquietly imposing. Everybody agreed that Vienna had chosen the best one."It's a dry-point, isn't it?" Marguerite asked, peering into it. Georgestarted. This single remark convinced him that she knew all aboutetching, whereas he himself knew nothing. He did not even know exactlywhat a dry-point was."Mostly," said Mr. Prince. "You can only get that peculiar quality ofline in dry-point."George perceived that etching was an entrancing subject, and hedetermined to learn something about it--everything about it.Then came the turn of Mr. Buckingham Smith's paintings. These were notsigned 'Smith' as the etchings were signed 'Prince.' By no means! Theywere signed 'Buckingham Smith.' George much admired them, though lessthan he admired the etchings. They were very striking and ingenious, inparticular the portraits and the still-life subjects. He had to admitthat these fellows to whom he had scarcely given a thought, thesefellows who existed darkly behind the house, were prodigiouslyaccomplished."Of course," said Mr. Buckingham Smith negligently, "you can't get anyidea of them by this light--though," he added warningly, "it's thefinest artificial light going. Better than all your electricity."There was a pause, and Mr. Prince sighed and said:"I was thinking of going up to the Promenades to-night, but Buck won'tgo."George took fire at once. "The Glazounov ballet music?""Glazounov?" repeated Mr. Prince uncertainly. "No. I rather wanted tohear the new Elgar."George was disappointed, for he had derived from Mr. Enwright positiveopinions about the relative importance of Elgar and Glazounov."Go often?" he asked."No," said Mr. Prince. "I haven't been this season yet, but I'm alwaysmeaning to." He smiled apologetically. "And I thought to-night----"Despite appearances, he was not indifferent after all to his greatViennese triumph; he had had some mild notion of his own of celebratingthe affair."I suppose this is what etchings are printed with," said George to Mr.Buckingham Smith, for the sake of conversation, and he moved towards thepress. The reception given to the wonderful name of Glazounov in thatstudio was more than a disappointment for George; he felt obscurely thatit amounted to a snub.Mr. Buckingham Smith instantly became the urbane and alert showman. Heexplained how the pressure was regulated. He pulled the capstan-likearms of the motive wheel and the blanketed steel bed slid smoothly underthe glittering cylinder. Although George had often been in hisstepfather's printing works he now felt for the first time thefascination of manual work, of artisanship, in art, and he regrettedthat the architect had no such labour. He could indistinctly hear Mr.Prince talking to Marguerite."This is a monotype," said Mr. Buckingham Smith, picking up a dustyprint off the window-sill. "I do one occasionally.""Did you do this?" asked George, who had no idea what a monotype was anddared not inquire."Yes. They're rather amusing to do. You just use a match or your fingeror anything.""It's jolly good," said George. "D'you know, it reminds me a bit ofCezanne."Of course it was in Paris that he had heard of the great original, themartyr and saviour of modern painting. Equally of course it was Mr.Enwright who had inducted him into the esoteric cult of Cezanne, andmagically made him see marvels in what at the first view had struck himas a wilful and clumsy absurdity."Oh!" murmured Buck, stiffening."What do you think of Cezanne?""Rule it out!" said Buck, with a warning cantankerous inflection, firmlyand almost brutally reproving this conversational delinquency ofGeorge's. "Rule it out, young man! We don't want any of that sort ofmountebanking in England. We know what it's worth."George was cowed. More, his faith in Cezanne was shaken. He smiledsheepishly and was angry with himself. Then he heard Mr. Prince sayingcalmly and easily to Miss Haim--the little old man could not in fact beso nervous as he seemed:"I suppose _you_ wouldn't come with me to the Prom?"George was staggered and indignant. It was inconceivable, monstrous,that those two should be on such terms as would warrant Mr. Prince'sastounding proposal. He felt that he simply could not endure themmarching off together for the evening. Her acceptance of the proposalwould be an outrage. He trembled. However, she declined, and he waslifted from the rack."I must really go," she said. "Father's sure to be home by now.""May I?" demanded Mr. Buckingham Smith, stooping over Marguerite'sportfolio of designs, and glancing round at her for permission to openit. Already his hand was on the tape."On no account!" she cried. "No! No!... Mr. Cannon, please take it fromhim!" She was serious."Oh! All right! All right!" Mr. Buckingham Smith rose to the erectgood-humouredly.After a decent interval George took the portfolio under his arm.Marguerite was giving thanks for hospitality. They left. George wassingularly uplifted by the fact that she never concealed from him thosedesigns upon which Mr. Buckingham Smith had not been allowed to gaze.And, certain contretemps and disappointments notwithstanding, he wasimpressed by the entity of the studio. It had made a desirable picturein his mind: the romantic paraphernalia, the etchings, the canvases, thelights and shadows, the informality, the warm odours of the lamp and ofthe Pilsener, the dazzling white of the tablecloth, the quick, positivetones of Buckingham Smith, who had always to be convincing not onlyothers but himself that he was a strong man whose views wereunassailable, the eyes of Buckingham Smith like black holes in hishandsome face, the stylish gestures and coarse petulance of BuckinghamSmith, the shy assurance of little old Prince. He envied the pair. Theirexistence had a cloistral quality which appealed to something in him.They were continually in the studio, morning, afternoon, evening. Theywere independent. They had not to go forth to catch omnibuses andtrains, to sit in offices, to utilize the services of clerks, to takeorders, to 'Consider the idiosyncrasies of superiors. They wereself-contained, they were consecrated, and they were free. No opencompetitions for them! No struggles with committees and withcontractors! And no waiting for the realization of an idea! They satdown and worked, and the idea came at once to life, complete, withoutthe necessity of other human co-operation! They did not sit in front ofa painting or etching and say, as architects had too often to say infront of their designs: "That is wasted! That will never come intobeing." Architecture might be the art of arts, and indeed it was, butthere were terrible drawbacks to it....And next he was outside in the dark with Marguerite Haim, and new,intensified sensations thrilled him. She was very marvellous in thedark.Mr. Haim had not returned."Well!" she muttered; and then dreamily: "What a funny little man Mr.Prince is, isn't he?" She spoke condescendingly."Anyhow," said George, who had been respecting Mr. Alfred Prince,"anyhow, I'm glad you didn't go to the concert with him.""Why?" she asked, with apparent simplicity. "I adore the Proms. Don'tyou?""Let's go, then," he suggested. "We shan't be very late, and what elseis there for you to do?"His audacity frightened him. There she stood with him in the porch,silent, reflective. She would never go. For sundry practical and otherreasons she would refuse. She must refuse."I'll go," she said, as if announcing a well-meditated decision. Hecould scarcely believe it. This could not be London that he was in.They deposited the portfolio under the mat in the porch.IVWhen they got into the hall the band was sending forth a tremendousvolume of brilliant exhilarating sound. A vast melody seemed to ride onwaves of brass. The conductor was very excited, and his dark locks shookwith the violence of his gestures as he urged onward the fingers andarms of the executants flying madly through the maze of the music to aclimax. There were flags; there was a bank of flowers; there was afountain; there were the huge crimson-domed lamps that poured down theirradiance; and there was the packed crowd of straw-hatted andfloral-hatted erect figures gazing with upturned, intent faces at theimmense orchestral machine. Then came a final crash, and for an instantthe thin, silvery tinkle of the fountain supervened in an enchantedhush; and then terrific applause, with yells and thuds above and belowthe hand-clapping, filled and inflamed the whole interior. Theconductor, recovering from a collapse, turned round and bowed low withhis hand on his shirt-front; his hair fell over his forehead; hestraightened himself and threw the hair back again, and so he kept on,time after time casting those plumes to and fro. At last, sated withhomage, he thought of justice, and pointed to the band and smiled withan unconvincing air of humility, as if saying: "I am naught. Here arethe true heroes." And on the end of his stick he lifted to their feeteighty men, whose rising drew invigorated shouts. Enthusiasm reigned;triumph was accomplished. Even when the applause had expired, enthusiasmstill reigned; and every person present had the illusion of a share inthe triumph. It was a great night at the Promenades.George and Marguerite looked at each other happily. They both wereinspired by the feeling that life was a grand thing, and that they hadreached suddenly one of the summits of existence. George, observing theexcitement in her eyes, thought how wonderful it was that she too shouldbe excited."What was that piece?" she asked."I don't quite know," he said. "There don't appear to be any programmesabout." He wished he had been able to identify the piece, but he was toocontent to be ashamed of his ignorance. Moreover, his ignorance was hersalso, and he liked that.The music resumed. He listened, ready to put himself into the mood ofadmiration if it was the Glazounov item. Was it Glazounov? He could notbe certain. It sounded fine. Surely it sounded Russian. Then he had aglimpse of a programme held by a man standing near, and he peered at it."No. 4. Elgar--Sea-Pictures." No. 5 was the Glazounov."It's only the Elgar," he said, with careless condescension, perceivingat once, by the mere virtue of a label, that the music was not fine andnot Russian. He really loved music, but he happened to be at that age,from which some people never emerge, at which the judgment dependsalmost completely on extraneous suggestion."Oh!" murmured Marguerite indifferently, responding to his tone."Glazounov's next," he said."I suppose we couldn't sit down," she suggested.Yet it was she who had preferred the Promenade to the Grand Circle orthe Balcony."We'll find something," he said, with his usual assurance. And in thecorridor that surrounded the hemicycle they climbed up on to a narrowledge in the wall and sat side by side in perfect luxury, not dreamingthat they were doing anything unusual or undignified. As a fact, theywere not. Other couples were perched on other ledges, and still otherson the cold steam-pipes. A girl with a big face and heavy red lips satalone, lounging, her head aslant. She had an open copy of _Home Notes_in one hand. Elgar had sent the simple creature into an ecstasy, and shenever stirred; probably she did not know anyone named Enwright.Promenaders promenaded in and out of the corridor, and up and down thecorridor, and nobody troubled to glance twice either at theheavy-lipped, solitary girl or at the ledged couples.Through an arched doorway could be seen the orchestra and half theauditorium."This is the best seat in the hall," George observed proudly. Margueritesmiled at him.When the "Sea-Pictures" were finished she gave a sigh of appreciation,having forgotten, it seemed, that persons who had come to admireGlazounov ought not to relish Elgar. And George, too, reflecting uponthe sensations produced within him by Elgar, was ready to admit that,though Elgar could of course not be classed with the foreigner, theremight be something to be said for him after all."This is just what I needed," she murmured."Oh?""I was very depressed this afternoon," she said."Were you?" He had not noticed it."Yes. They've cut down my price from a pound to seventeen and six."'They' were the employing bookbinders, and the price was the fixed pricefor a design--side and back.He was shocked, and he felt guilty. How was it that he had noticednothing in her demeanour? He had been full of the misfortune of thefirm, and she had made the misfortune her own, keeping silence about thegrinding harshness of bookbinders. He was an insensible egotist, andgirls were wondrous. At any rate this girl was wondrous. He had anintense desire to atone for his insensibility and his egotism byprotecting her, spoiling her, soothing her into forgetfulness of hertrouble.... Ah! He understood now what she meant when she had replied tohis suggestion as to visiting the cathedral: "It might do me good.""How rotten!" he exclaimed, expressing his sympathy by means of disgust."Couldn't you tell them to go to the dickens?""You have to take what they'll give," she answered. "Especially whenthey begin to talk about bad trade and that sort of thing.""Well, it's absolutely rotten!"It was not the arbitrary reduction of her earnings that he resented, butthe fact of her victimhood. Scandalous, infamous, that this rare anddelicate creature should be defenceless against commercial brutes!The Glazounov ballet music, "The Seasons," started. Knowing himselfjustified, he surrendered himself to it, to its exoticism, to itsRussianism, to its wilful and disconcerting beauty. And there was nocomposer like Glazounov. Beneath the sensory spell of the music, hismemory wandered about through the whole of his life. He recalled days inhis mother's boarding-house at Brighton; musical evenings, at which JohnOrgreave was present, at his stepfather's house in the Five Towns; andin all kinds of scenes at the later home at Ladderedge Hall--scenes inwhich his mother again predominated, becoming young again and learningsports and horsewomanship as a girl might have learnt them.... And theywere all beautiful beneath the music. The music softened; the fountainwas heard; the striking of matches was heard.... Still, all wasbeautiful. Then he touched Marguerite's hand as it rested a littlebehind her on the ledge. The effect of contact was surprising. With allhis other thoughts he had not ceased to think of the idea of shieldingand enveloping her. But now this idea utterly possessed him. The musicgrew louder, and as it were under cover of the music he put his handround her hand. It was a venturesome act with such a girl; he wasafraid.... The hand lay acquiescent within his! He tightened thepressure. The hand lay acquiescent; it accepted. The flashingrealization of her compliance overwhelmed him. He was holding the verysymbol of wild purity, and there was no effort to be free. Noneguessed. None could see. They two had the astonishing, the incrediblesecret between them. He looked at her profile, taking precautions. Nosign of alarm or disturbance. Her rapt glance was fixed steadily on theorchestra framed in the arched doorway.... Incredible, the soft, warmdelicacy of the cotton glove!The applause at the end of the number awoke them. He released her hand.She slipped neatly down from the ledge."I think I ought to be going back home.... Father ..." she murmured. Shemet his eyes; but his embarrassed eyes would not meet hers."Certainly!" he agreed quickly, though they had been in the hall littlemore than half an hour. He would have agreed to any suggestion from her.It seemed to him that the least he could do at that moment was to fulfilunquestioningly her slightest wish. Then she looked away, and he sawthat a deep blush gradually spread over her lovely face. This was thesupreme impressive phenomenon. Before the blush he was devotional.VThey walked down Regent Street almost in silence, enjoyingsimultaneously the silence and solitude of the curving thoroughfare andthe memory of the bright, crowded, triumphant scene which they had left.At Piccadilly Circus George inquired for the new open motor-buses whichhad just begun to run between the Circus and Putney, passing theRedcliffe Arms. Already, within a year, the time was historicallydistant when a policeman had refused to allow the automobile of a Memberof Parliament to enter Palace Yard, on the ground that there was noprecedent for such a desecration. The new motor-buses, however, did notrun at night. Human daring had limits, and it was reported that at leastone motor-driver, succumbing to the awful nervous strain of guidingthese fast expresses through the traffic of the West End, had been takento the lunatic asylum. George called a hansom, of which there weredozens idling about. Marguerite seemed tacitly to object to this act asthe germ of extravagance; but it was the only classic thing to do, andhe did it.The hansom rolled rapidly and smoothly along upon that well-establishednovelty, india-rubber tyres. Bits of the jingling harness oscillatedregularly from side to side. At intervals the whip-thong dragged gentlyacross the horse's back, and the horse lifted and shook its head. Theshallow and narrow interior of the hansom was constructed withexactitude to hold two. Neither occupant could move in any direction,and neither desired to move. The splendidly lighted avenues, of whichevery detail could be discerned as by day, flowed evenly past thevehicle."I've never been in a hansom before," said Marguerite timidly--becausethe situation was so dismaying in its enchantment.He, from the height of two years of hansom-using, was touched,delighted, even impressed. The staggering fact increased her virginalcharm and its protectiveness. He thought upon the simplicity of herexistence. Of course she had never been in a hansom! Hansoms wereobviously outside her scheme. He said nothing, but he sought for andfound her hand beneath the apron. She did not resist. He reflected "Canshe resist? She cannot." Her hand was in a living swoon. Her hand washis; it was admittedly his. She could never deny it, now. He touched thebutton of the glove, and undid it. Then, moving her passive hand, hebrought both his to it, and with infinitely delicate and considerategestures he slowly drew off the glove, and he held her hand ungloved.She did not stir nor speak. Nothing so marvellous as her exquisite andconfiding stillness had ever happened.... The hansom turned intoAlexandra Grove, and when it stopped he pushed the glove into her hand,which closed on it. As they descended the cabman, accustomed to peerdown on loves pure and impure, gave them a beneficent look."He's not come in," said Marguerite, glancing through the flap of thefront door. She was exceedingly self-conscious, but beneath herself-consciousness could be noticed an indignant accusation against oldHaim. She had rung the bell and knocked."Are you sure? Can you see the hat-stand?""I can see it enough for that.""Look here," George suggested, with false lightness, "I expect I couldget in through my window." His room was on the ground floor, and notmuch agility was needed to clamber up to its ledge from the level of thearea. He might have searched his pockets again and discovered hislatchkey, but he would not. Sooner than admit a deception he would haveremained at the door with her all night."Think you could?""Yes. I could slide the window-catch."He jumped down the steps and showed her how he could climb. In twominutes he was opening the front door to her from the inside. She movedtowards him in the gloom."Oh! My portfolio!" She stopped, and bent down to the mat.Then she busily lighted the little hall-lamp with his matches, andhurried down, taking the matches, to the kitchen. After a few momentsGeorge followed her; he was obliged to follow her. She had removed hercoat; it lay on the sole chair. The hat and blouse which she wore seemedvery vivid in the kitchen--vestiges of past glorious episodes inconcert-halls and hansoms. She had lighted the kitchen-lamp and wasstanding apparently idle. The alarum-clock on the black mantelpieceticked noisily. The cat sat indifferently on the corner of the clean,bare table. George hesitated in the doorway. He was extremely excited,because the tremendous fact of what he had done and what she hadpermitted, with all the implications, had to be explicitly acknowledgedbetween them. Of course it had to be acknowledged! They were both fullyaware of the thing, she as well as he, but spoken words mustauthenticate its existence as only spoken words could.She said, beginning sternly and finishing with a peculiar smile:"I do think this business of father and Mrs. Lobley is going ratherfar."And George had a sudden new sense of the purely feminine adroitness ofwomen. In those words she had clearly conceded that their relations wereutterly changed. Never before had she made even the slightest, mostdistant reference to the monstrous household actuality, unadmitted andyet patent, of the wooing of Mrs. Lobley the charwoman by her father,the widower of her mother. If Mr. Haim stayed away from home of anevening, Mrs. Lobley was the siren who deflected him from the straightdomestic path. She knew it; George surmised it; the whole street had itssuspicions. But hitherto Marguerite had given no sign. She now createdGeorge the confidant of her resentment. And her smile was not anearnest of some indulgence for her father--her smile was for Georgealone.He went boldly up to her, put his arms round her, and kissed her. Shedid not kiss. But she allowed herself to be kissed, and she let her bodyloose in his embrace. She looked at him with her eyes nearly upon his,and her eyes glittered with a mysterious burning; he knew that she wascontent. That she should be content, that it should please her to lethim have the unimaginable experience of holding that thrilled andthrilling body close to his, seemed to him to be a marvellous piece ofsheer luck and overwhelming good fortune. She was so sensuous and yet soserious. Her gaze stimulated not only love but conscience. In himambition was superlatively vigorous. Nevertheless he felt then as thoughhe had never really known ambition till that moment. He thought of thenew century and of a new life. He perceived the childishness and follyof his favourite idea that an artist ought to pass through a phase ofDon Juanism. He knew that the task of satisfying the lofty and exactingand unique girl would be immense, and that he could fulfil it, but onthe one condition that it monopolized his powers. Thus he was bothmodest and proud, anxious and divinely elated. His mind was the scene ofinnumerable impulses and sensations over which floated the banner of themale who has won an impassioned allegiance."Don't let's tell anyone yet," she murmured."No.""I mean for a long time," she insisted."No, we won't," he agreed, and added scornfully: "They'd only say we'retoo young."The notion of secrecy was an enchanting notion.She cut magic cake and poured out magic milk. And they ate and dranktogether, for they were hungry. And at this point the cat began to showan interest in their doings.And after they were both in their beds, but not after they were asleep,Mr. Haim, by the clicking of a latchkey in a lock, reminded them ofsomething which they had practically forgotten--his disorderedexistence.CHAPTER IIITHE CHARWOMANIGeorge entered Alexandra Grove very early the next evening, having dinedinadequately and swiftly so that he might reach the neighbourhood ofMarguerite at the first moment justifiable. He would have omitted dinnerand trusted to Marguerite's kitchen, only that, in view of the secrecyresolved upon, appearances had to be preserved. The secrecy in itselfwas delicious, but even the short experiences of the morning had shownboth of them how extremely difficult it would be for two people who wereeverything to each other to behave as though they were nothing to eachother. George hoped, however, that Mr. Haim would again be absent, andhe was anticipating exquisite hours.At the precise instant when he put his latchkey in the door the door waspulled away from him by a hand within, and he saw a woman of aboutthirty-five, plump but not stout, in a blue sateen dress, bonneted butnot gloved. She had pleasant, commonplace features and brown hair.Several seconds elapsed before George recognized in her Mrs. Lobley, thecharwoman of No. 8, and when he did so he was a little surprised at herpresentableness. He had met her very seldom in the house. He was alwayslate for breakfast, and his breakfast was always waiting for him. OnSundays he was generally out. If he did catch sight of her, she wasinvariably in a rough apron and as a rule on her knees. Theiracquaintance had scarcely progressed far enough for him to call her'Mrs. Lob' with any confidence. He had never seen her at night, thoughupon occasion he had heard her below in the basement, and for him shewas associated with mysterious nocturnal goings and comings by thebasement door. That she should be using the front door was as startlingas that she should be so nobly attired in blue sateen."Good evening--Mr. Cannon," she said, in her timid voice, too thin forher body. He noticed that she was perturbed. Hitherto she had alwaysaddressed him as 'sir.'"Excuse me," she said, and with an apologetic air she slipped past himand departed out of the house.Mr. Haim was visible just within the doorway of the sitting-room, andbehind him the table with the tea-things still on it. George had feltconsiderably self-conscious in Mr. Haim's presence at the office; and hewas so preoccupied by his own secret mighty affair that his firstsuspicion connected the strange apparition of a new Mrs. Lobley and thepeculiar look on Mr. Haim's face with some disagreeable premature anddramatic explosion of the secret mighty affair. His thoughts, thoughabsurd, ran thus because they could not run in any other way."Ah, Mr. Cannon!" said Mr. Haim queerly. "You're in early to-night.""A bit earlier," George admitted, with caution. "Have to read, youknow." He was using the word 'read' in the examination sense."If you could spare me a minute," smiled Mr. Haim"Certainly.""Have a cigarette," said Mr. Haim, as soon as George had deposited hishat and come into the room. This quite unprecedented offer reassuredGeorge, who in spite of reason had continued to fear that the landlordhad something on his mind about his daughter and his lodger. Mr. Haimpresented his well-known worn cigarette-case, and then with precise andcalm gestures carefully shut the door."The fact is," said he, "I wanted to tell you something. I told Mr.Enwright this afternoon, as I thought was proper, and it seems to methat you are the next person who ought to be informed.""Oh yes?""I am going to be married.""The deuce you are!"The light words had scarcely escaped from young George before heperceived that his tone was a mistake, and that Mr. Haim was in a stateof considerable emotion, which would have to be treated very carefully.And George too now suddenly partook of the emotion. He felt himself tobe astonished and even shaken by Mr. Haim's news. The atmosphere of theinterview changed in an instant. Mr. Haim moved silently on slipperedfeet to the mantelpiece, out of the circle of lamplight, and droppedsome ash into the empty fire-place."I congratulate you," said George."Thank you!" said Mr. Haim brightly, seizing gratefully on the fustianphrase, eager to hall-mark it as genuine and put it among his treasures.Without doubt he was flattered. "Yes," he proceeded, as it werereflectively, "I have asked Mrs. Lobley to be my wife, and she has doneme the honour to consent." He had the air of having invented the wordsspecially to indicate that Mrs. Lobley was descending from a throne inorder to espouse him. It could not have occurred to him that they hadever been used before and that the formula was classic. He smiled again,and went on: "Of course I've known and admired Mrs. Lobley for a longtime. What we should have done without her valuable help in this house Idon't like to think. I really don't.""'Her help in this house,'" thought the ruthless George, behindcigarette smoke. "Why doesn't he say right out she's the charwoman? If Iwas marrying a charwoman, I should say I was marrying a charwoman." Andthen he had a misgiving: "Should I? I wonder whether I should." And heremembered that ultimately the charwoman was going to be his ownmother-in-law. He was aware of a serious qualm."Mrs. Lobley has had an uphill fight since her first husband's death,"said Mr. Haim. "He was an insurance agent--the Prudential. She's comeout of it splendidly. She's always kept up her little home, though itwas only two rooms, and she'll only leave it because I can offer her abetter one. I have always admired her, and I'm sure the more you knowher the more you'll like her. She's a woman in a thousand, Mr. Cannon.""I expect she is," George agreed feebly. He could not think of anythingto say."And I'm thankful I _can_ offer her a better home. I don't mind tellingyou now that at one time I began to fear I shouldn't have a home. I'vehad my ambitions, Mr. Cannon. I was meant for a quantity surveyor. I wasone--you may say. But it was not to be. I came down in the world, but Ikept my head above water. And then in the end, with a little money I hadI bought this house. L575. It needed some negotiation. Ground-rent L10per annum, and seventy years to run. You see, all along I had had theidea of building a studio in the garden. I was one of the first to seethe commercial possibilities of studios in Chelsea. But of course I knowChelsea. I made the drawings for the studio myself. Mr. Enwright kindlysuggested a few improvements. With all my experience I was in a positionto get it put up as cheaply as possible. You'd be surprised at thenumber of people in the building line anxious to oblige me. It costunder L300. I had to borrow most of it. But I've paid it off. What's theconsequence? The consequence is that the rent of the studio and the toprooms brings me in over eight per cent on all I spent on the house andthe studio together. And I'm living rent free myself.""Jolly good!""Yes.... If I'd had capital, Mr. Cannon, I could have made thousands outof studios. Thousands. I fancy I've the gift. But I've never had thecapital. And that's all there is to it." He smacked his lips, and leanedback against the mantelpiece. "You may tell me I've realized myambitions. Not all of them, Mr. Cannon. Not all of them. If I'd hadmoney I should have had leisure, and I should have improved myself.Reading, I mean. Study. Literature. Music. Painting. History ofarchitecture. All that sort of thing. I've got the taste for it. I knowI've got the taste for it. But what could I do? I gave it up. You'llnever know how lucky you are, Mr. Cannon. I gave it up. However, I'venothing to be ashamed of. At any rate I hope not."George nodded appreciatively. He was touched. He was even impressed. Headmitted the _naivete_ of the ageing man, his vanity, hissentimentality. But he saw himself to be in the presence of anachievement. And though the crown of Mr. Haim's achievement was to marrya charwoman, still the achievement impressed. And the shabby man withthe lined, common face was looking back at the whole of his life--therewas something positively formidable in that alone. He was at the end;George was at the beginning, and George felt callow and deferential. Thesensation of callowness at once heightened his resolve to succeed. AllGeorge's sensations seemed mysteriously to transform themselves intofood for this great resolve."And what does Miss Haim say to all this?" he asked, rather timidly andwildly. It was a venturesome remark; it might well have been called animpertinence; but the mage of Marguerite was involved in all theworkings of his mind, and it would not be denied expression.Mr. Haim lifted his back from the mantelpiece sharply. Then hehesitated, moving forward a little."Mr. Cannon," he said, "it's curious you should ask that." His voicetrembled, and at the vibration George was suddenly apprehensive. Mr.Haim had soon recovered from his original emotion, but now he seemed tobe in danger of losing control of himself.George nervously cleared his throat and apologized."I didn't mean----""I'd better tell you," Mr. Haim interrupted him, rather loudly. "We'vejust had a terrible scene with my daughter, a terrible scene!" He seldomreferred to Marguerite by her Christian name, "Mr. Cannon, I had hopedto get through my life without a scandal, and especially an openscandal. But it seems as if I shouldn't--if I know my daughter! It wasnot my intention to say anything. Far from it. Outsiders ought not to betroubled.... I--I like you, Mr. Cannon. She left us a few minutes agoAnd as she didn't put her hat on she must be either at the studio or atAgg's....""She went out of the house?" George questioned awkwardly.Mr. Haim nodded, and then without warning he dropped like an inert lumpon to a chair and let his head fall on to his hand.George was frightened as well as mystified. The spectacle of the oldman--at one moment boasting ingenuously of his career, and at the nextalmost hysterical with woe--roused his pity in a very disconcertingmanner, and from his sight the Lucas & Enwright factotum vanishedutterly, and was supplanted by a tragic human being. But he had no ideahow to handle the unexampled situation with dignity; he realizedpainfully his own lack of experience, and his over-mastering impulse wasto get away while it was still possible to get away. Moreover, hedesired intensely to see and hear Marguerite."Perhaps I had better find out where she is," he absurdly suggested, anddeparted from the room feeling like a criminal reprieved.The old man did not stir.II"Can I come in?" said George, hatless, pushing open the door of thestudio, which was ajar.There were people in the bright and rather chilly studio, and none ofthem moved until the figure arriving out of the darkness was identified.Mr. Prince, who in the far corner was apparently cleaning or adjustinghis press, then came forward with a quiet, shy, urbane welcome.Marguerite herself stood nearly under the central lamp, talking to Agg,who was seated. The somewhat celebrated Agg immediately rose and said inher somewhat deep voice to Marguerite:"I must go."Agg was the eldest daughter of the Agg family, a broad-minded andturbulent tribe who acknowledged the nominal headship of a hard-workingand successful barrister. She was a painter, and lived and slept insemi-independence in a studio of her own in Manresa Road, but maintainedclose and constant relations with the rest of the tribe. In shape andproportions fairly tall and fairly thin, she counted in shops among thestock-sizes; but otherwise she was entitled to call herself unusual. Shekept her hair about as short as the hair of a boy who has postponedgoing to the barber's for a month after the proper time, and sheincompletely covered the hair with the smallest possible hat. Her coatwas long and straight and her skirt short. Her boots were high, reachingwell up the calf, but they had high heels and were laced in somehundreds of holes. She carried a cane in a neatly gloved hand. She wastwenty-seven. In style Marguerite and Agg made a great contrast with oneanother. Each was fully aware of the contrast, and liked it."Good evening, Mr. Cannon," said Agg firmly, not shaking hands.George had met her once in the way of small-talk at her father's house.Having yet to learn the important truth that it takes all sorts to makea world, he did not like her and wondered why she existed. He couldunderstand Agg being fond of Marguerite, but he could not understandMarguerite being fond of Agg; and the friendship between these two, nowthat he actually for the first time saw it in being, irked him."Is anything the matter?... Have you seen father?" asked Marguerite in aserious, calm tone, turning to him. Like George, she had run into thestudio without putting on any street attire.George perceived that there was no secret in the studio as to the crisisin the Haim family. Clearly the topic had been under discussion. Princeas well as Agg was privy to it. He did not quite like that. He wasvaguely jealous of both Prince and Agg. Indeed he was startled to findthat Marguerite could confide such a matter to Prince--at any ratewithout consulting himself. While not definitely formulating the claimin his own mind, he had somehow expected of Marguerite that until shemet him she would have existed absolutely sole, without any sentimentalconnexions of any sort, in abeyance, waiting for his miraculous advent.He was glad that Mr. Buckingham Smith was not of the conclave; he feltthat he could not have tolerated Mr. Buckingham Smith."Yes, I've seen him," George answered."Did he tell you?""Yes."Mr. Prince, after a little hovering, retired to his press, and a wheelcould be heard creaking."What did he tell you?""He told me about--the marriage.... And I gathered there'd been a bit ofa scene.""Nothing else?""No."Agg then interjected, fixing her blue eyes on George:"Marguerite is coming to live with me in my studio."And her challenging gaze met George's."Oh!" George could not suppress his pained inquietude at this decisionhaving been made without his knowledge. Both girls misapprehended hisfeeling. "That's it, is it?""Well," said Agg, "what can Mr. Haim expect? Here Marguerite's beenpaying this woman two shillings a day and her food, and letting her takea parcel home at nights. And then all of a sudden she comes dressed upfor tea, and sits down, and Mr. Haim says she's his future wife. What_does_ he expect? Does he expect Marguerite to kiss her and call hermamma? The situation's impossible.""But you can't stop people from falling in love, Agg, you know. It's nota crime," said Mr. Prince in his weak voice surprisingly from the press."I know it's not a crime," said Agg sharply. "And nobody wants to stoppeople from falling in love. If Mr. Haim chooses to go mad about acharwoman, when his wife, and such a wife, 's been dead barely threeyears, that's his concern. It's true the lady isn't much more than halfhis age, and that the whole business would be screamingly funny if itwasn't disgusting; but still he's a free agent. And Marguerite's a freeagent too, I hope. Of course he's thunder-struck to discover thatMarguerite _is_ a free agent. He would be!""He certainly is in a state," said George, with an uneasy short laugh.Agg continued:"And why is he in a state? Because Marguerite says she shall leave thehouse? Not a bit. Only because of what he thinks is the scandal of herleaving. Mr. Haim is a respectable man. He's simply all respectability.Respectability's his god--Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Always has been.He'd sacrifice everything to respectability--except the lovely Lobley.It's not respectable in a respectable family for a girl to leave home onaccount of her stepmother. And so he's in a state, if you please!... Ifhe wanted to carry on with Mrs. Lobley, let him carry on with her. Butno! That's not respectable. He's just got to marry her!" Agg sneered.George was startled, perhaps excusably, at the monstrous doctrineimplied in Agg's remarks. He had thought himself a man of the world,experienced, unshockable. But he blenched, and all his presence of mindwas needed to preserve a casual, cool demeanour. The worst of the trialwas Marguerite's tranquil acceptance of the attitude of her friend. Sheglanced at Agg in silent, admiring approval. He surmised that until thatmoment he had been perfectly ignorant of what girls really were."I see," said George courageously. And then, strangely, he began toadmire too. And he pulled himself together."I think I shall leave to-morrow," Marguerite announced. "Morning. Itwill be much better. She can look after him. I don't see that I owe anyduty ...""Yes, you do, dear," Agg corrected her impressively. "You owe a duty toyour mother--to her memory. That's the duty you owe. I'll come round foryou to-morrow myself in a four-wheeler--let me see, about eleven."George hated the sound of the word 'duty.'"Thank you, dear," Marguerite murmured, and the girls shook hands; theydid not kiss."Bye-bye, Princey.""Bye-bye, Agg.""Good night, Mr. Cannon."Agg departed, slightly banging the door."I think I'll go back home now," said Marguerite, in a sweet, firm tone."Had they gone out?""Who? Your father and What's-her-name? She's gone, but he hasn't. If youdon't want to meet him to-night again, hadn't you better----""Oh! If she's gone, he'll be gone too by this time. Trust him!"Mr. Prince approached them, urging Marguerite soothingly to stay as longas she liked. She shook her head, and pressed his hand affectionately.IIIWhen George and Marguerite re-entered No. 8 by the front door, Mr. Haimwas still sitting overcome at the tea-table. They both had sight of himthrough the open door of the parlour. Marguerite was obviously disturbedto see him there, but she went straight into the room. George moved intothe darkness of his own room. He heard the voices of the other two."Then you mean to go?" Haim asked accusingly.Marguerite answered in a calm, good-humoured, sweet tone:"Of course, if you mean to marry Mrs. Lobley.""Marry Mrs. Lobley! Of course I shall marry her!" Haim's voice rose."What right have you to settle where I shall marry and where I shan't?""I've fixed everything up with Celia Agg," said Marguerite very quietly."You've soon arranged it!"No reply from Marguerite. The old man spoke again:"You've no right--It'll be an open scandal."Then a silence. George now thought impatiently that a great fuss wasbeing made about a trifle, and that a matter much more importantdeserved attention. His ear caught a violent movement. The old man cameout of the parlour, and, instead of taking his hat and rushing off tofind the enchantress, he walked slowly and heavily upstairs, preceded byhis immense shadow thrown from the hall-lamp. He disappeared round thecorner of the stairs. George, under the influence of the apparition, wasforced to modify his view that all the fuss was over a trifle. Hetiptoed into the parlour. Marguerite was standing at the table. As soonas George came in she began to gather the tea-things together on thetray."I _say_!" whispered George.Marguerite's bent, tranquil face had a pleasant look as she handled thecrockery."I shall get him a nice breakfast to-morrow," she said, also in awhisper. "And as soon as he's gone to the office I shall pack. It won'ttake me long, really.""But won't Mrs. Lobley be here?""What if she is? I've nothing against Mrs. Lobley. Nor, as far as thatgoes, against poor father either--you see what I mean.""He told me you'd had a terrible scene. That's what he said'--a terriblescene.""It depends what you call a scene," she said smoothly. "I was ratherupset just at first--who wouldn't be?--but ..." She stopped, listening,with a glance at the ceiling. There was not the slightest soundoverhead. "I wonder what he's doing?"She picked up the tray."I'll carry that," said George."No! It's all right. I'm used to it. You might bring me the tablecloth.But you won't drop the crumbs out of it, will you?"He followed her with the bunched-up tablecloth down the dangerousbasement steps into the kitchen. She passed straight into the littlescullery, where the tray with its contents was habitually left for theattention of Mrs. Lobley the next morning. When she turned again, hehalted her, as it were, at the entrance from the scullery with aquestion."Shall you be all right?""With Agg?""Yes.""How do you mean--'all right'?""Well, for money, and so on.""Oh yes!" She spoke lightly and surely, with a faint confident smile."I was thinking as they'd cut down your prices----""I shall have heaps. Agg and I--why, we can live splendidly for next tonothing. You'll see."He was rebuffed. He felt jealous of both Agg and Prince, but especiallyof Prince. It still seemed outrageous to him that Prince should havebeen taken into her confidence. Prince had known of the affair beforehimself. He was more than jealous; he had a greater grievance.Marguerite appeared to have forgotten all about love, all about themighty event of their betrothal. She appeared to have put it away, ascasually as she had put away the tray. Yet ought not the event to countsupreme over everything else--over no matter what? He was desolate andunhappy."Did you tell Agg?" he asked."What about?""Our being engaged--and so on."She started towards him."Dearest!" she protested, not in the least irritated or querulous, butkindly, affectionately. "Without asking you first? Didn't we agree wewouldn't say anything to anybody? But we shall have to think abouttelling Agg."He met her and suddenly seized her. They kissed, and she shut her eyes.He was ecstatically happy."Oh!" she murmured in his embrace. "I'm so glad I've got you."And she opened her eyes and tears fell from them. She cried quietly,without excitement and without shame. She cried with absolutenaturalness. Her tears filled him with profound delight. And in theexquisite subterranean intimacy of the kitchen, he saw with his eyes andfelt with his arms how beautiful she was. Her face, seen close, wasincredibly soft and touching. Her nose was the most wonderful nose everwitnessed. He gloated upon her perfection. For, literally, to him shewas perfect. With what dignity and with what a sense of justice she hadbehaved, in the studio, in the parlour, and here. He was gloriouslyreassured as he realized how in their joint future he would be able torely upon her fairness, her conscientiousness, her mere pleasantnesswhich nothing could disturb. Throughout the ordeal of the evening shehad not once been ruffled. She had not said an unkind word, nor given anunkind gesture, nor exhibited the least trace of resentment. Then, shehad taste, and she was talented. But perhaps the greatest quality of allwas her adorable beauty and charm. And yet no! The final attraction wasthat she trusted him, depended on him, cried in his embrace.... Heloosed her with reluctance, and she deliciously wiped her eyes on hishandkerchief, and he took her again."I suppose I must leave here too, now," he said."Oh, George!" she exclaimed. "You mustn't! Why should you? I don't wantyou to.""Don't you? Why?""Oh! I don't! Truly. You'll be just as well looked after as if I washere. I do hope you'll stay."That settled it. And Manresa Road was not far off.She sat on the table and leaned against him a long time. Then she saidshe must go upstairs to her room--she had so much to do. He could notforbid, because she was irresistible. She extinguished the kitchen-lamp,and, side by side, they groped up the stairs to the first floor. The catnonchalantly passed them in the hall."Put the lights out here, will you, when you go to bed?" she whispered.He felt flattered.She offered her face.... The lovely thing slipped away upstairs withunimaginable, ravishing grace. She vanished. There was silence. After amoment George could hear the clock ticking in the kitchen below. Hestood motionless, amid the dizzying memories of her glance, hergestures, the softness of her body. What had happened to him was pastbelief. He completely forgot the existence of the old man in love.CHAPTER IVTHE LUNCHEONIGeorge, having had breakfast in bed, opened his door for the second timethat morning, and duly found on the mat the can of hot water (coveredwith a bit of old blanket) and the can of cold water which comprised thematerial for his bath. There was no sound in the house. The new spousemight be upstairs or she might be downstairs--he could not tell; but thecans proved that she was immanent and regardful; indeed, she neverforgot anything. And George's second state at No. 8 was physically evenbetter than his first. In the transition through autumn from summer towinter--a transition which, according to the experience of tens ofthousands of London lodgers, is capable of turning comparative comfortinto absolute discomfort--Mrs. Haim had behaved with benevolence andingenuity. For example, the bedroom fire, laid overnight, was nowburning up well from the mere touch of the lodger's own match. Suchthings are apt to count, and they counted with George.As for Mr. Haim, George knew that he was still in bed, because, sincehis marriage, Mr. Haim had made a practice of staying in bed on Sundaymornings. The scheme was his wife's; she regarded it as his duty tohimself to exercise this grand male privilege of staying in bed; to doso gave him majesty, magnificence, and was a sign of authority. A copyof _The Referee_, fresh as fruit new-dropped from the bough, lay in thehall at the front door. Mr. Haim had read _The Referee_ since _TheReferee_ was. He began his perusal with the feature known as "Mustardand Cress," which not only amused him greatly, but convinced him thathis own ideas on affairs were really very sagacious. His chief and mostserious admiration, however was kept for "Our Hand-Book." "It's myBible," he had once remarked, "and I'm not ashamed to say it. And thereare scores and scores of men who'd say the same." Church bells could notbe heard at No. 8. _The Referee_ lying in the hall was the gracious signof Sabbath morning. Presently Mrs. Haim would carry it upstairs,respectfully. For her it was simply and unanalysably _The Referee_. Shedid not dream of looking into it. Mr. Haim did not expect her to lookinto it. Her mission was to solace and to charm, his alone to supply theintellectual basis upon which their existence reposed. George's nosecaught the ascending beautiful odour of bacon; he picked up his cans anddisappeared.When he was dressed, he brought forward the grindstone to the fire, andconscientiously put his nose to it, without even lighting a cigarette.It had been agreed between himself and Marguerite that there should beno more cigarettes until after lunch. It had also been agreed that heshould put his nose to the grindstone that Sunday morning, and that sheshould do the same away in Manresa Road. George's grindstone happened tobe Miers and Crosskey's _The Soil in Relation to Health_. He waspreparing for his Final Examination. In addition to the vastimperial subject of Design, the Final comprised four othersubjects--Construction, Hygiene, Properties and Uses of BuildingMaterials, and Ordinary Practice of Architecture. George was now busywith one branch of the second of these subjects. Perhaps he was notfollowing precisely the order of tactics prescribed by the most wilytacticians, for as usual he had his own ideas and they were arbitrary;but he was veritably and visibly engaged in the slow but excitingprocess of becoming a great architect. And he knew and felt that he was.And the disordered bed, and the untransparent bath-water, and thesoap-tin by the side of the bath, and the breakfast-tray on a chair,were as much a part of the inspiring spectacle as himself tense andespecially dandiacal in the midst.Nevertheless appearances deceived. On a table were the thirteen folioand quarto glorious illustrated volumes of Ongania's _Basilica di SanMarco_, which Mr. Enwright had obtained for him on loan, and which hadcome down to No. 8 in a big box by Carter Paterson van. And while Georgesat quite still with his eyes and his volition centred fiercely on Miersand Crosskey, his brain would keep making excursions across the room tothe Church of St. Mark at Venice. He brought it back again and againwith a jerk but he could not retain it in place. The minutes passed; thequarters passed, until an hour and a half had gone. Then he closed Miersand Crosskey. He had sworn to study Miers and Crosskey for an hour and ahalf. He had fought hard to do so, and nobody could say that he had notdone so. He was aware, however, that the fight had not been whollysuccessful; he had not won it; on the other hand neither had he lost it.Honour was saved, and he could still sincerely assert that in regard tothe Final Examination he had got time fiercely by the forelock. He roseand strolled over to the _Basilica di San Marco_, and opened one or twoof those formidable and enchanting volumes. Then he produced acigarette, and struck a match, and he was about to light the cigarette,when squinting down at it he suddenly wondered: "Now how the deuce didthat cigarette come into my mouth?" He replaced the cigarette in hiscase, and in a moment he had left the house.He was invited to Mrs. John Orgreave's new abode at Bedford Park forlunch. In the early part of the year, Mrs. John had inheritedmoney--again, and the result had been an increase in the spaciousness ofher existence. George had not expected to see the new house, for he haddetermined to have nothing more to do with Mrs. John. He was, it is tobe feared, rather touchy. He and Mrs. John had not openly quarrelled,but in their hearts they had quarrelled. George had for some timeobjected to her attitude towards him as a boarder. She would hint that,as she assuredly had no need of boarders, she was conferring a favour onhim by boarding him. It was of course true, but George considered thather references to the fact were offensive. He did not understand andmake allowances for Adela. Moreover, he thought that a woman who hadbeen through the Divorce Court ought to be modest in demeanour towardspeople who had not been through the Divorce Court. Further, Adelaresented his frequent lateness for meals. And she had said, with anuncompromising glance: "I hope you'll turn over a new leaf when we getinto the new house." And he had replied, with an uncompromising glance:"Perhaps _I_ shan't get into the new house." Nothing else. But thatended it. After that both felt that mutual detestation had set in. JohnOrgreave was not implicated in the discreet rupture. Possibly he knew ofit; possibly he didn't; he was not one to look for trouble, and heaccepted the theory that it was part of George's vital scheme to inhabitChelsea. And then Adela, all fluffiness and winsomeness, had called, inthe previous week, at Russell Square and behaved like a woman whose soleaim in life is to please and cosset men of genius. "I shall bedreadfully hurt if you don't come to one of my Sunday lunches, George!"she had said. And also: "We _miss_ you, you know," and had put her headon one side.Marguerite had thoroughly approved his acceptance of the invitation. Shethought that he 'ought' to accept. He had promised, as she had an urgentdesign to do, not to arrive at the studio before 8 p.m., and he hadreceived a note from her that morning to insist on the hour.IIThe roads were covered with a very even, very thin coating of mud; itwas as though a corps of highly skilled house-painters had laid on themud, and just vanished. The pavements had a kind of yellowish-brownvarnish. Each of the few trees that could be seen--and there were afew--carried about six surviving leaves. The sky was of a blue-blackwith golden rents and gleams that travelled steadily eastwards. Exceptthe man with newspapers at the corner of Alexandra Grove, scarcely asign of life showed along the vistas of Fulham Road; but the clock overthe jeweller's was alive and bearing the usual false witness. From theupper open galleries of the Workhouse one or two old men and old womenin uniform looked down indifferently upon the free world which they hadleft for ever. Then an omnibus appeared faintly advancing from thebeautiful grey distance of the straight and endless street. Georgecrossed the road on his way towards Redcliffe Gardens and Earl's Court.He was very smart, indeed smarter than ever, having produced in himselfquite naturally and easily a fair imitation of the elegant figureswhich, upon his visits to the restaurant-building in Piccadilly, he hadobserved airing themselves round about Bond Street. His hair was smoothlike polished marble; his hat and stick were at the right angle; hisovercoat was new, and it indicated the locality of his waist; the spotsof colour in his attire complied with the operative decrees. His youngface had in it nothing that obviously separated him from the averageyouth of his clothes. Nobody would have said of him, at a glance, thathe might be a particularly serious individual. And most people wouldhave at once classed him as a callow pleasure-seeking person in the actof seeking pleasure.Nevertheless he was at that moment particularly serious, and hisseriousness was growing. His secret engagement had affected him, in partdirectly, and in part by the intensification of ambitious endeavourwhich had resulted from contact with that fount of seriousness,Marguerite. Although still entirely dependent--even to cigarettemoney--upon the benevolence of a couple of old individuals a hundred andfifty miles off, he reckoned that he was advancing in the world. TheIntermediate Examination was past, and already he felt that he had cometo grips with the Final and would emerge victorious. He felt too thathis general knowledge and the force and variety of his ideas wereincreasing. At times, when he and Marguerite talked, he was convincedthat both of them had achieved absolute knowledge, and that theircriticisms of the world were and would always be unanswerable. After theFinal, he hoped, his uncle would buy him a share in the Lucas & Enwrightpractice. In due season, his engagement would be revealed, and all wouldbe immensely impressed by his self-restraint and his good taste, and themarriage would occur, and he would be a London architect, an establishedman--at the mature age of, say, twenty-two.No cloud would have obscured the inward radiance caused by the lovelyimage of Marguerite and by his confidence in himself, had it not beenfor those criticisms of the world. He had moods of being rather gravelyconcerned as to the world, and as to London. He was recovering from thefirst great attack of London. He saw faults in London. He was capable ofbeing disturbed by, for example, the ugliness and the inefficiency ofLondon. He even thought that something ought to be done about it. Uponthis Sunday morning, fresh from visions of Venice, and rendered a littlecomplacent by the grim execution of the morning's programme of work, hewas positively pained by the aspect of Redcliffe Gardens. The RedcliffeArms public-house, locked and dead, which was the daily paradise ofhundreds of human beings, and had given balm and illusion to wholegenerations, seemed simply horrible to him in its Sunday morning coma.The large and stuffy unsightliness of it could not be borne. (However,the glimpse of a barmaid at an upper window interested him pleasantlyfor a moment.) And the Redcliffe Arms was the true gate to the stuccoand areas of Redcliffe Gardens. He looked down into the areas and sawtherein the furtive existence of squalor behind barred windows. All theobscene apparatus of London life was there. And as he raised his eyes tothe drawing-room and bedroom stories he found no relief. His eyes coulddiscover nothing that was not mean, ugly, frowzy, and unimaginative. Hepictured the heavy, gloomy, lethargic life within. The slatternlyservants pottering about the bases of the sooty buildings sickened andsaddened him. A solitary Earl's Court omnibus that lumbered past withits sinister, sparse cargo seemed to be a spectacle absolutelytragic--he did not know why. The few wayfarers were obviously prim andsmug. No joy, no elegance, anywhere! Only, at intervals, a feeling thatmysterious and repulsive wealth was hiding itself like an ogre in theeternal twilight of fastnesses beyond the stuccoed walls and the grimycurtains.... The city worked six days in order to be precisely this onthe seventh. Truly it was very similar to the Five Towns, and inessentials not a bit better.--A sociological discovery which startledhim! He wanted to destroy Redcliffe Gardens, and to design it afresh andrebuild it under the inspiration of St. Mark's and of the principles ofhygiene as taught for the Final Examination. He had grandiose ideas fora new design. As for Redcliffe Square, he could do marvels with itsspaces.He arrived too soon at Earl's Court Station, having forgotten that theUnderground Railway had a treaty with the Church of England and all theNonconformist churches not to run trains while the city, represented bypossibly two per cent of its numbers, was at divine worship. He walkedto and fro along the platforms in the vast echoing cavern peopled withwandering lost souls, and at last a train came in from the void, and ithad the air of a miracle, because nobody had believed that any trainever would come in. And at last the Turnham Green train came in, andGeorge got into a smoking compartment, and Mr. Enwright was in thecompartment.Mr. Enwright also was going to the Orgreave luncheon. He was in what theoffice called 'one of his moods.' The other occupants of the compartmenthad a stiff and self-conscious air: some apparently were proud of beingabroad on Sunday morning; some apparently were ashamed. Mr. Enwright'sdemeanour was as free and natural as that of a child. His lined anddrawn face showed worry and self-absorption in the frankest manner. Hebegan at once to explain how badly he had slept; indeed he asserted thathe had not slept at all; and he complained with extreme acerbity of therenewal of his catarrh. 'Constant secretion. Constant secretion,' wasthe phrase he used to describe the chief symptom. Then by a forcedtransition he turned to the profession of architecture, and restated hiscelebrated theory that it was the Cinderella of professions. The firmhad quite recently obtained a very important job in a manufacturingquarter of London, without having to compete for it; but Mr. Enwright'sgreat leading ideas never fluctuated with the fluctuation of facts. Ifthe multiplicity of his lucrative jobs had been such as to compel him torun round from one to another on a piebald pony in the style of Sir HughCorver, his view of the profession would not have altered. He spoke withterrible sarcasm apropos of a rumour current in architectural circlesthat a provincial city intended soon to invite competitive designs for abuilding of realty enormous proportions, and took oath that in no caseshould his firm, enter for the competition. In short, his condition wasmarkedly pessimistic.George loved him, and was bound to humour him; and in order to respondsympathetically to Enwright's pessimism he attempted to describe hissensations concerning the London Sunday, and in particular the Sundaymorning aspect of Earl's Court streets. He animadverted with virulence,and brought forward his new startling discovery that London was in truthas provincial as the provinces."Well, I don't think it is," said Enwright, instantly becoming ajudicial truth-seeker."Why don't you?""Simply because it's bigger--so much bigger. That's the principaldifference, and you'll never get over it. You must appreciate size. Anelephant is a noble animal, but it wouldn't be if it was only as big asa fly. London's an elephant, and forget it not.""It's frightfully ugly, most of it, anyhow, and especially on Sundaymorning," George persisted."Is it? I wonder whether it is, now. The architecture's ugly. But what'sarchitecture? Architecture isn't everything. If you can go up and downLondon and see nothing but architecture, you'll never be an A1architect." He spoke in a low, kindly, and reasonable tone. "I likeLondon on Sunday mornings. In fact it's marvellous. You say it's untidyand all that ... slatternly, and so on. Well, so it ought to be when itgets up late. Jolly bad sign if it wasn't. And that's part of it! Why,dash it, look at a bedroom when you trail about, getting up! Look howyou leave it! The existence of a big city while it's waking up--lethargybusiness--a sort of shamelessness--it's like a great animal! I thinkit's marvellous, and I always have thought so."George would not openly agree, but his mind was illuminated with a newlight, and in his mind he agreed, very admiringly.The train stopped; people got out; and the two were alone in thecompartment."I thought all was over between you and Adela," said Mr. Enwright,confidentially and quizzically.George blushed a little. "Oh no!""I don't know what I'm going to her lunch for, I'm sure. I suppose Ihave to go.""I have, too," said George."Well, she won't do you any good, you know. I was glad when you leftthere."George looked worldly. "Rum sort, isn't she?"I'll tell you what she is, now. You remember _Aida_ at the Paris Opera.The procession in the second act where you lost your head and said itwas the finest music ever written. And those girls in white, wavingpalms in front of the hero--What's-his-name. There are some women whoare born to do that and nothing else. Thin lips. Fixed idiotic smile.They don't think a bit about what they're doing. They're thinking aboutthemselves all the time. They simply don't care a damn about the hero,or about the audience, or anything, and they scarcely pretend to.Arrogance isn't the word. It's something more terrific--it's stupendous!Mrs. John's like that. I thought of it as I was coming along here.""Is she?" said George negligently. "Perhaps she is. I never thought ofher like that."Turnham Green Station was announced.IIIDespite the fresh pinky horrors of its external architecture, anddespite his own desire and firm intention to the contrary, George wasvery deeply impressed by the new Orgreave home. It was far larger thanthe previous house. The entrance was spacious, and the drawing-room,with a great fire at either end, immense. He had never been in aninterior so splendid. He tried to be off-hand in his attitude towardsit, but did not fully succeed. The taste shown in the decoration andfurniture was almost unexceptionable. White walls--Heppel-white;chintz--black, crackling chintz strewn with tens of thousands of giantroses. On the walls were a few lithographs--John's contribution to thegeneral effect. John having of late years begun to take himselfseriously as a collector of lithographs.One-third of the room was divided from the rest by an arched and frettedscreen of red lacquer, and within this open cage stood Mrs. John,surveying winsomely the expanse of little tables, little chairs, bigchairs, huge chairs, sofas, rugs, flower-vases, and knick-knacks. Shehad an advantage over most blondes nearing the forties in that she hadnot stoutened. She was in fact thin as well as short; but her face wastoo thin. Still, it dimpled, and she held
