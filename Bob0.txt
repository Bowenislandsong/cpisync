uld afford it very well?_Husb._--That's true, but I see it is otherwise now; and though I cannothelp it, I could not mention it to you, nor, for ought I know, should Iever have done it._Wife_.--Why! you said just now you should have done it._Husb._--Ay, at last, perhaps, I might, when things had been pastrecovery._Wife_.--That is to say, when you were ruined and undone, and could notshow your head, I should know it; or when a statute of bankrupt had comeout, and the creditors had come and turned us out of doors, then Ishould have known it--that would have been a barbarous sort of kindness._Husb._--What could I do? I could not help it._Wife_.--Just so our old acquaintance G--W--did; his poor wife knew notone word of it, nor so much as suspected it, but thought him in asflourishing circumstances as ever; till on a sudden he was arrested inan action for a great sum, so great that he could not find bail, and thenext day an execution on another action was served in the house, andswept away the very bed from under her; and the poor lady, that broughthim L3000 portion, was turned into the street with five small childrento take care of._Husb._--Her case was very sad, indeed._Wife_.--But was not he a barbarous wretch to her, to let her knownothing of her circumstances? She was at the ball but the day before, inher velvet suit, and with her jewels on, and they reproach her with itevery day._Husb._--She did go too fine, indeed._Wife_.--Do you think she would have done so, if she had known any thingof his circumstances?_Husb._--It may be not._Wife_.--No, no; she is a lady of too much sense, to allow us to suggestit._Husb._--And why did he not let her have some notice of it?_Wife_.--Why, he makes the same dull excuse you speak of; he could notbear to speak to her of it, and it looked so unkind to do any thing tostraiten her, he could not do it, it would break his heart, and thelike; and now he has broke her heart._Husb._--I know it is hard to break in upon one's wife in such a manner,where there is any true kindness and affection; but--_Wife_.--But! but what? Were there really a true kindness and affection,as is the pretence, it would be quite otherwise; he would not break hisown heart, forsooth, but chose rather to break his wife's heart! hecould not be so cruel to tell her of it, and therefore left her to becruelly and villanously insulted, as she was, by the bailiffs andcreditors. Was that his kindness to her?_Husb._--Well, my dear, I have not brought you to that, I hope._Wife_.--No, my dear, and I hope you will not; however, you shall not sayI will not do every thing I can to prevent it; and, if it lies on myside, you are safe._Husb._--What will you do to prevent it? Come, let's see, what can youdo?_Wife_.--Why, first, I keep five maids, you see, and a footman; I shallimmediately give three of my maids warning, and the fellow also, andsave you that part of the expense._Husb._--How can you do that?--you can't do your business._Wife_.--Yes, yes, there's nobody knows what they can do till they aretried; two maids may do all my house-business, and I'll look after mychildren myself; and if I live to see them grown a little bigger, I'llmake them help one another, and keep but one maid; I hope that will beone step towards helping it._Husb_.--And what will all your friends and acquaintance, and the world,say to it?_Wife_.--Not half so much as they would to see you break, and the worldbelieve it be by my high living, keeping a house full of servants, anddo nothing myself._Husb_.--They will say I am going to break upon your doing thus, andthat's the way to make it so._Wife_.--I had rather a hundred should say you were going to break, thanone could say you were really broke already._Husb_.--But it is dangerous to have it talked of, I say._Wife_.--No, no; they will say we are taking effectual ways to preventbreaking._Husb_.--But it will put a slur upon yourself too. I cannot bear anymortifications upon you, any more than I can upon myself._Wife_.--Don't tell me of mortifications; it would be a worsemortification, a thousand times over, to have you ruined, and have yourcreditors insult me with being the occasion of it._Husb_.--It is very kind in you, my dear, and I must always acknowledgeit; but, however, I would not have you straiten yourself too muchneither._Wife_.--Nay, this will not be so much a mortification as the naturalconsequence of other things; for, in order to abate the expense of ourliving, I resolve to keep less company. I assure you I will lay down allthe state of living, as well as the expense of it; and, first, I willkeep no visiting days; secondly, I'll drop the greatest part of theacquaintance I have; thirdly, I will lay down our treats andentertainments, and the like needless occasions of expense, and then Ishall have no occasion for so many maids._Husb_.--But this, my dear, I say, will make as much noise almost, as ifI were actually broke._Wife_.--No, no; leave that part to me._Husb_.--But you may tell me how you will manage it then._Wife_.--Why, I'll go into the country._Husb_.--That will but bring them after you, as it used to do._Wife_.--But I'll put off our usual lodgings at Hampstead, and give outthat I am gone to spend the summer in Bedfordshire, at my aunt's, whereevery body knows I used to go sometimes; they can't come after methither._Husb_.--But when you return, they will all visit you._Wife_.--Yes, and I will make no return to all those I have a mind todrop, and there's an end of all their acquaintance at once._Husb_.--And what must I do?_Wife_.--Nay, my dear, it is not for me to direct that part; you knowhow to cure the evil which you sensibly feel the mischief of. If I do mypart, I don't doubt you know how to do yours._Husb_.--Yes, I know, but it is hard, very hard._Wife_.--Nay, I hope it is no harder for you than it is for your wife._Husb_.--That is true, indeed, but I'll see._Wife_.--The question to me is not whether it is hard, but whether it isnecessary._Husb_.--Nay, it is necessary, that is certain._Wife_.--Then I hope it is as necessary to you as to your wife._Husb_.--I know not where to begin._Wife_.--Why, you keep two horses and a groom, you keep rich highcompany, and you sit long at the Fleece every evening. I need say nomore; you know where to begin well enough._Husb_.--It is very hard; I have not your spirit, my dear._Wife_.--I hope you are not more ashamed to retrench, than you would beto have your name in the Gazette._Husb_.--It is sad work to come down hill thus._Wife_.--It would be worse to fall down at one blow from the top; betterslide gently and voluntarily down the smooth part, than to be pusheddown the precipice, and be dashed all in pieces.There was more of this dialogue, but I give the part which I think mostto the present purpose; and as I strive to shorten the doctrine, so Iwill abridge the application also; the substance of the case lies in afew particulars, thus:--I. The man was melancholy, and oppressed with the thoughts of hisdeclining circumstances, and yet had not any thought of letting his wifeknow it, whose way of living was high and expensive, and more than hecould support; but though it must have ended in ruin, he would ratherlet it have gone on till she was surprised in it, than to tell her thedanger that was before her.His wife very well argues the injustice and unkindness of such usage,and how hard it was to a wife, who, being of necessity to suffer in thefall, ought certainly to have the most early notice of it--that, ifpossible, she might prevent it, or, at least, that she might not beoverwhelmed with the suddenness and the terror of it.II. Upon discovering it to his wife, or rather her drawing thediscovery from him by her importunity, she immediately, and mostreadily and cheerfully, enters into measures to retrench her expenses,and, as far as she was able, to prevent the blow, which was otherwiseapparent and unavoidable.Hence it is apparent, that the expensive living of most tradesmen intheir families, is for want of a serious acquainting their wives withtheir circumstances, and acquainting them also in time; for there arevery few ladies so unreasonable, who, if their husbands seriouslyinformed them how things stood with them, and that they could notsupport their way of living, would not willingly come into measures toprevent their own destruction.III. That it is in vain, as well as unequal, for a tradesman to preachfrugality to his wife, and to bring his wife to a retrenching of herexpenses, and not at the same time to retrench his own; seeing thatkeeping horses and high company is every way as great and expensive, andas necessary to be abated, as any of the family extravagances, let thembe which they will.All this relates to the duty of a tradesman in preventing his familyexpenses being ruinous to his business; but the true method to preventall this, and never to let it come so far, is still, as I said before,not to marry too soon; not to marry, till by a frugal industriousmanagement of his trade in the beginning, he has laid a foundation formaintaining a wife, and bringing up a family, and has made an essay bywhich he knows what he can and cannot do, and also before he has laid upand increased his stock, that he may not cripple his fortune at first,and be ruined before he has begun to thrive.FOOTNOTES:[22] [Defoe's views on the subject of the too early marrying of youngtradesmen, are in every particular sound. Though there are instances ofpremature marriages followed by no evil result, but rather the contrary,there can be no doubt, that the only prudent course is to wait till asettlement in life, and a regular income, have been secured. A youngman, anxious for other reasons to marry, is sometimes heard to expresshis conviction that he might live more cheaply married than single.There could be no assertion more inconsistent with all commonexperience. Even if no positively ruinous consequences arise from anover-early marriage, it almost always occasions much hardship. Itsaddens a period of life which nature has designed to be peculiarlycheerful. The whole life of such a man becomes like a year in whichthere has been no May or June. The grave cares of matrimony do notappear to be naturally suitable to the human character, till the man hasapproached his thirtieth, and the woman her twenty-fourth year.]CHAPTER XIIOF THE TRADESMAN'S LEAVING HIS BUSINESS TO SERVANTSIt is the ordinary excuse of the gentlemen tradesmen of our times, thatthey have good servants, and that therefore they take more liberty to beout of their business, than they would otherwise do. 'Oh!' says theshopkeeper, 'I have an apprentice--it is an estate to have such aservant. I am as safe in him as if I had my eye upon the business frommorning till night; let me be where I will, I am always satisfied he isat home; if I am at the tavern, I am sure he is in the counting-house,or behind the counter; he is never out of his post.'And then for my other servants, the younger apprentices,' says he, 'itis all one as if I were there myself--they would be idle it may be, buthe won't let them, I assure you; they must stick close to it, or he willmake them do it; he tells them, boys do not come apprentices to play,but to work; not to sit idle, and be doing nothing, but to mind theirmaster's business, that they may learn how to do their own.''Very well; and you think, Sir, this young man being so much in theshop, and so diligent and faithful, is an estate to you, and so indeedit is; but are your customers as well pleased with this man, too, as youare? or are they as well pleased with him, as they would be, if you werethere yourself?''Yes, they are,' says the shopkeeper; 'nay, abundance of the customerstake him for the master of the shop, and don't know any other; and he isso very obliging, and pleases so well, giving content to every body,that, if I am at any other part of the shop, and see him serving acustomer, I never interrupt them, unless sometimes (he is so modest) hewill call me, and turning to the ladies say, "There's my master, Madam;if you think he will abate you any thing, I'll call him;" and sometimesthey will look a little surprised, and say, "Is that your master?indeed, we thought you had been the master of the shop yourself."''Well,' said I, 'and you think yourself very happy in all this, don'tyou? Pray, how long has this young gentleman to serve? how long is itbefore his time will be out?' 'Oh, he has almost a year and a half toserve,' says the shopkeeper. 'I hope, then,' said I, 'you will take careto have him knocked on the head, as soon as his time is out.' 'Godforbid,' says the honest man; 'what do you mean by that?' 'Mean!' saidI, 'why, if you don't, he will certainly knock your trade on the head,as soon as the year and a half comes to be up. Either you must disposeof him, as I say, or take care that he does not set up near you, no, notin the same street; if you do, your customers will all run thither. Whenthey miss him in the shop, they will presently inquire for him; and as,you say, they generally take him for the master, they will ask whetherthe gentleman is removed that kept the shop before.'All my shopkeeper could say, was, that he had got a salve for that sore,and that was, that when Timothy was out of his time, he resolved to takehim in partner.'A very good thing, indeed! so you must take Timothy into half the tradewhen he is out of his time, for fear he should run away withthree-quarters of it, when he sets up for himself. But had not themaster much better have been Timothy himself?--then he had been surenever to have the customers take Timothy for the master; and when hewent away, and set up perhaps at next door, leave the shop, and runafter him.'It is certain, a good servant, a faithful, industrious, obligingservant, is a blessing to a tradesman, and, as he said, is an estate tohis master; but the master, by laying the stress of his business uponhim, divests himself of all the advantages of such a servant, and turnsthe blessing into a blast; for by giving up the shop as it were to him,and indulging himself in being abroad, and absent from his business, theapprentice gets the mastery of the business, the fame of the shopdepends upon him, and when he sets up, certainly follows him. Such aservant would, with the master's attendance too, be very helpful, andyet not be dangerous; such a servant is well, when he is visibly anassistant to the master, but is ruinous when he is taken for the master.There is a great deal of difference between a servant's being the stayof his master, and his being the stay of his trade: when he is thefirst, the master is served by him; and when he is gone, he breeds upanother to follow his steps; but when he is the last, he carries thetrade with him, and does his master infinitely more hurt than good.A good tradesman has a great deal of trouble with a bad servant, butmust take heed that he is not wounded by a good one--the extravagantidle vagrant servant hurts himself, but the diligent servant endangershis master. The greater reputation the servant gets in his business, themore care the master has upon him, lest he gets within him, and wormshim out of his business.The only way to prevent this, and yet not injure a diligent servant, isthat the master be as diligent as the servant; that the master be asmuch at the shop as the man. He that will keep in his business, neednever fear keeping his business, let his servant be as diligent as hewill. It is a hard thing that a tradesman should have the blessing of agood servant, and make it a curse to him, by his appearing less capablethan his man.Let your apprentice be in the business, but let the master be at thehead of the business at all times. There is a great deal of differencebetween being diligent in the business _in_ the shop, and leading thewhole business _of_ the shop. An apprentice who is diligent may bemaster of his business, but should never be master of the shop; the oneis to be useful to his master, the other is to be master of his master;and, indeed, this shows the absolute necessity of diligence andapplication in a tradesman, and how, for want of it, that very thingwhich is the blessing of another tradesman's business is the ruin ofhis.Servants, especially apprentices, ought to be considered, as they reallyare, in their moveable station, that they are here with you but sevenyears, and that then they act or move in a sphere or station of theirown: their diligence is now for you, but ever after it is forthemselves; that the better servants they have been while they were withyou, the more dangerous they will be to you when you part; that,therefore, though you are bound in justice to them to let them into yourbusiness in every branch of it, yet you are not bound to give yourbusiness away to them; the diligence, therefore, of a good servant inthe master's business, should be a spur to the master's diligence totake care of himself.There is a great deal of difference also between trusting a servant inyour business, and trusting him with your business: the first is leavingyour business with him, the other is leaving your business to him. Hethat trusts a servant in his business, leaves his shop only to him; buthe that leaves his business to his servant, leaves his wife and childrenat his disposal--in a word, such a trusting, or leaving the business tothe servant, is no less than a giving up all to him, abandoning the careof his shop and all his affairs to him; and when such a servant is outof his time, the master runs a terrible risk, such as, indeed, it is notfit any tradesman should run--namely, of losing the best of hisbusiness.What I have been now saying, is of the tradesman leaving his business tohis apprentices and servants, when they prove good, when they are honestand diligent, faithful, and industrious; and if there are dangers evenin trusting good servants, and such as do their duty perfectly well,what, then, must it be when the business is left to idle, negligent, andextravagant servants, who both neglect their masters' business and theirown, who neither learn their trade for themselves, nor regard it for theinterest of their masters? If the first are a blessing to their masters,and may only be made dangerous by their carrying away the trade withthem when they go, these are made curses to their masters early, forthey lose the trade for themselves and their masters too. The firstcarry the customers away with them, the last drive the customers awaybefore they go. 'What signifies going to such a shop?' say the ladies,either speaking of a mercer or a draper, or any other trade; 'there isnothing to be met with there but a crew of saucy boys, that are alwaysat play when you come in, and can hardly refrain it when you are there:one hardly ever sees a master in the shop, and the young rude boyshardly mind you when you are looking on their goods; they talk to you asif they cared not whether you laid out your money or no, and as if theyhad rather you were gone, that they might go to play again. I will gothere no more, not I.'If this be not the case, then you are in danger of worse still, and thatis, that they are often thieves--idle ones are seldom honest ones--nay,they cannot indeed be honest, in a strict sense, if they are idle: butby dishonest, I mean downright thieves; and what is more dangerous thanfor an apprentice, to whom the whole business, the cash, the books, andall is committed, to be a thief?For a tradesman, therefore, to commit his business thus into the hand ofa false, a negligent, and a thievish servant, is like a man that travelsa journey, and takes a highwayman into the coach with him: such a man issure to be robbed, and to be fully and effectually plundered, because hediscovers where he hides his treasure. Thus the tradesman places hisconfidence in the thief, and how should he avoid being robbed?It is answered, that, generally tradesmen, who have any considerabletrust to put into the hands of an apprentice, take security of them fortheir honesty by their friends, when their indentures are signed; and itis their fault then, if they are not secure. True, it is often so; butin a retail business, if the servant be unfaithful, there are so manyways to defraud a master, besides that of merely not balancing the cash,that it is impossible to detect them; till the tradesman, declininginsensibly by the weight of the loss, is ruined and undone.What need, then, has the tradesman to give a close attendance, andpreserve himself from plunder, by acquainting himself in and with hisbusiness and servants, by which he makes it very difficult for them todeceive him, and much easier to him to discover it if he suspects them.But if the tradesman lives abroad, keeps at his country-house orlodgings, and leaves his business thus in the hands of his servants,committing his affairs to them, as is often the case; if they provethieves, negligent, careless, and idle, what is the consequence?--he isinsensibly wronged, his substance wasted, his business neglected; andhow shall a tradesman thrive under such circumstances? Nay, how is itpossible he should avoid ruin and destruction?--I mean, as to hisbusiness; for, in short, every such servant has his hand in his master'spocket, and may use him as he pleases.Again, if they are not thieves, yet if they are idle and negligent, itis, in some cases, the same thing; and I wish it were well recommendedto all such servants as call themselves honest, that it is as criminalto neglect their master's business as to rob him; and he is as really athief who robs him of his time, as he that robs him of his money.I know, as servants are now, this is a principle they will not allow,neither does one servant in fifty act by it; but if the master beabsent, the servant is at his heels--that is to say, is as soon out ofdoors as his master, and having none but his conscience to answer to, hemakes shift to compound with himself, like a bankrupt with his creditor,to pay half the debt--that is to say, half the time to his master, andhalf to himself, and think it good pay too.The point of conscience, indeed, seems to be out of the question now,between master and servant; and as few masters concern themselves withthe souls, nay, scarce with the morals of their servants, either toinstruct them, or inform them of their duty either to God or man, muchless to restrain them by force, or correct them, as was ancientlypractised, so, few servants concern themselves in a conscientiousdischarge of their duty to their masters--so that the great law ofsubordination is destroyed, and the relative duties on both sides areneglected; all which, as I take it, is owing to the exorbitant sums ofmoney which are now given with servants to the masters, as the presentor condition of their apprenticeship, which, as it is extravagant initself, so it gives the servant a kind of a different figure in thefamily, places him above the ordinary class of servants hired for wages,and exempts him from all the laws of family government, so that a masterseems now to have nothing to do with his apprentice, any other than inwhat relates to his business.And as the servant knows this, so he fails not to take the advantage ofit, and to pay no more service than he thinks is due; and the hours ofhis shop business being run out, he claims all the rest for himself,without the above restraint. Nor will the servants, in these times, bearany examinations with respect to the disposing of their waste time, orwith respect to the company they keep, or the houses or places they goto.The use I make of it is this, and herein it is justly applicable to thecase in hand; by how much the apprentices and servants in this age areloose, wild, and ungovernable, by so much the more should a master thinkhimself obliged not to depend upon them, much less to leave his businessto them, and dispense with his own attendance in it. If he does, he musthave much better luck then his neighbours, if he does not find himselfvery much wronged and abused, seeing, as I said above, the servants andapprentices of this age do very rarely act from a principle ofconscience in serving their master's interest, which, however, I do notsee they can be good Christians without.I knew one very considerable tradesman in this city, and who had alwaysfive or six servants in his business, apprentices and journeymen, wholodged in his house; and having a little more the spirit of governmentin him than most masters I now meet with, he took this method with them.When he took apprentices, he told them beforehand the orders of hisfamily, and which he should oblige them to; particularly, that theyshould none be absent from his business without leave, nor out of thehouse after nine o'clock at night; and that he would not have it thoughthard, if he exacted three things of them:--1. That, if they had been out, he should ask them where they had been,and in what company? and that they should give him a true and directanswer.2. That, if he found reason to forbid them keeping company with anyparticular person, or in any particular house or family, they should beobliged to refrain from such company.3. That, in breach of any of those two, after being positively chargedwith it, he would, on their promising to amend it, forgive them, onlyacquainting their friends of it; but the second time, he would dismissthem his service, and not be obliged to return any of the money he hadwith them. And to these he made their parents consent when they werebound; and yet he had large sums of money with them too, not less thanL200 each, and sometimes more.As to his journeymen, he conditioned with them as follows:--1. They should never dine from home without leave asked and obtained,and telling where, if required.2. After the shutting in of the shop, they were at liberty to go wherethey pleased, only not to be out of the house after nine o'clock atnight.3. Never to be in drink, or to swear, on pain of being immediatelydismissed without the courtesy usual with such servants, namely, of amonth's warning.These were excellent household laws; but the question is, how shall amaster see them punctually obeyed, for the life of all laws depends upontheir being well executed; and we are famous in England for being remissin that very point; and that we have the best laws the worst executed ofany nation in the world.But my friend was a man who knew as well how to make his laws be wellexecuted, as he did how to make the laws themselves. His case was thus:he kept a country-house about two miles from London, in the summer-time,for the air of his wife and children, and there he maintained them verycomfortably: but it was a rule with him, that he who expects hisservants to obey his orders, must be always upon the spot with them tosee it done: to this purpose he confined himself to lie always at home,though his family was in the country; and every afternoon he walked outto see them, and to give himself the air too; but always so ordered hisdiversions, that he was sure to be at home before nine at night, that hemight call over his family, and see that they observed orders, that is,that they were all at home at their time, and all sober.As this was, indeed, the only way to have good servants, and an orderlyfamily, so he had both; but it was owing much, if not all, to theexactness of his government; and would all masters take the same method,I doubt not they would have the like success; but what servants can aman expect when he leaves them to their own government, not regardingwhether they serve God or the devil?Now, though this man had a very regular family, and very good servants,yet he had this particular qualification, too, for a good tradesman,namely, that he never left his business entirely to them, nor could anyof them boast that they were trusted to more than another.This is certainly the way to have regular servants and to have businessthrive; but this is not practised by one master to a thousand at thistime--if it were, we should soon see a change in the families oftradesmen, and that very much for the better: nor, indeed, would thisfamily government be good for the tradesman only, but it would be theservant's advantage too; and such a practice, we may say, would in timereform all the next age, and make them ashamed of us that went beforethem.If, then, the morals of servants are thus loose and debauched, and thatit is a general and epidemic evil, how much less ought tradesmen of thisage to trust them, and still less to venture their all upon them, leavetheir great design, the event of all their business with them, and gointo the country in pursuit of their pleasure.The case of tradesmen differs extremely in this age from those in thelast, with respect to their apprentices and servants; and the differenceis all to the disadvantage of the present age, namely, in the last age,that is to say, fifty or sixty years ago, for it is not less, servantswere infinitely more under subjection than they are now, and thesubordination of mankind extended effectually to them; they were contentto submit to family government; and the just regulations which mastersmade in their houses were not scorned and contemned, as they are now;family religion also had some sway upon them; and if their masters didkeep good orders, and preserve the worship of God in their houses, theapprentices thought themselves obliged to attend at the usual hours forsuch services; nay, it has been known, where such orders have beenobserved, that if the master of the family has been sick, or indisposed,or out of town, the eldest apprentice has read prayers to the family inhis place.How ridiculous, to speak in the language of the present times, would itbe for any master to expect this of a servant in our days! and where isthe servant that would comply with it? Nay, it is but very rarely nowthat masters themselves do it; it is rather thought now to be a lowstep, and beneath the character of a man in business, as if worshippingGod were a disgrace, and not an honour, to a family, or to the master ofa family; and I doubt not but in a little while more, either the worshipof God will be quite banished out of families, or the better sort oftradesmen, and such as have any regard to it, will keep chaplains, asother persons of quality do. It is confessed, the first is mostprobable, though the last, as I am informed, is already begun in thecity, in some houses, where the reader of the parish is allowed a smalladditional salary to come once a-day, namely, every evening, to readprayers in the house.But I am not talking on this subject; I am not directing myself tocitizens or townsmen, as masters of families, but as heads of trade, andmasters in their business; the other part would indeed require a wholebook by itself, and would insensibly run me into a long satiricaldiscourse upon the loss of all family government among us; in which,indeed, the practice of house-keepers and heads of families is grown notremiss only in all serious things, but even scandalous in their ownmorals, and in the personal examples they show to their servants, andall about them.But to come back to my subject, namely, that the case of tradesmendiffers extremely from what it was formerly: the second head ofdifference is this; that whereas, in former times, the servants werebetter and humbler than they are now, submitted more to familygovernment, and to the regulations made by their masters, and masterswere more moral, set better examples, and kept better order in theirhouses, and, by consequence of it, all servants were soberer, and fitterto be trusted, than they are now; yet, on the other hand,notwithstanding all their sobriety, masters did not then so much dependupon them, leave business to them, and commit the management of theiraffairs so entirely to their servants, as they do now.All that I meet with, which masters have to say to this, is contained intwo heads, and these, in my opinion, amount to very little.I. That they have security for their servants' honesty, which in formertimes they had not.II. That they receive greater premiums, or present-money, now with theirapprentices, than they did formerly.The first of these is of no moment; for, first, it does not appear thatapprentices in those former days gave no security to their masters fortheir integrity, which, though perhaps not so generally as now, yet Ihave good reason to know was then practised among tradesmen of note,and is not now among inferior tradesmen: but, secondly, this securityextends to nothing, but to make the master satisfaction for anymisapplications or embezzlements which are discovered, and can beproved, but extend to no secret concealed mischiefs: neither, thirdly,do those securities reach to the negligence, idleness, or debaucheriesof servants; but, which is still more than all the rest, they do notreach to the worst of robbery between the servant and his master, I meanthe loss of his time; so that still there is as much reason for themaster's inspection, both into his servants and their business, as ever.But least of all does this security reach to make the master anysatisfaction for the loss of his business, the ill management of hisshop, the disreputation brought upon it by being committed to servants,and those servants behaving ill, slighting, neglecting, or disobligingcustomers; this does not relate to securities given or taken, nor canthe master make himself any amends upon his servant, or upon hissecurities, for this irrecoverable damage. He, therefore, that will keepup the reputation of his shop, or of his business, and preserve histrade to his own advantage, must resolve to attend it himself, and notleave it to servants, whether good or bad; if he leaves it to goodservants, they improve it for themselves, and carry the trade away withthem when they go; if to bad servants, they drive his customers away,bring a scandal upon his shop, and destroy both their master andthemselves.Secondly, As to the receiving great premiums with their apprentices,which, indeed, is grown up to a strange height in this age, beyondwhatever it was before, it is an unaccountable excess, which is the ruinof more servants at this time than all the other excesses they aresubject to, nay, in some respect it is the cause of it all; and, on thecontrary, is far from being an equivalent to their masters for thedefect of their service, but is an unanswerable reason why the mastershould not leave his business to their management.This premium was originally not a condition of indenture, but was a kindof usual or customary present to the tradesman's wife to engage her tobe kind to the youth, and take a motherly care of him, being supposed tobe young when first put out.By length of time this compliment or present became so customary as tobe made a debt, and to be conditioned for as a demand, but still waskept within bounds, and thirty or forty pounds was sufficient to a verygood merchant, which now is run up to five hundred, nay, to a thousandpounds with an apprentice; a thing which formerly would have beenthought monstrous, and not to be named.The ill consequences of giving these large premiums are such and somany, that it is not to be entered upon in such a small tract as this;nor is it the design of this work: but it is thus far to the purposehere--namely, as it shows that this sets up servants into a class ofgentlemen above their masters, and above their business; and theyneither have a sufficient regard to one or other, and consequently arethe less fit to be trusted by the master in the essential parts of hisbusiness; and this brings it down to the case in hand.Upon the whole, the present state of things between masters and servantsis such, that now more than ever the caution is needful and just, thathe that leaves his business to the management of his servants, it is tento one but he ruins his business and his servants too.Ruining his business is, indeed, my present subject; but ruining hisservants also is a consideration that an honest, conscientious masterought to think is of weight with him, and will concern himself about.Servants out of government are like soldiers without an officer, fit fornothing but to rob and plunder; without order, and without orders, theyneither know what to do, or are directed how to do it.Besides, it is letting loose his apprentices to levity and liberty inthat particular critical time of life, when they have the most need ofgovernment and restraint. When should laws and limits be useful tomankind but in their youth, when unlimited liberty is most fatal tothem, and when they are least capable of governing themselves? To haveyouth left without government, is leaving fire in a magazine of powder,which will certainly blow it all up at last, and ruin all the housesthat are near it.If there is any duty on the side of a master to his servant, anyobligation on him as a Christian, and as a trustee for his parents, itlies here--to limit and restrain them, if possible, in the liberty ofdoing evil; and this is certainly a debt due to the trust reposed inmasters by the parents of the youth committed to them. If he is letloose here, he is undone, of course, and it may be said, indeed, he wasruined by his master; and if the master is afterwards ruined by such aservant, what can be said for it but this? He could expect no other.To leave a youth without government is indeed unworthy of any honestmaster; he cannot discharge himself as a master; for instead of takingcare of him he indeed casts him off, abandons him, and, to put it intoScripture words, he leads him into temptation: nay, he goes farther, touse another Scripture expression: he delivers him over to Satan.It is confessed--and it is fatal both to masters and servants at thistime--that not only servants are made haughty, and above the governmentof their masters, and think it below them to submit to any familygovernment, or any restraints of their masters, as to their morals andreligion; but masters also seem to have given up all family government,and all care or concern for the morals and manners, as well as for thereligion of their servants, thinking themselves under no obligation tomeddle with those things, or to think any thing about them, so thattheir business be but done, and their shop or warehouse duly lookedafter.But to bring it all home to the point in hand, if it is so with themaster and servant, there is the less room still for the master of suchservants to leave any considerable trust in the hands of suchapprentices, or to expect much from them, to leave the weight of theiraffairs with them, and, living at their country lodgings, and takingtheir own diversions, depend upon such servants for the success of theirbusiness. This is indeed abandoning their business, throwing it away,and committing themselves, families, and fortunes, to the conduct ofthose, who, they have all the reason in the world to believe, have noconcern upon them for their good, or care one farthing what becomes ofthem.CHAPTER XIIIOF TRADESMEN MAKING COMPOSITION WITH DEBTORS, OR WITH CREDITORSThere is an alternative in the subject of this chapter, which places thediscourse in the two extremes of a tradesman's fortunes.I. The _fortunate tradesman_, called upon by his poor unfortunateneighbour, who is his debtor, and is become insolvent, to havecompassion on him, and to compound with him for part of his debt, andaccept his offer in discharge of the whole.II. The _unfortunate tradesman_ become insolvent and bankrupt himself,and applying himself to his creditor to accept of a composition, indischarge of his debt.I must confess, a tradesman, let his circumstances be what they will,has the most reason to consider the disasters of the unfortunate, and becompassionate to them under their pressures and disasters, of any othermen; because they know not--no, not the most prosperous of them--whatmay be their own fate in the world. There is a Scripture proverb, if Imay call it so, very necessary to a tradesman in this case, 'Let himthat thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.'N.B. It is not said, let him that standeth take heed, but him _thatthinketh_ he standeth. Men in trade can but think they stand; and thereare so many incidents in a tradesman's circumstances, that sometimeswhen he thinks himself most secure of standing, he is in most danger offalling.If, then, the contingent nature of trade renders every man liable todisaster that is engaged in it, it seems strange that tradesmen shouldbe outrageous and unmerciful to one another when they fall; and yet soit is, that no creditor is so furious upon an unhappy insolventtradesman, as a brother-tradesman of his own class, and who is at leastliable to the same disaster, in the common event of his business.Nay, I have lived to see--such is the uncertainty of human affairs, andespecially in trade--the furious and outrageous creditor become bankrupthimself in a few years, or perhaps months after, and begging the samemercy of others, which he but just before denied to his not moreunfortunate fellow-tradesman, and making the same exclamations at thecruelty and hard-heartedness of his creditors in refusing to comply withhim, when, at the same time, his own heart must reproach him with hisformer conduct; how inexorable he was to all the entreaties and tears ofhis miserable neighbour and his distressed family, who begged hiscompassion with the lowest submission, who employed friends to solicitand entreat for them, laying forth their misery in the most livelyexpressions, and using all the arguments which the most moving distresscould dictate, but in vain.The tradesman is certainly wrong in this, as compassion to the miserableis a debt of charity due from all mankind to their fellow-creatures; andthough the purse-proud tradesman may be able to say he is above the fearof being in the like circumstances, as some may be, yet, even then, hemight reflect that perhaps there was a time when he was not so, and heought to pay that debt of charity, in acknowledgement of the mercy thathas set him above the danger.And yet, speaking in the ordinary language of men who are subject tovicissitudes of fortune, where is the man that is sure he shall meetwith no shock? And how have we seen men, who have to-day been immenselyrich, be to-morrow, as it were, reduced to nothing! What examples weremade in this city of such precipitations within the memory of someliving, when the Exchequer shutting up ruined the great bankers ofLombard Street.[23] To what fell Sir Robert Viner--the great AldermanBackwell--the three brothers of the name of Forth, of whom King CharlesII. made that severe pun, that '_Three-fourths_ of the city were broke?'To what have we seen men of prodigious bulk in trade reduced--as SirThomas Cook, Sir Basil Firebrass, Sheppard, Coggs, and innumerablebankers, money-scriveners, and merchants, who thought themselves assecure against the shocks of trade, as any men in the world could be?Not to instance our late South Sea directors, and others, reduced by theterrible fate of bubbles, whose names I omit because they yet live,though sinking still under the oppression of their fortunes, and whoseweight I would be far from endeavouring to make heavier.Why, then, should any tradesman, presuming on his own security, and ofhis being out of the reach of disaster, harden his heart against themiseries and distresses of a fellow-tradesman, who sinks, as it were, byhis side, and refuse to accept his offer of composition; at least, if hecannot object against the integrity of his representations, and cannotcharge him with fraud and deceit, breaking with a wicked design to cheatand delude his creditors, and to get money by a pretended breach? I say,why should any tradesman harden his heart in such a case, and not, witha generous pity, comply with a reasonable and fair proposal, while it isto be had?I do acknowledge, if there is an evident fraud, if he can detect thebankrupt in any wicked design, if he can prove he has effects sufficientto pay his debts, and that he only breaks with a purpose to cheat hiscreditors, and he conceals a part of his estate, when he seems to offera sincere surrender; if this be the case, and it can be made appear tobe so--for in such a case, too, we ought to be very sure of thefact--then, indeed, no favour is due, and really none ought to be shown.And, therefore, it was a very righteous clause which was inflicted onthe fraudulent bankrupt, in a late act of Parliament, namely, that incase he concealed his effects, and that it appeared he had, though uponhis oath, not given in a full account of his estate, but willingly andknowingly concealed it, or any part of it, with design to defraud hiscreditors, he should be put to death as a felon: the reason and justiceof which clause was this, and it was given as the reason of it when theact was passed in the House of Commons, namely, that the act was madefor the relief of the debtor, as well as of the creditor, and to procurefor him a deliverance on a surrender of his effects; but then it wasmade also for the relief of the creditor, too, that he might have asmuch of his debt secured to him as possible, and that he should notdischarge the debtor with his estate in his pocket, suffering him to runaway with his (the creditor's) money before his face.Also it was objected, that the act, without a penalty, would be only anact to encourage perjury, and would deliver the hard-mouthed knave thatcould swear what he pleased, and ruin and reject the modestconscientious tradesman, that was willing and ready to give up theutmost farthing to his creditors. On this account the clause wasaccepted, and the act passed, which otherwise had been thrown out.Now, when the poor insolvent has thus surrendered his all, stripthimself entirely upon oath, and that oath taken on the penalty of deathif it be false, there seems to be a kind of justice due to the bankrupt.He has satisfied the law, and ought to have his liberty given him _as aprey_, as the text calls it, Jer. xxxix. 18., that he may try the worldonce again, and see, if possible, to recover his disasters, and get hisbread; and it is to be spoken in honour of the justice as well ashumanity of that law for delivering bankrupts, that there are moretradesmen recover themselves in this age upon their second endeavours,and by setting up again after they have thus failed and been delivered,than ever were known to do so in ten times the number of years before.To break, or turn bankrupt, before this, was like a man being taken bythe Turks; he seldom recovered liberty to try his fortune again, butfrequently languished under the tyranny of the commissioners ofbankrupt, or in the Mint, or Friars, or rules of the Fleet, till hewasted the whole estate, and at length his life, and so his debts wereall paid at once.Nor was the case of the creditor much better--I mean as far asrespected his debt, for it was very seldom that any considerabledividend was made; on the other hand, large contributions were calledfor before people knew whether it was likely any thing would be made ofthe debtor's effects or no, and oftentimes the creditor lost his wholedebt, contribution-money and all; so that while the debtor was kept onthe rack, as above, being held in suspense by the creditors, or by thecommissioners, or both, he spent the creditor's effects, and subsistedat their expense, till, the estate being wasted, the loss fell heavy onevery side, and generally most on those who were least able to bear it.By the present state of things, this evil is indeed altered, and theruin of the creditor's effects is better prevented; the bankrupt can nomore skulk behind the door of the Mint and Rules, and prevent thecommissioners' inspection; he must come forth, be examined, give in anaccount, and surrender himself and effects too, or fly his country, andbe seen here no more; and if he does come in, he must give a fullaccount upon oath, on the penalty of his neck.When the effects are thus surrendered, the commissioners' proceedingsare short and summary. The assignees are obliged to make dividends, andnot detain the estate in their own hands, as was the case in formerdays, till sometimes they became bankrupts themselves, so that thecreditors are sure now what is put into the hands of the assignees,shall in due time, and without the usual delay, be fairly divided. Onthe other hand, the poor debtor having honestly discharged his part, andno objection lying against the sincerity of the discovery, has acertificate granted him, which being allowed by the Lord Chancellor, heis a clear man, and may begin the world again, as I have said above.The creditor, being thus satisfied that the debtor has been faithful,does not answer the end of the act of Parliament, if he declines toassent to the debtor's certificate; nor can any creditor decline it, buton principles which no man cares to own--namely, that of malice, and thehighest resentment, which are things a Christian tradesman will noteasily act upon.But I come now to the other part of the case; and this is supposing adebtor fails, and the creditors do not think fit to take out acommission of bankrupt against him, as sometimes is the case, at least,where they see the offers of the debtor are any thing reasonable: myadvice in such case is (and I speak it from long experience in suchthings), that they should always accept the first reasonable proposal ofthe debtor; and I am not in this talking on the foot of charity andmercy to the debtor, but of the real and undoubted interest of thecreditor; nor could I urge it, by such arguments as I shall bring, uponany other foundation; for, if I speak in behalf of the debtor, I mustargue commiseration to the miserable, compassion and pity of his family,and a reflection upon the sad changes which human life exposes us allto, and so persuade the creditor to have pity upon not him only, butupon all families in distress.But, I say, I argue now upon a different foundation, and insist that itis the creditor's true interest, as I hinted before, that if he findsthe debtor inclined to be honest, and he sees reason to believe he makesthe best offer he can, he should accept the first offer, as beinggenerally the best the debtor can make;[24] and, indeed, if the debtorbe wise as well as honest, he will make it so, and generally it is foundto be so. And there are, indeed, many reasons why the first offers ofthe debtor are generally the best, and why no commission of bankruptordinarily raises so much, notwithstanding all its severities, as thebankrupt offers before it is sued out--not reckoning the time andexpense which, notwithstanding all the new methods, attend such things,and are inevitable. For example--When the debtor, first looking into his affairs, sees the necessitycoming upon him of making a stop in trade, and calling his creditorstogether, the first thought which by the consequence of the thing comesto be considered, is, what offers he can make to them to avoid thehaving a commission sued out against him, and to which end commonprudence, as well as honest principles, move him to make the best offershe can. If he be a man of sense, and, according to what I mentioned inanother chapter, has prudently come to a stop in time, before things arerun to extremities, and while he has something left to make an offer ofthat may be considerable, he will seldom meet with creditors so weak orso blind to their own interest not to be willing to end it amicably,rather than to proceed to a commission. And as this is certainly bestboth for the debtor and the creditor, so, as I argued with the debtor,that he should be wise enough, as well as honest enough, to breakbetimes, and that it was infinitely best for his own interest, so I mustadd, on the other hand, to the creditor, that it is always his interestto accept the first offer; and I never knew a commission make more of anestate, where the debtor has been honest, than he (the debtor) proposedto give them without it.It is true, there are cases where the issuing out a commission may beabsolutely necessary. For example--1. Where the debtor is evidently knavish, and discovers himself to beso, by endeavours to carry off his effects, or alter the property of theestate, confessing judgments, or any the usual ways of fraud, which insuch cases are ordinarily practised. Or--2. Where some creditors, by such judgments, or by attachments of debts,goods delivered, effects made over, or any other way, have gotten someof the estate into their hands, or securities belonging to it, wherebythey are in a better state, as to payment, than the rest. Or--3. Where some people are brought in as creditors, whose debts there isreason to believe are not real, but who place themselves in the room ofcreditors, in order to receive a dividend for the use of the bankrupt,or some of his family.In these, and such like cases, a commission is inevitable, and must betaken out; nor does the man merit to be regarded upon the foot of what Icall compassion and commiseration at all, but ought to be treated like a_rapparee_,[25] or plunderer, who breaks with a design to make himselfwhole by the composition; and as many did formerly, who were beggarswhen they broke, be made rich by the breach. It was to provide againstsuch harpies as these that the act of Parliament was made; and the onlyremedy against them is a commission, in which the best thing they can dofor their creditors is to come in and be examined, give in a falseaccount upon oath, be discovered, convicted of it, and sent to thegallows, as they deserve.But I am speaking of honest men, the reverse of such thieves as these,who being brought into distress by the ordinary calamities of trade, arewilling to do the utmost to satisfy their creditors. When such as thesebreak in the tradesman's debt, let him consider seriously my advice, andhe shall find--I might say, he shall _always_ find, but I do affirm, heshall _generally_ find--the first offer the best, and that he will neverlose by accepting it. To refuse it is but pushing the debtor toextremities, and running out some of the effects to secure the rest.First, as to collecting in the debts. Supposing the man is honest, andthey can trust him, it is evident no man can make so much of them as thebankrupt. (1.) He knows the circumstances of the debtors, and how bestto manage them; he knows who he may best push at, and who best forbear.(2.) He can do it with the least charge; the commissioners or assigneesmust employ other people, such as attorneys, solicitors, &c., and theyare paid dear. The bankrupt sits at home, and by letters into thecountry, or by visiting them, if in town, can make up every account,answer every objection, judge of every scruple, and, in a word, withease, compared to what others must do, brings them to comply.Next, as to selling off a stock of goods. The bankrupt keeps open theshop, disperses or disposes of the goods with advantage; whereas thecommission brings all to a sale, or an outcry, or an appraisement, andall sinks the value of the stock; so that the bankrupt can certainlymake more of the stock than any other person (always provided he ishonest, as I said before), and much more than the creditors can do.For these reasons, and many others, the bankrupt is able to make abetter offer upon his estate than the creditors can expect to raise anyother way; and therefore it is their interest always to take the firstoffer, if they are satisfied there is no fraud in it, and that the manhas offered any thing near the extent of what he has left in the worldto offer from.If, then, it be the tradesman's interest to accept of the offer made,there needs no stronger argument to be used with him for the doing it;and nothing is more surprising to me than to see tradesmen, the hardestto come into such compositions, and to push on severities against othertradesmen, as if they were out of the reach of the shocks of fortunethemselves, or that it was impossible for them ever to stand in need ofthe same mercy--the contrary to which I have often seen.To what purpose should tradesmen push things to extremities againsttradesmen, if nothing is to be gotten by it, and if the insolventtradesman will take proper measures to convince the creditor that hisintentions are honest? The law was made for offenders; there needs nolaw for innocent men: commissions are granted to manage knaves, andhamper and entangle cunning and designing rogues, who seek to raisefortunes out of their creditors' estates, and exalt themselves by theirown downfall; they are not designed against honest men, neither, indeed,is there any need of them for such.Let no man mistake this part, therefore, and think that I am movingtradesmen to be easy and compassionate to rogues and cheats: I am farfrom it, and have given sufficient testimony of the contrary; having, Iassure you, been the only person who actually formed, drew up, and firstproposed that very cause to the House of Commons, which made it felonyto the bankrupt to give in a false account. It cannot, therefore, besuggested, without manifest injustice, that I would with one breathprompt creditors to be easy to rogues, and to cheating fraudulentbankrupts, and with another make a proposal to have them hanged.But I move the creditor, on account of his own interest, always to takethe first offer, if he sees no palpable fraud in it, or sees no reasonto suspect such fraud; and my reason is good, namely, because I believe,as I said before, it is generally the best.I know there is a new method of putting an end to a tradesman'stroubles, by that which was formerly thought the greatest of alltroubles; I mean a fraudulent method, or what they call taking outfriendly statutes; that is, when tradesmen get statutes taken outagainst themselves, moved first by some person in kindness to them, anddone at the request of the bankrupt himself. This is generally donewhen the circumstances of the debtor are very low, and he has little ornothing to surrender; and the end is, that the creditors may be obligedto take what there is, and the man may get a full discharge.This is, indeed, a vile corruption of a good law, and turning the edgeof the act against the creditor, not against the debtor; and as he hasnothing to surrender, they get little or nothing, and the man is aseffectually discharged as if he had paid twenty shillings in the pound;and so he is in a condition to set up again, take fresh credit, breakagain, and have another commission against him; and so round, as oftenas he thinks fit. This, indeed, is a fraud upon the act, and shows thatall human wisdom is imperfect, that the law wants some repairs, and thatit will in time come into consideration again, to be made capable ofdisappointing the people that intend to make such use of it.I think there is also wanting a law against twice breaking, and that allsecond commissions should have some penalty upon the bankrupt, and athird a farther penalty, and if the fourth brought the man to thegallows, it could not be thought hard; for he that has set up and broke,and set up again, and broke again, and the like, a third time, I thinkmerits to be hanged, if he pretends to venture any more.Most of those crimes against which any laws are published in particular,and which are not capital, have generally an addition of punishment upona repetition of the crime, and so on--a further punishment to a furtherrepetition. I do not see why it should not be so here; and I doubt notbut it would have a good effect upon tradesmen, to make them cautious,and to warn them to avoid such scandalous doings as we see dailypractised, breaking three or four, or five times over; and we seeinstances of some such while I am writing this very chapter.To such, therefore, I am so far from moving for any favour, either fromthe law, or from their creditors, that I think the only deficiency ofthe law at this time is, that it does not reach to inflict a corporalpunishment in such a case, but leaves such insolvents to fare well, incommon with those whose disasters are greater, and who, being honest andconscientious, merit more favour, but do not often find it.FOOTNOTES:[23] [This event took place in 1671, Charles II. finding it necessary tosuspend the national payments for a year.][24] [The truth of this continues to be matter of daily observation inour own times.][25] [A name applied, in the seventeenth century, to a certain class ofrobbers in Ireland.]CHAPTER XIVOF THE UNFORTUNATE TRADESMAN COMPOUNDING WITH HIS CREDITORSThis is what in the last chapter I called an alternative to that of thefortunate tradesman yielding to accept the composition of his insolventdebtor.The poor unhappy tradesman, having long laboured in the fire, andfinding it is in vain to struggle, but that whether he strives or notstrives, he must break; that he does but go backward more and more, andthat the longer he holds out, he shall have the less to offer, and bethe harder thought of, as well as the harder dealt with--resolves tocall his creditors together in time, while there is somethingconsiderable to offer them, and while he may have some just account togive of himself, and of his conduct, and that he may not be reproachedwith having lived on the spoil, and consumed their estates; and thus,being satisfied that the longer he puts the evil day from him, theheavier it will fall when it comes; I say, he resolves to go no farther,and so gets a friend to discourse with and prepare them, and then drawsup a state of his case to lay before them.First, He assures them that he has not wasted his estate, either by viceand immorality, or by expensive and riotous living, luxury,extravagance, and the like.Secondly, He makes it appear that he has met with great losses, such ashe could not avoid; and yet such and so many, that he has not been ableto support the weight of them.Thirdly, That he could have stood it out longer, but that he wassensible if he did, he should but diminish the stock, which, consideringhis debts, was properly not his own; and that he was resolved not tospend one part of their debts, as he had lost the other.Fourthly, That he is willing to show them his books, and give up everyfarthing into their hands, that they might see he acted the part of anhonest man to them. And,Fifthly, That upon his doing so, they will find, that there is in goodsand good debts sufficient to pay them fifteen shillings in the pound;after which, and when he has made appear that they have a faithful andjust account of every thing laid before them, he hopes they will givehim his liberty, that he may try to get his bread, and to maintain hisfamily in the best manner he can; and, if possible, to pay the remainderof the debt.You see I go all the way upon the suggestion of the poor unfortunatetradesman being critically honest, and showing himself so to the fullsatisfaction of his creditors; that he shows them distinctly a truestate of his case, and offers his books and vouchers to confirm everypart of his account.Upon the suggestion of his being thus sincerely honest, and allowingthat the state of his account comes out so well as to pay fifteenshillings in the pound, what and who but a parcel of outrageoushot-headed men would reject such a man? What would they be called, nay,what would they say of themselves, if they should reject such acomposition, and should go and take out a commission of bankrupt againstsuch a man? I never knew but one of the like circumstances, that wasrefused by his creditors; and that one held them out, till they were allglad to accept of half what they said should be first paid them: so mayall those be served, who reject such wholesome advice, and the seasonfor accepting a good offer, when it was made them. But I return to thedebtor.When he looks into his books, he finds himself declined, his own fortunelost, and his creditors' stock in his hands wasted in part, and stillwasting, his trade being for want of stock much fallen off, and hisfamily expense and house-rent great; so he draws up the general articlesthus:--STOCK DEBTOR     To cash of my father (being my stock) to begin with in     trade                                                       L800  0  0     To Cash of my father-in-law, being my wife's portion         600  0  0     To household-goods, plate, &c. of both                       100  0  0     To profits in trade for ten years, as by the yearly balance     in the journal appears                                      2469 10  0     To debts abroad esteemed good, as by the ledger appears     1357  8  0     To goods in the warehouse at the prime cost                  672 12  0     Plate and some small jewels of my wife's left, and old     household-goods altogether                                   103  0  0                                                               ------------                                                                L6102 10  0     Estate deficient to balance                                 1006  2  0                                                               ------------                                                                L7108 12  0     STOCK CREDITOR     By losses by bad debts in trade, in the year 1715       L 50    0  0     By do. 1716                                               66   10  0     By do. 1717                                              234   15  0     By do. 1718                                               43    0  0     By do. 1719                                               25    0  0     By do. by the South Sea stock, 1720                     1280    0  0     By do. in trade, 1721                                     42    0  0     By do. 1722                                              106    0  0     By do. 1723                                              302    0  0     By do. 1724                                               86   15  0     By house-keeping and expenses, taxes included, as by the        cash-book appears, for ten years                     1836   12  0     By house-rents at L50 per annum                          500    0  0     By credits now owing to sundry persons, as by the ledger        appears                                              2536    0  0                                                          ----------------                                                            L7108   12  0                                                          ================This account is drawn out to satisfy himself how his condition stands,and what it is he ought to do: upon the stating which account he sees tohis affliction that he has sunk all his own fortune and his wife's, andis a thousand pounds worse than nothing in the world; and that, beingobliged to live in the same house for the sake of his business andwarehouse, though the rent is too great for him, his trade beingdeclined, his credit sunk, and his family being large, he sees evidentlyhe cannot go on, and that it will only be bringing things from bad toworse; and, above all the rest, being greatly perplexed in his mind thathe is spending other people's estates, and that the bread he eats is nothis own, he resolves to call his creditors all together, lay before themthe true state of his case, and lie at their mercy for the rest.The account of his present and past fortune standing as it did, and asappears above, the result is as follows, namely, that he has notsufficient to pay all his creditors, though his debts should prove to beall good, and the goods in his warehouse should be fully worth the pricethey cost, which, being liable to daily contingencies, add to thereasons which pressed him before to make an offer of surrender to hiscreditors both of his goods and debts, and to give up all into theirhands.The state of his case, as to his debts and credits, stands as follows:--     His debts esteemed good, as by the ledger, are         L1357   8   0     His goods in the warehouse                               672  12   0                                                           ---------------                                                            L2030   0   0     His creditors demands, as by the same ledger     appears, are                                           L3036   0   0This amounts to fifteen shillings in the pound upon all his debts,which, if the creditors please to appoint an assignee or trustee to sellthe goods, and collect the debts, he is willing to surrender wholly intotheir hands, hoping they will, as a favour, give him his householdgoods, as in the account, for his family use, and his liberty, that hemay seek out for some employment to get his bread.The account being thus clear, the books exactly agreeing, and the manappearing to have acted openly and fairly, the creditors meet, and,after a few consultations, agree to accept his proposals, and the man isa free man immediately, gets fresh credit, opens his shop again, and,doubling his vigilance and application in business, he recovers in a fewyears, grows rich; then, like an honest man still, he calls all hiscreditors together again, tells them he does not call them now to asecond composition, but to tell them, that having, with God's blessingand his own industry, gotten enough to enable him, he was resolved topay them the remainder of his old debt; and accordingly does so, to thegreat joy of his creditors, to his own very great honour, and to theencouragement of all honest men to take the same measures. It is true,this does not often happen, but there have been instances of it, and Icould name several within my own knowledge.But here comes an objection in the way, as follows: It is true this mandid very honestly, and his creditors had a great deal of reason to besatisfied with his just dealing with them; but is every man bound thusto strip himself naked? Perhaps this man at the same time had a familyto maintain, and had he no debt of justice to them, but to beg hishousehold goods back of them for his poor family, and that as analms?-and would he not have fared as well, if he had offered hiscreditors ten shillings in the pound, and took all the rest uponhimself, and then he had reserved to himself sufficient to havesupported himself in any new undertaking?The answer to this is short and plain, and no debtor can be at a loss toknow his way in it, for otherwise people may make difficulties wherethere are none; the observing the strict rules of justice and honestywill chalk out his way for him.The man being deficient in stock, and his estate run out to a thousandpounds worse than nothing by his losses, &c, it is evident all he hasleft is the proper estate of his creditors, and he has no right to oneshilling of it; he owes it them, it is a just debt to them, and he oughtto discharge it fairly, by giving up all into their hands, or at leastto offer to do so.But to put the case upon a new foot; as he is obliged to make an offer,as above, to put all his effects, books, and goods into their power, sohe may add an alternative to them thus, namely--that if, on the otherhand, they do not think proper to take the trouble, or run the risk, ofcollecting the debts, and selling the goods, which may be difficult, ifthey will leave it to him to do it, he will undertake to paythem--shillings in the pound, and stand to the hazard both of debts andgoods.Having thus offered the creditors their choice, if they accept theproposal of a certain sum, as sometimes I know they have chosen to do,rather than to have the trouble of making assignees, and run the hazardof the debts, when put into lawyers' hands to collect, and of the goods,to sell them by appraisement; if, I say, they choose this, and offer todischarge the debtor upon payment, suppose it be of ten or twelveshillings in the pound in money, within a certain time, or on givingsecurity for the payment; then, indeed, the debtor is discharged inconscience, and may lawfully and honestly take the remainder as a giftgiven him by his creditors for undertaking their business, or securingthe remainder of their debt to them--I say, the debtor may do this withthe utmost satisfaction to his conscience.But without thus putting it into the creditors' choice, it is a forceupon them to offer them any thing less than the utmost farthing that heis able to pay; and particularly to pretend to make an offer as if itwere his utmost, and, as is usual, make protestations that it is themost he is able to pay (indeed, every offer of a composition is a kindof protestation that the debtor is not able to pay any more)--I say, tooffer thus, and declare he offers as much as possible, and as much asthe effects he has left will produce, if his effects are able to producemore, he is then a cheat; for he acts then like one that stands at baywith his creditors, make an offer, and if the creditors do not think fitto accept of it, they must take what methods they think they can take toget more; that is to say, he bids open defiance to their statutes andcommissions of bankrupt, and any other proceedings: like a townbesieged, which offers to capitulate and to yield upon such and sucharticles; which implies, that if those articles are not accepted, thegarrison will defend themselves to the last extremity, and do all themischief to the assailants that they can.Now, this in a garrison-town, I say, may be lawful and fair, but in adebtor to his creditor it is quite another thing: for, as I have saidabove, the debtor has no property in the effects which he has in hishands; they are the goods and the estate of the creditor; and to holdout against the creditor, keep his estate by violence, and make himaccept of a small part of it, when the debtor has a larger part in hispower, and is able to give it--this is not fair, much less is it honestand conscientious; but it is still worse to do this, and at the sametime to declare that it is the utmost the debtor can do; this, I say, isstill more dishonest, because it is not true, and is adding falsehood tothe other injustice.Thus, I think, I have stated the case clearly, for the conduct of thedebtor; and, indeed, this way of laying all before the creditors, andputting it into their choice, seems a very happy method for the comfortof the debtor, cast down and dejected with the weight of hiscircumstances; and, it may be, with the reproaches of his own consciencetoo, that he has not done honestly in running out the effects of hiscreditors, and making other families suffer by him, and perhaps poorfamilies too--I say, this way of giving up all with an honest and singledesire to make all the satisfaction he is able to his creditors, greatlyheals the breach in his peace, which his circumstances had made before;for, by now doing all that is in his power, he makes all possible amendsfor what is past, I mean as to men; and they are induced, by this open,frank usage, to give him the reward of his honesty, and freely forgivehim the rest of the debt.There is a manifest difference to the debtor, in point of conscience,between surrendering his whole effects, or estate, to his creditors forsatisfaction of their debts, and offering them a composition, unless, asI have said, the composition is offered, as above, to the choice of thecreditor. By surrendering the whole estate, the debtor acknowledges thecreditors' right to all he has in his possession, and gives it up tothem as their own, putting it in their full power to dispose of it asthey please.But, by a composition, the debtor, as I have said above, stands at baywith the creditors, and, keeping their estates in his hands, capitulateswith them, as it were, sword in hand, telling them he can give them nomore, when perhaps, and too often it is the case, it is apparent that heis in condition to offer more. Now, let the creditors consent to theseproposals, be what it will; and, however voluntary it may be pretendedto be, it is evident that a force is the occasion of it, and thecreditor complies, and accepts the proposal, upon the supposition thatno better conditions can be had. It is the plain language of the thing,for no man accepts of less than he thinks he can get: if he believed hecould have more, he would certainly get it if he could.And if the debtor is able to pay one shilling more than he offers, it isa cheat, a palpable fraud, and of so much he actually robs his creditor.But in a surrender the case is altered in all its parts; the debtor saysto his creditors, 'Gentlemen, there is a full and faithful account ofall I have left; it is your own, and there it is; I am ready to put itinto your hands, or into the hands of whomsoever you shall appoint toreceive it, and to lie at your mercy.' This is all the man is able todo, and therefore is so far honest; whether the methods that reduced himwere honest or no, that is a question by itself. If on this surrender hefinds the creditors desirous rather to have it digested into acomposition, and that they will voluntarily come into such a proposal,then, as above, they being judges of the equity of the composition, andof what ability the debtor is to perform it, and, above all, of what hemay or may not gain by it, if they accept of such a composition, insteadof the surrender of his effects, then the case alters entirely, and thedebtor is acquitted in conscience, because the creditor had a fairchoice, and the composition is rather their proposal to the debtor, thanthe debtor's proposal to them.Thus, I think, I have stated the case of justice and conscience on thedebtor's behalf, and cleared up his way, in case of a necessity, to stoptrading, that he may break without wounding his conscience, as well ashis fortunes; and he that thinks fit to act thus, will come off with thereputation of an honest man, and will have the favour of his creditorsto begin again, with whatever he may have as to stock; and sometimesthat favour is better to him than a stock, and has been the raising ofmany a broken tradesman, so that his latter end has been better than hisbeginning.CHAPTER XVOF TRADESMEN RUINING ONE ANOTHER BY RUMOUR AND CLAMOUR, BY SCANDAL ANDREPROACHI have dwelt long upon the tradesman's management of himself, in orderto his due preserving both his business and his reputation: let mebestow one chapter upon the tradesman for his conduct among hisneighbours and fellow-tradesmen.Credit is so much a tradesman's blessing that it is the choicest ware hedeals in, and he cannot be too chary of it when he has it, or buy it toodear when he wants it; it is a stock to his warehouse, it is currentmoney in his cash-chest, it accepts all his bills, for it is on the fundof his credit that he has any bills to accept; demands would else bemade upon the spot, and he must pay for his goods before he hasthem--therefore, I say, it accepts all his bills, and oftentimes paysthem too; in a word, it is the life and soul of his trade, and itrequires his utmost vigilance to preserve it.If, then, his own credit should be of so much value to him, and heshould be so nice in his concern about it, he ought in some degree tohave the same care of his neighbour's. Religion teaches us not toslander and defame our neighbour, that is to say, not to raise orpromote any slander or scandal upon his good name. As a good name is toanother man, and which the wise man says, 'is better than life,' thesame is credit to a tradesman--it is the life of his trade; and he thatwounds a tradesman's credit without cause, is as much a murderer intrade, as he that kills a man in the dark is a murderer in matters ofblood.Besides, there is a particular nicety in the credit of a tradesman,which does not reach in other cases: a man is slandered in hischaracter, or reputation, and it is injurious; and if it comes in theway of a marriage, or of a preferment, or post, it may disappoint andruin him; but if this happens to a tradesman, he is immediately andunavoidably blasted and undone; a tradesman has but two sorts of enemiesto encounter with, namely, thieves breaking open his shop, and illneighbours blackening and blasting his reputation; and the latter arethe worst thieves of the two, by a great deal; and, therefore, peopleshould indeed be more chary of their discourse of tradesmen, than ofother men, and that as they would not be guilty of murder. I knew anauthor of a book, who was drawn in unwarily, and without design, topublish a scandalous story of a tradesman in London. He (the author) wasimposed upon by a set of men, who did it maliciously, and he was utterlyignorant of the wicked design; nor did he know the person, but rashlypublished the thing, being himself too fond of a piece of news, which hethought would be grateful to his readers; nor yet did he publish theperson's name, so cautious he was, though that was not enough, as itproved, for the person was presently published by those who hadmaliciously done it.The scandal spread; the tradesman, a flourishing man, and a considerabledealer, was run upon by it with a torrent of malice; a match which hewas about with a considerable fortune was blasted and prevented, andthat indeed was the malicious end of the people that did it; nor did itstop there--it brought his creditors upon him, it ruined him, it broughtout a commission of bankrupt against him, it broke his heart, and killedhim; and after his death, his debts and effects coming in, thereappeared to be seven shillings in the pound estate, clear and good overand above all demands, all his debts discharged, and all the expenses ofthe statute paid.It was to no purpose that the man purged himself of the crime laid tohis charge--that the author, who had ignorantly and rashly published thescandal, declared himself ignorant; the man was run down by a torrent ofreproach; scandal oppressed him; he was buried alive in the noise anddust raised both against his morals and his credit, and yet hischaracter was proved good, and his bottom in trade was so too, as I havesaid above.It is not the least reason of my publishing this to add, that even theperson who was ignorantly made the instrument of publishing the scandal,was not able to retrieve it, or to prevent the man's ruin by all thepublic reparation he could make in print, and by all the acknowledgementhe could make of his having been ignorantly drawn in to do it. And thisI mention for the honest tradesman's caution, and to put him in mind,that when he has unwarily let slip anything to the wounding thereputation of his neighbour tradesman, whether in his trading credit, orthe credit of his morals, it may not be in his power to unsay it again,that is, so as to prevent the ruin of the person; and though it maygrieve him as long as he lives, as the like did the author I mention,yet it is not in his power to recall it, or to heal the wound he hasgiven; and that he should consider very well of beforehand.A tradesman's credit and a virgin's virtue ought to be equally sacredfrom the tongues of men; and it is a very unhappy truth, that as timesnow go, they are neither of them regarded among us as they ought to be.The tea-table among the ladies, and the coffee-house among the men, seemto be places of new invention for a depravation of our manners andmorals, places devoted to scandal, and where the characters of allkinds of persons and professions are handled in the most mercilessmanner, where reproach triumphs, and we seem to give ourselves a looseto fall upon one another in the most unchristian and unfriendly mannerin the world.It seems a little hard that the reputation of a young lady, or of anew-married couple, or of people in the most critical season ofestablishing the characters of their persons and families, should lie atthe mercy of the tea-table; nor is it less hard, that the credit of atradesman, which is the same thing in its nature as the virtue of alady, should be tossed about, shuttle-cock-like, from one table toanother, in the coffee-house, till they shall talk all his creditorsabout his ears, and bring him to the very misfortune which they reportedhim to be near, when at the same time he owed them nothing who raisedthe clamour, and owed nothing to all the world, but what he was able topay.And yet how many tradesmen have been thus undone, and how many more havebeen put to the full trial of their strength in trade, and have stood bythe mere force of their good circumstances; whereas, had they beenunfurnished with cash to have answered their whole debts, they must havefallen with the rest.We need go no farther than Lombard Street for an exemplification of thistruth. There was a time when Lombard Street was the only bank, and thegoldsmiths there were all called bankers. The credit of their businesswas such, that the like has not been seen in England since, in privatehands: some of those bankers, as I have had from their own mouths, havehad near two millions of paper credit upon them at a time; that is tosay, have had bills under their hands running abroad for so much at atime.On a sudden, like a clap of thunder, King Charles II. shut up theExchequer, which was the common centre of the overplus cash these greatbankers had in their hands. What was the consequence? Not only thebankers who had the bulk of their cash there, but all Lombard Street,stood still. The very report of having money in the Exchequer brought arun upon the goldsmiths that had no money there, as well as upon thosethat had, and not only Sir Robert Viner, Alderman Backwell, Farringdon,Forth, and others, broke and failed, but several were ruined who had nota penny of money in the Exchequer, and only sunk by the rumour of it;that rumour bringing a run upon the whole street, and giving a check tothe paper credit that was run up to such an exorbitant height.I remember a shopkeeper who one time took the liberty (foolish liberty!)with himself, in public company in a coffee-house, to say that he wasbroke. 'I assure you,' says he, 'that I am broke, and to-morrow Iresolve to shut up my shop, and call my creditors together.' His meaningwas, that he had a brother just dead in his house, and the next day wasto be buried, when, in civility to the deceased, he kept his shop shut;and several people whom he dealt with, and owed money to, were the nextday invited to the funeral, so that he did actually shut up his shop,and call some of his creditors together.But he sorely repented the jest which he put upon himself. 'Are youbroke?' says one of his friends to him, that was in the coffee-house;'then I wish I had the little money you owe me' (which however, itseems, was not much). Says the other, still carrying on his jest, 'Ishall pay nobody, till, as I told you, I have called my peopletogether.' The other did not reach his jest, which at best was but adull one, but he reached that part of it that concerned himself, andseeing him continue carelessly sitting in the shop, slipped out, and,fetching a couple of sergeants, arrested him. The other was a littlesurprised; but however, the debt being no great sum, he paid it, andwhen he found his mistake, told his friends what he meant by his beingbroke.But it did not end there; for other people of his neighbours, who werethen in the coffee-house, and heard his discourse, and had thoughtnothing more of it, yet in the morning seeing his shop shut, concludedthe thing was so indeed, and immediately it went over the whole streetthat such a one was broke; from thence it went to the Exchange, and fromthence into the country, among all his dealers, who came up in a throngand a fright to look after him. In a word, he had as much to do toprevent his breaking as any man need to desire, and if he had not hadvery good friends as well as a very good bottom, he had inevitably beenruined and undone.So small a rumour will overset a tradesman, if he is not very careful ofhimself; and if a word in jest from himself, which though indeed no manthat had considered things, or thought before he spoke, would have said(and, on the other hand, no man who had been wise and thinking wouldhave taken as it was taken)--I say, if a word taken from the tradesman'sown mouth could be so fatal, and run such a dangerous length, what maynot words spoken slyly, and secretly, and maliciously, be made to do?A tradesman's reputation is of the nicest nature imaginable; like ablight upon a fine flower, if it is but touched, the beauty of it, orthe flavour of it, or the seed of it, is lost, though the noxious breathwhich touched it might not reach to blast the leaf, or hurt the root;the credit of a tradesman, at least in his beginning, is too much at themercy of every enemy he has, till it has taken root, and is establishedon a solid foundation of good conduct and success. It is a sad truth,that every idle tongue can blast a young shopkeeper; and therefore,though I would not discourage any young beginner, yet it is highlybeneficial to alarm them, and to let them know that they must expect astorm of scandal and reproach upon the least slip they make: if they butstumble, fame will throw them down; it is true, if they recover, shewill set them up as fast; but malice generally runs before, and bearsdown all with it; and there are ten tradesmen who fall under the weightof slander and an ill tongue, to one that is lifted up again by thecommon hurry of report.To say I am broke, or in danger of breaking, is to break me: and thoughsometimes the malicious occasion is discovered, and the author detectedand exposed, yet how seldom is it so; and how much oftener are illreports raised to ruin and run down a tradesman, and the credit of ashop; and like an arrow that flies in the dark, it wounds unseen. Theauthors, no nor the occasion of these reports, are never discoveredperhaps, or so much as rightly guessed at; and the poor tradesman feelsthe wound, receives the deadly blow, and is perhaps mortally stabbed inthe vitals of his trade, I mean his trading credit, and never knows whohurt him.I must say, in the tradesman's behalf, that he is in such a case to beesteemed a sacrifice to the worst and most hellish of all secret crimes,I mean envy; which is made up of every hateful vice, a complication ofcrimes which nothing but the worst of God's reasonable world can beguilty of; and he will indeed merit and call for every honest man's pityand concern. But what relief is this to him? for, in the meantime,though the devil himself were the raiser of the scandal, yet it shall goabout; the blow shall take, and every man, though at the same timeexpressing their horror and aversion at the thing, shall yet not beable, no not themselves, to say they receive no impression from it.Though I know the clamour or rumour was raised maliciously, and from asecret envy at the prosperity of the man, yet if I deal with him, itwill in spite of all my abhorrence of the thing, in spite of all mywillingness to do justice, I say it will have some little impressionupon me, it will be some shock to my confidence in the man; and though Iknow the devil is a liar, a slanderer, a calumniator, and that his name_devil_ is derived from it; and that I knew, if that, as I said, werepossible, that the devil in his proper person raised and began, andcarried on, this scandal upon the tradesman, yet there is a secretlurking doubt (about him), which hangs about me concerning him; thedevil is a liar, but he may happen to speak truth just then, he maychance to be right, and I know not what there may be in it, and whetherthere may be any thing or no, but I will have a little care, &c.Thus, insensibly and involuntarily, nay, in spite of friendship, goodwishes, and even resolution to the contrary, it is almost impossible toprevent our being shocked by rumour, and we receive an impressionwhether we will or not, and that from the worst enemy; there is such apowerful sympathy between our thoughts and our interest, that the firstbeing but touched, and that in the lightest manner imaginable, we cannothelp it, caution steps on in behalf of the last, and the man is jealousand afraid, in spite of all the kindest and best intentions in theworld.Nor is it only dangerous in case of false accusations and false charges,for those indeed are to be expected fatal; but even just and true thingsmay be as fatal as false, for the truth is not always necessary to besaid of a tradesman: many things a tradesman may perhaps allow himselfto do, and may be lawfully done, but if they should be known to be partof his character, it would sink deep into his trading fame, his creditwould suffer by it, and in the end it might be his ruin; so that he thatwould not set his hand to his neighbour's ruin, should as carefullyavoid speaking some truths, as raising some forgeries upon him.Of what fatal consequence, then, is the raising rumours and suspicionsupon the credit and characters of young tradesmen! and how little dothose who are forward to raise such suspicions, and spread such rumours,consult conscience, or principle, or honour, in what they do! How littledo they consider that they are committing a trading murder, and that, inrespect to the justice of it, they may with much more equity break openthe tradesman's house, and rob his cash-chest, or his shop; and whatthey can carry away thence will not do him half the injury that robbinghis character of what is due to it from an upright and diligent conduct,would do. The loss of his money or goods is easily made up, and may besometimes repaired with advantage, but the loss of credit is neverrepaired; the one is breaking open his house, but the other is burningit down; the one carries away some goods, but the other shuts goods outfrom coming in; one is hurting the tradesman, but the other is undoinghim.Credit is the tradesman's life; it is, as the wise man says, 'marrow tohis bones;' it is by this that all his affairs go on prosperously andpleasantly; if this be hurt, wounded, or weakened, the tradesman issick, hangs his head, is dejected and discouraged; and if he does go on,it is heavily and with difficulty, as well as with disadvantage; he isbeholding to his fund of cash, not his friends; and he may be truly saidto stand upon his own legs, for nothing else can do it.And therefore, on the other hand, if such a man is any way beholding tohis credit, if he stood before upon the foundation of his credit, if heowes any thing considerable, it is a thousand to one but he sinks underthe oppression of it; that is to say, it brings every body upon him--Imean, every one that has any demand upon him--for in pushing for theirown, especially in such cases, men have so little mercy, and are souniversally persuaded that he that comes first is first served, that Idid not at all wonder, that in the story of the tradesman who sofoolishly exposed himself in the coffee-house, as above, his friend whomhe said the words to, began with him that very night, and before he wentout of the coffee-house; it was rather a wonder to me he did not go outand bring in half-a-dozen more upon him the same evening.It is very rarely that men are wanting to their own interest; and thejealousy of its being but in danger, is enough to make men forget, notfriendship only, and generosity, but good manners, civility, and evenjustice itself, and fall upon the best friends they have in the world,if they think they are in the least danger of suffering by them.On these accounts it is, and many more, that a tradesman walks incontinual jeopardy, from the looseness and inadvertency of men'stongues, ay, and women's too; for though I am all along very tender ofthe ladies, and would do justice to the sex, by telling you, they werenot the dangerous people whom I had in view in my first writing uponthis subject, yet I must be allowed to say, that they are sometimesfully even with the men, for ill usage, when they please to fall uponthem in this nice article, in revenge for any slight, or but pretendedslight, put upon them.It was a terrible revenge a certain lady, who was affronted by atradesman in London, in a matter of love, took upon him in this veryarticle. It seems a tradesman had courted her some time, and it wasbecome public, as a thing in a manner concluded, when the tradesman leftthe lady a little abruptly, without giving a good reason for it, and,indeed, she afterwards discovered, that he had left her for the offer ofanother with a little more money, and that, when he had done so, hereported that it was for another reason, which reflected a little on theperson of the lady; and in this the tradesman did very unworthilyindeed, and deserved her resentment: but, as I said, it was a terriblerevenge she took, and what she ought not to have done.First, she found out who it was that her former pretended lover had beenrecommended to, and she found means to have it insinuated to her by awoman-friend, that he was not only rakish and wicked, but, in short,that he had a particular illness, and went so far as to produce lettersfrom him to a quack-doctor, for directions to him how to take hismedicines, and afterwards a receipt for money for the cure; though boththe letters and receipt also, as afterwards appeared, were forged, inwhich she went a dismal length in her revenge, as you may see.Then she set two or three female instruments to discourse her case inall their gossips' companies, and at the tea-tables wherever they came,and to magnify the lady's prudence in refusing such a man, and what anescape she had had in being clear of him.'Why,' says a lady to one of these emissaries, 'what was the matter? Ithought she was like to be very well married.''Oh no, Madam! by no means,' says the emissary.'Why, Madam,' says another lady, 'we all know Mr H----; he is a verypretty sort of a man.''Ay, Madam,' says the emissary again, 'but you know a pretty man is notall that is required.''Nay,' says the lady again, 'I don't mean so; he is no beauty, no raritythat way; but I mean a clever good sort of a man in his business, suchas we call a pretty tradesman.''Ay,' says the lady employed, 'but that is not all neither.''Why,' says the other lady, 'he has a very good trade too, and lives ingood credit.''Yes,' says malice, 'he has some of the first, but not too much of thelast, I suppose.''No!' says the lady; 'I thought his credit had been very good.''If it had, I suppose,' says the first, 'the match had not been brokeoff.''Why,' says the lady, 'I understood it was broken off on his side.''And so did I,' says another.'And so did I, indeed,' says a third.'Oh, Madam!' says the tool, 'nothing like it, I assure you.''Indeed,' says another, I understood he had quitted Mrs----, because shehad not fortune enough for him, and that he courted another certainlady, whom we all know.'Then the ladies fell to talking of the circumstances of his leaving her,and how he had broken from her abruptly and unmannerly, and had been toofree with her character; at which the first lady, that is to say, theemissary, or tool, as I call her, took it up a little warmly, thus:--1. _Lady_.--Well, you see, ladies, how easily a lady's reputation may beinjured; I hope you will not go away with it so.2. _Lady_.--Nay, we have all of us a respect for Mrs----, and some of usvisit there sometimes; I believe none of us would be willing to injureher.1. _Lady_.--But indeed, ladies, she is very much injured in that story.2. _Lady_.--Indeed, it is generally understood so, and every bodybelieves it.1. _Lady_.--I can assure you it is quite otherwise in fact.2. _Lady_.--I believe he reports it so himself, and that with some veryodd things about the lady too.1. _Lady_.--The more base unworthy fellow he.2. _Lady_.--Especially if he knows it to be otherwise.1. _Lady_.--Especially if he knows the contrary to be true, Madam.2. _Lady_.--Is that possible? Did he not refuse her, then?1. _Lady_.--Nothing like it, Madam; but just the contrary.2. _Lady_.--You surprise me!3. _Lady_.--I am very glad to hear it, for her sake.1. _Lady_.--I can assure you, Madam, she had refused him, and that heknows well enough, which has been one of the reasons that has made himabuse her as he has done.2. _Lady_.--Indeed, she has been used very ill by him, or somebody forhim.1. _Lady_.--Yes, he has reported strange things, but they are all lies.2. _Lady_.--Well; but pray, Madam, what was the reason, if we may be sofree, that she turned him off after she had entertained him so long?1. _Lady_.--Oh, Madam! reason enough; I wonder he should pretend, whenhe knew his own circumstances too, to court a lady of her fortune.2. _Lady_.--Why, are not his circumstances good, then?1. _Lady_.--No, Madam. Good! alas, he has no bottom.2. _Lady_.--No bottom! Why, you surprise me; we always looked upon himto be a man of substance, and that he was very well in the world.1. _Lady_.--It is all a cheat, Madam; there's nothing in it; when itcame to be made out, nothing at all in it.2. _Lady_.--That cannot be, Madam; Mr ---- has lived always in goodreputation and good credit in his business.1. _Lady_.--It is all sunk again then, if it was so; I don't know.2. _Lady_.--Why did she entertain him so long, then?1. _Lady_.--Alas! Madam, how could she know, poor lady, till her friendsinquired into things? But when they came to look a little narrowly intoit, they soon found reason to give her a caution, that he was not theman she took him for.2. _Lady_.--Well, it is very strange; I am sure he passed for anotherman among us.1. _Lady_.--It must be formerly, then, for they tell me his credit hasbeen sunk these three or four years; he had need enough indeed to tryfor a greater fortune, he wants it enough.2. _Lady_.--It is a sad thing when men look out for fortunes to healtheir trade-breaches with, and make the poor wife patch up their oldbankrupt credit.1. _Lady_.--Especially, Madam, when they know themselves to be gone sofar, that even with the addition they can stand but a little while, andmust inevitably bring the lady to destruction with them.2. _Lady_.--Well, I could never have thought Mr ---- was in suchcircumstances.3. _Lady_.--Nor I; we always took him for a ten thousand pound man.1. _Lady_.--They say he was deep in the bubbles, Madam.2. _Lady_.--Nay, if he was gotten into the South Sea, that might hurthim indeed, as it has done many a gentleman of better estates than he.1. _Lady_.--I don't know whether it was the South Sea, or some otherbubbles, but he was very near making a bubble of her, and L3000 into thebargain.2. _Lady_.--I am glad she has escaped him, if it be so; it is a sign herfriends took a great deal of care of her.1. _Lady_.--He won't hold it long; he will have his desert, I hope; Idon't doubt but we shall see him in the Gazette quickly for a bankrupt.2. _Lady_.--If he does not draw in some innocent young thing that hasher fortune in her own hands to patch him up.1. _Lady_.--I hope not, Madam; I hear he is blown where he went since,and there, they say, they have made another discovery of him, in a worsecircumstance than the other.2. _Lady_.--How, pray?1. _Lady_.--Nothing, Madam, but a particular kind of illness, &c. I needsay no more.2. _Lady_.--You astonish me! Why, I always thought him a very civil,honest, sober man.1. _Lady_.--This is a sad world, Madam; men are seldom known now, tillit is too late; but sometimes murder comes out seasonably, and so Iunderstand it is here; for the lady had not gone so far with him, butthat she could go off again.2. _Lady_.--Nay, it was time to go off again, if it were so.1. _Lady_.--Nay, Madam, I do not tell this part of my own knowledge; Ionly heard so, but I am afraid there is too much in it.Thus ended this piece of hellish wildfire, upon the character and creditof a tradesman, the truth of all which was no more than this--that thetradesman, disliking his first lady, left her, and soon after, thoughnot presently, courted another of a superior fortune indeed, though notfor that reason; and the first lady, provoked at being cast off, and, asshe called it, slighted, raised all this clamour upon him, andpersecuted him with it, wherever she was able.Such a discourse as this at a tea-table, it could not be expected wouldbe long a secret; it ran from one tittle-tattle society to another; andin every company, snow-ball like, it was far from lessening, and it wenton, till at length it began to meet with some contradiction, and thetradesman found himself obliged to trace it as far and as well as hecould.But it was to no purpose to confront it; when one was asked, and anotherwas asked, they only answered they heard so, and they heard it incompany in such a place, and in such a place, and some could rememberwhere they had it, and some could not; and the poor tradesman, though hewas really a man of substance, sank under it prodigiously: his newmistress, whom he courted, refused him, and would never hear any thingin his favour, or trouble herself to examine whether it were true orno--it was enough, she said, to her, that he was laden with such areport; and, if it was unjust, she was sorry for it, but the misfortunemust be his, and he must place it to the account of his having made someenemies, which she could not help.As to his credit, the slander of the first lady's raising was spreadindustriously, and with the utmost malice and bitterness, and did him aninexpressible prejudice; every man he dealt with was shy of him; everyman he owed any thing to came for it, and, as he said, he was sure heshould see the last penny demanded; it was his happiness that he hadwherewith to pay, for had his circumstances been in the least perplexed,the man had been undone; nay, as I have observed in another case, as hisaffairs might have lain, he might have been able to have paid fortyshillings in the pound, and yet have been undone, and been obliged tobreak, and shut up his shop.It is true, he worked through it, and he carried it so far as to fix themalice of all the reports pretty much upon the first lady, andparticularly so far as to discover that she was the great reason of hisbeing so positively rejected by the other; but he could never fix it soupon her as to recover any damages of her, only to expose her a little,and that she did not value, having, as she said wickedly, had her fullrevenge of him, and so indeed she had.The sum of the matter is, and it is for this reason I tell you thestory, that the reputation of a tradesman is too much at the mercy ofmen's tongues or women's either; and a story raised upon a tradesman,however malicious, however false, and however frivolous the occasion, isnot easily suppressed, but, if it touches his credit, as a flash of fireit spreads over the whole air like a sheet; there is no stopping it.My inference from all this shall be very brief; if the tongues of everyill-disposed envious gossip, whether man-gossip or woman-gossip, forthere are of both sorts, may be thus mischievous to the tradesman, andhe is so much at the mercy of the tattling slandering part of the world,how much more should tradesmen be cautious and wary how they touch orwound the credit and character of one another. There are but a very fewtradesmen who can say they are out of the reach of slander, and that themalice of enemies cannot hurt them with the tongue. Here and there one,and those ancient and well established, may be able to defy the world;but there are so many others, that I think I may warn all tradesmenagainst making havoc of one another's reputation, as they would betenderly used in the same case.And yet I cannot but say it is too much a tradesman's crime, I mean tospeak slightly and contemptibly of other tradesman, their neighbours, orperhaps rivals in trade, and to run them down in the characters theygive of them, when inquiry may be made of them, as often is the case.The reputation of tradesmen is too often put into the hands of theirfellow-tradesmen, when ignorant people think to inform themselves oftheir circumstances, by going to those whose interest it is to defameand run them down.I know no case in the world in which there is more occasion for thegolden rule, Do as you would be done unto; and though you may beestablished, as you may think, and be above the reach of the tongues ofothers, yet the obligation of the rule is the same, for you are to do asyou would be done unto, supposing that you were in the same condition,or on a level with the person.It is confessed that tradesmen do not study this rule in the particularcase I am now speaking of. No men are apter to speak slightly and coldlyof a fellow-tradesman than his fellow-tradesmen, and to speak unjustlyso too; the reasons for which cannot be good, unless it can be pleadedfor upon the foundation of a just and impartial concern in the interestof the inquirer; and even then nothing must be said but what isconsistent with strict justice and truth: all that is more than that, ismere slander and envy, and has nothing of the Christian in it, much lessof the neighbour or friend. It is true that friendship may be due to theinquirer, but still so much justice is due to the person inquired of,that it is very hard to speak in such cases, and not be guilty ofraising dust, as they call it, upon your neighbour, and at leasthurting, if not injuring him.It is, indeed, so difficult a thing, that I scarce know what stated ruleto lay down for the conduct of a tradesman in this case:--A tradesman ata distance is going to deal with another tradesman, my neighbour; andbefore he comes to bargain, or before he cares to trust him, he goes,weakly enough perhaps, to inquire of him, and of his circumstances,among his neighbours and fellow-tradesmen, perhaps of the sameprofession or employment, and who, among other things, it may be, areconcerned by their interest, that this tradesman's credit should notrise too fast. What must be done in this case?If I am the person inquired of, what must I do? If I would have this mansink in his reputation, or be discredited, and if it is for my interestto have him cried down in the world, it is a sore temptation to me toput in a few words to his disadvantage; and yet, if I do it ingratification of my private views or interest, or upon the foot ofresentment of any kind whatever, and let it be from what occasion itwill, nay, however just and reasonable the resentment is, or may be, itis utterly unjust and unlawful, and is not only unfair as a man, butunchristian, and is neither less nor more than a secret revenge, whichis forbidden by the laws of God and man.If, on the other hand, I give a good character of the man, or of hisreputation, I mean, of his credit in business, in order to have theinquirer trust him, and at the same time know or believe that he is nota sound and good man (that is, as to trade, for it is his character intrade that I am speaking of), what am I doing then? It is plain I lay asnare for the inquirer, and am at least instrumental to his loss,without having really any design to hurt him; for it is to be supposed,before he came to me to inquire, I had no view of acting any thing tohis prejudice.Again, there is no medium, for to refuse or decline giving a characterof the man, is downright giving him the worst character I can--it is, inshort, shooting him through the head in his trade. A man comes to me fora character of my neighbouring tradesman; I answer him with a repulse tohis inquiry thus--_A_.--Good sir, do not ask me the character of my neighbours--I resolveto meddle with nobody's character; pray, do not inquire of me._B_.--Well, but, sir, you know the gentleman; you live next door to him;you can tell me, if you please, all that I desire to know, whether he isa man in credit, and fit to be trusted, or no, in the way of hisbusiness._A_.--I tell you, sir, I meddle with no man's business; I will not givecharacters of my neighbours--it is an ill office--a man gets no thanksfor it, and perhaps deserves none._B_.--But, sir, you would be willing to be informed and advised, if itwere your own case._A_.--It may be so, but I cannot oblige people to inform me._B_.--But you would entreat it as a favour, and so I come to you._A_.--But you may go to any body else._B_.--But you are a man of integrity; I can depend upon what you say; Iknow you will not deceive me; and, therefore, I beg of you to satisfyme._A_.--But I desire you to excuse me, for it is what I never do--I cannotdo it._B_.--But, sir, I am in a great strait; I am just selling him a greatparcel of goods, and I am willing to sell them too, and yet I am willingto be safe, as you would yourself, if you were in my case._A_.--I tell you, sir, I have always resolved to forbear meddling withthe characters of my neighbours--it is an ill office. Besides, I mind myown business; I do not enter into the inquiries after other people'saffairs._B_.--Well, sir, I understand you, then; I know what I have to do._A_.--What do you mean by that?_B_.--Nothing, sir, but what I suppose you would have me understand byit._A_.--I would have you understand what I say--namely, that I willmeddle with nobody's business but my own._B_.--And I say I understand you; I know you are a good man, and a manof charity, and loth to do your neighbours any prejudice, and that youwill speak the best of every man as near as you can._A_.--I tell you, I speak neither the best nor the worst--I speaknothing._B_.--Well, sir, that is to say, that as charity directs you to speakwell of every man, so, when you cannot speak well, you refrain, and willsay nothing; and you do very well, to be sure; you are a very kindneighbour._A_.--But that is a base construction of my words; for I tell you, I dothe like by every body._B_.--Yes, sir, I believe you do, and I think you are in the right ofit--am fully satisfied._A_.--You act more unjustly by me than by my neighbour; for you take mysilence, or declining to give a character, to be giving an illcharacter._B_.--No, sir, not for an ill character._A_.--But I find you take it for a ground of suspicion._B_.--I take it, indeed, for a due caution to me, sir; but the man maybe a good man for all that, only--_A_.--Only what? I understand you--only you won't trust him with yourgoods._B_.--But another man may, sir, for all that, so that you have been kindto your neighbours and to me too, sir--and you are very just. I wish allmen would act so one by another; I should feel the benefit of it myselfamong others, for I have suffered deeply by ill tongues, I am sure._A_.--Well, however unjust you are to me, and to my neighbour too, Iwill not undeceive you at present; I think you do not deserve it.He used a great many more words with him to convince him that he did notmean any discredit to his neighbour tradesman; but it was all one; hewould have it be, that his declining to give his said neighbour a goodcharacter was giving him an ill character, which the other told him wasa wrong inference. However, he found that the man stood by his ownnotion of it, and declined trusting the tradesman with the goods, thoughhe was satisfied he (the tradesman) was a sufficient man.Upon this, he was a little uneasy, imagining that he had been the causeof it, as indeed he had, next to the positive humour of the inquirer,though it was not really his fault; neither was the construction theother made of it just to his intention, for he aimed at freeing himselffrom all inquiries of that nature, but found there was no prevailingwith him to understand it any other way than he did; so, to requite theman a little in his own way, he contrived the following method: he metwith him two or three days after, and asked him if he had sold his goodsto the person his neighbour?'No,' says he; 'you know I would not.''Nay,' says the other, 'I only knew you said so; I did not think youwould have acted so from what I said, nor do I think I gave you anyreason.''Why,' says he, 'I knew you would have given him a good character if youcould, and I knew you were too honest to do it, if you were not sure itwas just.''The last part I hope is true, but you might have believed me honesttoo, in what I did say, that I had resolved to give no characters of anybody.''As to that, I took it, as any body would, to be the best and modestestway of covering what you would not have be disclosed, namely, that youcould not speak as you would; and I also judged that you therefore choseto say nothing.''Well, I can say no more but this; you are not just to me in it, and Ithink you are not just to yourself neither.'They parted again upon this, and the next day the first tradesman, whohad been so pressed to give a character of his neighbour, sent a man tobuy the parcel of goods of the other tradesman, and offering him readymoney, bought them considerably cheaper than the neighbour-tradesman wasto have given for them, besides reckoning a reasonable discount for thetime, which was four months, that the first tradesman was to have givento his neighbour.As soon as he had done, he went and told the neighbour-tradesman what hehad done, and the reason of it, and sold the whole parcel to him again,giving the same four months' credit for them as the first man was tohave given, and taking the discount for time only to himself, gave himall the advantage of the buying, and gave the first man themortification of knowing it all, and that the goods were not only forthe same man, but that the very tradesman, whom he would not believewhen he declined giving a character of any man in general, had trustedhim with them.He pretended to be very angry, and to take it very ill; but the othertold him, that when he came to him for a character of the man, and hetold him honestly, that he would give no characters at all, that it wasnot for any ill to his neighbour that he declined it, he ought to havebelieved him; and that he hoped, when he wanted a character of any ofhis neighbours again, he would not come to him for it.This story is to my purpose in this particular, which is indeed verysignificant; that it is the most difficult thing of its kind in theworld to avoid giving characters of our neighbouring tradesmen; andthat, let your reasons for it be what they will, to refuse giving acharacter is giving a bad character, and is generally so taken, whatevercaution or arguments you use to the contrary.In the next place, it is hard indeed, if an honest neighbour be indanger of selling a large parcel of goods to a fellow, who I may know itis not likely should be able to pay for them, though his credit may inthe common appearance be pretty good at that time; and what must I do?If I discover the man's circumstances, which perhaps I am let into bysome accident, I say, if I discover them, the man is undone; and if I donot, the tradesman, who is in danger of trusting him, is undone.I confess the way is clear, if I am obliged to speak at all in the case:the man unsound is already a bankrupt at bottom, and must fail, but theother man is sound and firm, if this disaster does not befall him: thefirst has no wound given him, but negatively; he stands where he stoodbefore; whereas the other is drawn in perhaps to his own ruin. In thenext place, the first is a knave, or rather thief, for he offers to buy,and knows he cannot pay; in a word, he offers to cheat his neighbour;and if I know it, I am so far confederate with him in the cheat.In this case I think I am obliged to give the honest man a due cautionfor his safety, if he desires my advice; I cannot say I am obligedofficiously to go out of my way to do it, unless I am any way interestedin the person--for that would be to dip into other men's affairs, whichis not my proper work; and if I should any way be misinformed of thecircumstances of the tradesman I am to speak of, and wrong him, I may beinstrumental to bring ruin causelessly upon him.In a word, it is a very nice and critical case, and a tradesman ought tobe very sure of what he says or does in such a case, the good or evilfate of his neighbour lying much at stake, and depending too much on thebreath of his mouth. Every part of this discourse shows how much atradesman's welfare depends upon the justice and courtesy of hisneighbours, and how nice and critical a thing his reputation is.This, well considered, would always keep a tradesman humble, and showhim what need he has to behave courteously and obligingly among hisneighbours; for one malicious word from a man much meaner than himself,may overthrow him in such a manner, as all the friends he has may not beable to recover him; a tradesman, if possible, should never make himselfany enemies.But if it is so fatal a thing to tradesmen to give characters of oneanother, and that a tradesman should be so backward in it for fear ofhurting his neighbour, and that, notwithstanding the character givenshould be just, and the particular reported of him should be true, withhow much greater caution should we act in like cases where what issuggested is really false in fact, and the tradesman is innocent, as wasthe case in the tradesman mentioned before about courting the lady. If atradesman may be ruined and undone by a true report, much more may he beso by a false report, by a malicious, slandering, defaming tongue. Thereis an artful way of talking of other people's reputation, which really,however some people salve the matter, is equal, if not superior, inmalice to the worst thing they can say; this is, by rendering themsuspected, talking doubtfully of their characters, and of their conduct,and rendering them first doubtful, and then strongly suspected. I don'tknow what to say to such a man. A gentleman came to me the other day,but I knew not what to say; I dare not say he is a good man, or that Iwould trust him with five hundred pounds myself; if I should say so, Ishould belie my own opinion. I do not know, indeed, he may be a good manat bottom, but I cannot say he minds his business; if I should, I mustlie; I think he keeps a great deal of company, and the like.Another, he is asked of the currency of his payments, and he answerssuspiciously on that side too; I know not what to say, he may pay themat last, but he does not pay them the most currently of any man in thestreet, and I have heard saucy boys huff him at his door for bills, onhis endeavouring to put them off; indeed, I must needs say I had a billon him a few weeks ago for a hundred pounds, and he paid me verycurrently, and without any dunning, or often calling upon, but it was Ibelieve because I offered him a bargain at that time, and I supposed hewas resolved to put a good face upon his credit.A tradesman, that would do as he would be done by, should carefullyavoid these people who come always about, inquiring after othertradesman's characters. There are men who make it their business to dothus; and as they are thereby as ready to ruin and blow up goodfair-dealing tradesmen as others, so they do actually surprise many, andcome at their characters earlier and nearer than they expect they would.Tradesmen, I say, that will thus behave to one another, cannot besupposed to be men of much principle, but will be apt to lay hold of anyother advantage, how unjust soever, and, indeed, will wait for anoccasion of such advantages; and where is there a tradesman, but who, ifhe be never so circumspect, may some time or other give his neighbour,who watches for his halting, advantage enough against him. When such amalicious tradesman appears in any place, all the honest tradesmen abouthim ought to join to expose him, whether they are afraid of him or no:they should blow him among the neighbourhood, as a public nuisance, as acommon _barrettor_, or raiser of scandal; by such a general aversion tohim they would depreciate him, and bring him into so just a contempt,that no body would keep him company, much less credit any thing he said;and then his tongue would be no slander, and his breath would be noblast, and nobody would either tell him any thing, or hear any thingfrom him: and this kind of usage, I think, is the only way to put a stopto a defamer; for when he has no credit of his own left, he would beunable to hurt any of his neighbour's.CHAPTER XVIOF THE TRADESMAN'S ENTERING INTO PARTNERSHIP IN TRADE, AND THE MANYDANGERS ATTENDING ITThere are some businesses which are more particularly accustomed topartnerships than others, and some that are very seldom managed withouttwo, three, or four partners, and others that cannot be at all carriedon without partnership; and there are those again, in which they seldomjoin partners together.Mercers, linen-drapers, banking goldsmiths, and such considerabletrades, are often, and indeed generally, carried on in partnership; butother meaner trades, and of less business, are carried on, generallyspeaking, single-handed.Some merchants, who carry on great business in foreign ports, have whatthey call houses in those ports, where they plant and breed up theirsons and apprentices; and these are such as I hinted could not carry ontheir business without partnership.The trading in partnership is not only liable to more hazards anddifficulties, but it exposes the tradesman to more snares anddisadvantages by a great deal, than the trading with a single hand does;and some of those snares are these:--1. If the partner is a stirring, diligent, capable man, there is dangerof his slipping into the whole trade, and, getting in between you andhome, by his application, thrusting you at last quite out; so that youbring in a snake into your chimney corner, which, when it is warmed andgrown vigorous, turns about at you, and hisses you out of the house. Itis with the tradesman, in the case of a diligent and active partner, asI have already observed it was in the case of a trusty and diligentapprentice, namely, that if the master does not appear constantly at thehead of the business, and make himself be known by his own applicationand diligence to be what he is, he shall soon look to be what he is not,that is to say, one not concerned in the business.He will never fail to be esteemed the principal person concerned in theshop, and in the trade, who is principally and most constantly foundthere, acting at the head of every business; and be it a servant or apartner, the master or chief loses himself extremely by the advances theother makes of that kind; for, whenever they part again, either theapprentice by being out of his time, or the partner by the expiration ofthe articles of partnership, or by any other determination of theiragreement, the customers most certainly desire to deal with the man whomthey have so often been obliged by; and if they miss him, inquire afterand follow him.It is true, the apprentice is the more dangerous of the two, because hisseparation is supposed to be more certain, and generally sooner than thepartner; the apprentice is not known, and cannot have made his interestamong the buyers, but for perhaps a year, or a year and a half, beforehis time expired: sooner than that he could not put himself in the wayof being known and observed; and then, when his time is out, hecertainly removes, unless he is taken into the shop as a partner, andthat, indeed, prolongs the time, and places the injury at a greaterdistance, but still it makes it the more influencing when it comes; andunless he is brought some how or other into the family, and becomes oneof the house, perhaps by marriage, or some other settled union with themaster, he never goes off without making a great chasm in the master'saffairs, and the more, by how much he has been more diligent and usefulin the trade, the wounds of which the master seldom if ever recovers.If the partner were not an apprentice, but that they either came out oftheir times together, or near it, or had a shop and business before, butquitted it to come in, it may then be said that he brought part of thetrade with him, and so increased the trade when he joined with the otherin proportion to what he may be said to carry away when he went off;this is the best thing that can be said of a partnership; and then Ihave this to add, first, that the tradesman who took the partner in hasa fair field, indeed, to act in with his partner, and must take care, byhis constant attendance, due acquaintance with the customers, andappearing in every part of the business, to maintain not his interestonly, but the appearance of his interest, in the shop or warehouse, thathe may, on every occasion, and to every customer, not only be, but beknown to be, the master and head of the business; and that the other isat best but a partner, and not a chief partner, as, in case of hisabsence and negligence, will presently be suggested; for he that chieflyappears will be always chief partner in the eye of the customers,whatever he is in the substance of the thing.This, indeed, is much the same case with what is said before of adiligent servant, and a negligent master, and therefore I forbear toenlarge upon it; but it is so important in both cases, that indeed itcannot well be mentioned too often: the master's full application, inhis own person, is the only answer to both. He that takes a partner onlyto ease him of the toil of his business, that he may take his pleasure,and leave the drudgery, as they call it, to the partner, should takecare not to do it till about seven years before he resolves to leaveoff trade, that, at the end of the partnership, he may be satisfied togive up the trade to his partner, or see him run away with it, and nottrouble himself about it.But if he takes a partner at his beginning, with an intent, by theirjoint enlarged stock, to enlarge their business, and so carry on acapital trade, which perhaps neither of them were able to do bythemselves, and which is the only justifiable reason for taking apartner at all, he must resolve then to join with his partner, not onlyin stock, but in mutual diligence and application, that the trade mayflourish by their joint assistance and constant labour, as two oxenyoked together in the same draught, by their joint assistance, draw muchmore than double what they could either of them draw by their singlestrength; and this, indeed, is the only safe circumstance of apartnership: then, indeed, they are properly partners when they areassistants to one another, whereas otherwise they are like two gamestersstriving to worm one another out, and to get the mastery in the playthey are engaged in.The very word _partner_ imports the substance of the thing, and theyare, as such, engaged to a mutual application, or they are no morepartners, but rather one is the trading gentleman, and the other is thetrading drudge; but even then, let them depend, the drudge will carryaway the trade, and the profit too, at last. And this is the way how onepartner may honestly ruin another, and for ought I know it is the onlyone: for it cannot be said but that the diligent partner acts honestlyin acting diligently, and if the other did the same, they would boththrive alike; but if one is negligent and the other diligent, oneextravagant and expensive, the other frugal and prudent, it cannot besaid to be his fault that one is rich and the other poor--that oneincreases in the stock, and the other is lessened, and at last workedquite out of it.As a partner, then, is taken in only for ease, to abate the firsttradesman's diligence, and take off the edge of his application, so fara partner, let him be as honest and diligent as he will, is dangerous tothe tradesman--nay, the more honest and the more diligent he is, themore dangerous he is, and the more a snare to the tradesman that takeshim in; and a tradesman ought to be very cautious in the adventure, for,indeed, it is an adventure--that he be not brought in time to relax hisdiligence, by having a partner, even contrary to his first intention;for laziness is a subtle insinuating thing, and it is a sore temptationto a man of ease and indolence to see his work done for him, and lessneed of him in the business than used to be, and yet the business to goon well too; and this danger is dormant, and lies unseen, till afterseveral years it rises, as it were, out of its ambuscade, and surprisesthe tradesman, letting him see by his loss what his neglect has costhim.2. But there are other dangers in partnership, and those not a few; foryou may not only be remiss and negligent, remitting the weight of thebusiness upon him, and depending upon him for its being carried on, bywhich he makes himself master, and brings you to be forgot in thebusiness; but he may be crafty too, and designing in all this, and whenhe has thus brought you to be as it were _nobody_, he shall make himselfbe all _somebody_ in the trade, and in that particular he by degreesgets the capital interest, as well as stock in the trade, while the trueoriginal of the shop, who laid the foundation of the whole business,brought a trade to the shop, or brought commissions to the house, andwhose the business more particularly is, is secretly supplanted, andwith the concurrence of his own negligence--for without that it cannotbe--is, as it were, laid aside, and at last quite thrust out.Thus, whether honest or dishonest, the tradesman is circumvented, andthe partnership is made fatal to him; for it was all owing to thepartnership the tradesman was diligent before, understood his business,and kept close to it, gave up his time to it, and by employing himself,prevented the indolence which he finds breaking insensibly upon himafterwards, by being made easy, as they call it, in the assistance of apartner.3. But there are abundance of other cases which make a partnershipdangerous; for if it be so where the partner is honest and diligent, andwhere he works into the heart of the business by his industry andapplication, or by his craft and insinuation, what may it not be if heproves idle and extravagant; and if, instead of working him out, he maybe said to play him out of the business, that is to say, prove wild,expensive, and run himself and his partner out by his extravagance?There are but too many examples of this kind; and here the honesttradesman has the labouring oar indeed; for instead of being assisted bya diligent industrious partner, whom on that account he took into thetrade, he proves a loose, extravagant, wild fellow, runs abroad intocompany, and leaves him (for whose relief he was taken in) to bear theburden of the whole trade, which, perhaps, was too heavy for him before,and if it had not been so, he had not been prevailed with to have takenin a partner at all.This is, indeed, a terrible disappointment, and is very discouraging,and the more so, because it cannot be recalled; for a partnership islike matrimony, it is almost engaged in for better or for worse, tillthe years expire; there is no breaking it off, at least, not easily norfairly, but all the inconveniences which are to be feared will followand stare in your face: as, first, the partner in the first place drawsout all his stock; and this sometimes is a blow fatal enough, forperhaps the partner cannot take the whole trade upon himself, and cannotcarry on the trade upon his own stock: if he could, he would not havetaken in a partner at all. This withdrawing the stock has sometimes beenvery dangerous to a partner; nay, has many times been the overthrow andundoing of him and of the family that is left.He that takes a partner into his trade on this account--namely, for thesupport of his stock, to enjoy the assistance of so much cash to carryon the trade, ought seriously to consider what he shall be able to dowhen the partner, breaking off the partnership, shall carry all hisstock, and the improvement of it too, with him: perhaps the tradesman'sstock is not much increased, perhaps not at all; nay, perhaps the stockis lessened, instead of being increased, and they have rather gonebackward than forward. What shall the tradesman do in such a case? Andhow shall he bear the breach in his stock which that separation wouldmake?Thus he is either tied down to the partner, or the partner is pinneddown to him, for he cannot separate without a breach. It is a sad truthto many a partner, that when the partnership comes to be finished andexpired, the man would let his partner go, but the other cannot gowithout tearing him all to pieces whom he leaves behind him; and yet thepartner being loose, idle, and extravagant, in a word, will ruin both ifhe stays.This is the danger of partnership in some of the best circumstances ofit; but how hazardous and how fatal is it in other cases! And how manyan honest and industrious tradesman has been prevailed with to take in apartner to ease himself in the weight of the business, or on severalother accounts, some perhaps reasonable and prudent enough, but hasfound himself immediately involved in a sea of trouble, is brought intoinnumerable difficulties, concealed debts, and unknown incumbrances,such as he could no ways extricate himself out of, and so both have beenunavoidably ruined together!These cases are so various and so uncertain, that it is not easy toenumerate them: but we may include the particulars in a general or two.1. One partner may contract debts, even in the partnership itself, sofar unknown to the other, as that the other may be involved in thedanger of them, though he was not at all concerned in, or acquaintedwith, them at the same time they were contracted.2. One partner may discharge debts for both partners; and so, having adesign to be knavish, may go and receive money, and give receipts forit, and not bringing it to account, or not bringing the money into cash,may wrong the stock to so considerable a sum as may be to the ruin ofthe other partner.3. One partner may confess judgment, or give bonds, or current notes inthe name, and as for the account of the company, and yet convert theeffects to his own private use, leaving the stock to be answerable forthe value.4. One partner may sell and give credit, and deliver parcels of goods towhat sum, or what quantity, he thinks fit, and to whom, and so, by hisindiscretion, or perhaps by connivance and knavery, lose to the stockwhat parcel of goods he pleases, to the ruin of the other partner, andbring themselves to be both bankrupt together.5. Nay, to sum up all, one partner may commit acts of bankruptcy withoutthe knowledge of the other, and thereby subject the united stock, andboth or all the partners, to the danger of a commission, when they maythemselves know nothing of it till the blow is given, and given so as tobe too late to be retrieved.All these, and many more, being the ill consequences and dangers ofpartnership in trade, I cannot but seriously warn the honest industrioustradesman, if possible, to stand upon his own legs, and go on upon hisown bottom; to pursue his business diligently, but cautiously, and whatwe call fair and softly; not eagerly pushing to drive a vast trade, andenjoy but half of it, rather carry on a middling business, and let it behis own.There may be cases, indeed, which may have their exceptions to thisgeneral head of advice; partnerships may sometimes prove successful, andin some particular business they are more necessary than in others, andin some they tell us that they are absolutely necessary, though the lastI can by no means grant; but be that as it will, there are so many casesmore in number, and of great consequence too, which miscarry by theseveral perplexed circumstances, differing tempers, and open knavery ofpartners, that I cannot but give it as a friendly advice to alltradesmen--if possible, to avoid partnerships of all kinds.But if the circumstances of trade require partnerships, and the riskmust be run, I would recommend to the tradesman not to enter intopartnerships, but under the following circumstances:--1. Not to take in any partner who should be allowed to carry on anyseparate business, in which the partnership is not concerned. Dependupon it, whatever other business your partner carries on, you run therisk of it as much as you do of your own; and you run the risk with thisparticular circumstance too, that you have the hazard without the profitor success: that is, without a share in the profit or success, which isvery unequal and unfair. I know cunning men will tell you, that theremay be provision made so effectually in the articles of partnership,that the stock in partnership should be concerned in no other interestor engagements but its own; but let such cunning gentlemen tell me, ifthe partner meets with a disappointment in his other undertakings, whichwounds him so deep as to break him, will it not affect the partnershipthus far? 1. That it may cause his stock to be drawn hastily out, andperhaps violently too. 2. That it touches and taints the credit of thepartner to be concerned with such a man; and though a man's bottom maysupport him, if it be very good, yet it is a blow to him, touches hiscredit, and makes the world stand a little at a stay about him, if it beno more, for a while, till they see that he shows himself upon theExchange, or at his shop-door again, in spite of all the apprehensionsand doubts that have been handed about concerning him. Either of theseare so essential to the tradesman, whose partner thus sinks by his ownprivate breaches, in which the parnership is not concerned, that it isworth while to caution the tradesman against venturing. And I must add,too, that many a tradesman has fallen under the disaster by thepartner's affairs thus affecting him, though the immediate losses whichthe partner had suffered have not been charged upon him; and yet Ibelieve it is not so easy to avoid being fallen upon for those debtsalso.It is certain, as I formerly noted, rumour will break a tradesman almostat any time. It matters not, at first, whether the rumour be true orfalse. What rumour can sit closer to a man in business--his own personalmisfortunes excepted--than such as this-_that his partner is broke?_That his partner has met with a loss, suppose an insurance, suppose afall of stocks, suppose a bubble or a cheat, or we know not what, thepartner is sunk, no man knows whether the partnership be concerned in itor no; and while it is not known, every man will suppose it, for mankindalways think the worst of every thing.What can be a closer stroke at the poor tradesman? He knows not what hispartner has done; he has reason to fear the worst; he even knows nothimself, for a while, whether he can steer clear of the rocks or no; butsoon recovers, knows his own circumstances, and struggles hard with theworld, pays out his partner's stock, and gets happily over it. And it iswell he does so, for that he is at the brink of ruin must be granted;and where one stands and keeps up his reputation and his business, thereare twenty would be undone in the same circumstance.Who, then, would run the venture of a partner, if it were possible toavoid it? And who, if they must have a partner, would have one that wasconcerned in separate business, in which the partnership was notengaged?2. If you must have a partner, always choose to have the partner ratherunder than over you; by this I mean, take him in for a fifth, a fourth,or at most a third, never for a half. There are many reasons to be givenfor this, besides that of having the greater share of profits, for thatI do not give as a reason here at all; but the principal reasons arethese:--First, in case of any disaster in any of the particular supposedaccidents which I have mentioned, and that you should be obliged to payout your partner's stock, it will not be so heavy, or be so much a blowto you: and, secondly, you preserve to yourself the governing influencein your own business; you cannot be overruled, overawed, or dogmaticallytold, it shall, or shall not, be thus, or thus. He that takes in apartner for a third, has a partner servant; he that takes him in for ahalf, has a partner master--that is to say, a director, or preceptor:let your partner have always a lesser interest in the business thanyourself, and be rather less acquainted with the business than yourself,at least not better. You should rather have a partner to be instructed,than a partner to instruct you; for he that teaches you, will alwaystaunt you.3. If you must have a partner, let him always be your junior, ratherthan your senior; by this I mean, your junior in business, whether he isso in years or not. There are many reasons why the tradesman shouldchoose this, and particularly the same as the other of taking him in fora junior or inferior part of the trade--that is to say, to maintain thesuperiority of the business in his own hands; and this I mention, not atall upon account of the pride or vanity of the superiority, for that isa trifle compared to the rest; but that he may have the more authorityto inspect the conduct of his partner, in which he is so much and soessentially concerned; and to inquire whether he is doing any thing, ortaking any measures, dangerous or prejudicial to the stock, or to thecredit of the partnership, that so if he finds any thing, he mayrestrain him, and prevent in time the mischief which would otherwise beinevitable to them both.There are many other advantages to a tradesman who is obliged to take apartner, by keeping in his own hands the major part of the trade, whichare too long to repeat here; such as his being always able to put acheck to any rash adventure, any launching out into bubbles andprojects, and things dangerous to the business: and this is a veryneedful thing in a partnership, that one partner should be able tocorrect the rash resolves of another in hazardous cases.By this correcting of rash measures, I mean over-ruling them withmoderation and temper, for the good of the whole, and for their mutualadvantage. The Romans frequently had two generals, or consuls, tocommand their armies in the field: one of which was to be a young man,that by his vigour and sprightly forwardness he might keep up thespirits and courage of the soldiers, encourage them to fight, and leadthem on by his example; the other an old soldier, that by his experiencein the military affairs, age, and counsels, he might a little abate thefire of his colleague, and might not only know how to fight, but knowwhen to fight, that is to say, when to avoid fighting; and the want ofthis lost them many a victory, and the great battle of Cannae inparticular, in which 80,000 Romans were killed in one day.To compare small things with great, I may say it is just so in theaffair of trade. You should always join a sober grave head, weighed tobusiness, and acquainted with trade, to the young trader, who havingbeen young in the work will the easier give up his judgment to theother, and who is governed with the solid experience of the other; andso you join their ways together, the rash and the sedate, the grave andthe giddy.Again, if you must go into partnership, be sure, if possible, you takenobody into partnership but such as whose circumstances in trade you arefully acquainted with. Such there are frequently to be had amongrelations and neighbours, and such, if possible, should be the man thatis taken into partnership, that the hazard of unsound circumstances maybe avoided. A man may else be taken into partnership who may be reallybankrupt even before you take him; and such things have been done, tothe ruin of many an honest tradesman.If possible, let your partner be a beginner, that his stock may bereasonably supposed to be free and unentangled; and let him be one thatyou know personally, and his circumstances, and did know even before youhad any thoughts of engaging together.All these cautions are with a supposition that the partner must be had;but I must still give it as my opinion, in the case of such tradesmen asI have all along directed myself to, that if possible they should go onsingle-handed in trade; and I close it with this brief note, respectingthe qualifications of a partner, as above, that, next to no partner,such a partner is best.CHAPTER XVIIOF HONESTY IN DEALING, AND LYINGThere is some difference between an honest man and an honest tradesman;and though the distinction is very nice, yet, I must say, it is to besupported. Trade cannot make a knave of an honest man, for there is aspecific difference between honesty and knavery which can never bealtered by trade or any other thing; nor can that integrity of mindwhich describes and is peculiar to a man of honesty be ever abated to atradesman; the rectitude of his soul must be the same, and he must notonly intend or mean honestly and justly, but he must do so; he must acthonestly and justly, and that in all his dealings; he must neither cheatnor defraud, over-reach nor circumvent his neighbour, nor indeed anybodyhe deals with; nor must he design to do so, or lay any plots or snaresto that purpose in his dealing, as is frequent in the general conduct oftoo many, who yet call themselves honest tradesmen, and would take itvery ill to have any one tax their integrity.But after all this is premised, there are some latitudes, like poeticallicences in other cases, which a tradesman is and must be allowed, andwhich by the custom and usage of trade he may give himself a liberty in,which cannot be allowed in other cases to any man, no, nor to thetradesman himself out of his business--I say, he may take someliberties, but within bounds; and whatever some pretenders to strictliving may say, yet that tradesman shall pass with me for a very honestman, notwithstanding the liberty which he gives himself of this kind, ifhe does not take those liberties in an exorbitant manner; and thoseliberties are such as these.1. The liberty of asking more than he will take. I know some people havecondemned this practice as dishonest, and the Quakers for a time stoodto their point in the contrary practice, resolving to ask no more thanthey would take, upon any occasion whatsoever, and choosing rather tolose the selling of their goods, though they could afford sometimes totake what was offered, rather than abate a farthing of the price theyhad asked; but time and the necessities of trade made them wiser, andbrought them off of that severity, and they by degrees came to ask, andabate, and abate again, just as other business tradesmen do, though notperhaps as some do, who give themselves a fuller liberty that way.Indeed, it is the buyers that make this custom necessary; for they,especially those who buy for immediate use, will first pretendpositively to tie themselves up to a limited price, and bid them alittle and a little more, till they come so near the sellers' price,that they, the sellers, cannot find in their hearts to refuse it, andthen they are tempted to take it, notwithstanding their first words tothe contrary. It is common, indeed, for the tradesman to say, 'I cannotabate anything,' when yet they do and can afford it; but the tradesmanshould indeed not be understood strictly and literally to his words, butas he means it, namely, that he cannot reasonably abate, and that hecannot afford to abate: and there he may be in earnest, namely, that hecannot make a reasonable profit of his goods, if he is obliged to abate,and so the meaning is honest, that he cannot abate; and yet rather thannot take your money, he may at last resolve to do it, in hopes ofgetting a better price for the remainder, or being willing to abate hisordinary gain, rather than disoblige the customer; or being perhapsafraid he should not sell off the quantity; and many such reasons may begiven why he submits to sell at a lower price than he really intended,or can afford to do; and yet he cannot be said to be dishonest, or tolie, in saying at first he cannot, or could not, abate.A man in trade is properly to be said not to be able to do what hecannot do to his profit and advantage. The English cannot trade toHungary, and into Slavonia--that is to say, they cannot do it toadvantage; but it is better for them to trade to Venice with theirgoods, and let the Venetians carry on a trade into Hungary throughDalmatia, Croatia, &c, and the like in other places.To bring it down to particular cases: one certain merchant cannot dealin one sort of goods which another merchant is eminent for; the othermerchant is as free to the trade as he, but he cannot do it to profit;for he is unacquainted with the trade, and it is out of his way, andtherefore he cannot do it.Thus, to the case in hand. The tradesman says he cannot sell his goodsunder such a price, which in the sense of his business is true; that isto say, he cannot do it to carry on his trade with the usual andreasonable advantage which he ought to expect, and which others make inthe same way of business.Or, he cannot, without underselling the market, and undervaluing thegoods, and seeming to undersell his neighbour-shopkeepers, to whom thereis a justice due in trade, which respects the price of sale; and toundersell is looked upon as an unfair kind of trading.All these, and many more, are the reasons why a tradesman may be saidnot to lie, though he should say he _cannot_ abate, or _cannot_ sell hisgoods under such a price, and yet may after think fit to sell you hisgoods something lower than he so intended, or can afford to do, ratherthan lose your custom, or rather than lose the selling of his goods, andtaking your ready money, which at that time he may have occasion for.In these cases, I cannot say a shopkeeper should be tied down to theliteral meaning of his words in the price he asks, or that he is guiltyof lying in not adhering stiffly to the letter of his first demand;though, at the same time, I would have every tradesman take as littleliberty that way as may be: and if the buyer would expect the tradesmanshould keep strictly to his demand, he should not stand and haggle, andscrew the shopkeeper down, bidding from one penny to another, to atrifle within his price, so, as it were, to push him to the extremity,either to turn away his customer for a sixpence, or some such trifle, orto break his word: as if he would say, I will force you to speakfalsely, or turn me away for a trifle.In such cases, if, indeed, there is a breach, the sin is the buyer's: atleast, he puts himself in the devil's stead, and makes himself bothtempter and accuser; nor can I say that the seller is in that case somuch to blame as the buyer. However, it were to be wished that on bothsides buying and selling might be carried on without it; for the buyeras often says, 'I won't give a farthing more,' and yet advances, as theseller says, 'I can't abate a farthing,' and yet complies. These are, asI call them, _trading lies_; and it were to be wished they could beavoided on both sides; and the honest tradesman does avoid them as muchas possible, but yet must not, I say, in all cases, be tied up to thestrict, literal sense of that expression, _I cannot abate_, asabove.[26]2. Another trading licence is that of appointing, and promising paymentsof money, which men in business are oftentimes forced to make, andforced to break, without any scrupple; nay, and without any reproachupon their integrity. Let us state this case as clearly as we can, andsee how it stands as to the morality of it, for that is the point indebate.The credit usually given by one tradesman to another, as particularly bythe merchant to the wholesale-man, and by the wholesale-man to theretailer, is such, that, without tying the buyer up to a particular dayof payment, they go on buying and selling, and the buyer pays money uponaccount, as his convenience admits, and as the seller is content to takeit. This occasions the merchant, or the wholesale-man, to go about, asthey call it, _a-dunning_ among their dealers, and which is generallythe work of every Saturday. When the merchant comes to his customer thewholesale-man, or warehouse-keeper, for money, he tells him, 'I have nomoney, Sir; I cannot pay you now; if you call next week, I will payyou.' Next week comes, and the merchant calls again; but it is the samething, only the warehouseman adds, 'Well, I will pay you next week,_without fail.'_ When the week comes, he tells him he has met with greatdisappointments, and he knows not what to do, but desires his patienceanother week: and when the other week comes, perhaps he pays him, and sothey go on.Now, what is to be said for this? In the first place, let us look backto the occasion. This warehouse-keeper, or wholesale-man, sells thegoods which he buys of the merchant--I say, he sells them to theretailers, and it is for that reason I place it first there. Now, asthey buy in smaller quantities than he did of the merchant, so he dealswith more of them in number, and he goes about among them the sameSaturday, to get in money that he may pay his merchant, and he receiveshis bag full of promises, too, every where instead of money, and is putoff from week to week, perhaps by fifty shopkeepers in a day; and theirserving him thus obliges him to do the same to the merchant.Again, come to the merchant. Except some, whose circumstances are aboveit, they are by this very usage obliged to put off the Blackwell-hallfactor, or the packer, or the clothier, or whoever they deal with, inproportion; and thus promises go round for payment, and those promisesare kept or broken as money comes in, or as disappointments happen; andall this while there is no breach of honesty, or parole; no lying, orsupposition of it, among the tradesmen, either on one side or other.But let us come, I say, to the morality of it. To break a solemn promiseis a kind of prevarication; that is certain, there is no coming off ofit; and I might enlarge here upon the first fault, namely, of making thepromise, which, say the strict objectors, they should not do. But thetradesman's answer is this: all those promises ought to be taken as theyare made--namely, with a contingent dependence upon the circumstances oftrade, such as promises made them by others who owe them money, or thesupposition of a week's trade bringing in money by retail, as usual,both of which are liable to fail, or at least to fall short; and thisthe person who calls for the money knows, and takes the promise withthose attending casualties; which if they fail, he knows the shopkeeper,or whoever he is, must fail him too.The case is plain, if the man had the money in cash, he need not make apromise or appointment for a farther day; for that promise is no more orless than a capitulation for a favour, a desire or condition of a week'sforbearance, on his assurance, that if possible he will not fail to payhim at the time. It is objected, that the words _if possible_ shouldthen be mentioned, which would solve the morality of the case: to thisI must answer, that I own I think it needless, unless the man to whomthe promise was made could be supposed to believe the promise was to beperformed, whether it were possible or no; which no reasonable man canbe supposed to do.There is a parallel case to this in the ordinary appointment of peopleto meet either at place or time, upon occasions of business. Two friendsmake an appointment to meet the next day at such a house, suppose atavern at or near the Exchange: one says to the other, 'Do not fail meat that time, for I will certainly be there;' the other answers, 'I willnot fail.' Some people, who think themselves more religious than others,or at least would be thought so, object against these positiveappointments, and tell us we ought to say, 'I will, if it pleases God.'or I will, life and health permitting;[27] and they quote the text forit, where our Saviour expressly commands to use such a caution, andwhich I shall say nothing to lessen the force of.But to say a word to our present custom. Since Christianity is thepublic profession of the country, and we are to suppose we not only areChristians ourselves, but that all those we are talking to, or of, arealso Christians, we must add that Christianity supposes we acknowledgethat life, and all the contingencies of life, are subjected to thedominion of Providence, and liable to all those accidents which Godpermits to befall us in the ordinary course of our living in the world,therefore we expect to be taken in that sense in all such appointments;and it is but justice to us as Christians, in the common acceptation ofour words, that when I say, _I will certainly_ meet my friend at such aplace, and at such a time, he should understand me to mean, if itpleases God to give me life and health, or that his Providence permitsme to come, or, as the text says, 'If the Lord will;' for we all knowthat unless the Lord will, I cannot meet, or so much as live.Not to understand me thus, is as much as to say, you do not understandme to be a Christian, or to act like a Christian in any thing; and onthe other hand, they that understand it otherwise, I ought not tounderstand them to be Christians. Nor should I be supposed to put anyneglect or dishonour upon the government of Providence in the world, orto suggest that I did not think myself subjected to it, because Iomitted the words in my appointment.In like manner, when a man comes to me for money, I put him off: that,in the first place, supposes I have not the money by me, or cannot spareit to pay him at that time; if it were otherwise, it may be supposed Iwould pay him just then. He is then perhaps impatient, and asks me whenI will pay him, and I tell him at such a time. This naturally supposes,that by that time I expect to be supplied, so as to be able to pay; Ihave current bills, or promises of money, to be paid me, or I expect theordinary takings in my shop or warehouse will supply me to make good mypromise: thus my promise is honest in its foundation, because I havereason to expect money to come in to make me in a condition to performit; but so it falls out, contrary to my expectation, and contrary to thereason of things, I am disappointed, and cannot do it; I am then,indeed, a trespasser upon my creditor, whom I ought to have paid, and Iam under affliction enough on that account, and I suffer in myreputation for it also; but I cannot be said to be a liar, an immoralman, a man that has no regard to my promise, and the like; for at thesame time I have perhaps used my utmost endeavour to do it, but amprevented by many several men breaking promise with me, and I am no wayable to help myself.It is objected to this, that then I should not make my promisesabsolute, but conditional. To this I say, that the promises, as is aboveobserved, are really not absolute, but conditional in the very nature ofthem, and are understood so when they are made, or else they that hearthem do not understand them, as all human appointments ought to beunderstood; I do confess, it would be better not to make an absolutepromise at all, but to express the condition or reserve with thepromise, and say, 'I will if I can,' or, 'I will if people are just tome, and perform their promises to me.'But to this I answer, the importunity of the person who demands thepayment will not permit it--nothing short of a positive promise willsatisfy--they never believe the person intends to perform if he makesthe least reserve or condition in his promise, though, at the same time,they know that even the nature of the promise and the reason of thepromise strongly implies the condition--I say, the importunity of thecreditor occasions the breach, which he reproaches the debtor with theimmorality of.[28]Custom, indeed, has driven us beyond the limits of our morals in manythings, which trade makes necessary, and which we cannot now avoid; sothat if we must pretend to go back to the literal sense of the command;if our yea must be yea, and our nay nay; if no man must go beyond, ordefraud his neighbour; if our conversation must be without covetousness,and the like--why, then, it is impossible for tradesmen to beChristians, and we must unhinge all business, act upon new principles intrade, and go on by new rules--in short, we must shut up shop, and leaveoff trade, and so in many things we must leave off living; for asconversation is called life, we must leave off to converse: all theordinary communication of life is now full of lying; and what withtable-lies, salutation-lies, and trading-lies, there is no such thing asevery man speaking truth with his neighbour.But this is a subject would launch me out beyond the bounds of achapter, and make a book by itself. I return to the case particularly inhand--promises of payment of money. Men in trade, I say, are under thisunhappy necessity, they are forced to make them, and they are forced tobreak them; the violent pressing and dunning, and perhaps threateningtoo, of the creditor, when the poor shopkeeper cannot comply with hisdemand, forces him to promise; in short, the importunate creditor willnot be otherwise put off, and the poor shopkeeper, almost worried, andperhaps a little terrified too, and afraid of him, is glad to do and sayany thing to pacify him, and this extorts a promise, which, when thetime comes, he is no more able to perform than he was before, and thismultiplies promises, and consequently breaches, so much of which are tobe placed to the accounts of force, that I must acknowledge, though thedebtor is to blame, the creditor is too far concerned in the crime of itto be excused, and it were to be wished some other method could be foundout to prevent the evil, and that tradesmen would resolve with morecourage to resist the importunities of the creditor, be the consequencewhat it would, rather than break in upon their morals, and load theirconsciences with the reproaches of it for all their lives after.I remember I knew a tradesman, who, labouring long under the ordinarydifficulties of men embarrassed in trade, and past the possibility ofgetting out, and being at last obliged to stop and call his peopletogether, told me, that after he was broke, though it was a terriblething to him at first too, as it is to most tradesmen, yet he thoughthimself in a new world, when he was at a full stop, and had no more theterror upon him of bills coming for payment, and creditors knocking athis door to dun him, and he without money to pay. He was no more obligedto stand in his shop, and be bullied and ruffled by his creditors, nay,by their apprentices and boys, and sometimes by porters and footmen, towhom he was forced to give good words, and sometimes strain hispatience to the utmost limits: he was now no more obliged to makepromises, which he knew he could not perform, and break promises as fastas he made them, and so lie continually both to God and man; and, headded, the ease of his mind which he felt upon that occasion was sogreat, that it balanced all the grief he was in at the general disasterof his affairs; and, farther, that even in the lowest of hiscircumstances which followed, he would not go back to live as he haddone, in the exquisite torture of want of money to pay his bills and hisduns.Nor was it any satisfaction to him to say, that it was owing to the likebreach of promise in the shopkeepers, and gentlemen, and people whom hedealt with, who owed him money, and who made no conscience of promisingand disappointing him, and thereby drove him to the necessity ofbreaking his own promises; for this did not satisfy his mind in thebreaches of his word, though they really drove him to the necessity ofit: but that which lay heaviest upon him was the violence and clamour ofcreditors, who would not be satisfied without such promises, even whenhe knew, or at least believed, he should not be able to perform.Nay, such was the importunity of one of his merchants, that when he camefor money, and he was obliged to put him off, and to set him anotherday, the merchant would not be satisfied, unless he would swear that hewould pay him on that day without fail. 'And what said you to him?' saidI. 'Say to him!' said he, 'I looked him full in the face, and sat medown without speaking a word, being filled with rage and indignation athim; but after a little while he insisted again, and asked me whatanswer I would make him, at which I smiled, and asked him, if he were inearnest? He grew angry then, and asked me if I laughed at him, and if Ithought to laugh him out of his money? I then asked him, if he reallydid expect I should swear that I would pay him the next week, as Iproposed to promise? He told me, yes, he did, and I should swear it, orpay him before he went out of my warehouse.I wondered, indeed, at the discourse, and at the folly of the merchant,who, I understood afterwards, was a foreigner; and though I thought hehad been in jest at first, when he assured me he was not, I was curiousto hear the issue, which at first he was loth to go on with, because heknew it would bring about all the rest; but I pressed him to know--so hetold me that the merchant carried it to such a height as put him into afurious passion, and, knowing he must break some time or other, he wasresolved to put an end to his being insulted in that manner; so at lasthe rose up in a rage, told the merchant, that as no honest man couldtake such an oath, unless he had the money by him to pay it, so nohonest man could ask such a thing of him; and that, since he must havean answer, his answer was, he would not swear such an oath for him, norany man living, and if he would not be satisfied without it, he might dohis worst--and so turned from him; and knowing the man was aconsiderable creditor, and might do him a mischief, he resolved to shutup that very night, and did so, carrying all his valuable goods with himinto the Mint, and the next day he heard that his angry creditor waylaidhim the same afternoon to arrest him, but he was too quick for him; and,as he said, though it almost broke his heart to shut up his shop, yetthat being delivered from the insulting temper of his creditor, and theperpetual perplexities of want of money to pay people when they dunnedhim, and, above all, from the necessity of making solemn promises fortrifling sums, and then breaking them again, was to him like a loadtaken off his back when he was weary, and could stand under it nolonger; it was a terror to him, he said, to be continually lying,breaking faith with all mankind, and making promises which he could notperform.This necessarily brings me to observe here, and it is a little for theease of the tradesman's mind in such severe cases, that there is adistinction to be made in this case between wilful premeditated lying,and the necessity men may be driven to by their disappointments, andother accidents of their circumstances, to break such promises, as theyhad made with an honest intention of performing them.He that breaks a promise, however solemnly made, may be an honest man,but he that makes a promise with a design to break it, or with noresolution of performing it, cannot be so: nay, to carry it farther, hethat makes a promise, and does not do his endeavour to perform it, or toput himself into a condition to perform it, cannot be an honest man. Apromise once made supposes the person willing to perform it, if it werein his power, and has a binding influence upon the person who made it,so far as his power extends, or that he can within the reach of anyreasonable ability perform the conditions; but if it is not in his powerto perform it, as in this affair of payment of money is often the case,the man cannot be condemned as dishonest, unless it can be made appear,either1. That when he made the promise, he knew he should not be able toperform it; or,2. That he resolved when he made the promise not to perform it, thoughhe should be in a condition to do it. And in both these cases themorality of promising cannot be justified, any more than the immoralityof not performing it.But, on the other hand, the person promising, honestly intending when hemade the appointment to perform it if possible, and endeavouringfaithfully to be able, but being rendered unable by the disappointmentof those on whose promises he depended for the performance of his own; Icannot say that such a tradesman can be charged with lying, or with anyimmorality in promising, for the breach was not properly his own, butthe people's on whom he depended; and this is justified from what I saidbefore, namely, that every promise of that kind supposes the possibilityof such a disappointment, even in the very nature of its making; for, ifthe man were not under a moral incapacity of payment, he would notpromise at all, but pay at the time he promised. His promising, then,implies that he has only something future to depend upon, to capacitatehim for the payment; that is to say, the appointments of payment byother tradesmen, who owe him (that promises) the money, or the dailysupply from the ordinary course of his trade, suppose him a retailer ina shop, and the like; all which circumstances are subject tocontingencies and disappointments, and are known to be so by the personto whom the promise is made; and it is with all those contingencies andpossibilities of disappointment, that he takes or accepts thetradesman's promise, and forbears him, in hopes that he will be able toperform, knowing, that unless he receives money as above, he cannot.I must, however, acknowledge, that it is a very mortifying thing to atradesman, whether we suppose him to be one that values his credit intrade, or his principle as to honest dealing, to be obliged to break hisword; and therefore, where men are not too much under the hatches to thecreditor, and they can possibly avoid it, a tradesman should not makehis promises of payment so positive, but rather conditional, and therebyavoid both the immorality and the discredit of breaking his word; norwill any tradesman, I hope, harden himself in a careless forwardness topromise, without endeavouring or intending to perform, from any thingsaid in this chapter; for be the excuse for it as good as it will, as tothe point of strict honesty, he can have but small regard to his ownpeace of mind, or to his own credit in trade, who will not avoid it asmuch as possible.FOOTNOTES:[26] [The practice of haggling about prices is now very properlyabandoned by all respectable dealers in goods, greatly to the comfort ofboth sellers and buyers.][27] [It was a fashion of trade in Defoe's time, and down to a somewhatlater period, to thrust the phrase 'God willing' into almost everypromise or announcement, the purport of which might possibly be thwartedby death or any other accident. The phrase, in particular, appeared atthe beginning of all letters in which a merchant announced his design ofvisiting retail dealers in the provinces; as, 'God willing, I shall havethe honour of waiting on you on the 15th proximo:' hence English_riders_, or commercial travellers, came to be known in Scotland by thenickname of God-willings.' This pious phraseology seems now to bebanished from all mercantile affairs, except the shipping of goods.][28] [Notwithstanding all this ingenious reasoning, we cannot helpthinking that it would be better if conditional promises were made inconditional language. It is not necessarily to be understood in allcases that a direct unreserved promise means something conditional, sothat there is a liability to being much deceived and grievouslydisappointed by all such promises. A sound morality certainly demandsthat the tradesman should use the practices described in the text asrarely, and with as much reluctance, as possible, and that, like othermen, he should make his words, as nearly as may be, the echo of histhoughts.]CHAPTER XVIIIOF THE CUSTOMARY FRAUDS OF TRADE, WHICH HONEST MEN ALLOW THEMSELVES TOPRACTISE, AND PRETEND TO JUSTIFYAs there are trading lies which honest men tell, so there are frauds intrade, which tradesmen daily practise, and which, notwithstanding, theythink are consistent with their being honest men.It is certainly true, that few things in nature are simply unlawful anddishonest, but that all crime is made so by the addition and concurrenceof circumstances; and of these I am now to speak: and the first I takenotice of, is that of taking and repassing, or putting off, counterfeitor false money.It must be confessed, that calling in the old money in the time of thelate King William was an act particularly glorious to that reign, and innothing more than this, that it delivered trade from a terrible load,and tradesmen from a vast accumulated weight of daily crime. There wasscarce a shopkeeper that had not a considerable quantity or bag full offalse and unpassable money; not an apprentice that kept his master'scash, but had an annual loss, which they sometimes were unable tosupport, and sometimes their parents and friends were called upon forthe deficiency.The consequence was, that every raw youth or unskilful body, that wassent to receive money, was put upon by the cunning tradesmen, and allthe bad money they had was tendered in payment among the good, that byignorance or oversight some might possibly be made to pass; and as thesetook it, so they were not wanting again in all the artifice and sleightof hand they were masters of, to put it off again; so that, in short,people were made bites and cheats to one another in all their business;and if you went but to buy a pair of gloves, or stockings, or anytrifle, at a shop, you went with bad money in one hand, and good moneyin the other, proffering first the bad coin, to get it off, if possible,and then the good, to make up the deficiency, if the other was rejected.Thus, people were daily upon the catch to cheat and surprise oneanother, if they could; and, in short, paid no good money for anything,if they could help it. And how did we triumph, if meeting with some poorraw servant, or ignorant woman, behind a counter, we got off acounterfeit half-crown, or a brass shilling, and brought away theirgoods (which were worth the said half-crown or shilling, if it had beengood) for a half-crown that was perhaps not worth sixpence, or for ashilling not worth a penny: as if this were not all one with picking theshopkeeper's pocket, or robbing his house!The excuse ordinarily given for this practice was this--namely, that itcame to us for good; we took it, and it only went as it came; we did notmake it, and the like; as if, because we had been basely cheated by A,we were to be allowed to cheat B; or that because C had robbed ourhouse, that therefore we might go and rob D.And yet this was constantly practised at that time over the wholenation, and by some of the honestest tradesmen among us, if not by allof them.When the old money was, as I have said, called in, this cheating tradewas put to an end, and the morals of the nation in some measurerestored--for, in short, before that, it was almost impossible for atradesman to be an honest man; but now we begin to fall into it again,and we see the current coin of the kingdom strangely crowded withcounterfeit money again, both gold and silver; and especially we havefound a great deal of counterfeit foreign money, as particularlyPortugal and Spanish gold, such as moydores and Spanish pistoles, which,when we have the misfortune to be put upon with them, the fraud runshigh, and dips deep into our pockets, the first being twenty-sevenshillings, and the latter seventeen shillings. It is true, the latterbeing payable only by weight, we are not often troubled with them; butthe former going all by tale, great quantities of them have been put offamong us. I find, also, there is a great increase of late of counterfeitmoney of our own coin, especially of shillings, and the quantityincreasing, so that, in a few years more, if the wicked artists are notdetected, the grievance may be in proportion as great as it wasformerly, and perhaps harder to be redressed, because the coin is notlikely to be any more called in, as the old smooth money was.What, then, must be done? And how must we prevent the mischief toconscience and principle which lay so heavy upon the whole nationbefore? The question is short, and the answer would be as short, and tothe purpose, if people would but submit to the little loss that wouldfall upon them at first, by which they would lessen the weight of it asthey go on, as it would never increase to such a formidable height as itwas at before, nor would it fall so much upon the poor as it did then.First, I must lay it down as a stated rule or maxim, in the moral partof the question--that to put off counterfeit base money for good money,knowing it to be counterfeit, is dishonest and knavish.Nor will it take off from the crime of it, or lessen the dishonesty, tosay, 'I took it for good and current money, and it goes as it comes;'for, as before, my having been cheated does not authorise me to cheatany other person, so neither was it a just or honest thing in thatperson who put the bad money upon me, if they knew it to be bad; and ifit were not honest in them, how can it be so in me? If, then, it came byknavery, it should not go by knavery--that would be, indeed, to say, itgoes as it comes, in a literal sense; that is to say, it came byinjustice, and I shall make it go so: but that will not do in matters ofright and wrong.The laws of our country, also, are directly against the practice; thelaw condemns the coin as illegal--that is to say, it is not currentmoney, or, as the lawyers style it, it is not lawful money of England.Now, every bargain or agreement in trade, is in the common and justacceptation, and the language of trade, made for such a price or rate,in the current money of England; and though you may not express it inwords at length, it is so understood, as much as if it were set down inwriting. If I cheapen any thing at a shop, suppose it the least toy ortrifle, I ask them, 'What must you have for it?' The shopkeeperanswers--so much; suppose it were a shilling, what is the English butthis--one shilling of lawful money of England? And I agree to give thatshilling; but instead of it give them a counterfeit piece of lead ortin, washed over, to make it look like a shilling. Do I pay them what Ibargained for? Do I give them one shilling of lawful money of England?Do I not put a cheat upon them, and act against justice and mutualagreement?To say I took this for the lawful money of England, will not add at all,except it be to the fraud; for my being deceived does not at all make itbe lawful money: so that, in a word, there can be nothing in that partbut increasing the criminal part, and adding one knave more to thenumber of knaves which the nation was encumbered with before.The case to me is very clear, namely, that neither by law, justice, norconscience, can the tradesman put off his bad money after he has takenit, if he once knows it to be false and counterfeit money. That it isagainst the law is evident, because it is not good and lawful money ofEngland; it cannot be honest, because you do not pay in the coin youagreed for, or perform the bargain you made, or pay in the coin expectedof you; and it is not just, because you do not give a valuableconsideration for the goods you buy, but really take a tradesman's goodsaway, and return dross and dirt to him in the room of it.The medium I have to propose in the room of this, is, that every man whotakes a counterfeit piece of money, and knows it to be such, shouldimmediately destroy it--that is to say, destroy it as money, cut it inpieces; or, as I have seen some honest tradesmen do, nail it up againsta post, so that it should go no farther. It is true, this is sinking somuch upon himself, and supporting the credit of the current coin at hisown expense, and he loses the whole piece, and this tradesmen are lothto do: but my answer is very clear, that thus they ought to do, and thatsundry public reasons, and several public benefits, would follow to thepublic, in some of which he might have his share of benefit hereafter,and if he had not, yet he ought to do it.First, by doing thus, he puts a stop to the fraud--that piece of moneyis no more made the instrument to deceive others, which otherwise itmight do; and though it is true that the loss is only to the last man,that is to say, in the ordinary currency of the money, yet the breachupon conscience and principle is to every owner through whose hands thatpiece of money has fraudulently passed, that is to say, who have passedit away for good, knowing it to be counterfeit; so that it is a piece ofgood service to the public to take away the occasion and instrument ofso much knavery and deceit.Secondly, he prevents a worse fraud, which is, the buying and sellingsuch counterfeit money. This was a very wicked, but open trade, informer days, and may in time come to be so again: fellows went about thestreets, crying '_Brass money, broken or whole;'_ that is to say, theywould give good money for bad. It was at first pretended that they wereobliged to cut it in pieces, and if you insisted upon it, they would cutit in pieces before your face; but they as often got it without thatceremony, and so made what wicked shifts they could to get it off again,and many times did put it off for current money, after they had boughtit for a trifle.Thirdly, by this fraud, perhaps, the same piece of money might, severalyears after, come into your hands again, after you had sold it for atrifle, and so you might lose by the same shilling two or three timesover, and the like of other people; but if men were obliged to demolishall the counterfeit money they take, and let it go no farther, they theywould be sure the fraud could go no farther, nor would the quantity beever great at a time; for whatever quantity the false coiners should atany time make, it would gradually lessen and sink away, and not a massof false and counterfeit coin appear together, as was formerly the case,and which lost the nation a vast sum of money to call in.It has been the opinion of some, that a penalty should be inflicted uponthose who offered any counterfeit money in payment; but besides that,there is already a statute against uttering false money, knowing it tobe such. If any other or farther law should be made, either to enforcethe statute, or to have new penalties added, they would still fall intothe same difficulties as in the act.1. That innocent men would suffer, seeing many tradesmen may take apiece of counterfeit money in tale with other money, and really and_bona fide_ not know it, and so may offer it again as innocently as theyat first took it ignorantly; and to bring such into trouble for everyfalse shilling which they might offer to pay away without knowing it,would be to make the law be merely vexatious and tormenting to thoseagainst whom it was not intended, and at the same time not to meddlewith the subtle crafty offender whom it was intended to punish, and whois really guilty.2. Such an act would be difficultly executed, because it would still bedifficult to know who did knowingly utter false money, and who did not;which is the difficulty, indeed, in the present law--so that, upon thewhole, such a law would no way answer the end, nor effectually discoverthe offender, much less suppress the practice. But I am not uponprojects and schemes--it is not the business of this undertaking.But a general act, obliging all tradesmen to suppress counterfeit money,by refusing to put it off again, after they knew it to be counterfeit,and a general consent of tradesmen to do so; this would be the best wayto put a stop to the practice, the morality of which is so justly calledin question, and the ill consequences of which to trade are so very wellknown; nor will any thing but a universal consent of tradesmen, in thehonest suppressing of counterfeit money, ever bring it to pass. In themeantime, as to the dishonesty of the practice, however popular it isgrown at this time, I think it is out of question; it can have nothingbut custom to plead for it, which is so far from an argument, that Ithink the plea is criminal in itself, and really adds to its being agrievance, and calls loudly for a speedy redress.Another trading fraud, which, among many others of the like nature, Ithink worth speaking of, is the various arts made use of by tradesmen toset off their goods to the eye of the ignorant buyer.I bring this in here, because I really think it is something of kin toputting off counterfeit money; every false gloss put upon our woollenmanufactures, by hot-pressing, folding, dressing, tucking, packing,bleaching, &c, what are they but washing over a brass shilling to makeit pass for sterling? Every false light, every artificial side-window,sky-light, and trunk-light we see made to show the fine Hollands, lawns,cambrics, &c. to advantage, and to deceive the buyer--what is it but acounterfeit coin to cheat the tradesman's customers?--an _ignis fatuus_to impose upon fools and ignorant people, and make their goods lookfiner than they are?But where in trade is there any business entirely free from thesefrauds? and how shall we speak of them, when we see them so universallymade use of? Either they are honest, or they are not. If they are not,why do we, I say, universally make use of them?--if they are honest, whyso much art and so much application to manage them, and to make goodsappear fairer and finer to the eye than they really are?--which, in itsown nature, is evidently a design to cheat, and that in itself iscriminal, and can be no other.And yet there is much to be said for setting goods out to the bestadvantage too; for in some goods, if they are not well dressed, wellpressed, and packed, the goods are not really shown in a true light;many of our woollen manufactures, if brought to market rough andundressed, like a piece of cloth not carried to the fulling or thickingmill, it does not show itself to a just advantage, nay, it does not showwhat it really is; and therefore such works as may be proper for so farsetting it forth to the eye may be necessary. For example:The cloths, stuffs, serges, druggets, &c, which are brought to market inthe west and northern parts of England, and in Norfolk, as they arebought without the dressing and making up, it may be said of them thatthey are brought to market unfinished, and they are bought there againby the wholesale dealers, or cloth-workers, tuckers, and merchants, andthey carry them to their warehouses and workhouses, and there they gothrough divers operations again, and are finished for the market; nor,indeed, are they fit to be shown till they are so; the stuffs are in thegrease, the cloth is in the oil, they are rough and foul, and are notdressed, and consequently not finished; and as our buyers do notunderstand them till they are so dressed, it is no proper finishing thegoods to bring them to market before--they are not, indeed, properlysaid to be made till that part is done.Therefore I cannot call all those setting-out of goods to be knavish andfalse; but when the goods, like a false shilling, are to be set out withfraud and false colours, and made smooth and shining to delude the eye,there, where they are so, it is really a fraud; and though in some casesit extremely differs, yet that does not excuse the rest by any means.The packers and hot-pressers, tuckers, and cloth-workers, are verynecessary people in their trades, and their business is to set goods offto the best advantage; but it may be said, too, that their true andproper business is to make the goods show what really they are, andnothing else. It is true, as above, that in the original dress, as apiece of cloth or drugget, or stuff, comes out of the hand of the maker,it does not show itself as it really is, nor what it should and ought toshow: thus far these people are properly called finishers of themanufactures, and their work is not lawful only, but it is a doingjustice to the manufacture.But if, by the exuberances of their art, they set the goods in a falselight, give them a false gloss, a finer and smoother surface than reallythey have: this is like a painted jade, who puts on a false colour uponher tawny skin to deceive and delude her customers, and make her seemthe beauty which she has no just claim to the name of.So far as art is thus used to show these goods to be what they reallyare not, and deceive the buyer, so far it is a trading fraud, which isan unjustifiable practice in business, and which, like coining ofcounterfeit money, is making goods to pass for what they really are not;and is done for the advantage of the person who puts them off, and tothe loss of the buyer, who is cheated and deceived by the fraud.The making false lights, sky-lights, trunks, and other contrivances, tomake goods look to be what they are not, and to deceive the eye of thebuyer, these are all so many brass shillings washed over, in order todeceive the person who is to take them, and cheat him of his money; andso far these false lights are really criminal, they are cheats in trade,and made to deceive the world; to make deformity look like beauty, andto varnish over deficiencies; to make goods which are ordinary inthemselves appear fine; to make things which are ill made look well; ina word, they are cheats in themselves, but being legitimated by custom,are become a general practice; the honestest tradesmen have them, andmake use of them; the buyer knows of it, and suffers himself to be soimposed upon; and, in a word, if it be a cheat, as no doubt it is, theytell us that yet it is a universal cheat, and nobody trades without it;so custom and usage make it lawful, and there is little to be said butthis, _Si populus vult decepi, decipiatur_--if the people will becheated, let them be cheated, or they shall be cheated.I come next to the setting out their goods to the buyer by the help oftheir tongue; and here I must confess our _shop rhetoric_ is a strangekind of speech; it is to be understood in a manner by itself; it is tobe taken, not in a latitude only, but in such a latitude as indeedrequires as many flourishes to excuse it, as it contains flourishes initself.The end of it, indeed, is corrupt, and it is also made up of a corruptcomposition; it is composed of a mass of rattling flattery to the buyer,and that filled with hypocrisy, compliment, self-praises, falsehood,and, in short, a complication of wickedness; it is a corrupt means to avicious end: and I cannot see any thing in it but what a wise man laughsat, a good man abhors, and any man of honesty avoids as much aspossible.The shopkeeper ought, indeed, to have a good tongue, but he should notmake a common prostitute of his tongue, and employ it to the wickedpurpose of abusing and imposing upon all that come to deal with him.There is a modest liberty, which trading licence, like the poeticlicence, allows to all the tradesmen of every kind: but tradesmen oughtno more to lie behind the counter, than the parsons ought to talktreason in the pulpit.Let them confine themselves to truth, and say what they will. But itcannot be done; a talking rattling mercer, or draper, or milliner,behind his counter, would be worth nothing if he should confine himselfto that mean silly thing called _truth_--they must lie; it is in supportof their business, and some think they cannot live without it; but Ideny that part, and recommend it, I mean to the tradesmen I am speakingof, to consider what a scandal it is upon trade, to pretend to say thata tradesman cannot live without lying, the contrary to which may be madeappear in almost every article.On the other hand, I must do justice to the tradesmen, and must say,that much of it is owing to the buyers--they begin the work, and givethe occasion. It was the saying of a very good shopman once upon thisoccasion, 'That their customers would not be pleased without lying; andwhy,' said he, 'did Solomon reprove the buyer?--he said nothing to theshopkeeper--"It is naught, it is naught," says the buyer; "but when hegoes away, then he boasteth" (Prov. xx. 14.) The buyer telling us,' addshe, 'that every thing is worse than it is, forces us, in justifying itstrue value, to tell them it is better than it is.'It must be confessed, this verbose way of trading is most ridiculous, aswell as offensive, both in buyer and seller; and as it adds nothing tothe goodness or value of the goods, so, I am sure, it adds nothing tothe honesty or good morals of the tradesman, on one side or other, butmultiplies trading-lies on every side, and brings a just reproach on theintegrity of the dealer, whether he be the buyer or seller.It was a kind of a step to the cure of this vice in trade, for such itis, that there was an old office erected in the city of London, forsearching and viewing all the goods which were sold in bulk, and couldnot be searched into by the buyer--this was called _garbling_; and thegarbler having viewed the goods, and caused all damaged or unsound goodsto be taken out, set his seal upon the case or bags which held the rest,and then they were vouched to be marketable, so that when the merchantand the shopkeeper met to deal, there was no room for any words aboutthe goodness of the wares; there was the garbler's seal to vouch thatthey were marketable and good, and if they were otherwise, the garblerwas answerable.This respected some particular sorts of goods only, and chiefly spicesand drugs, and dye-stuffs, and the like. It were well if some othermethod than that of a rattling tongue could be found out, to ascertainthe goodness and value of goods between the shopkeeper and the retailbuyer, that such a flux of falsehoods and untruths might be avoided, aswe see every day made use of to run up and run down every thing that isbought or sold, and that without any effect too; for, take it one timewith another, all the shopkeeper's lying does not make the buyer likethe goods at all the better, nor does the buyer's lying make theshopkeeper sell the cheaper.It would be worth while to consider a little the language that passesbetween the tradesman and his customer over the counter, and put itinto plain homespun English, as the meaning of it really imports. Wewould not take that usage if it were put into plain words--it would setall the shopkeepers and their customers together by the ears, and weshould have fighting and quarrelling, instead of bowing and curtseying,in every shop. Let us hark a little, and hear how it would sound betweenthem. A lady comes into a mercer's shop to buy some silks, or to thelaceman's to buy silver laces, or the like; and when she pitches upon apiece which she likes, she begins thus:_Lady_.--I like that colour and that figure well enough, but I don'tlike the silk--there is no substance in it._Mer._--Indeed, Madam, your ladyship lies--it is a very substantialsilk._Lady_.-No, no! you lie indeed, Sir; it is good for nothing; it will dono service._Mer._--Pray, Madam, feel how heavy it is; you will find it is a lie;the very weight of it may satisfy you that you lie, indeed, Madam._Lady_.--Come, come, show me a better piece; I am sure you have better._Mer._--Indeed, Madam, your ladyship lies; I may show you more pieces,but I cannot show you a better; there is not a better piece of silk ofthat sort in London, Madam._Lady_.--Let me see that piece of crimson there._Mer._--Here it is, Madam._Lady_.--No, that won't do neither; it is not a good colour._Mer_.--Indeed, Madam, you lie; it is as fine a colour as can be dyed._Lady_.--Oh fy! you lie, indeed, Sir; why, it is not in grain._Mer_.--Your ladyship lies, upon my word, Madam; it is in grain, indeed,and as fine as can be dyed.I might make this dialogue much longer, but here is enough to set themercer and the lady both in a flame, and to set the shop in an uproar,if it were but spoken out in plain language, as above; and yet what isall the shop-dialect less or more than this? The meaning is plain--it isnothing but _you lie_, and _you lie_--downright Billingsgate, wrappedup in silk and satin, and delivered dressed finely up in better clothesthan perhaps it might come dressed in between a carman and a porter.How ridiculous is all the tongue-padding flutter between Miss Tawdry,the sempstress, and Tattle, my lady's woman, at the change-shop, whenthe latter comes to buy any trifle! and how many lies, indeed, creepinto every part of trade, especially of retail trade, from the meanestto the uppermost part of business!--till, in short, it is grown soscandalous, that I much wonder the shopkeepers themselves do not leaveit off, for the mere shame of its simplicity and uselessness.But habits once got into use are very rarely abated, however ridiculousthey are; and the age is come to such a degree of obstinate folly, thatnothing is too ridiculous for them, if they please but to make a customof it.I am not for making my discourse a satire upon the shopkeepers, or upontheir customers: if I were, I could give a long detail of the arts andtricks made use of behind the counter to wheedle and persuade the buyer,and manage the selling part among shopkeepers, and how easily anddexterously they draw in their customers; but this is rather work for aballad and a song: my business is to tell the complete tradesman how toact a wiser part, to talk to his customers like a man of sense andbusiness, and not like a mountebank and his merry-andrew; to let him seethat there is a way of managing behind a counter, that, let the customerbe what or how it will, man or woman, impertinent or notimpertinent--for sometimes, I must say, the men customers are every jotas impertinent as the women; but, I say, let them be what they will, andhow they will, let them make as many words as they will, and urge theshopkeeper how they will, he may behave himself so as to avoid all thoseimpertinences, falsehoods, follish and wicked excursions which Icomplain of, if he pleases.It by no means follows, that because the buyer is foolish, the sellermust be so too; that because the buyer has a never-ceasing tongue, theseller must rattle as fast as she; that because she tells a hundred liesto run down his goods, he must tell another hundred to run them up; andthat because she belies the goods one way, he must do the same the otherway.There is a happy medium in these things. The shopkeeper, far from beingrude to his customers on one hand, or sullen and silent on the other,may speak handsomely and modestly, of his goods; what they deserve, andno other; may with truth, and good manners too, set forth his goods asthey ought to be set forth; and neither be wanting to the commodity hesells, nor run out into a ridiculous extravagance of words, which haveneither truth of fact nor honesty of design in them.Nor is this middle way of management at all less likely to succeed, ifthe customers have any share of sense in them, or the goods he shows anymerit to recommend them; and I must say, I believe this grave middle wayof discoursing to a customer, is generally more effectual, and more tothe purpose, and more to the reputation of the shopkeeper, than a stormof words, and a mouthful of common, shop-language, which makes a noise,but has little in it to plead, except to here and there a fool that canno otherwise be prevailed with.It would be a terrible satire upon the ladies, to say that they will notbe pleased or engaged either with good wares or good pennyworths, withreasonable good language, or good manners, but they must have theaddition of long harangues, simple, fawning, and flattering language,and a flux of false and foolish words, to set off the goods, and wheedlethem in to lay out their money; and that without these they are not tobe pleased.But let the tradesman try the honest part, and stand by that, keeping astock of fashionable and valuable goods in his shop to show, and I daresay he will run no venture, nor need he fear customers; if any thingcalls for the help of noise, and rattling words, it must be mean andsorry, unfashionable, and ordinary goods, together with weak and sillybuyers; and let the buyers that chance to read this remember, thatwhenever they find the shopkeeper begins his noise, and makes his finespeeches, they ought to suppose he (the shopkeeper) has trash to bringout, and believes he has fools to show it to.CHAPTER XIXOF FINE SHOPS, AND FINE SHOWSIt is a modern custom, and wholly unknown to our ancestors, who yetunderstood trade, in proportion to the trade they carried on, as well aswe do, to have tradesmen lay out two-thirds of their fortune in fittingup their shops.By fitting up, I do not mean furnishing their shops with wares and goodsto sell--for in that they came up to us in every particular, and perhapswent beyond us too--but in painting and gilding, fine shelves, shutters,boxes, glass-doors, sashes, and the like, in which, they tell us now, itis a small matter to lay out two or three hundred pounds, nay, fivehundred pounds, to fit up a pastry-cook's, or a toy-shop.The first inference to be drawn from this must necessarily be, that thisage must have more fools than the last: for certainly fools only aremost taken with shows and outsides.It is true, that a fine show of goods will bring customers; and it isnot a new custom, but a very old one, that a new shop, very wellfurnished, goes a great way to bringing a trade; for the proverb was,and still is, very true, that every body has a penny for a new shop; butthat a fine show of shelves and glass-windows should bring customers,that was never made a rule in trade till now.And yet, even now, I should not except so much against it, if it werenot carried on to such an excess, as is too much for a middlingtradesman to bear the expense of. In this, therefore, it is made not agrievance only, but really scandalous to trade; for now, a youngbeginner has such a tax upon him before he begins, that he must sinkperhaps a third part, nay, a half part, of his stock, in painting andgilding, wainscoting and glazing, before he begins to trade, nay, beforehe can open his shop. As they say of building a watermill, two-thirds ofthe expense lies under the water; and when the poor tradesman comes tofurnish his shop, and lay in his stock of goods, he finds a great holemade in his cash to the workmen, and his show of goods, on which thelife of his trade depends, is fain to be lessened to make up his show ofboards, and glass to lay them in.Nor is this heavy article to be abated upon any account; for if he doesnot make a good show, he comes abroad like a mean ordinary fellow, andnobody of fashion comes to his shop; the customers are drawn away by thepictures and painted shelves, though, when they come there, they are nothalf so well filled as in other places, with goods fit for a trade; andhow, indeed, should it be otherwise? the joiners and painters, glaziersand carvers, must have all ready money; the weavers and merchants maygive credit; their goods are of so much less moment to the shopkeeper,that they must trust; but the more important show must be finishedfirst, and paid first; and when that has made a deep hole in thetradesman's stock, then the remainder may be spared to furnish the shopwith goods, and the merchant must trust for the rest.It will hardly be believed in ages to come, when our posterity shall begrown wiser by our loss, and, as I may truly say, at our expense, that apastry-cook's shop, which twenty pounds would effectually furnish at atime, with all needful things for sale, nay, except on an extraordinaryshow, as on twelfth-day at night for cakes, or upon some great feast,twenty pounds can hardly be laid out at one time in goods for sale, yetthat fitting up one of these shops should cost upwards of L300 in theyear 1710--let the year be recorded--the fitting up to consist of thefollowing particulars:--1. Sash windows, all of looking-glass plates, 12 inches by 16 inches inmeasure.2. All the walls of the shop lined up with galley-tiles, and the backshop with galley-tiles in panels, finely painted in forest-work andfigures.3. Two large pier looking-glasses and one chimney glass in the shop, andone very large pier-glass seven feet high in the back shop.4. Two large branches of candlesticks, one in the shop, and one in theback room.5. Three great glass lanterns in the shop, and eight small ones.6. Twenty-five sconces against the wall, with a large pair of silverstanding candlesticks in the back room, value L25.7. Six fine large silver salvers to serve sweetmeats.8. Twelve large high stands of rings, whereof three silver, to placesmall dishes for tarts, jellies, &c., at a feast.9. Painting the ceiling, and gilding the lanterns, the sashes, and thecarved work, L55.These, with some odd things to set forth the shop, and make a show,besides small plate, and besides china basins and cups, amounted to, asI am well informed, above L300.Add to this the more necessary part, which was:--1. Building two ovens, about L25.2. Twenty pounds in stock for pies, cheese-cakes, &c.So that, in short, here was a trade which might be carried on for aboutL30 or L40 stock, required L300 expenses to fit up the shop, and make ashow to invite customers.I might give something of a like example of extravagance in fitting upa cutler's shop, _Anglice_ a toyman, which are now come up to such aridiculous expense, as is hardly to be thought of without the utmostcontempt: let any one stop at the Temple, or at Paul's corner, or inmany other places.As to the shops of the more considerable trades, they all bear aproportion of the humour of the times, but do not call for so loud aremark. Leaving, therefore, the just reflection which such things callfor, let me bring it home to the young tradesman, to whom I am directingthis discourse, and to whom I am desirous to give solid and useful hintsfor his instruction, I would recommend it to him to avoid all suchneedless expenses, and rather endeavour to furnish his shop with goods,than to paint and gild it over, to make it fine and gay; let it invitecustomers rather by the well-filled presses and shelves, and the greatchoice of rich and fashionable goods, that one customer beingwell-served may bring another; and let him study to bring his shop intoreputation for good choice of wares, and good attendance on hiscustomers; and this shall bring a throng to him much better, and of muchbetter people, than those that go in merely for a gay shop.Let the shop be decent and handsome, spacious as the place will allow,and let something like the face of a master be always to be seen in it;and, if possible, be always busy, and doing something in it, that maylook like being employed: this takes as much with the wiser observers ofsuch things, as any other appearance can do.I have heard of a young apothecary, who setting up in a part of thetown, where he had not much acquaintance, and fearing much whether heshould get into business, hired a man acquainted with such business, andmade him be every morning between five and six, and often late in theevenings, working very hard at the great mortar; pounding and beating,though he had nothing to do with it, but beating some very needlessthing, that all his neighbours might hear it, and find that he was infull employ, being at work early and late, and that consequently he mustbe a man of vast business, and have a great practice: and the thing waswell laid, and took accordingly; for the neighbours, believing he hadbusiness, brought business to him; and the reputation of having a trade,made a trade for him.The observation is just: a show may bring some people to a shop, but itis the fame of business that brings business; and nothing raises thefame of a shop like its being a shop of good trade already; then peoplego to it, because they think other people go to it, and because theythink there is good choice of goods; their gilding and painting may go alittle way, but it is the having a shop well filled with goods,[29]having good choice to sell, and selling reasonable--these are the thingsthat bring a trade, and a trade thus brought will stand by you and last;for fame of trade brings trade anywhere.It is a sign of the barrenness of the people's fancy, when they are soeasily taken with shows and outsides of things. Never was such paintingand gilding, such sashings and looking-glasses among the shopkeepers, asthere is now; and yet trade flourished more in former times by a greaddeal that it does now, if we may believe the report of very honest andunderstanding men. The reason, I think, cannot be to the credit of thepresent age, nor it it to the discredit of the former; for they carriedon their trade with less gaiety, and with less expense, than we donow.[30]My advice to a young tradesman is to keep the safe middle between theseextremes; something the times must be humoured in, because fashion andcustom must be followed; but let him consider the depth of his stock,and not lay out half his estate upon fitting up his shop, and then leavebut the other half to furnish it; it is much better to have a full shop,than a fine shop; and a hundred pounds in goods will make a much bettershow than a hundred pounds' worth of painting and carved work; it isgood to make a show, but not to be _all show._It is true, that painting and adorning a shop seems to intimate, thatthe tradesman has a large stock to begin with, or else they suggest hewould not make such a show; hence the young shopkeepers are willing tomake a great show, and beautify, and paint, and gild, and carve, becausethey would be thought to have a great stock to begin with; but let metell you, the reputation of having a great stock is ill purchased, whenhalf your stock is laid out to make the world believe it; that is, inshort, reducing yourself to a small stock to have the world believe youhave a great one; in which you do no less than barter the real stock forthe imaginary, and give away your stock to keep the name of it only.I take this indeed to be a French humour, or a spice of it turnedEnglish; and, indeed, we are famous for this, that when we do mimic theFrench, we generally do it to our hurt, and over-do the Frenchthemselves.The French nation are eminent for making a fine outside, when perhapswithin they want necessaries; and, indeed, a gay shop and a mean stockis something like the Frenchman with his laced ruffles, without a shirt.I cannot but think a well-furnished shop with a moderate outside is muchbetter to a tradesman, than a fine shop and few goods; I am sure it willbe much more to his satisfaction, when he casts up his year's account,for his fine shop will weigh but sorrily in his account of profit andloss; it is all a dead article; it is sunk out of his first money,before he makes a shilling profit, and may be some years a-recovering,as trade may go with him.It is true that all these notions of mine in trade are founded upon theprinciple of frugality and good husbandry; and this is a principle sodisagreeable to the times, and so contrary to the general practice, thatwe shall find very few people to whom it is agreeable. But let me tellmy young tradesmen, that if they must banish frugality and goodhusbandry, they must at the same time banish all expectation of growingrich by their trade. It is a maxim in commerce, that money gets money,and they that will not frugally lay up their gain, in order to increasetheir gain, must not expect to gain as they might otherwise do;frugality may be out of fashion among the gentry, but if it comes to beso among tradesmen, we shall soon see that wealthy tradesmen will behard to find; for they who will not save as well as gain, must expect togo out of trade as lean as they began.Some people tell us indeed in many cases, especially in trade, thatputting a good face upon things goes as far as the real merit of thethings themselves; and that a fine, painted, gilded shop, among therest, has a great influence upon the people, draws customers, and bringstrade; and they run a great length in this discourse by satirising onthe blindness and folly of mankind, and how the world are to be taken intheir own way; and seeing they are to be deluded and imposed upon insuch an innocent way, they ought to be so far deluded and imposed upon,alluding to the old proverbial saying, '_Si populus vult decipi,decipiatur;' _that it is no fraud, no crime, and can neither be againstconscience, nor prudence; for if they are pleased with a show, whyshould they not have it? and the like.This way of talking is indeed plausible; and were the fact true, theremight be more in it than I think there is. But I do not grant that theworld is thus to be deluded; and that the people do follow this rule ingeneral--I mean, go always to a fine shop to lay out their money.Perhaps, in some cases, it may be so, where the women, and the weakestof the sex too, are chiefly concerned; or where the fops and fools ofthe age resort; and as to those few, they that are willing to be soimposed upon, let them have it.But I do not see, that even this extends any farther than to a fewtoy-shops, and pastry-cooks; and the customers of both these are not ofcredit sufficient, I think, to weigh in this case: we may as well arguefor the fine habits at a puppet-show and a rope-dancing, because theydraw the mob about them; but I cannot think, after you go but one degreeabove these, the thing is of any weight, much less does it bring creditto the tradesman, whatever it may do to the shop.The credit of a tradesman respects two sorts of people, first, themerchants, or wholesale men, or makers, who sell him his goods, or thecustomers, who come to his shop to buy.The first of these are so far from valuing him upon the gay appearanceof his shop, that they are often the first that take an offence at it,and suspect his credit upon that account: their opinion upon atradesman, and his credit with them, is raised quite another way,namely, by his current pay, diligent attendance, and honest figure; thegay shop does not help him at all there, but rather the contrary.As to the latter, though some customers may at first be drawn by the gayappearance and fine gilding and painting of a shop, yet it is the wellsorting a shop with goods, and the selling good pennyworths, that willbring trade, especially after the shop has been open some time: this,and this only, establishes the man and the credit of the shop.To conclude: the credit raised by the fine show of things is also of adifferent kind from the substantial reputation of a tradesman; it israther the credit of the shop, than of the man; and, in a word, it is nomore or less than a net spread to catch fools; it is a bait to allureand deceive, and the tradesman generally intends it so. He intends thatthe customers shall pay for the gilding and painting his shop, and it isthe use he really makes of it, namely, that his shop looking likesomething eminent, he may sell dearer than his neighbours: who, and whatkind of fools can so be drawn in, it is easy to describe, but satire isnone of our business here.On the contrary, the customers, who are the substantial dependence of atradesman's shop, are such as are gained and preserved by good usage,good pennyworths, good wares, and good choice; and a shop that has thereputation of these four, like good wine that needs no bush, needs nopainting and gilding, no carved works and ornaments;[31] it requiresonly a diligent master and a faithful servant, and it will never want atrade.FOOTNOTES:[29] [In another place, the author recommends a light stock, as showinga nimble trade. There can be little doubt that he is more reasonablehere. A considerable abundance of goods is certainly an attraction to ashop. No doubt, a tradesman with little capital would only be incurringcertain ruin having a larger stock than he could readily pay for. Hemust needs keep a small stock, if he would have a chance at all of doingwell in the world. But this does not make it the less an advantage to atradesman of good capital to keep an abundant and various stock ofgoods.][30] [It is really curious to find in this chapter the same contrastdrawn between the _old_ and the _new_ style of fitting up shops, andcarrying on business, as would be drawn at the present day by nine outof every ten common observers. The notion that the shops of the past agewere plain, while those of the present are gaudy, and that the tradesmenof a past age carried on all their business in a quiet way and withlittle expense, is as strongly impressed on the minds of the presentgeneration, as it is here seen to have been on those of Defoe'scontemporaries, a hundred and twenty years ago, although it is quiteimpossible that the notion can be just in both cases. The truth probablyis, that in Defoe's time, and at all former times, there wereconspicuous, but not very numerous, examples of finely decorated shops,which seemed, and really were, very much of a novelty, as well as arather striking exception from the style in which such places in generalwere then, and had for many years been furnished. So far, however, fromthese proving, as Defoe anticipates, a warning to future generations,the general appearance of shops has experienced a vast improvement sincethose days; and the third-rate class are now probably as fine as thefirst-rate were at no distant period. At the same time, as in the reignof the first George, we have now also a few shops fitted up in a styleof extraordinary and startling elegance, and thus forming that contrastwith the general appearance of shops for the last forty years, whichmakes old people, and many others, talk of all the past as homely andmoderate, and all the present as showy and expensive.][31] [The author seems here to carry his objections to decoration to anextreme. Good usage, good pennyworths, good wares, and good choice, aredoubtless the four cardinal points of business; but a handsome shop alsogoes a considerable way in attracting customers, and is a principlewhich no prudent tradesman will despise.]CHAPTER XXOF THE TRADESMAN'S KEEPING HIS BOOKS, AND CASTING UP HIS SHOPIt was an ancient and laudable custom with tradesmen in England alwaysto balance their accounts of stock, and of profit and loss, at leastonce every year; and generally it was done at Christmas, or New-year'stide, when they could always tell whether they went backward or forward,and how their affairs stood in the world; and though this good custom isvery much lost among tradesmen at this time, yet there are a great manythat do so still, and they generally call it _casting up shop. _To speakthe truth, the great occasion of omitting it has been from the manytradesmen, who do not care to look into things, and who, fearing theiraffairs are not right, care not to know how they go at all, good or bad;and when I see a tradesman that does not cast up once a-year, I concludethat tradesman to be in very bad circumstances, that at least he fearshe is so, and by consequence cares not to inquire.As casting up the shop is the way to know every year whether he goesbackward or forward, and is the tradesman's particular satisfaction, sohe must cast up his books too, or else it will be very ominous to thetradesman's credit.Now, in order to doing this effectually once a-year, it is needful thetradesman should keep his books always in order; his day-book dulyposted, his cash duly balanced, and all people's accounts always fit fora view. He that delights in his trade will delight in his books; and, asI said that he that will thrive must diligently attend his shop orwarehouse, and take up his delight there, so, I say now, he must alsodiligently keep his books, or else he will never know whether he thrivesor no.Exact keeping his books is one essential part of a tradesman'sprosperity. The books are the register of his estate, the index of hisstock. All the tradesman has in the world must be found in these threearticles, or some of them:--Goods in the shop; Money in cash; Debts abroad.The shop will at any time show the first of these upon a small stop tocast it up; the cash-chest and bill-box will show the second at demand;and the ledger when posted will show the last; so that a tradesman canat any time, at a week's notice, cast up all these three; and then,examining his accounts, to take the balance, which is a real trying whathe is worth in the world.It cannot be satisfactory to any tradesman to let his books gounsettled, and uncast up, for then he knows nothing of himself, or ofhis circumstances in the world; the books can tell him at any time whathis condition is, and will satisfy him what is the condition of hisdebts abroad.In order to his regular keeping his books, several things might be saidvery useful for the tradesman to consider:I. Every thing done in the whole circumference of his trade must be setdown in a book, except the retail trade; and this is clear, if the goodsare not in bulk, then the money is in cash, and so the substance will bealways found either there, or somewhere else; for if it is neither inthe shop, nor in the cash, nor in the books, it must be stolen and lost.II. As every thing done must be set down in the books, so it should bedone at the very time of it; all goods sold must be entered in the booksbefore they are sent out of the house; goods sent away and not entered,are goods lost; and he that does not keep an exact account of what goesout and comes in, can never swear to his books, or prove his debts, ifoccasion calls for it.I am not going to set down rules here for book-keeping, or to teach thetradesman how to do it, but I am showing the necessity and usefulness ofdoing it at all. That tradesman who keeps no books, may depend upon ithe will ere long keep no trade, unless he resolves also to give nocredit. He that gives no trust, and takes no trust, either by wholesaleor by retail, and keeps his cash all himself, may indeed go on withoutkeeping any books at all; and has nothing to do, when he would know hisestate, but to cast up his shop and his cash, and see how much theyamount to, and that is his whole and neat estate; for as he owesnothing, so nobody is in debt to him, and all his estate is in his shop;but I suppose the tradesman that trades wholly thus, is not yet born, orif there ever were any such, they are all dead.A tradesman's books, like a Christian's conscience, should always bekept clean and clear; and he that is not careful of both will give but asad account of himself either to God or man. It is true, that a greatmany tradesmen, and especially shopkeepers, understand but little ofbook-keeping; but it is as true that they all understand something ofit, or else they will make but poor work of shopkeeping.I knew a tradesman that could not write, and yet he supplied the defectwith so many ingenious knacks of his own, to secure the account of whatpeople owed him, and was so exact doing it, and then took such care tohave but very short accounts with any body, that he brought up hismethod to be every way an equivalent to writing; and, as I often toldhim, with half the study and application that those things cost him, hemight have learned to write, and keep books too. He made notches uponsticks for all the middling sums, and scored with chalk for lesserthings. He had drawers for every particular customer's name, which hismemory supplied, for he knew every particular drawer, though he had agreat many, as well as if their faces had been painted upon them; he hadinnumerable figures to signify what he would have written, if he could;and his shelves and boxes always put me in mind of the Egyptianhieroglyphics, and nobody understood them, or any thing of them, buthimself.It was an odd thing to see him, when a country-chap, came up to settleaccounts with him; he would go to a drawer directly, among such a numberas was amazing: in that drawer was nothing but little pieces of splitsticks, like laths, with chalk-marks on them, all as unintelligible asthe signs of the zodiac are to an old school-mistress that teaches thehorn-book and primer, or as Arabic or Greek is to a ploughman. Everystick had notches on one side for single pounds, on the other side fortens of pounds, and so higher; and the length and breadth also had itssignification, and the colour too; for they were painted in some placeswith one colour, and in some places with anther; by which he knew whatgoods had been delivered for the money: and his way of casting up wasvery remarkable, for he knew nothing of figures; but he kept six spoonsin a place on purpose, near his counter, which he took out when he hadoccasion to cast up any sum, and, laying the spoons in a row before him,he counted upon them thus:   One, two, three, and another, one odd spoon, and t'other | | | | | |By this he told up to six; if he had any occasion to tell any farther,he began again, as we do after the number ten in our ordinarynumeration; and by this method, and running them up very quick, he wouldcount any number under thirty-six, which was six spoons of six spoons,and then, by the strength of his head, he could number as many more ashe pleased, multiplying them always by sixes, but never higher.I give this instance to show how far the application of a man's headmight go to supply the defect, but principally to show (and it doesabundantly show it) what an absolute necessity there is for a tradesmanto be very diligent and exact in keeping his books, and what pains thosewho understand their business will always take to do it.This tradesman was indeed a country shopkeeper; but he was soconsiderable a dealer, that he became mayor of the city which he livedin (for it was a city, and that a considerable city too), and hisposterity have been very considerable traders in the same city eversince, and they show their great-grandfather's six counting spoons andhis hieroglyphics to this day.After some time, the old tradesman bred up two of his sons to hisbusiness, and the young men having learned to write, brought books intothe counting-house, things their father had never used before; but theold man kept to his old method for all that, and would cast up a sum,and make up an account with his spoons and his drawers, as soon as theycould with their pen and ink, if it were not too full of small articles,and that he had always avoided in his business.However, as I have said above, this evidently shows the necessity ofbook-keeping to a tradesman, and the very nature of the thing evidencesalso that it must be done with the greatest exactness. He that does notkeep his books exactly, and so as that he may depend upon them forcharging his debtors, had better keep no books at all, but, like myshopkeeper, score and notch every thing; for as books well kept makebusiness regular, easy, and certain, so books neglected turn all intoconfusion, and leave the tradesman in a wood, which he can never get outof without damage and loss. If ever his dealers know that his books areill kept, they play upon him, and impose horrid forgeries and falsitiesupon him: whatever he omits they catch at, and leave it out; whateverthey put upon him, he is bound to yield to; so that, in short, as bookswell kept are the security of the tradesman's estate, and theascertaining of his debts, so books ill kept will assist every knavishcustomer or chapman to cheat and deceive him.Some men keep a due and exact entry or journal of all they sell, orperhaps of all they buy or sell, but are utterly remiss in posting itforward to a ledger; that is to say, to another book, where every parcelis carried to the debtor's particular account. Likewise they keepanother book, where they enter all the money they receive, but, asabove, never keeping any account for the man; there it stands in thecash-book, and both these books must be ransacked over for theparticulars, as well of goods sold, as of the money received, when thiscustomer comes to have his account made up; and as the goods arecertainly entered when sold or sent away, and the money is certainlyentered when it is received, this they think is sufficient, and all therest superfluous.I doubt not such tradesmen often suffer as much by their slothfulnessand neglect of book-keeping, as might, especially if their business isconsiderable, pay for a book-keeper; for what is such a man's case,when his customer, suppose a country dealer, comes to town, whichperhaps he does once a-year (as in the custom of other tradesmen), anddesires to have his account made up? The London tradesman goes to hisbooks, and first he rummages his day-book back for the whole year, andtakes out the foot[32] of all the parcels sent to his chapman, and theymake the debtor side of the account; then he takes his cash-book, if itdeserves that name, and there he takes out all the sums of money whichthe chapman has sent up, or bills which he has received, and these makethe creditor side of the account; and so the balance is drawn out, andthis man thinks himself a mighty good accountant, that he keeps hisbooks exactly; and so perhaps he does, as far as he keeps them at all;that is to say, he never sends a parcel away to his customer, but heenters it down, and never receives a bill from him, but he sets it downwhen the money is paid; but now take this man and his chap, together, asthey are making up this account. The chapman, a sharp clever tradesman,though a countryman, has his pocket-book with him, and in it a copy ofhis posting-book, so the countrymen call a ledger, where the Londontradesman's accounts are copied out; and when the city tradesman hasdrawn out his account, he takes it to his inn and examines it by hislittle book, and what is the consequence?If the city tradesman has omitted any of the bills which the countrytradesman has sent him up, he finds it out, and is sure to put him inmind of it. 'Sir,' says he, 'you had a bill from me upon Mr A.G. at sucha time, for thirty pounds, and I have your letter that you received themoney; but you have omitted it in the account, so that I am not so muchin your debt by thirty pounds, as you thought I was.''Say you so!' says the city tradesman; 'I cannot think but you must bemistaken.''No, no!' says the other, 'I am sure I can't be mistaken, for I have itin my book; besides, I can go to Mr A.G., whom the bill was drawn upon,and there is, to be sure, your own endorsement upon it, and a receiptfor the money.''Well,' says the citizen, 'I keep my books as exact as any body--I'lllook again, and if it be there I shall find it, for I am sure if I hadit, it is in my cash-book.''Pray do, then,' says the countryman, 'for I am sure I sent it you, andI am sure I can produce the bill, if there be occasion.'Away goes the tradesman to his books, which he pretends he keeps soexact, and examining them over again, he finds the bill for thirtypounds entered fairly, but in his running the whole year over together,as well he might, he had overlooked it, whereas, if his cash-book hadbeen duly posted every week, as it ought to have been, this bill hadbeen regularly placed to account.But now, observe the difference: the bill for thirty pounds beingomitted, was no damage to the country tradesman, because he has anaccount of it in his book of memorandums, and had it regularly posted inhis books at home, whatever the other had, and also was able to bringsufficient proof of the payment; so the London tradesman's omission wasno hurt to him.But the case differs materially in the debtor side of the account; forhere the tradesman, who with all his boasts of keeping his booksexactly, has yet no ledger, which being, as I have said, duly posted,should show every man's account at one view; and being done every week,left it scarce possible to omit any parcel that was once entered in theday-book or journal--I say, the tradesman keeping no ledger, he looksover his day-book for the whole year past, to draw up the debtor side ofhis customer's account, and there being a great many parcels, truly heoverlooks one or two of them, or suppose but one of them, and gives thechapman the account, in which he sums up his debtor side so much,suppose L136, 10s.: the chapman examining this by his book, as he didthe cash, finds two parcels, one L7, 15s., and the other L9, 13s.,omitted; so that by his own book his debtor side was L153, 18s.; butbeing a cunning sharp tradesman, and withal not exceeding honest, 'Well,well,' says he to himself, 'if Mr G. says it is no more than L136, 10s.what have I to do to contradict him? it is none of my business to keephis books for him; it is time enough for me to reckon for it when hecharges me.' So he goes back to him the next day, and settles accountswith him, pays him the balance in good bills which he brought up withhim for that purpose, takes a receipt in full of all accounts anddemands to such a day of the month, and the next day comes and looks outanother parcel of goods, and so begins an account for the next year,like a current chapman, and has the credit of an extraordinary customerthat pays well, and clears his accounts every year; which he had notdone had he not seen the advantage, and so strained himself to pay, thathe might get a receipt in full of all accounts.It happens some years after that this city tradesman dies, and hisexecutors finding his accounts difficult to make up, there being nobooks to be found but a day-book and a cash-book, they get some skilfulbook-keeper to look into them, who immediately sees that the only way tobring the accounts to a head, is to form a ledger out of the other two,and post every body's account into it from the beginning; for though itwere a long way back, there is no other remedy.In doing this, they come to this mistake, among a great many others ofthe like kind in other chapmen's accounts; upon this they write to thechapman, and tell him they find him debtor to the estate of the deceasedin such a sum of money, and desire him to make payment.The country shopkeeper huffs them, tells them he always made up accountswith Mr. G., the deceased, once a-year, as he did with all his otherchapmen, and that he took his receipt in full of all accounts anddemands, upon paying the balance to him at such a time; which receipt hehas to show; and that he owes him nothing, or but such a sum, being theaccount of goods bought since.The executors finding the mistake, and how it happened, endeavour toconvince him of it; but it is all one-he wants no convincing, for heknows at bottom how it is; but being a little of a knave himself, or ifyou please, not a little, he tells them he cannot enter into theaccounts so far back--Mr G. always told him he kept his books veryexactly, and he trusted to him; and as he has his receipt in full, andit is so long ago, he can say nothing to it.From hence they come to quarrel, and the executors threaten him withgoing to law; but he bids them defiance, and insists upon his receipt infull; and besides that, it is perhaps six years ago, and so he tellsthem he will plead the statute of limitations upon them; and then adds,that he does not do it avoid a just debt, but to avoid being imposedupon, he not understanding books so well as Mr G. pretended to do; andhaving balanced accounts so long ago with him, he stands by the balance,and has nothing to say to their mistakes, not he. So that, in short, notfinding any remedy, they are forced to sit down by the loss; and perhapsin the course of twenty years' trade, Mr G. might lose a great many suchparcels in the whole; and had much better have kept a ledger; or if hedid not know how to keep a ledger himself, had better have hired abook-keeper to have come once a-week, or once a-month, to have postedhis day-book for him.The like misfortune attends the not balancing his cash, a thing whichsuch book-keepers as Mr G. do not think worth their trouble; nor do theyunderstand the benefit of it. The particulars, indeed, of this articleare tedious, and would be too long for a chapter; but certainly theythat know any thing of the use of keeping an exact cash-book, know that,without it, a tradesman can never be thoroughly satisfied either of hisown not committing mistakes, or of any people cheating him, I meanservants, or sons, or whoever is the first about him.What I call balancing his cash-book, is, first, the casting up daily, orweekly, or monthly, his receipts and payments, and then seeing whatmoney is left in hand, or, as the usual expression of the tradesman is,what money is in cash; secondly, the examining his money, telling itover, and seeing how much he has in his chest or bags, and then seeingif it agrees with the balance of his book, that what is, and what shouldbe, correspond.And here let me give tradesmen a caution or two.1. Never sit down satisfied with an error in the cash; that is to say,with a difference between the money really in the cash, and the balancein the book; for if they do not agree, there must be a mistakesomewhere, and while there is a mistake in the cash, the tradesmancannot, at least he ought not to be, easy. He that can be easy with amistake in his cash, may be easy with a gang of thieves in his house;for if his money does not come right, he must have paid something thatis not set down, and that is to be supposed as bad as if it were lost;or he must have somebody about him that can find the way to his moneybesides himself, that is to say, somebody that should not come to it;and if so, what is the difference between that and having a gang ofthieves about him?--for every one that takes money out of his cashwithout his leave, and without letting him know it, is so far a thief tohim: and he can never pretend to balance his cash, nor, indeed, know anything of his affairs, that does not know which way his money goes.2. A tradesman endeavouring to balance his cash, should no more besatisfied if he finds a mistake in his cash one way, than another--thatis to say, if he finds more in cash than by the balance of his cash-bookought to be there, than if he finds less, or wanting in cash. I knowmany, who, when they find it thus, sit down satisfied, and say, 'Well,there is an error, and I don't know where it lies; but come, it is anerror on the right hand; I have more cash in hand than I should have,that is all, so I am well enough; let it go; I shall find it some timeor other.' But the tradesman ought to consider that he is quite in thedark; and as he does not really know where it lies, so, for ought heknows, the error may really be to his loss very considerably--and thecase is very plain, that it is as dangerous to be over, as it would beto be under; he should, therefore, never give it over till he has foundit out, and brought it to rights. For example:If there appears to be more money in the cash than there is by thebalance in the cash-book, this must follow--namely, that some parcel ofmoney must have been received, which is not entered in the book; now,till the tradesman knows what sum of money this is, that is thus notentered, how can he tell but the mistake may be quite the other way, andthe cash be really wrong to his loss? Thus,My cash-book being cast up for the last month, I find, by the foot ofthe leaf, there is cash remaining in hand to balance L176, 10s. 6d.To see if all things are right, I go and tell my money over, and there,to my surprise, I find L194, 10s. 6d. in cash, so that I have L18 theremore than I should have. Now, far from being pleased that I have moremoney by me than I should have, my inquiry is plain, 'How comes this topass?'Perhaps I puzzle my head a great while about it, but not being able tofind out, I sit down easy and satisfied, and say, 'Well, I don't muchconcern myself about it; it is better to be so than L18 missing; Icannot tell where it lies, but let it lie where it will, here is themoney to make up the mistake when it appears.'But how foolish is this! how ill-grounded the satisfaction! and how weakam I to argue thus, and please myself with the delusion! For some monthsafter, it appears, perhaps, that whereas there was L38 entered, receivedof Mr B.K., the figure 3 was mistaken, and set down for a figure of 5,for the sum received was L58; so that, instead of having L18 more incash than there ought to be, I have 40s. wanting in my cash, which myson or my apprentice stole from me when they put in the money, and madethe mistake of the figures to puzzle the book, that it might be sometime before it should be discovered.Upon the whole, take it as a rule, the tradesman ought to be asunsatisfied when he finds a mistake to his gain in his cash, as when hefinds it to his loss; and it is every whit as dangerous, nay, it is themore suspicious, because it seems to be laid as a bait for him to stophis mouth, and to prevent further inquiries; and it is on that accountthat I leave this caution upon record, that the tradesman may be dulyalarmed.The keeping a cash-book is one of the nicest parts of a tradesman'sbusiness, because there is always the bag and the book to be broughttogether, and if they do not exactly speak the same language, even to afarthing, there must be some omission; and how big or how little thatomission may be, who knows, or how shall it be known, but by casting andrecasting up, telling, and telling over and over again, the money?If there is but twenty shillings over in the money, the question is,'How came it there?' It must be received somewhere, and of somebody,more than is entered; and how can the cash-keeper, be he master orservant, know but more was received with it, which is not, and shouldhave been, entered, and so the loss may be the other way? It is true, intelling money there may have been a mistake, and he that received a sumof money may have received twenty shillings too much, or five pounds toomuch--and such a mistake I have known to be made in the paying andreceiving of money--and a man's cash has been more perplexed, and hismind more distracted about it, than the five pounds have been worth,because he could not find it out, till some accident has discoveredit;[33] and the reason is, because not knowing which way it could comethere, he could not know but some omission might be made to his lossanother way, as in the case above mentioned.I knew, indeed, a strong waterman, who drove a very considerable trade,but, being an illiterate tradesman, never balanced his cash-book formany years, nor scarce posted his other books, and, indeed, hardlyunderstood how to do it; but knowing his trade was exceedinglyprofitable, and keeping his money all himself, he was easy, and grewrich apace, in spite of the most unjustifiable, and, indeed, the mostintolerable, negligence; but lest this should be pleaded as an exceptionto my general rule, and to invalidate the argument, give me leave toadd, that, though this man grew rich in spite of indolence, and aneglect of his book, yet, when he died, two things appeared, which notradesman in his wits would desire should be said of him.I. The servants falling out, and maliciously accusing one another, had,as it appeared by the affidavits of several of them, wronged him ofseveral considerable sums of money, which they received, and neverbrought into the books; and others, of sums which they brought into thebooks, but never brought into the cash; and others, of sums which theytook ready money in the shop, and never set down, either the goods inthe day-book, or the money into the cash-book; and it was thought,though he was so rich as not to feel it, that is, not to his hurt, yetthat he lost three or four hundred pounds a-year in that manner, for thetwo or three last years of his life; but his widow and son, who cameafter him, having the discovery made to them, took better measuresafterwards.II. He never did, or could know, what he was worth, for the accounts inhis books were never made up; nor when he came to die, could hisexecutors make up any man's account, so as to be able to prove theparticulars, and make a just demand of their debt, but found aprodigious number of small sums of money paid by the debtors, as byreceipts in their books and on their files, some by himself, and some byhis man, which were never brought to account, or brought into cash; andhis man's answer being still, that he gave all to the master, they couldnot tell how to charge him by the master's account, because severalsums, which the master himself received, were omitted being entered inthe same manner, so that all was confusion and neglect; and though theman died rich, it was in spite of that management that would have madeany but himself have died poor.Exact book-keeping is to me the effect of a man whose heart is in hisbusiness, and who intends to thrive. He that cares not whether his booksare kept well or no, is in my opinion one that does not much carewhether he thrives or no; or else, being in desperate circumstances,knows it, and that he cannot, or does not thrive, and so matters notwhich way it goes.It is true, the neglect of the books is private and secret, and isseldom known to any body but the tradesman himself, at least till hecomes to break, and be a bankrupt, and then you frequently hear themexclaim against him, upon that very account. 'Break!' says one of theassignees; 'how should he but break?--why, he kept no books; you neversaw books kept in such a scandalous manner in your life; why, he has notposted his cash-book, for I know not how many months; nor posted hisday-book and journal at all, except here and there an account that heperhaps wanted to know the balance of; and as for balancing his cash, Idon't see any thing of that done, I know not how long. Why, this fellowcould never tell how he went on, or how things stood with him: I wonderhe did not break a long time ago.'Now, the man's case was this: he knew how to keep his books well enough,perhaps, and could write well enough; and if you look into his five orsix first years of trade, you find all his accounts well kept, thejournal duly posted, the cash monthly balanced; but the poor man foundafter that, that things went wrong, that he went backwards, and that allwent down-hill, and he hated to look into his books. As a profligatenever looks into his conscience, because he can see nothing there butwhat terrifies and affrights him, makes him uneasy and melancholy, so asinking tradesman cares not to look into his books, because the prospectthere is dark and melancholy. 'What signify the accounts to me?' sayshe; 'I can see nothing in the books but debts that 1 cannot pay, anddebtors that will never pay; I can see nothing there but how I havetrusted my estate away like a fool, and how I am to be ruined for myeasiness, and being a sot:' and this makes him throw them away, andhardly post things enough to make up when folks call to pay; or if hedoes post such accounts as he has money to receive from, that's all, andthe rest lie at random, till, as I say, the assignees come to reproachhim with his negligence.Whereas, in truth, the man understood his books well enough, but had noheart to look in them, no courage to balance them, because of theafflicting prospect of them.But let me here advise tradesmen to keep a perfect acquaintance withtheir books, though things are bad and discouraging; it keeps them infull knowledge of what they are doing, and how they really stand; and itbrings them sometimes to the just reflections on their circumstanceswhich they ought to make; so to stop in time, as I hinted before, andnot let things run too far before they are surprised and torn to piecesby violence.And, at the worst, even a declining tradesman should not let his booksbe neglected; if his creditors find them punctually kept to the last, itwill be a credit to him, and they would see he was a man fit forbusiness; and I have known when that very thing has recommended atradesman so much to his creditors, that after the ruin of his fortunes,some or other of them have taken him into business, as into partnership,or into employment, only because they knew him to be qualified forbusiness, and for keeping books in particular.But if we should admonish the tradesman to an exact and regular care ofhis books, even in his declining fortunes, much more should it be hiscare in his beginning, and before any disaster has befallen him. I doubtnot, that many a tradesman has miscarried by the mistakes and neglect ofhis books; for the losses that men suffer on that account are not easilyset down; but I recommend it to a tradesman to take exact care of hisbooks, as I would to every man to take care of his diet and temperateliving, in order to their health; for though, according to some, wecannot, by all our care and caution, lengthen out life, but that everyone must and shall live their appointed time,[34] yet, by temperance andregular conduct, we may make that life more comfortable, more agreeable,and pleasant, by its being more healthy and hearty; so, though theexactest book-keeping cannot be said to make a tradesman thrive, or thathe shall stand the longer in his business, because his profit and lossdo not depend upon his books, or the goodness of his debts depend uponthe debtor's accounts being well posted, yet this must be said, that thewell keeping of his books may be the occasion of his trade being carriedon with the more ease and pleasure, and the more satisfaction, by havingnumberless quarrels, and contentions, and law-suits, which are theplagues of a tradesman's life, prevented and avoided; which, on thecontrary, often torment a tradesman, and make his whole business beuneasy to him for want of being able to make a regular proof of thingsby his books.A tradesman without his books, in case of a law-suit for a debt, is likea married woman without her certificate. How many times has a womanbeen cast, and her cause not only lost, but her reputation andcharacter exposed, for want of being able to prove her marriage, thoughshe has been really and honestly married, and has merited a goodcharacter all her days? And so in trade, many a debt has been lost, manyan account been perplexed by the debtor, many a sum of money beenrecovered, and actually paid over again, especially after the tradesmanhas been dead, for want of hits keeping his books carefully and exactlywhen he was alive; by which negligence, if he has not been ruined whenhe was living, his widow and children have been ruined after hisdecease; though, had justice been done, he had left them in goodcircumstances, and with sufficient to support them.And this brings me to another principal reason why a tradesman shouldnot only keep books, but be very regular and exact in keeping them inorder, that is to say, duly posted, and all his affairs exactly and dulyentered in his books; and this is, that if he should be surprised bysudden or unexpected sickness, or death, as many are, and as all may be,his accounts may not be left intricate and unsettled, and his affairsthereby be perplexed.Next to being prepared for death, with respect to Heaven and his soul, atradesman should be always in a state of preparation for death, withrespect to his books; it is in vain that he calls for a scrivener orlawyer, and makes a will, when he finds a sudden summons sent him forthe grave, and calls his friends about him to divide and settle hisestate; if his business is in confusion below stairs, his books out oforder, and his accounts unsettled, to what purpose does he give hisestate among his relations, when nobody knows where to find it?As, then, the minister exhorts us to take care of our souls, and makeour peace with Heaven, while we are in a state of health, and while lifehas no threatening enemies about it, no diseases, no fevers attending;so let me second that advice to the tradesman always to keep his booksin such a posture, that if he should be snatched away by death, hisdistressed widow and fatherless family may know what is left for them,and may know where to look for it. He may depend upon it, that what heowes to any one they will come fast enough for, and his widow andexecutrix will be pulled to pieces for it, if she cannot and does notspeedily pay it. Why, then, should he not put her in a condition to havejustice done her and her children, and to know how and of whom to seekfor his just debts, that she may be able to pay others, and secure theremainder for herself and her children? I must confess, a tradesman notto leave his books in order when he dies, argues him to be either.1. A very bad Christian, who had few or no thoughts of death upon him,or that considered nothing of its frequent coming unexpected and suddenwithout warning; or,2. A very unnatural relation, without the affections of a father, or ahusband, or even of a friend, that should rather leave what he had to beswallowed up by strangers, than leave his family and friends in acondition to find, and to recover it.Again, it is the same case as in matters religious, with respect to thedoing this in time, and while health and strength remain. For, as we sayvery well, and with great reason, that the work of eternity should notbe left to the last moments; that a death-bed is no place, and a sicklanguishing body no condition, and the last breath no time, forrepentance; so I may add, neither are these the place, the condition,nor the time, to make up our accounts. There is no posting the books ona death-bed, or balancing the cash-book in a high fever. Can thetradesman tell you where his effects lie, and to whom he has lent ortrusted sums of money, or large quantities of goods, when he isdelirious and light-headed? All these things must be done in time, andthe tradesman should take care that his books should always do this forhim, and then he has nothing to do but make his will, and dispose ofwhat he has; and for the rest he refers them to his books, to know whereevery thing is to be had.FOOTNOTES:[32] [The sum at the bottom, or _foot_, of the account.][33] [This reminds the editor of an amusing anecdote he has heard,illustrative of the diseased accuracy, as it may be called, of a certainexisting London merchant. On reckoning up his household book one year,he found that he had expended one penny more than was accounted for, andthere was accordingly an error to that extent in his reckoning. The veryidea of an error, however trifling the amount, gave him greatuneasiness, and he set himself with the greatest anxiety to discover, ifpossible, the occasion. He employed the by-hours of weeks in the vainattempt; but at length, having one day to cross Waterloo Bridge, wherethere is a pontage of a penny for foot passengers, he all at once, tohis inconceivable joy, recollected having there disbursed the coin inquestion about a twelvemonth before.][34] [The correct doctrine is, we _may_ not, by our utmost care anddiligence, avoid the causes of an early and premature death; but he whoacts according to the rules which promote health, and avoids all thingswhich tend to endanger it, has a much better chance of living to thenatural period appointed for human life than he who actsotherwise--besides, as stated in the text, making his life moreagreeable. The author's illustration would be more properly drawn if wewere to say, 'The tradesman, by keeping exact accounts, may not succeedin contending against certain unfavourable circumstances, no more thanthe man who lives according to the just rules of nature may therebysucceed in eviting other evils that tend to cut short life; but as thetemperate man is most likely to be healthy, so is the tradesman, whokeeps exact accounts, most likely to thrive in business.']CHAPTER XXIOF THE TRADESMAN LETTING HIS WIFE BE ACQUAINTED WITH HIS BUSINESSIt must be acknowledged, that as this chapter seems to be written infavour of the women, it also seems to be an officious, thanklessbenefaction to the wives; for that, as the tradesman's ladies nowmanage, they are above the favour, and put no value upon it. On thecontrary, the women, generally speaking, trouble not their heads aboutit, scorn to be seen in the counting house, much less behind thecounter; despise the knowledge of their husbands' business, and act asif they were ashamed of being tradesmen's wives, and never intended tobe tradesmen's widows.If this chosen ignorance of theirs comes some time or other to be theirloss, and they find the disadvantage of it too late, they may read theirfault in their punishment, and wish too late they had acted the humblerpart, and not thought it below them to inform themselves of what it isso much their interest to know. This pride is, indeed, the greatmisfortune of tradesmen's wives; for, as they lived as if they wereabove being owned for the tradesman's wife, so, when he dies, they liveto be the shame of the tradesman's widow. They knew nothing how he gothis estate when he was alive, and they know nothing where to find itwhen he is dead. This drives them into the hands of lawyers, attorneys,and solicitors, to get in their effects; who, when they have got it,often run away with it, and leave the poor widow in a more disconsolateand perplexed condition than she was in before.It is true, indeed, that this is the women's fault in one respect, andtoo often it is so in many, since the common spirit is, as I observed,so much above the tradesman's condition; but since it is not so withevery body, let me state the case a little for the use of those whostill have ther senses about them; and whose pride is not got so muchabove their reason, as to let them choose to be tradesmen's beggars,rather than tradesmen's widows.When the tradesman dies, it is to be expected that what estate oreffects he leaves, is, generally speaking, dispersed about in manyhands; his widow, if she is left executrix, has the trouble of gettingthings together as well as she can; if she is not left executrix, shehas not the trouble indeed, but then it is looked upon that she isdishonoured in not having the trust; when she comes to look into heraffairs, she is more or less perplexed and embarrassed, as she has notor has acquainted herself, or been made acquainted, with her husband'saffairs in his lifetime.If she has been one of those gay delicate ladies, that valuing herselfupon her being a gentlewoman, and that thought it a step below herself,when she married this mechanic thing called a tradesman, andconsequently scorned to come near his shop, or warehouse, and byconsequence acquainting herself with any of his affairs,[35] or so muchas where his effects lay, which are to be her fortune for the future--Isay, if this has been her case, her folly calls for pity now, as herpride did for contempt before; for as she was foolish in the first, shemay be miserable in the last part of it; for now she falls into a sea oftrouble, she has the satisfaction of knowing that her husband has died,as the tradesmen call it, well to pass, and that she is left wellenough; but she has at the same time the mortification of knowingnothing how to get it in, or in what hands it lies. The only relief shehas is her husband's books, and she is happy in that, but just inproportion to the care he took in keeping them; even when she finds thenames of debtors, she knows not who they are, or where they dwell, whoare good, and who are bad; the only remedy she has here, if her husbandhad ever a servant, or apprentice, who was so near out of his time as tobe acquainted with the customers, and with the books, then she is forcedto be beholden to him to settle the accounts for her, and endeavour toget in the debts; in return for which she is forced to give him his timeand freedom, and let him into the trade, make him master of all thebusiness in the world, and it may be at last, with all her pride, has totake him for a husband; and when her friends upbraid her with it, thatshe should marry her apprentice boy, when it may be she was old enoughto be his mother, her answer is, 'Why, what could I do? I see I musthave been ruined else; I had nothing but what lay abroad in debts,scattered about the world, and nobody but he knew how to get them in.What could I do? If I had not done it, I must have been a beggar.' Andso, it may be, _she is_ at last too, if the boy of a husband proves abrute to her, as many do, and as in such unequal matches indeed mostsuch people do. Thus, that pride which once set her above a kind,diligent, tender husband, and made her scorn to stoop to acquaintherself with his affairs, by which, had she done it, she had beentolerably qualified to get in her debts, dispose of her shop-goods, andbring her estate together--the same pride sinks her into the necessityof cringing to a scoundrel, and taking her servant to be her master.This I mention for the caution of those ladies who stoop to marry men ofbusiness, and yet despise the business they are maintained by; thatmarry the tradesman, but scorn the trade. If madam thinks fit to stoopto the man, she ought never to think herself above owning hisemployment; and as she may upon occasion of his death be left to valueherself upon it, and to have at least her fortune and her children's togather up out of it, she ought not to profess herself so unacquaintedwith it as not to be able to look into it when necessity obliges her.It is a terrible disaster to any woman to be so far above her owncircumstances, that she should not qualify herself to make the best ofthings that are left her, or to preserve herself from being cheated, andbeing imposed upon. In former times, tradesmen's widows valuedthemselves upon the shop and trade, or the warehouse and trade, thatwere left them; and at least, if they did not carry on the trade intheir own names, they would keep it up till they put it off toadvantage; and often I have known a widow get from L300 to L500 for thegood-will, as it is called, of the shop and trade, if she did not thinkfit to carry on the trade; if she did, the case turned the other way,namely, that if the widow did not put off the shop, the shop would putoff the widow; and I may venture to say, that where there is one widowthat keeps on the trade now, after a husband's decease, there were ten,if not twenty, that did it then.But now the ladies are above it, and disdain it so much, that theychoose rather to go without the prospect of a second marriage, in virtueof the trade, than to stoop to the mechanic low step of carrying on atrade; and they have their reward, for they do go without it; andwhereas they might in former times match infinitely to their advantageby that method, now they throw themselves away, and the trade too.[36]But this is not the case which I particularly aim at in this chapter. Ifthe women will act weakly and foolishly, and throw away the advantagesthat he puts into their hands, be that to them, and it is their businessto take care of that; but I would have them have the opportunity putinto their hands, and that they may make the best of it if they please;if they will not, the fault is their own. But to this end, I say, Iwould have every tradesman make his wife so much acquainted with histrade, and so much mistress of the managing part of it, that she mightbe able to carry it on if she pleased, in case of his death; if she doesnot please, that is another case; or if she will not acquaint herselfwith it, that also is another case, and she must let it alone; but heshould put it into her power, or give her the offer of it.First, he should do it for her own sake, namely, as before, that she maymake her advantage of it, either for disposing herself and the shoptogether, as is said above, or for the more readily disposing the goods,and getting in the debts, without dishonouring herself, as I haveobserved, and marrying her 'prentice boy, in order to take care of theeffects--that is to say, ruining herself to prevent her being ruined.Secondly, he should do it for his children's sake, if he has any, thatif the wife have any knowledge of the business, and has a son to breedup to it, though he be not yet of age to take it up, she may keep thetrade for him, and introduce him into it, that so he may take thetrouble off her hands, and she may have the satisfaction of preservingthe father's trade for the benefit of his son, though left too young toenter upon it at first.Thus I have known many a widow that would have thought it otherwisebelow her, has engaged herself in her husbands's business, and carriedit on, purely to bring her eldest son up to it, and has preserved it forhim, and which has been an estate to him, whereas otherwise it must havebeen lost, and he would have had the world to seek for a new business.This is a thing which every honest affectionate mother would, or atleast should, be so willing to do for a son, that she, I think, whowould not, ought not to marry a tradesman at all; but if she would thinkherself above so important a trust for her own children, she shouldlikewise think herself above having children by a tradesman, and marrysomebody whose children she would act the mother for.But every widow is not so unnatural, and I am willing to suppose thetradesman I am writing to shall be better married, and, therefore, Igive over speaking to the woman's side, and I will suppose thetradesman's wife not to be above her quality, and willing to be madeacquainted with her husband's affairs, as well as to be helpful to him,if she can, as to be in a condition to be helpful to herself and herfamily, if she comes to have occasion. But, then, the difficulty oftenlies on the other side the question, and the tradesman cares not to layopen his business to, or acquaint his wife with it; and manycircumstances of the tradesman draw him into this snare; for I must callit a snare both to him and to her.I. The tradesman is foolishly vain of making his wife a gentlewoman,and, forsooth, he will have her sit above in the parlour, and receivevisits, and drink tea, and entertain her neighbours, or take a coach andgo abroad; but as to the business, she shall not stoop to touch it; hehas apprentices and journeymen, and there is no need of it.II. Some trades, indeed, are not proper for the women to meddle in, orcustom has made it so, that it would be ridiculous for the women toappear in their shops; that is, such as linen and woollen drapers,mercers, booksellers, goldsmiths, and all sorts of dealers bycommission, and the like--custom, I say, has made these trades soeffectually shut out the women, that, what with custom, and the women'sgenerally thinking it below them, we never, or rarely, see any women inthose shops or warehouses.III. Or if the trade is proper, and the wife willing, the husbanddeclines it, and shuts her out--and this is the thing I complain of asan unjustice upon the woman. But our tradesmen, forsooth, think it anundervaluing to them and to their business to have their wives seen intheir shops--that is to say, that, because other trades do not admitthem, therefore they will not have their trades or shops thought lessmasculine or less considerable than others, and they will not have theirwives be seen in their shops.IV. But there are two sorts of husbands more who decline acquaintingtheir wives with their business; and those are, (1.) Those who areunkind, haughty, and imperious, who will not trust their wives, becausethey will not make them useful, that they may not value themselves uponit, and make themselves, as it were, equal to their husbands. A weak,foolish, and absurd suggestion! as if the wife were at all exalted byit, which, indeed, is just the contrary, for the woman is rather humbledand made a servant by it: or, (2.) The other sort are those who areafraid their wives should be let into the grand secret of all--namely,to know that they are bankrupt, and undone, and worth nothing.All these considerations are foolish or fraudulent, and in every one ofthem the husband is in the wrong--nay, they all argue very strongly forthe wife's being, in a due degree, let into the knowledge of theirbusiness; but the last, indeed, especially that she may be put into aposture to save him from ruin, if it be possible, or to carry on somebusiness without him, if he is forced to fail, and fly; as many havebeen, when the creditors have encouraged the wife to carry on a tradefor the support of her family and children, when he perhaps may nevershow his head again.But let the man's case be what it will, I think he can never call it ahard shift to let his wife into an acquaintance with his business, ifshe desires it, and is fit for it; and especially in case of mortality,that she may not be left helpless and friendless with her children whenher husband is gone, and when, perhaps, her circumstances may requireit.I am not for a man setting his wife at the head of his business, andplacing himself under her like a journeyman, like a certainchina-seller, not far from the East India House, who, if any customerscame into the shop that made a mean, sorry figure, would leave them toher husband to manage and attend them; but if they looked like quality,and people of fashion, would come up to her husband, when he was showingthem his goods, putting him by with a 'Hold your tongue, Tom, and let metalk.' I say, it is not this kind, or part, that I would have thetradesman's wife let into, but such, and so much, of the trade only asmay be proper for her, not ridiculous, in the eye of the world, and maymake her assisting and helpful, not governing to him, and, which is themain thing I am at, such as should qualify her to keep up the businessfor herself and children, if her husband should be taken away, and shebe left destitute in the world, as many are.Thus much, I think, it is hard a wife should not know, and no honesttradesman ought to refuse it; and above all, it is a great pity thewives of tradesmen, who so often are reduced to great inconvenience forwant of it, should so far withstand their own felicity, as to refuse tobe thus made acquainted with their business, by which weak and foolishpride they expose themselves, as I have observed, to the misfortune ofthrowing the business away, when they may come to want it, and when thekeeping it up might be the restoring of their family, and providing fortheir children.For, not to compliment tradesmen too much, their wives are not allladies, nor are their children all born to be gentlemen. Trade, on thecontrary, is subject to contingencies; some begin poor, and end rich;others, and those very many, begin rich, and end poor: and there areinnumerable circumstances which may attend a tradesman's family, whichmay make it absolutely necessary to preserve the trade for his children,if possible; the doing which may keep them from misery, and raise themall in the world, and the want of it, on the other hand, sinks andsuppresses them. For example:--A tradesman has begun the world about six or seven years; he has, by hisindustry and good understanding in business, just got into a flourishingtrade, by which he clears five or six hundred pounds a-year; and if itshould please God to spare his life for twenty years or more, he wouldcertainly be a rich man, and get a good estate; but on a sudden, and inthe middle of all his prosperity, he is snatched away by a sudden fitof sickness, and his widow is left in a desolate despairing condition,having five children, and big with another; but the eldest of these isnot above six years old, and, though he is a boy, yet he is utterlyincapable to be concerned in the business; so the trade which (had hisfather lived to bring him up in his shop or warehouse) would have beenan estate to him, is like to be lost, and perhaps go all away to theeldest apprentice, who, however, wants two years of his time. Now, whatis to be done for this unhappy family?'Done!' says the widow; 'why, I will never let the trade fall so, thatshould be the making of my son, and in the meantime be the maintenanceof all my children.''Why, what can you do, child?' says her father, or other friends; 'youknow nothing of it. Mr ---- did not acquaint you with his business.''That is true,' says the widow; 'he did not, because I was a fool, anddid not care to look much into it, and that was my fault. Mr ---- did notpress me to it, because he was afraid I might think he intended to putme upon it; but he often used to say, that if he should drop off beforehis boys were fit to come into the shop, it would be a sad loss tothem--that the trade would make gentlemen of a couple of them, and itwould be great pity it should go away from them.''But what does that signify now, child?' adds the father; 'you see it isso; and how can it be helped?''Why,' says the widow, 'I used to ask him if he thought I could carry iton for them, if such a thing should happen?''And what answer did he make?' says the father.'He shook his head,' replied the widow, 'and answered, "Yes, I might, ifI had good servants, and if I would look a little into it beforehand."''Why,' says the father, 'he talked as if he had foreseen his end.''I think he did foresee it,' says she, 'for he was often talking thus.''And why did you not take the hint then,' says her father, 'and acquaintyourself a little with things, that you might have been prepared forsuch an unhappy circumstance, whatever might happen?''Why, so I did,' says the widow, 'and have done for above two yearspast; he used to show me his letters, and his books, and I know where hebought every thing; and I know a little of goods too, when they aregood, and when bad, and the prices; also I know all the country-peoplehe dealt with, and have seen most of them, and talked with them. Mr----used to bring them up to dinner sometimes, and he would prompt my beingacquainted with them, and would sometimes talk of his business with themat table, on purpose that I might hear it; and I know a little how tosell, too, for I have stood by him sometimes, and seen the customers andhim chaffer with one another.''And did your husband like that you did so?' says the father.'Yes,' says she, 'he loved to see me do it, and often told me he did so;and told me, that if he were dead, he believed I might carry on thetrade as well as he.''But he did not believe so, I doubt,' says the father.'I do not know as to that, but I sold goods several times to somecustomers, when he has been out of the way.''And was he pleased with it when he came home? Did you do it to hismind?''Nay, I have served a customer sometimes when he has been in thewarehouse, and he would go away to his counting-house on purpose, andsay, "I'll leave you and my wife to make the bargain," and I havepleased the customer and him too.''Well,' says the father, 'do you think you could carry on the trade?''I believe I could, if I had but an honest fellow of a journeyman for ayear or two to write in the books, and go abroad among customers.''Well, you have two apprentices; one of them begins to understand thingsvery much, and seems to be a diligent lad.''He comes forward, indeed, and will be very useful, if he does not growtoo forward, upon a supposition that I shall want him too much: but itwill be necessary to have a man to be above him for a while.''Well,' says the father, 'we will see to get you such a one.'In short, they got her a man to assist to keep the books, go toExchange, and do the business abroad, and the widow carried on thebusiness with great application and success, till her eldest son grewup, and was first taken into the shop as an apprentice to his mother;the eldest apprentice served her faithfully, and was her journeyman fouryears after his time was out; then she took him in partner to one-fourthof the trade, and when her son came of age, she gave the apprentice oneof her daughters, and enlarged his share to a third, gave her own sonanother third, and kept a third for herself to support the family.Thus the whole trade was preserved, and the son and son-in-law grew richin it, and the widow, who grew as skilful in the business as her husbandwas before her, advanced the fortunes of all the rest of her childrenvery considerably.This was an example of the husband's making the wife (but a little)acquainted with his business; and if this had not been the case, thetrade had been lost, and the family left just to divide what the fatherleft; which, as they were seven of them, mother and all, would not havebeen considerable enough to have raised them above just the degree ofhaving bread to eat, and none to spare.I hardly need give any examples where tradesmen die, leaving nourishingbusinesses, and good trades, but leaving their wives ignorant anddestitute, neither understanding their business, nor knowing how tolearn, having been too proud to stoop to it when they had husbands, andnot courage or heart to do it when they have none. The town is so fullof such as these, that this book can scarce fall into the hands of anyreaders but who will be able to name them among their own acquaintance.These indolent, lofty ladies have generally the mortification to seetheir husbands' trades catched up by apprentices or journeymen in theshop, or by other shopkeepers in the neighbourhood, and of the samebusiness, that might have enriched them, and descended to theirchildren; to see their bread carried away by strangers, and otherfamilies flourishing on the spoils of their fortunes.And this brings me to speak of those ladies, who, though they do,perhaps, for want of better offers, stoop to wed a trade, as we call it,and take up with a mechanic; yet all the while they are the tradesmen'swives, they endeavour to preserve the distinction of their fanciedcharacter; carry themselves as if they thought they were still abovetheir station, and that, though they were unhappily yoked with atradesman, they would still keep up the dignity of their birth, and becalled gentlewomen; and in order to this, would behave like such all theway, whatever rank they were levelled with by the misfortune of theircircumstances.This is a very unhappy, and, indeed, a most unseasonable kind of pride;and if I might presume to add a word here by way of caution to suchladies, it should be to consider, before they marry tradesmen, the greatdisadvantages they lay themselves under, in submitting to be atradesman's wife, but not putting themselves in a condition to take thebenefit, as well as the inconvenience of it; for while they are abovethe circumstances of the tradesman's wife, they are deprived of all theremedy against the miseries of a tradesman's widow; and if the man dies,and leaves them little or nothing but the trade to carry on and maintainthem, they, being unacquainted with that, are undone.A lady that stoops to marry a tradesman, should consider the usage ofEngland among the gentry and persons of distinction, where the case isthus: if a lady, who has a title of honour, suppose it be a countess, orif she were a duchess, it is all one--if, I say, she stoop to marry aprivate gentleman, she ceases to rank for the future as a countess, orduchess, but must be content to be, for the time to come, what herhusband can entitle her to, and no other; and, excepting the courtesy ofthe people calling her my Lady Duchess, or the Countess, she is no morethan plain Mrs such a one, meaning the name of her husband, and noother.Thus, if a baronet's widow marry a tradesman in London, she is no moremy lady, but plain Mrs----, the draper's wife, &c. The application ofthe thing is thus: if the lady think fit to marry a mechanic, say aglover, or a cutler, or whatever it is, she should remember she is aglover's wife from that time, and no more; and to keep up her dignity,when fortune has levelled her circumstances, is but a piece ofunseasonable pageantry, and will do her no service at all. The thing sheis to inquire is, what she must do if Mr----, the glover, or cutler,should die? whether she can carry on the trade afterwards, or whethershe can live without it? If she find she cannot live without it, it isher prudence to consider in time, and so to acquaint herself with thetrade, that she may be able to do it when she comes to it.I do confess, there is nothing more ridiculous than the double pride ofthe ladies of this age, with respect to marrying what they call belowtheir birth. Some ladies of good families, though but of mean fortune,are so stiff upon the point of honour, that they refuse to marrytradesmen, nay, even merchants, though vastly above them in wealth andfortune, only because they are tradesmen, or, as they are pleased tocall them, though improperly, mechanics; and though perhaps they havenot above L500 or L1000 to their portion, scorn the man for his rank,who does but turn round, and has his choice of wives, perhaps, with two,or three, or four thousand pounds, before their faces.The gentlemen of quality, we see, act upon quite another foot, and, Imay say, with much more judgment, seeing nothing is more frequent thanwhen any noble family are loaded with titles and honour rather thanfortune, they come down into the city, and choose wives among themerchants' and tradesmen's daughters to raise their families; and I ammistaken, if at this time we have not several duchesses, countesses, andladies of rank, who are the daughters of citizens and tradesmen, as theDuchess of Bedford, of A----e, of Wharton, and others; the Countess ofExeter, of Onslow, and many more, too many to name, where it is thoughtno dishonour at all for those persons to have matched into richfamilies, though not ennobled; and we have seen many trading familieslay the foundation of nobility by their wealth and opulence--as MrChild, for example, afterwards Sir Josiah Child, whose posterity by histwo daughters are now Dukes of Beaufort and of Bedford, and his grandsonLord Viscount Castlemain, and yet he himself began a tradesman, and incircumstances very mean.But this stiffness of the ladies, in refusing to marry tradesmen, thoughit is weak in itself, is not near so weak as the folly of those whofirst do stoop to marry thus, and yet think to maintain the dignity oftheir birth in spite of the meanness of their fortune, and so, carryingthemselves above that station in which Providence has placed them,disable themselves from receiving the benefit which their conditionoffers them, upon any subsequent changes of their life.This extraordinary stiffness, I have known, has brought many awell-bred gentlewoman to misery and the utmost distress, whereas, hadthey been able to have stooped to the subsequent circumstances of life,which Providence also thought fit to make their lot, they might havelived comfortably and plentifully all their days.It is certainly every lady's prudence to bring her spirit down to hercondition; and if she thinks fit, or it is any how her lot to marry atradesman, which many ladies of good families have found it for theiradvantage to do--I say, if it be her lot, she should take care she doesnot make that a curse to her, which would be her blessing, by despisingher own condition, and putting herself into a posture not to enjoy it.In all this, I am to be understood to mean that unhappy temper, which Ifind so much among the tradesman's wives at this time, of being abovetaking any notice of their husband's affairs, as if nothing were beforethem but a constant settled state of prosperity, and it were impossiblefor them to taste any other fortune; whereas, that very hour they embarkwith a tradesman, they ought to remember that they are entering a stateof life full of accidents and hazards, and that innumerable families, inas good circumstances as theirs, fall every day into disasters andmisfortunes, and that a tradesman's condition is liable to morecasualties than any other life whatever.How many widows of tradesmen, nay, and wives of broken and ruinedtradesmen, do we daily see recover themselves and their shatteredfamilies, when the man has been either snatched away by death, ordemolished by misfortunes, and has been forced to fly to the East orWest Indies, and forsake his family in search of bread?Women, when once they give themselves leave to stoop to their owncircumstances, and think fit to rouse up themselves to their own relief,are not so helpless and shiftless creatures as some would make themappear in the world; and we see whole families in trade frequentlyrecovered by their industry: but, then, they are such women as can stoopto it, and can lay aside the particular pride of their first years; andwho, without looking back to what they have been, can be content to lookinto what Providence has brought them to be, and what they mustinfallibly be, if they do not vigorously apply to the affairs whichoffer, and fall into the business which their husbands leave them theintroduction to, and do not level their minds to their condition. Itmay, indeed, be hard to do this at first, but necessity is a spur toindustry, and will make things easy where they seem difficult; and thisnecessity will humble the minds of those whom nothing else could make tostoop; and where it does not, it is a defect of the understanding, aswell as of prudence, and must reflect upon the senses as well as themorals of the person.FOOTNOTES:[35] [Most of the wives of tradesmen above a certain rather humblecondition would now smile at the idea of their being expected to attendtheir husbands' shops, in order to form an intimate acquaintance withtheir affairs. Doubtless, however, in the days of Defoe, when thecapitals of tradesmen were less, when provision for widows by insuranceupon lives was not practised, and when the comparative simplicity of themodes of conducting business admitted it, a female in that situationwould only be exercising a prudent caution, and doing nothing in theleast inconsistent with the delicacy of her sex, in obeying the ruleslaid down in the text.][36] [The number of widows, or at least females, carrying on trade inEngland, is still very considerable. In Scotland, it is a comparativelyrare case. A native of the northern part of the island is apt to bestrongly impressed with this fact, when, in the large manufacturingtowns of England, he sees female names in so many cases inscribed uponthe waggons used in the transport of goods. The complaint in the text,that females have, to such an extent, ceased to carry on the business oftheir deceased husbands, is probably, like many other complaints of thesame kind already pointed out, merely a piece of querulousness on thepart of our author, or the result of a very common mental deception.]CHAPTER XXIIOF THE DIGNITY OF TRADE IN ENGLAND MORE THAN IN OTHER COUNTRIESIt is said of England, by way of distinction, and we all value ourselvesupon it, that it is a trading country; and King Charles II., who wasperhaps that prince of all the kings that ever reigned in England, thatbest understood the country and the people that he governed, used tosay, 'That the tradesmen were the only gentry in England.' His majestyspoke it merrily, but it had a happy signification in it, such as waspeculiar to the bright genius of that prince, who, though he was not thebest governor, was the best acquainted with the world of all the princesof his age, if not of all the men in it; and, though it be a digression,give me leave, after having quoted the king, to add three shortobservations of my own, in favour of England, and of the people andtrade of it, and yet without the least partiality to our own country.I. We are not only a trading country, but the greatest trading countryin the world.II. Our climate is the most agreeable climate in the world to live in.III. Our Englishmen are the stoutest and best men (I mean what we callmen of their hands) in the world.These are great things to advance in our own favour, and yet to pretendnot to be partial too; and, therefore, I shall give my reasons, which Ithink support my opinion, and they shall be as short as the headsthemselves, that I may not go too much off from my subject.1. We are the greatest trading country in the world, because we have thegreatest exportation of the growth and product of our land, and of themanufacture and labour of our people; and the greatest importation andconsumption of the growth, product, and manufactures of other countriesfrom abroad, of any nation in the world.[37]2. Our climate is the best and most agreeable, because a man can be moreout of doors in England than in other countries. This was King CharlesII.'s reason for it, and I cannot name it, without doing justice to hismajesty in it.3. Our men are the stoutest and best, because, strip them naked from thewaist upwards, and give them no weapons at all but their hands andheels, and turn them into a room, or stage, and lock them in with thelike number of other men of any nation, man for man, and they shall beatthe best men you shall find in the world.From this digression, which I hope will not be disagreeable, as it isnot very tedious, I come back to my first observation, that England is atrading country, and two things I offer from that head.First, our tradesmen are not, as in other countries, the meanest of ourpeople.Secondly, some of the greatest and best, and most flourishing families,among not the gentry only, but even the nobility, have been raised fromtrade, owe their beginning, their wealth, and their estates, to trade;and, I may add,Thirdly, those families are not at all ashamed of their original, and,indeed, have no occasion to be ashamed of it.It is true, that in England we have a numerous and an illustriousnobility and gentry; and it is true, also, that not so many of thosefamilies have raised themselves by the sword as in other nations, thoughwe have not been without men of fame in the field too.But trade and learning have been the two chief steps by which ourgentlemen have raised their relations, and have built their fortunes;and from which they have ascended up to the prodigious height, both inwealth and number, which we see them now risen to.As so many of our noble and wealthy families are raised by, and derivefrom trade, so it is true, and, indeed, it cannot well be otherwise,that many of the younger branches of our gentry, and even of thenobility itself, have descended again into the spring from whence theyflowed, and have become tradesmen; and thence it is, that, as I saidabove, our tradesmen in England are not, as it generally is in othercountries, always of the meanest of our people.Indeed, I might have added here, that trade itself in England is not, asit generally is in other countries, the meanest thing the men can turntheir hand to; but, on the contrary, trade is the readiest way for mento raise their fortunes and families; and, therefore, it is a field formen of figure and of good families to enter upon.N.B. By trade we must be understood to include navigation, and foreigndiscoveries, because they are, generally speaking, all promoted andcarried on by trade, and even by tradesmen, as well as merchants; andthe tradesmen are at this time as much concerned in shipping (as owners)as the merchants; only the latter may be said to be the chief employersof the shipping.Having thus done a particular piece of justice to ourselves, in thevalue we put upon trade and tradesmen in England, it reflects very muchupon the understanding of those refined heads, who pretend to depreciatethat part of the nation, which is so infinitely superior in number andin wealth to the families who call themselves gentry, or quality, and soinfinitely more numerous.As to the wealth of the nation, that undoubtedly lies chiefly among thetrading part of the people; and though there are a great many familiesraised within few years, in the late war, by great employments, and bygreat actions abroad, to the honour of the English gentry; yet how manymore families among the tradesmen have been raised to immense estates,even during the same time, by the attending circumstances of the war,such as the clothing, the paying, the victualling and furnishing, &c,both army and navy! And by whom have the prodigious taxes been paid, theloans supplied, and money advanced upon all occasions? By whom are thebanks and companies carried on?--and on whom are the customs and exciseslevied? Have not the trade and tradesmen born the burden of thewar?--and do they not still pay four millions a-year interest for thepublic debts? On whom are the funds levied, and by whom the publiccredit supported? Is not trade the inexhausted fund of all funds, andupon which all the rest depend?As is the trade, so in proportion are the tradesmen; and how wealthy aretradesmen in almost all the several parts of England, as well as inLondon! How ordinary is it to see a tradesman go off the stage, even butfrom mere shopkeeping, with from ten to forty thousand pounds' estate,to divide among his family!--when, on the contrary, take the gentry inEngland from one end to the other, except a few here and there, whatwith excessive high living, which is of late grown so much into adisease, and the other ordinary circumstances of families, we find fewfamilies of the lower gentry, that is to say, from six or seven hundreda-year downwards, but they are in debt and in necessitous circumstances,and a great many of greater estates also.On the other hand, let any one who is acquainted with England, look butabroad into the several counties, especially near London, or withinfifty miles of it. How are the ancient families worn out by time andfamily misfortunes, and the estates possessed by a new race oftradesmen, grown up into families of gentry, and established by theimmense wealth, gained, as I may say, behind the counter, that is, inthe shop, the warehouse, and the counting-house! How are the sons oftradesmen ranked among the prime of the gentry! How are the daughters oftradesmen at this time adorned with the ducal coronets, and seen ridingin the coaches of the best of our nobility! Nay, many of our tradinggentlemen at this time refuse to be ennobled, scorn being knighted, andcontent themselves with being known to be rated among the richestcommoners in the nation. And it must be acknowledged, that, whateverthey be as to court-breeding and to manners, they, generally speaking,come behind none of the gentry in knowledge of the world.At this very day we see the son of Sir Thomas Scawen matched into theducal family of Bedford, and the son of Sir James Bateman into theprincely house of Marlborough, both whose ancestors, within the memoryof the writer of these sheets, were tradesmen in London; the first SirWilliam Scawen's apprentice, and the latter's grandfather a porter uponor near London Bridge.How many noble seats, superior to the palaces of sovereign princes (insome countries) do we see erected within few miles of this city bytradesmen, or the sons of tradesmen, while the seats and castles of theancient gentry, like their families, look worn out, and fallen intodecay. Witness the noble house of Sir John Eyles, himself a merchant, atGiddy-hall near Rumford; Sir Gregory Page on Blackheath, the son of abrewer; Sir Nathaniel Mead near Wealgreen, his father a linen-draper,with many others too long to repeat; and, to crown all, the LordCastlemains at Wanstead, his father Sir Josiah Child, originally atradesman.It was a smart, but just repartee, of a London tradesman, when agentleman, who had a good estate too, rudely reproached him in company,and bade him hold his tongue, for he was no gentleman. 'No, Sir,' sayshe, 'but I can buy a gentleman, and therefore I claim a liberty to speakamong gentlemen.'Again, in how superior a port or figure (as we now call it) do ourtradesmen live, to what the middling gentry either do or can support! Anordinary tradesman now, not in the city only, but in the country, shallspend more money by the year, than a gentleman of four or five hundredpounds a-year can do, and shall increase and lay up every year too,whereas the gentleman shall at the best stand stock still, just where hebegan, nay, perhaps decline; and as for the lower gentry, from a hundredpounds a-year to three hundred, or thereabouts, though they are often asproud and high in their appearance as the other--as to them, I say, ashoemaker in London shall keep a better house, spend more money, clothehis family better, and yet grow rich too. It is evident where thedifference lies; _an estate's a pond, but a trade's a spring_: thefirst, if it keeps full, and the water wholesome, by the ordinarysupplies and drains from the neighbouring grounds, it is well, and it isall that is expected; but the other is an inexhausted current, which notonly fills the pond, and keeps it full, but is continually running over,and fills all the lower ponds and places about it.This being the case in England, and our trade being so vastly great, itis no wonder that the tradesmen in England fill the lists of ournobility and gentry; no wonder that the gentlemen of the best familiesmarry tradesmen's daughters, and put their younger sons apprentices totradesmen; and how often do these younger sons come to buy the elderson's estates, and restore the family, when the elder, and head of thehouse, proving rakish and extravagant, has wasted his patrimony, and isobliged to make out the blessing of Israel's family, where the youngerson bought the birthright, and the elder was doomed to serve him.Trade is so far here from being inconsistent with a gentleman, that, inshort, trade in England makes gentlemen, and has peopled this nationwith gentlemen; for after a generation or two the tradesmen's children,or at least their grand-children, come to be as good gentlemen,statesmen, parliament-men, privy-counsellors, judges, bishops, andnoblemen, as those of the highest birth and the most ancient families,and nothing too high for them. Thus the late Earl of Haversham wasoriginally a merchant; the late Secretary Craggs was the son of abarber; the present Lord Castlemain's father was a tradesman; thegreat-grandfather of the present Duke of Bedford the same; and so ofseveral others. Nor do we find any defect either in the genius orcapacities of the posterity of tradesmen, arising from any remains ofmechanic blood, which it is pretended should influence them, but all thegallantry of spirit, greatness of soul, and all the generous principles,that can be found in any of the ancient families, whose blood is themost untainted, as they call it, with the low mixtures of a mechanicrace, are found in these; and, as is said before, they generally gobeyond them in knowledge of the world, which is the best education.We see the tradesmen of England, as they grow wealthy, coming every dayto the Herald's Office, to search for the coats-of-arms of theirancestors, in order to paint them upon their coaches, and engrave themupon their plate, embroider them upon their furniture, or carve themupon the pediments of their new houses; and how often do we see themtrace the registers of their families up to the prime nobility, or themost ancient gentry of the kingdom!In this search we find them often qualified to raise new families, ifthey do not descend from old; as was said of a certain tradesman ofLondon that if he could not find the ancient race of gentlemen fromwhich he came, he would begin a new race, who should be as goodgentlemen as any that went before them. They tell us a story of the oldLord Craven, who was afterwards created Earl of Craven by King CharlesII., that, being upbraided with his being of an upstart nobility, by thefamous Aubery, Earl of Oxford, who was himself of the very ancientfamily of the Veres, Earls of Oxford, the Lord Craven told him, he(Craven) would cap pedigrees with him (Oxford) for a wager. The Earl ofOxford laughed at the challenge, and began reckoning up his famousancestors, who had been Earls of Oxford for a hundred years past, andknights for some hundreds of years more; but when my Lord Craven began,he read over his family thus:--'I am William Lord Craven; my father wasLord Mayor of London, and my grandfather was the Lord knows who;wherefore I think my pedigree as good as yours, my lord.' The story wasmerry enough, but is to my purpose exactly; for let the grandfather bewho he would, his father, Sir William Craven, who was Lord Mayor ofLondon, was a wholesale grocer, and raised the family by trade, and yetnobody doubts but that the family of Craven is at this day as trulynoble, in all the beauties which adorn noble birth and blood, as can bedesired of any family, however ancient, or anciently noble.In Italy, and especially at Venice, we see every day the sons ofmerchants, and other trades, who grow in wealth and estates, and canadvance for the service of their country a considerable sum of money,namely, 60,000 to 100,000 dollars, are accepted to honour by the senate,and translated into the list of the nobility, without any regard to theantiquities of their families, or the nobility of blood; and in all agesthe best kings and sovereign princes have thought fit to reward theextraordinary merit of their subjects with titles of honour, and to rankmen among their nobility, who have deserved it by good and greatactions, whether their birth and the antiquity of their familiesentitled them to it or not.Thus in the late wars between England and France, how was our army fullof excellent officers, who went from the shop, and from behind thecounter, into the camp, and who distinguished themselves there by theirmerit and gallant behaviour. And several such came to command regiments,and even to be general officers, and to gain as much reputation in theservice as any; as Colonel Pierce, Wood, Richards, and several othersthat might be named.All this confirms what I have said before, namely, that trade in Englandneither is nor ought to be levelled with what it is in other countries;nor the tradesmen depreciated as they are abroad, and as some of ourgentry would pretend to do in England; but that, as many of our bestfamilies rose from trade, so many branches of the best families inEngland, under the nobility, have stooped so low as to be putapprentices to tradesmen in London, and to set up and follow thosetrades when they have come out of their times, and have thought it nodishonour to their blood.To bring this once more home to the ladies, who are so scandalised atthat mean step, which they call it, of marrying a tradesman--it may betold them for their humiliation, that, however they think fit to act,sometimes those tradesmen come of better families than their own; andoftentimes, when they have refused them to their loss, those verytradesmen have married ladies of superior fortune to them, and haveraised families of their own, who in one generation have been superiorto those nice ladies both in dignity and estate, and have, to theirgreat mortification, been ranked above them upon all public occasions.The word tradesman in England does not sound so harsh as it does inother countries; and to say _a gentleman-tradesman_, is not so muchnonsense as some people would persuade us to reckon it: and, indeed, astrade is now flourishing in England, and increasing, and the wealth ofour tradesmen is already so great, it is very probable a few years willshow us still a greater race of trade-bred gentlemen, than ever Englandyet had.The very name of an English tradesman will, and does already obtain inthe world; and as our soldiers by the late war gained the reputation ofbeing some of the best troops in the world, and our seamen are at thisday, and very justly too, esteemed the best sailors in the world, so theEnglish tradesmen may in a few years be allowed to rank with the bestgentlemen in Europe; and as the prophet Isaiah said of the merchants ofTyre, that 'her traffickers were the honourable of the earth,' (Isaiah,xxiii. 8.)In the meantime, it is evident their wealth at this time out-does thatof the like rank of any nation in Europe; and as their number isprodigious, so is their commerce; for the inland commerce ofEngland--and it is of those tradesmen, or traffickers, that I am nowspeaking in particular--is certainly the greatest of its kind of any inthe world; nor is it possible there should ever be any like it, theconsumption of all sorts of goods, both of our own manufacture, and offoreign growth, being so exceeding great.If the English nation were to be nearly inquired into, and its presentopulence and greatness duly weighed, it would appear, that, as thefigure it now makes in Europe is greater than it ever made before--takeit either in King Edward III.'s reign, or in Queen Elizabeth's, whichwere the two chief points of time when the English fame was in itshighest extent--I say, if its present greatness were to be duly weighed,there is no comparison in its wealth, the number of its people, thevalue of its lands, the greatness of the estates of its privateinhabitants; and, in consequence of all this, its real strength isinfinitely beyond whatever it was before, and if it were needful, Icould fill up this work with a very agreeable and useful inquiry intothe particulars.But I content myself with turning it to the case in hand, for the truthof fact is not to be disputed--I say, I turn it to the case in handthus: whence comes it to be so?--how is it produced? War has not doneit; no, nor so much as helped or assisted to it; it is not by anymartial exploits; we have made no conquests abroad, added no newkingdoms to the British empire, reduced no neighbouring nations, orextended the possession of our monarchs into the properties of others;we have grained nothing by war and encroachment; we are butted andbounded just where we were in Queen Elizabeth's time; the Dutch, theFlemings, the French, are in view of us just as they were then. We havesubjected no new provinces or people to our government; and, with few orno exceptions, we are almost for dominion where King Edward I. left us;nay, we have lost all the dominions which our ancient kings for somehundreds of years held in France--such as the rich and powerfulprovinces of Normandy, Poictou, Gascoigne, Bretagne, and Acquitaine; andinstead of being enriched by war and victory, on the contrary we havebeen torn in pieces by civil wars and rebellions, as well in Ireland asin England, and that several times, to the ruin of our richest families,and the slaughter of our nobility and gentry, nay, to the destructioneven of monarchy itself, and this many years at a time, as in the longbloody wars between the houses of Lancaster and York, the manyrebellions of the Irish, as well in Queen Elizabeth's time, as in KingCharles I.'s time, and the fatal massacre, and almost extirpation of theEnglish name in that kingdom; and at last, the late rebellion inEngland, in which the monarch fell a sacrifice to the fury of thepeople, and monarchy itself gave way to tyranny and usurpation, foralmost twenty years.These things prove abundantly that the rising greatness of the Britishnation is not owing to war and conquests, to enlarging its dominion bythe sword, or subjecting the people of other countries to our power; butit is all owing to trade, to the increase of our commerce at home, andthe extending it abroad.It is owing to trade, that new discoveries have been made in landsunknown, and new settlements and plantations made, new colonies placed,and new governments formed in the uninhabited islands, and theuncultivated continent of America; and those plantings and settlementshave again enlarged and increased the trade, and thereby the wealth andpower of the nation by whom they were discovered and planted. We havenot increased our power, or the number of our subjects, by subduing thenations which possessed those countries, and incorporating them into ourown, but have entirely planted our colonies, and peopled the countrieswith our own subjects, natives of this island; and, excepting thenegroes, which we transport from Africa to America, as slaves to work inthe sugar and tobacco plantations, all our colonies, as well in theislands as on the continent of America, are entirely peopled from GreatBritain and Ireland, and chiefly the former; the natives having eitherremoved farther up into the country, or by their own folly andtreachery raising war against us, been destroyed and cut off.As trade alone has peopled those countries, so trading with them hasraised them also to a prodigy of wealth and opulence; and we see now theordinary planters at Jamaica and Barbadoes rise to immense estates,riding in their coaches and six, especially at Jamaica, with twenty orthirty negroes on foot running before them whenever they please toappear in public.As trade has thus extended our colonies abroad, so it has, except thosecolonies, kept our people at home, where they are multiplied to thatprodigious degree, and do still continue to multiply in such a manner,that if it goes on so, time may come that all the lands in England willdo little more than serve for gardens for them, and to feed their cows;and their corn and cattle be supplied from Scotland and Ireland.What is the reason that we see numbers of French, and of Scots, and ofGermans, in all the foreign nations in Europe, and especially filling uptheir armies and courts, and that you see few or no English there?What is the reason, that when we want to raise armies, or to man naviesin England, we are obliged to press the seamen, and to make laws andempower the justices of the peace, and magistrates of towns, to forcemen to go for soldiers, and enter into the service, or allure them bygiving bounty-money, as an encouragement to men to listthemselves?--whereas the people of other nations, and even the Scots andIrish, travel abroad, and run into all the neighbour nations, to seekservice, and to be admitted into their pay.What is it but trade?--the increase of business at home, and theemployment of the poor in the business and manufactures of this kingdom,by which the poor get so good wages, and live so well, that they willnot list for soldiers; and have so good pay in the merchants' service,that they will not serve on board the ships of war, unless they areforced to do it?What is the reason, that, in order to supply our colonies andplantations with people, besides the encouragement given in thosecolonies to all people that will come there to plant and to settle, weare obliged to send away thither all our petty offenders, and all thecriminals that we think fit to spare from the gallows, besides what weformerly called the kidnapping trade?--that is to say, the arts made useof to wheedle and draw away young vagrant and indigent people, andpeople of desperate fortunes, to sell themselves--that is, bindthemselves for servants, the numbers of which are very great.It is poverty fills armies, mans navies, and peoples colonies. In vainthe drums beat for soldiers, and the king's captains invite seamen toserve in the armies for fivepence a-day, and in the royal navy fortwenty-three shillings per month, in a country where the ordinarylabourer can have nine shillings a-week for his labour, and themanufacturers earn from twelve to sixteen shillings a-week for theirwork, and while trade gives thirty shillings per month wages to theseamen on board merchant ships. Men will always stay or go, as the paygives them encouragement; and this is the reason why it has been so muchmore difficult to raise and recruit armies in England, than it has beenin Scotland and Ireland, France and Germany.The same trade that keeps our people at home, is the cause of the wellliving of the people here; for as frugality is not the national virtueof England, so the people that get much spend much; and as they workhard, so they live well, eat and drink well, clothe warm, and lodgesoft--in a word, the working manufacturing people of England eat thefat, and drink the sweet, live better, and fare better, than the workingpoor of any other nation in Europe; they make better wages of theirwork, and spend more of the money upon their backs and bellies, than inany other country. This expense of the poor, as it causes a prodigiousconsumption both of the provisions, and of the manufactures of ourcountry at home, so two things are undeniably the consequence of thatpart.1. The consumption of provisions increases the rent and value of thelands, and this raises the gentlemen's estates, and that again increasesthe employment of people, and consequently the numbers of them, as wellthose who are employed in the husbandry of land, breeding and feeding ofcattle, &c, as of servants in the gentlemen's families, who, as theirestates increase in value, so they increase their families andequipages.2. As the people get greater wages, so they, I mean the same poorer partof the people, clothe better, and furnish better, and this increases theconsumption of the very manufactures they make; then that consumptionincreases the quantity made, and this creates what we call inland trade,by which innumerable families are employed, and the increase of thepeople maintained, and by which increase of trade and people the presentgrowing prosperity of this nation is produced.The whole glory and greatness of England, then, being thus raised bytrade, it must be unaccountable folly and ignorance in us to lessen thatone article in our own esteem, which is the only fountain from whence weall, take us as a nation, are raised, and by which we are enriched andmaintained. The Scripture says, speaking of the riches and glory of thecity of Tyre--which was, indeed, at that time, the great port oremporium of the world for foreign commerce, from whence all the silksand fine manufactures of Persia and India were exported all over thewestern world--'That her merchants were princes;' and, in another place,'By thy traffic thou hast increased thy riches.' (Ezek. xxviii. 5.)Certain it is, that our traffic has increased our riches; and it is alsocertain, that the flourishing of our manufactures is the foundation ofall our traffic, as well our merchandise as our inland trade.The inland trade of England is a thing not easily described; it would,in a word, take up a whole book by itself; it is the foundation of allour wealth and greatness; it is the support of all our foreign trade,and of our manufacturing, and, as I have hitherto written, of thetradesmen who carry it on. I shall proceed with a brief discourse of thetrade itself.FOOTNOTES:[37] [We have here a pleasing trait of the superior sagacity of Defoe,in as far as it was a prevalent notion down to his time, and even later(nor is it, perhaps, altogether extinguished yet), that the prosperityof a country was marked by its excess of exports over imports. Defoejustly ranks the amount of importation on a level with that ofexportation, as indicative of the well-being of the country.]CHAPTER XXIIIOF THE INLAND TRADE OF ENGLAND, ITS MAGNITUDE, AND THE GREAT ADVANTAGEIT IS TO THE NATION IN GENERALI have, in a few words, described what I mean by the inland trade ofEngland, in the introduction to this work. It is the circulation ofcommerce among ourselves.I. For the carrying on our manufactures of several kinds in the severalcounties where they are made, and the employing the several sorts ofpeople and trades needful for the said manufactures.II. For the raising and vending provisions of all kinds for the supplyof the vast numbers of people who are employed every where by the saidmanufactures.III. For the importing and bringing in from abroad all kinds of foreigngrowth and manufactures which we want.IV. For the carrying about and dispersing, as well our own growth andmanufactures as the foreign imported growth and manufactures of othernations, to the retailer, and by them to the last consumer, which is theutmost end of all trade; and this, in every part, to the utmost cornerof the island of Great Britain and Ireland.This I call inland trade, and these circulators of goods, and retailersof them to the last consumer, are those whom we are to understand by theword tradesmen, in all the parts of this work; for (as I observed in thebeginning) the ploughmen and farmers who labour at home, and themerchant who imports our merchandise from abroad, are not at all meantor included, and whatever I have been saying, except where they havebeen mentioned in particular, and at length.This inland trade is in itself at this time the wonder of all the worldof trade, nor is there any thing like it now in the world, much lessthat exceeds it, or perhaps ever will be, except only what itself maygrow up to in the ages to come; for, as I have said on all occasions, itis still growing and increasing.By this prodigy of a trade, all the vast importation from our owncolonies is circulated and dispersed to the remotest corner of theisland, whereby the consumption is become so great, and by which thosecolonies are so increased, and are become so populous and so wealthy asI have already observed of them. This importation consists chiefly ofsugars and tobacco, of which the consumption in Great Britain isscarcely to be conceived of, besides the consumption of cotton, indigo,rice, ginger, pimento or Jamaica pepper, cocoa or chocolate, rum andmolasses, train-oil, salt-fish, whale-fin, all sorts of furs, abundanceof valuable drugs, pitch, tar, turpentine, deals, masts, and timber, andmany other things of smaller value; all which, besides the employing avery great number of ships and English seamen, occasion again a verygreat exportation of our own manufactures of all sorts to thosecolonies; which being circulated again for consumption there, thatcirculation is to be accounted a branch of home or inland trade, asthose colonies are on all such occasions esteemed as a branch of part ofourselves, and of the British government in the world.This trade to our West Indies and American colonies, is veryconsiderable, as it employs so many ships and sailors, and so much ofthe growth of those colonies is again exported by us to other parts ofthe world, over and above what is consumed among us at home; and, also,as all those goods, and a great deal of money in specie, is returnedhither for and in balance of our own manufactures and merchandisesexported thither--on these accounts some have insisted that more realwealth is brought into Great Britain every year from those colonies,than is brought from the Spanish West Indies to old Spain,notwithstanding the extent of their dominion is above twenty times asmuch, and notwithstanding the vast quantity of gold and silver whichthey bring from the mines of Mexico, and the mountains of Potosi.[38]Whether these people say true or no, is not my business to inquire here;though, if I may give my opinion, I must acknowledge that I believe theydo; but be it so or not, it is certain that it is an infinitely extendedtrade, and daily increasing; and much of it, if not all, is and ought tobe esteemed as an inland trade, because, as above, it is a circulationamong ourselves.As the manufactures of England, particularly those of wool (cotton woolincluded), and of silk, are the greatest, and amount to the greatestvalue of any single manufacture in Europe,[39] so they not only employmore people, but those people gain the most money, that is to say, havethe best wages for their work of any people in the world; and yet, whichis peculiar to England, the English manufactures are, allowing for theirgoodness, the cheapest at market of any in the world, too. Even Franceitself, after all the pains they are at to get our wool, and all theexpense they have been at to imitate our manufactures, by getting overour workmen, and giving them even greater wages than they had here, haveyet made so little proficiency in it, and are so far from outselling usin foreign markets, that they still, in spite of the strictestprohibitions, send hither, and to Holland and Germany, for Englishbroad-cloths, druggets, duroys, flannels, serges, and several othersorts of our goods, to supply their own. Nor can they clothe themselvesto their satisfaction with their own goods; but if any French gentlemanof quality comes over hither from France, he is sure to bring no morecoats with him than backs, but immediately to make him new clothes assoon as he arrives, and to carry as many new suits home with him at hisreturn, as he can get leave to bring ashore when he comes there--ademonstration that our manufacture exceeds theirs, after all theirboasts of it, both in goodness and in cheapness, even by their ownconfession. But I am not now to enter upon the particular manufactures,but the general trade in the manufacture; this particular being a tradeof such a magnitude, it is to be observed for our purpose, that thegreatness of it consists of two parts:--1. The consumption of it at home, including our own plantations andfactories.2. The exportation of it to foreign parts, exclusive of the saidplantations and factories.It is the first of these which is the subject of my present discourse,because the tradesmen to whom, and for whose instruction these chaptersare designed, are the people principally concerned in the making allthese manufactures, and wholly and solely concerned in dispersing andcirculating them for the home consumption; and this, with someadditions, as explained above, I call _inland trade_.The home-consumption of our own goods, as it is very great, so it hasone particular circumstance attending it, which exceedingly increases itas a trade, and that is, that besides the numbers of people which itemploys in the raising the materials, and making the goods themselves asa manufacture--I say, besides all this, there are multitudes of peopleemployed, cattle maintained, with waggons and carts for the service onshore, barges and boats for carriage in the rivers, and ships and barksfor carrying by sea, and all for the circulating these manufactures fromone place to another, for the consumption of them among the people.So that, in short, the circulation of the goods is a business not equal,indeed, but bearing a very great proportion to the trade itself.This is owing to another particular circumstance of our manufacture, andperhaps is not so remarkably the case of any other manufacture orcountry in Europe, namely, that though all our manufactures are usedand called for by almost all the people, and that in every part of thewhole British dominion, yet they are made and wrought in their severaldistinct and respective countries in Britain, and some of them at theremotest distance from one another, hardly any two manufactures beingmade in one place. For example:The broad-cloth and druggets in Wilts, Gloucester, and Worcestershire;serges in Devon and Somersetshire; narrow-cloths in Yorkshire andStaffordshire; kerseys, cottons, half-thicks, duffields, plains, andcoarser things, in Lancashire and Westmoreland; shalloons in thecounties of Northampton, Berks, Oxford, Southampton, and York;women's-stuffs in Norfolk; linsey-woolseys, &c, at Kidderminster;dimmeties and cotton-wares at Manchester; flannels at Salisbury, and inWales; tammeys at Coventry; and the like. It is the same, in somerespects, with our provisions, especially for the supply of the city ofLondon, and also of several other parts: for example, when I speak ofprovisions, I mean such as are not made use of in the county where theyare made and produced. For example:Butter, in firkins, in Suffolk and Yorkshire; cheese from Cheshire,Wiltshire, Warwickshire, and Gloucestershire; herrings, cured red, fromYarmouth in Norfolk; coals, for fuel, from Northumberland and Durham;malt from the counties of Hertford, Essex, Kent, Bucks, Oxford, Berks,&c.And thus of many other things which are the proper produce of one partof the country only, but are from thence dispersed for the ordinary useof the people into many, or perhaps into all the other counties ofEngland, to the infinite advantage of our inland commerce, and employinga vast number of people and cattle; and consequently those people andcattle increasing the consumption of provisions and forage, and theimprovement of lands; so true it is, and so visible, that tradeincreases people, and people increase trade.This carriage of goods in England from those places is chiefly managedby horses and waggons; the number of which is not to be guessed at, noris there any rule or art that can be thought of, by which any justcalculation can be made of it, and therefore I shall not enter upon anyparticular of it at this time; it is sufficient to say, what I believeto be true, namely, that it is equal to the whole trade of some nations,and the rather because of the great improvement of land, which proceedsfrom the employing so many thousands of horses as are furnished for thispart of business.In other countries, and indeed, in most countries in Europe, all theirinland trade, such as it is, is carried on by the convenience ofnavigation, either by coastings on the sea, or by river-navigation. Itis true, our coasting trade is exceedingly great, and employs aprodigious number of ships, as well from all the shores of England toLondon, as from one port to another.But as to our river-navigation, it is not equal to it, though in someplaces it is very great too; but we have but a very few navigable riversin England, compared with those of other countries; nor are many ofthose rivers we have navigable to any considerable length from the sea.The most considerable rivers in England for navigation are asfollows:--The Thames, the Trent, the Severn, the Wye, the Ouse, theHumber, the Air, and the Calder. These are navigable a considerable way,and receive several other navigable rivers into them; but except thesethere are very few rivers in England which are navigable much above thefirst town of note within their mouth.Most of our other greatest and most navigable rivers are navigable but avery little way in; as the northern Ouse but to York, the Orwell but toIpswich, the Yare but to Norwich; the Tyne itself but a very littleabove Newcastle, not in all above twelve miles; the Tweed not at allabove Berwick; the great Avon but to Bristol; the Exe but to Exeter; andthe Dee but to Chester: in a word, our river-navigation is not to benamed for carriage, with the vast bulk of carriage by pack-horses and bywaggons; nor must the carriage by pedlars on their backs be omitted.[40]This carriage is the medium of our inland trade, and, as I said, is abranch of the trade itself. This great carriage is occasioned by thesituation of our produce and manufactures. For example--the Taunton andExeter serges, perpetuanas, and duroys, come chiefly by land; theclothing, such as the broad-cloth and druggets from Wilts, Gloucester,Worcester, and Shropshire, comes all by land-carriage to London, andgoes down again by land-carriages to all parts of England; the Yorkshireclothing trade, the Manchester and Coventry trades, all by land, not toLondon only, but to all parts of England, by horse-packs--the Manchestermen being, saving their wealth, a kind of pedlars, who carry their goodsthemselves to the country shopkeepers every where, as do now theYorkshire and Coventry manufacturers also.Now, in all these manufactures, however remote from one another, everytown in England uses something, not only of one or other, but of all therest. Every sort of goods is wanted every where; and where they make onesort of goods, and sell them all over England, they at the same timewant other goods from almost every other part. For example:Norwich makes chiefly woollen stuffs and camblets, and these are soldall over England; but then Norwich buys broad-cloth from Wilts andWorcestershire, serges and sagathies from Devon and Somersetshire,narrow cloth from Yorkshire, flannel from Wales, coal from Newcastle,and the like; and so it is, _mutatis mutandis_, of most of the otherparts.The circulating of these goods in this manner, is the life of our inlandtrade, and increases the numbers of our people, by keeping them employedat home; and, indeed, of late they are prodigiously multiplied; and theyagain increase our trade, as shall be mentioned in its place.As the demand for all sorts of English goods is thus great, and they arethus extended in every part of the island, so the tradesmen aredispersed and spread over every part also; that is to say, in everytown, great or little, we find shopkeepers, wholesale or retail, who areconcerned in this circulation, and hand forward the goods to the lastconsumer. From London, the goods go chiefly to the great towns, and fromthose again to the smaller markets, and from those to the meanestvillages; so that all the manufactures of England, and most of them alsoof foreign countries, are to be found in the meanest village, and in theremotest corner of the whole island of Britain, and are to be bought, asit were, at every body's door.This shows not the extent of our manufactures only, but the usefulnessof them, and how they are so necessary to mankind that our own peoplecannot be without them, and every sort of them, and cannot make onething serve for another; but as they sell their own, so they buy fromothers, and every body here trades with every body: this it is thatgives the whole manufacture so universal a circulation, and makes it soimmensely great in England. What it is abroad, is not so much to ourpresent purpose.Again, the magnitude of the city of London adds very considerably to thegreatness of the inland trade; for as this city is the centre of ourtrade, so all the manufactures are brought hither, and from hencecirculated again to all the country, as they are particularly calledfor. But that is not all; the magnitude of the city influences the wholenation also in the article of provisions, and something is raised inevery county in England, however remote, for the supply of London; nay,all the best of every produce is brought hither; so that all the people,and all the lands in England, seem to be at work for, or employed by, oron the account of, this overgrown city.This makes the trade increase prodigiously, even as the city itselfincreases; and we all know the city is very greatly increased within fewyears past. Again, as the whole nation is employed to feed and clothethis city, so here is the money, by which all the people in the wholenation seem to be supported and maintained.I have endeavoured to make some calculation of the number of shopkeepersin this kingdom, but I find it is not to be done--we may as well countthe stars; not that they are equal in number neither, but it is asimpossible, unless any one person corresponded so as to have themnumbered in every town or parish throughout the kingdom. I doubt notthey are some hundreds of thousands, but there is no making anestimate--the number is in a manner infinite. It is as impossiblelikewise to make any guess at the bulk of their trade, and how much theyreturn yearly; nor, if we could, would it give any foundation for anyjust calculation of the value of goods in general, because all our goodscirculate so much, and go so often through so many hands before theycome to the consumer. This so often passing every sort of goods throughso many hands, before it comes into the hands of the last consumer, isthat which makes our trade be so immensely great. For example, if thereis made in England for our home-consumption the value of L100,000 worthof any particular goods, say, for example, that it be so many pieces ofserge or cloth, and if this goes through ten tradesmen's hands, beforeit comes to the last consumer, then there is L1,000,000 returned intrade for that L100,000 worth of goods; and so of all the sorts of goodswe trade in.Again, as I said above, all our manufactures are so useful to, anddepend on, one another so much in trade, that the sale of onenecessarily causes the demand of the other in all parts. For example,suppose the poorest countryman wants to be clothed, or suppose it be agentleman wants to clothe one of his servants, whether a footman in alivery, or suppose it be any servant in ordinary apparel, yet he shallin some part employ almost every one of the manufacturing counties ofEngland, for making up one ordinary suit of clothes. For example:If his coat be of woollen-cloth, he has that from Yorkshire; the liningis shalloon from Berkshire; the waistcoat is of callamanco from Norwich;the breeches of a strong drugget from Devizes, Wiltshire; the stockingsbeing of yarn from Westmoreland; the hat is a felt from Leicester; thegloves of leather from Somersetshire; the shoes from Northampton; thebuttons from Macclesfield in Cheshire, or, if they are of metal, theycome from Birmingham, or Warwickshire; his garters from Manchester; hisshirt of home-made linen of Lancashire, or Scotland.If it be thus of every poor man's clothing, or of a servant, what mustit be of the master, and of the rest of the family? And in thisparticular the case is the same, let the family live where they will; sothat all these manufactures must be found in all the remotest towns andcounties in England, be it where you will.Again, take the furnishing of our houses, it is the same in proportion,and according to the figure and quality of the person. Suppose, then, itbe a middling tradesman that is going to live in some market-town, andto open his shop there; suppose him not to deal in the manufacture, butin groceries, and such sort of wares as the country grocers sell.This man, however, must clothe himself and his wife, and must furnishhis house: let us see, then, to how many counties and towns, among ourmanufactures, must he send for his needful supply. Nor is the quantityconcerned in it; let him furnish himself as frugally as he pleases, yethe must have something of every necessary thing; and we will suppose forthe present purpose the man lived in Sussex, where very few, if any,manufactures are carried on; suppose he lived at Horsham, which is amarket-town in or near the middle of the county.For his clothing of himself--for we must allow him to have a new suit ofclothes when he begins the world--take them to be just as above; for asto the quality or quantity, it is much the same; only, that instead ofbuying the cloth from Yorkshire, perhaps he has it a little finer thanthe poor man above, and so his comes out of Wiltshire, and his stockingsare, it may be, of worsted, not of yarn, and so they come fromNottingham, not Westmoreland; but this does not at all alter the case.Come we next to his wife; and she being a good honest townsman'sdaughter, is not dressed over fine, yet she must have something decent,being newly married too, especially as times go, when the burghers'wives of Horsham, or any other town, go as fine as they do in otherplaces: allow her, then, to have a silk gown, with all the necessariesbelonging to a middling tolerable appearance, yet you shall find all thenation more or less concerned in clothing this country grocer's wife,and furnishing his house, and yet nothing at all extravagant. Forexample:Her gown, a plain English mantua-silk, manufactured in Spitalfields; herpetticoat the same; her binding, a piece of chequered-stuff, made atBristol and Norwich; her under-petticoat, a piece of black callamanco,made at Norwith--quilted at home, if she be a good housewife, but thequilting of cotton from Manchester, or cotton-wool from abroad; herinner-petticoats, flannel and swanskin, from Salisbury and Wales; herstockings from Tewksbury, if ordinary, from Leicester, if woven; herlace and edgings from Stony Stratford the first, and Great Marlow thelast; her muslin from foreign trade, as likewise her linen, beingsomething finer than the man's, may perhaps be a guilick-Holland; herwrapper, or morning-gown, a piece of Irish linen, printed at London; herblack hood, a thin English lustring; her gloves, lamb's-skin, fromBerwick and Northumberland, or Scotland; her ribands, being but veryfew, from Coventry, or London; her riding-hood, of Englishworsted-camblet, made at Norwich.Come next to the furniture of their house. It is scarce credible, to howmany counties of England, and how remote, the furniture of but a meanhouse must send them, and how many people are every where employedabout it; nay, and the meaner the furniture, the more people and placesemployed. For example:The hangings, suppose them to be ordinary linsey-woolsey, are made atKidderminster, dyed in the country, and painted, or watered, at London;the chairs, if of cane, are made at London; the ordinary matted chairs,perhaps in the place where they live; tables, chests of drawers, &c.,made at London; as also looking-glass; bedding, &c., the curtains,suppose of serge from Taunton and Exeter, or of camblets, from Norwich,or the same with the hangings, as above; the ticking comes from the westcountry, Somerset and Dorsetshire; the feathers also from the samecountry; the blankets from Whitney in Oxfordshire; the rugs fromWestmoreland and Yorkshire; the sheets, of good linen, from Ireland;kitchen utensils and chimney-furniture, almost all the brass and ironfrom Birmingham and Sheffield; earthen-ware from Stafford, Nottingham,and Kent; glass ware from Sturbridge in Worcestershire, and London.I give this list to explain what I said before, namely, that there is noparticular place in England, where all the manufactures are made, butevery county or place has its peculiar sort, or particular manufacture,in which the people are wholly employed; and for all the rest that iswanted, they fetch them from other parts.[41]But, then, as what is thus wanted by every particular person, or family,is but in small quantities, and they would not be able to send for it tothe country or town where it is to be bought, there are shopkeepers inevery village, or at least in every considerable market-town, where theparticulars are to be bought, and who find it worth their while tofurnish themselves with quantities of all the particular goods, be theymade where and as far off as they will; and at these shops the peoplewho want them are easily supplied.Nor do even these shopkeepers go or send to all the several countieswhere those goods are made--that is to say, to this part for the cloth,or to that for the lining; to another for the buttons, and to anotherfor the thread; but they again correspond with the wholesale dealers inLondon, where there are particular shops or warehouses for all these;and they not only furnish the country shopkeepers, but give them largecredit, and sell them great quantities of goods, by which they againare enabled to trust the tailors who make the clothes, or even theirneighbours who wear them; and the manufacturers in the several countiesdo the like by those wholesale dealers who supply the country shops.Through so many hands do all the necessary things pass for the clothinga poor plain countryman, though he lived as far as Berwick-upon-Tweed;and this occasions, as I have said, a general circulation of trade, bothto and from London, from and to all the parts of England, so that everymanufacture is sold and removed five or six times, and perhaps more,before it comes at the last consumer.This method of trade brings another article in, which also is the greatfoundation of the increase of commerce, and the prodigious magnitude ofour inland trade is much owing to it; and that is giving credit, bywhich every tradesman is enabled to trade for a great deal more than heotherwise could do. By this method a shopkeeper is able to stock hisshop, or warehouses, with two or three times as much goods in value, ashe has stock of his own to begin the world with, and by that means isable to trust out his goods to others, and give them time, and so underone another--nay, I may say, many a tradesman begins the world withborrowed stocks, or with no stock at all, but that of credit, and yetcarries on a trade for several hundreds, nay, for several thousands, ofpounds a-year.By this means the trade in general is infinitely increased--nay, thestock of the kingdom in trade is doubled, or trebled, or more, and thereis infinitely more business carried on, than the real stock could beable to manage, if no credit were to be given; for credit in thisparticular is a stock, and that not an imaginary, but a real stock; forthe tradesman, that perhaps begins but with five hundred, or onethousand pounds' stock, shall be able to furnish or stock his shop withfour times the sum in the value of goods; and as he gives credit again,and trusts other tradesmen under him, so he launches out into a trade ofgreat magnitude; and yet, if he is a prudent manager of his business, hefinds himself able to answer his payments, and so continually supplyhimself with goods, keeping up the reputation of his dealings, and thecredit of his shop, though his stock be not a fifth, nay, sometimes nota tenth part, in proportion to the returns that he makes by the year: sothat credit is the foundation on which the trade of England is made soconsiderable.Nor is it enough to say, that people must and will have goods, and thatthe consumption is the same; it is evident that consumption is not thesame; and in those nations where they give no credit, or not so much ashere, the trade is small in proportion, as I shall show in its place.FOOTNOTES:[38] [The amount of trade produced by the British colonies is stillgreat; but it has been ascertained that it is not profitable to thenation at large, as much more is paid from the public purse for themilitary protection required by the colonies, than returns toindividuals through the medium of business.][39] [The cotton manufacture has now the prominence which, in Defoe'stime, was due to those of wool and silk.][40] [It is scarcely necessary to remind the reader, that the canalnavigation of England has come into existence since the date of thiswork--the railway communication is but of yesterday.][41] [Since Defoe's time, little alteration has taken place in thelocality of a number of manufactures in England; but, in the interval,an entire change has been effected in Scotland, which now possessesvarious manufactures of importance in the commercial economy of thenation. We need only allude to the cambrics, gauzes, and silks ofPaisley; the cottons and other goods of Glasgow; the plaidings ofStirlingshire; the stockings of Hawick; the printing-paper ofMid-Lothian; the carpets and bonnets of Kilmarnock; the iron of Muirkirkand Carron; the linens of Fife and Dundee; and the shawls of Edinburgh.]CHAPTER XXIVOF CREDIT IN TRADE, AND HOW A TRADESMAN OUGHT TO VALUE AND IMPROVE IT:HOW EASILY LOST, AND HOW HARD IT IS TO BE RECOVEREDCredit is, or ought to be, the tradesman's _mistress_; but I must tellhim too, he must not think of ever casting her off, for if once he losesher, she hardly ever returns; and yet she has one quality, in which shediffers from most of the ladies who go by that name--if you court her,she is gone; if you manage so wisely as to make her believe you reallydo not want her, she follows and courts you. But, by the way, notradesman can be in so good circumstances as to say he does not want,that is, does not stand in need of credit.Credit, next to real stock, is the foundation, the life and soul, ofbusiness in a private tradesman; it is his prosperity; it is his supportin the substance of his whole trade; even in public matters, it is thestrengh and fund of a nation. We felt, in the late wars, the consequenceof both the extremes--namely, of wanting and of enjoying a complete fundof credit.Credit makes war, and makes peace; raises armies, fits out navies,fights battles, besieges towns; and, in a word, it is more justly calledthe sinews of war than the money itself,[42] because it can do all thesethings without money--nay, it will bring in money to be subservient,though it be independent.Credit makes the soldier fight without pay, the armies march withoutprovisions, and it makes tradesmen keep open shop without stock. Theforce of credit is not to be described by words; it is an impregnablefortification, either for a nation, or for a single man in business; andhe that has credit is invulnerable, whether he has money or no; nay, itwill make money, and, which is yet more, it will make money without anintrinsic, without the _materia medica_ (as the doctors have it); itadds a value, and supports whatever value it adds, to the meanestsubstance; it makes paper pass for money, and fills the Exchequer andthe banks with as many millions as it pleases, upon demand. As I saidin last chapter, it increases commerce; so, I may add, it makes trade,and makes the whole kingdom trade for many millions more than thenational specie can amount to.It may be true, as some allege, that we cannot drive a trade for moregoods than we have to trade with, but then it is as true, that it is bythe help of credit that we can increase the quantity, and that moregoods are made to trade with than would otherwise be; more goods arebrought to market than they could otherwise sell; and even in the lastconsumption, how many thousands of families wear out their clothesbefore they pay for them, and eat their dinner upon tick with thebutcher! Nay, how many thousands who could not buy any clothes, if theywere to pay for them in ready money, yet buy them at a venture upontheir credit, and pay for them as they can!Trade is anticipated by credit, and it grows by the anticipation; formen often buy clothes before they pay for them, because they wantclothes before they can spare the money; and these are so many innumber, that really they add a great stroke to the bulk of our inlandtrade. How many families have we in England that live upon credit, evento the tune of two or three years' rent of their revenue, before itcomes in!--so that they must be said to _eat the calf in the cow'sbelly_. This encroachment they make upon the stock in trade; and eventhis very article may state the case: I doubt not but at this time theland owes to the trade some millions sterling; that is to say, thegentlemen owe to the tradesmen so much money, which, at long run, therents of their lands must pay.The tradesmen having, then, trusted the landed men with so much, wheremust they have it but by giving credit also to one another? Trustingtheir goods and money into trade, one launching out into the hands ofanother, and forbearing payment till the lands make it good out of theirproduce, that is to say, out of their rents.The trade is not limited; the produce of lands may be and is restrained.Trade cannot exceed the bounds of the goods it can sell; but while tradecan increase its stock of cash by credit, it can increase its stock ofgoods for sale, and then it has nothing to do but to find a market tosell at; and this we have done in all parts of the world, still by theforce of our stocks being so increased.Thus, credit raising stock at home, that stock enables us to give creditabroad; and thus the quantity of goods which we make, and which isinfinitely increased at home, enables us to find or force a vent abroad.This is apparent, our home trade having so far increased ourmanufacture, that England may be said to be able almost to clothe thewhole world; and in our carrying on the foreign trade wholly upon theEnglish stocks, giving credit to almost all the nations of the world;for it is evident, our stocks lie at this time upon credit in thewarehouses of the merchants in Spain and Portugal, Holland and Germany,Italy and Turkey; nay, in New Spain and Brazil.The exceeding quantity of goods thus raised in England cannot besupposed to be the mere product of the solid wealth and stocks of theEnglish people; we do not pretend to it; the joining those stocks to thevalue of goods, always appearing in England in the hands of themanufacturers, tradesmen, and merchants, and to the wealth which appearsin shipping, in stock upon land, and in the current coin of the nation,would amount to such a prodigy of stock, as not all Europe could pretendto.But all this is owing to the prodigious thing called credit, the extentof which in the British trade is as hard to be valued, as the benefit ofit to England is really not to be described. It must be likewise said,to the honour of our English tradesman, that they understand how tomanage the credit they both give and take, better than any othertradesmen in the world; indeed, they have a greater opportunity toimprove it, and make use of it, and therefore may be supposed to be moreready in making the best of their credit, than any other nations are.Hence it is that we frequently find tradesmen carrying on a prodigioustrade with but a middling stock of their own, the rest being all managedby the force of their credit; for example, I have known a man in aprivate warehouse in London trade for forty thousand pounds a-yearsterling, and carry on such a return for many years together, and nothave one thousand pounds' stock of his own, or not more--all the resthas been carried on upon credit, being the stocks of other men runningcontinually through his hands; and this is not practised now and then,as a great rarity, but is very frequent in trade, and may be seen everyday, as what in its degree runs through the whole body of the tradesmenin England.[43]Every tradesman both gives and takes credit, and the new mode of settingit up over their shop and warehouse doors, in capital letters, _No trustby retail_, is a presumption in trade; and though it may have beenattempted in some trades, was never yet brought to any perfection; andmost of those trades, who were the forwardest to set it up, have beenobliged to take it down again, or act contrary to it in their business,or see some very good customers go away from them to other shops, who,though they have not brought money with them, have yet good foundationsto make any tradesmen trust them, and who do at proper times makepayments punctual enough.On the contrary, instead of giving no trust by retail, we see veryconsiderable families who buy nothing but on trust; even bread, beer,butter, cheese, beef, and mutton, wine, groceries, &c, being the thingswhich even with the meanest families are generally sold for ready money.Thus I have known a family, whose revenue has been some thousandsa-year, pay their butcher, and baker, and grocer, and cheesemonger, by ahundred pounds at a time, and be generally a hundred more in each oftheir debts, and yet the tradesmen have thought it well worth while totrust them, and their pay has in the end been very honest and good.This is what I say brings land so much in debt to trade, and obliges thetradesman to take credit of one another; and yet they do not lose by itneither, for the tradesmen find it in the price, and they take care tomake such families pay warmly for the credit, in the rate of theirgoods; nor can it be expected it should be otherwise, for unless theprofit answered it, the tradesman could not afford to be so long withouthis money.This credit takes its beginning in our manufactures, even at the veryfirst of the operation, for the master manufacturer himself begins it.Take a country clothier, or bay-maker, or what other maker of goods youplease, provided he be one that puts out the goods to the making; it istrue that the poor spinners and weavers cannot trust; the first spin fortheir bread, and the last not only weave for their bread, but they haveseveral workmen and boys under them, who are very poor, and if theyshould want their pay on Saturday night, must want their dinner onSunday; and perhaps would be in danger of starving with their families,by the next Saturday.But though the clothier cannot have credit for spinning and weaving, hebuys his wool at the stapler's or fellmonger's, and he gets two or threemonths' credit for that; he buys his oil and soap of the countryshopkeeper, or has it sent down from his factor at London, and he getslonger credit for that, and the like of all other things; so that aclothier of any considerable business, when he comes to die, shallappear to be L4000 or L5000 in debt.But, then, look into his books, and you shall find his factor atBlackwell Hall, who sells his cloths, or the warehouse-keeper who sellshis duroys and druggets, or both together, have L2000 worth of goods inhand left unsold, and has trusted out to drapers, and mercers, andmerchants, to the value of L4000 more; and look into his workhouse athome, namely, his wool-lofts, his combing-shop, his yarn-chamber, andthe like, and there you will find it--in wool unspun, and in yarn spun,and in wool at the spinners', and in yarn at and in the looms at theweavers'; in rape-oil, gallipoli oil, and perhaps soap, &c, in hiswarehouses, and in cloths at the fulling-mill, and in his rowing-shops,finished and unfinished, L4000 worth of goods more; so that, though thisclothier owed L5000 at his death, he has nevertheless died in goodcircumstances, and has L5000 estate clear to go among his children, allhis debts paid and discharged. However, it is evident, that at the verybeginning of this manufacturer's trade, his L5000 stock is made L10,000,by the help of his credit, and he trades for three times as much in theyear; so that L5000 stock makes L10,000 stock and credit, and thattogether makes L30,000 a-year returned in trade.When you come from him to the warehouse-keeper in London, there youdouble and treble upon it, to an unknown degree; for the Londonwholesale man shall at his death appear to have credit among the countryclothiers for L10,000 or L15,000, nay, to L20,000, and yet have kept upan unspotted credit all his days.When he is dead, and his executors or widow come to look into things,they are frightened with the very appearance of such a weight of debts,and begin to doubt how his estate will come out at the end of it. Butwhen they come to cast up his books and his warehouse, they find,In debts abroad, perhaps   L30,000In goods in his warehouse  L12,000So that, in a word, the man has died immensely rich; that is to say,worth between L20,000 and L30,000, only that, having been a longstandard in trade, and having a large stock, he drove a very greatbusiness, perhaps to the tune of L60,000 or L70,000 a-year; so that, ofall the L30,000 owing, there may be very little of it delivered abovefour to six months, and the debtors being many of them considerablemerchants, and good paymasters, there is no difficulty in getting inmoney enough to clear all his own debts; and the widow and childrenbeing left well, are not in such haste for the rest but that it comes intime enough to make them easy; and at length it all comes in, or withbut a little loss.As it is thus in great things, it is the same in proportion with small;so that in all the trade of England, you may reckon two-thirds of itcarried on upon credit; in which reckoning I suppose I speak much withincompass, for in some trades there is four parts of five carried on so,and in some more.All these things serve to show the infinite value of which credit is tothe tradesman, as well as to trade itself; and it is for this reason Ihave closed my instructions with this part of the discourse. Credit isthe choicest jewel the tradesman is trusted with; it is better thanmoney many ways; if a man has L10,000 in money, he may certainly tradefor L10,000, and if he has no credit, he cannot trade for a shillingmore.But how often have we seen men, by the mere strength of their credit,trade for ten thousand pounds a-year, and have not one groat of realstock of their own left in the world! Nay, I can say it of my ownknowledge, that I have known a tradesman trade for ten thousand poundsa-year, and carry it on with full credit to the last gasp, then die, andbreak both at once; that is to say, die unsuspected, and yet, when hisestate has been cast up, appear to be five thousand pounds worse thannothing in the world: how he kept up his credit, and made good hispayments so long, is indeed the mystery, and makes good what I saidbefore, namely, that as none trade so much upon credit in the world, sonone know so well how to improve and manage credit to their realadvantage, as the English tradesmen do; and we have many examples of it,among our bankers especially, of which I have not room to enter at thistime into the discourse, though it would afford a great many divertingparticulars.[44]I have mentioned on several occasions in this work, how nice and howdainty a dame this credit is, how soon she is affronted and disobliged,and how hard to be recovered, when once distasted and fled; particularlyin the story of the tradesman who told his friends in a publiccoffee-house that he was broke, and should shut up his shop the nextday. I have hinted how chary we ought to be of one another's credit, andthat we should take care as much of our neighbour tradesman's credit aswe would of his life, or as we would of firing his house, and,consequently, the whole street.Let me close all with a word to the tradesman himself, that if it be sovaluable to him, and his friends should be all so chary of injuring hisreputation, certainly he should be very chary of it himself. Thetradesman that is not as tender of his credit as he is of his eyes, orof his wife and children, neither deserves credit, nor will long bemaster of it.As credit is a coy mistress, and will not easily be courted, so she is amighty nice touchy lady, and is soon affronted; if she is ill used, sheflies at once, and it is a very doubtful thing whether ever you gain herfavour again.Some may ask me here, 'How comes it to pass, since she is so nice andtouchy a lady, that so many clowns court and carry her, and so manyfools keep her so long?' My answer is, that those clowns have yet goodbreeding enough to treat her civilly; he must be a fool indeed that willgive way to have his credit injured, and sit still and be quiet-thatwill not bustle and use his utmost industry to vindicate his ownreputation, and preserve his credit.But the main question for a tradesman in this case, and which I have notspoken of yet, is, 'What is the man to do to preserve his credit? Whatare the methods that a young tradesman is to take, to gain a good shareof credit in his beginning, and to preserve and maintain it when it isgained?'[45]Every tradesman's credit is supposed to be good at first. He that beginswithout credit, is an unhappy wretch of a tradesman indeed, and may besaid to be broke even before he sets up; for what can a man do, who byany misfortune in his conduct during his apprenticeship, or by some illcharacter upon him so early, begins with a blast upon his credit? Myadvice to such a young man would be, not to set up at all; or if he did,to stay for some time, till by some better behaviour, either as ajourneyman, or as an assistant in some other man's shop or warehouse, hehad recovered himself; or else to go and set up in some other place ortown remote from that where he has been bred; for he must have a greatassurance that can flatter himself to set up, and believe he shallrecover a lost reputation.But take a young tradesman as setting up with the ordinary stock, thatis to say, a negative character, namely, that he has done nothing tohurt his character, nothing to prejudice his behaviour, and to givepeople a suspicion of him: what, then, is the first principle on whichto build a tradesman's reputation? and what is it he is to do?The answer is short. Two things raise credit in trade, and, I may say,they are the only things required; there are some necessary addenda, butthese are the fundamentals.1. Industry. 2. Honesty.I have dwelt upon the first; the last I have but a few words to say to,but they will be very significant; indeed, that head requires nocomment, no explanations or enlargements: nothing can support credit, beit public or private, but honesty; a punctual dealing, a general probityin every transaction. He that once breaks through his honesty, violateshis credit--once denominate a man a knave, and you need not forbid anyman to trust him.Even in the public it appears to be the same thing. Let any man view thepublic credit in its present flourishing circumstances, and compare itwith the latter end of the years of King Charles II. after the Exchequerhad been shut up, parliamentary appropriations misapplied, and, in aword, the public faith broken; who would lend? Seven or eight per cent,was given for anticipations in King William's time, though no new fraudhad been offered, only because the old debts were unpaid; and how hardwas it to get any one to lend money at all!But, after by a long series of just and punctual dealing, the Parliamentmaking good all the deficient funds, and paying even those debts forwhich no provision was made, and the like, how is the credit restored,the public faith made sacred again, and how money flows into theExchequer without calling for, and that at three or four per cent.interest, even from foreign countries as well as from our own people!They that have credit can never want money; and this credit is to beraised by no other method, whether by private tradesmen, or publicbodies of men, by nations and governments, but by a general probity andan honest punctual dealing.The reason of this case is as plain as the assertion; the cause is initself; no man lends his money but with an expectation of receiving itagain with the interest. If the borrower pays it punctually withouthesitations and defalcations, without difficulties, and, above all,without compulsion, what is the consequence?--he is called an honestman, he has the reputation of a punctual fair dealer. And whatthen?--why, then, he may borrow again whenever he will, he may take upmoney and goods, or anything, upon his bare words, or note; when anotherman must give bondsmen, or _mainprize_, that is, a pawn or pledge forsecurity, and hardly be trusted to neither. This is credit.It is not the quality of the person would give credit to his dealing;not kings, princes, emperors, it is all one; nay, a private shopkeepershall borrow money much easier than a prince, if the credit of thetradesman has the reputation of being an honest man. Not the crownitself can give credit to the head that wears it, if once he that wearsit comes but to mortgage his honour in the matter of payment of money.Who would have lent King Charles II. fifty pounds on the credit of hisword or bond, after the shutting up the Exchequer? The royal word wasmade a jest of, and the character of the king was esteemed a flutteringtrifle, which no man would venture upon, much less venture his moneyupon.In King William's time the case was much the same at first; though theking had not broken his credit then with any man, yet how did they breaktheir faith with the whole world, by the deficiency of the funds, thegiving high and ruinous interest to men almost as greedy as vultures,the causing the government to pay great and extravagant rates for whatthey bought, and great premiums for what they borrowed--these were theinjuries to the public for want of credit; nor was it in the power ofthe whole nation to remedy it; on the contrary, they made it still growworse and worse, till, as above, the parliament recovered it. And howwas it done? Not but by the same method a private person must do thesame, namely, by doing justly, and fairly, and honestly, by every body.Thus credit began to revive, and to enlarge itself again; and usury,which had, as it were, eaten up mankind in business, declined, and sothings came to their right way again.The case is the same with a tradesman; if he shuffles in payment,bargains at one time, and pays at another, breaks his word and hishonour in the road of his business, he is gone; no man will take hisbills, no man will trust him.The conclusion is open and clear: the tradesman cannot be too careful ofhis credit, he cannot buy it too dear, or be too careful to preserve it:it is in vain to maintain it by false and loose doing business; bybreaking faith, refusing to perform agreements, and such shufflingthings as those; the greatest monarch in Europe could not so preservehis credit.Nothing but probity will support credit; just, and fair, and honourabledealings give credit, and nothing but the same just, and fair, andhonourable dealings will preserve it.FOOTNOTES:[42] [How strikingly was this proved in the last war, when the Britishgovernment obtained credit for no less than six hundred millions toconduct warlike operations, and by these means was ultimatelyvictorious.][43] [The author's praises of credit must be received with caution. Ifhis descriptions of the credit system of his own day are true, animprovement has since taken place, as business neither is nor can be nowcarried on to such an extent upon credit--a circumstance that redoundsto the advantage of all parties.][44] [Defoe speaks of such cases as if there were something laudable inthem, whereas it is obviously for the interest of all honest traders,that no such men should be allowed to carry on business.][45] [Defoe almost appears in this place to lay capital out of thequestion, and to represent credit as all in all. Credit is a matter ofgreat consequence; but we must not attempt to carry on business by itsmeans alone. It should only be considered as an aid to capital. Thosewho, without capital, endeavour to set up in business by means ofcredit, or, when capital is exhausted, attempt to struggle on by meansof credit alone, will, in general, only have a life of anxiety anddispeace for their pains.]CHAPTER XXVOF THE TRADESMAN'S PUNCTUAL PAYING HIS BILLS AND PROMISSORY NOTES UNDERHIS HAND, AND THE CREDIT HE GAINS BY ITAs I said that credit is maintained by just and honourable dealing, sothat just dealing depends very much upon the tradesman's punctualpayment of money in all the several demands that are upon him. Theordinary demands of money upon a tradesman are--I. Promises of money for goods bought at time.II. Bills drawn upon him; which, generally speaking, are from thecountry, that is to say, from some places remote from where he lives.Or,III. Promissory notes under his hand, which are passed oftentimes uponbuying goods: bought also at time, as in the first head.IV. Bonds bearing interest, given chiefly for money borrowed at runninginterest.1. Promises of money for goods bought at time. This indeed is theloosest article in a tradesman's payments; and it is true that atradesman's credit is maintained upon the easiest terms in this case ofany other that belongs to trade; for in this case not one man in twentykeeps to his time; and so easy are tradesmen to one another, that ingeneral it is not much expected, but he that pays tolerably well, andwithout dunning, is a good man, and in credit; shall be trusted anywhere, and keeps up a character in his business: sometimes he payssooner, sometimes later, and is accounted so good a customer, thatthough he owes a great deal, yet he shall be trusted any where, and isas lofty and touchy if his credit be called in question, as if he paidall ready money.And, indeed, these men shall often buy their goods as cheap upon thecredit of their ordinary pay, as another man shall that brings his moneyin his hand; and it is reasonable it should be so, for the ready-moneyman comes and buys a parcel here and a parcel there, and comes butseldom, but the other comes every day, that is to say, as often as hewants goods, buys considerably, perhaps deals for two or three thousandpounds a-year with you, and the like, and pays currently too. Such acustomer ought indeed to be sold as cheap to, as the other chancecustomer for his ready money. In this manner of trade, I say, credit ismaintained upon the easiest terms of any other, and yet here thetradesman must have a great care to keep it up too; for though it be theeasiest article to keep up credit in, yet even in this article thetradesman may lose his credit, and then he is undone at once; and thisis by growing (what in the language of trade is called) long-winded,putting off and putting off continually, till he will bear dunning; thenhis credit falls, his dealer that trusted him perhaps a thousand poundspreviously, that esteemed him as good as ready money, now grows sick ofhim, declines him, cares not whether he deals with him or no, and atlast refuses to trust him any longer. Then his credit is quite sunk andgone, and in a little after that his trade is ruined and the tradesmantoo; for he must be a very extraordinary tradesman that can open hisshop after he has outlived his credit: let him look which way he will,all is lost, nobody cares to deal with him, and, which is still worse,nobody will trust him.2. Bills drawn upon him from the country, that is to say, from someplaces remote from where he now dwells: it is but a little while agosince those bills were the loosest things in trade, for as they couldnot be protested, so they would not (in all their heats) always sue forthem, but rather return them to the person from whom they received them.In the meantime, let the occasion be what it will, the tradesman oughton all occasions to pay these notes without a public recalling andreturning them, and without hesitation of any kind whatsoever. He thatlets his bills lie long unpaid, must not expect to keep his credit muchafter them.Besides, the late law for noting and protesting inland bills, alters thecase very much. Bills now accepted, are protested in form, and, if notpunctually paid, are either returned immediately, or the person on whomthey are drawn is liable to be sued at law; either of which is at best ablow to the credit of the acceptor.A tradesman may, without hurt to his reputation, refuse to accept abill, for then, when the notary comes he gives his reasons, namely, thathe refuses to accept the bill for want of advice, or for want of effectsin his hands for account of the drawer, or that he has not given ordersto draw upon him; in all which cases the non-acceptance touches thecredit of the drawer; for in trade it is always esteemed a dishonourablething to draw upon any man that has not effects in his hands to answerthe bill; or to draw without order, or to draw and not give advice ofit; because it looks like a forwardness to take the remitter's moneywithout giving him a sufficient demand for it, where he expects andought to have it.A tradesman comes to me in London, and desires me to give him a billpayable at Bristol, for he is going to the fair there, and being to buygoods there, he wants money at Bristol to pay for them. If I give him abill, he pays me down the money upon receipt of it, depending upon mycredit for the acceptance of the bill. If I draw this bill where I haveno reason to draw it, where I have no demand, or no effects to answerit, or if I give my correspondent no advice of it, I abuse the remitter,that is, the man whose money I take, and this reflects upon my creditthat am the drawer, and the next time this tradesman wants money atBristol fair, he will not come to me. 'No,' says he, 'his last billswere not accepted.' Or, if he does come to me, then he demands that heshould not pay his money till he has advice that my bills are accepted.But, on the other hand, if bills are right drawn, and advice duly given,and the person has effects in his hands, then, if he refuses the bill,he says to the notary he does not accept the bill, but gives no reasonfor it, only that he says absolutely, 'I will not accept it--you maytake that for an answer;' or he adds, 'I refuse to accept it, forreasons best known to myself.' This is sometimes done, but this does notleave the person's credit who refuses, so clear as the other, thoughperhaps it may not so directly reflect upon him; but it leaves the casea little dubious and uncertain, and men will be apt to write back to theperson who sent the bill to inquire what the drawer says to it, and whataccount he gives, or what character he has upon his tongue for theperson drawn upon.As the punctual paying of bills when accepted, is a main article in thecredit of the acceptor, so a tradesman should be very cautious inpermitting men to draw upon him where he has not effects, or does notgive order; for though, as I said, it ought not to affect his reputationnot to accept a bill where it ought not to be drawn, yet a tradesmanthat is nice of his own character does not love to be always or oftenrefusing to accept bills, or to have bills drawn upon him where he hasno reason to accept them, and therefore he will be very positive inforbidding such drawing; and if, notwithstanding that, the importunitiesof the country tradesman oblige him to draw, the person drawn upon willgive smart and rough answers to such bills; as particularly, 'I refuseto accept this bill, because I have no effects of the drawer's to answerit.' Or thus, 'I refuse to accept this bill, because I not only gave noorders to draw, but gave positive orders not to draw.' Or thus, 'Ineither will accept this bill, nor any other this man shall draw;' andthe like. This thoroughly clears the credit of the acceptor, andreflects grossly on the drawer.And yet, I say, even in this case a tradesman does not care to be drawnupon, and be obliged to see bills presented for acceptance, and forpayment, where he has given orders not to draw, and where he has noeffects to answer.It is the great error of our country manufacturers, in many, if not inmost, parts of England at this time, that as soon as they can finishtheir goods, they hurry them up to London to their factor, and as soonas the goods are gone, immediately follow them with their bills for themoney, without waiting to hear whether the goods are come to a market,are sold, or in demand, and whether they are likely to sell quickly ornot; thus they load the factor's warehouse with their goods before theyare wanted, and load the factor with their bills, before it is possiblethat he can have gotten cash in his hand to pay them.This is, first, a direct borrowing money of their factor; and it isborrowing, as it were, whether the factor will lend or no, and sometimeswhether he can or no. The factor, if he be a man of money, and answerstheir bills, fails not to make them pay for advancing; or sells thegoods to loss to answer the bills, which is making them pay dear for theloan; or refuses their bills, and so baulks both their business andtheir credit.But if the factor, willing to oblige his employers, and knowing he shallotherwise lose their commission, accepts the bills on the credit of thegoods, and then, not being able to sell the goods in time, is also madeunable to pay the bills when due--this reflects upon his credit, thoughthe fault is indeed in the drawer whose effects are not come in; andthis has ruined many an honest factor.First, it has hurt him by drawing large sums out of his cash, for thesupply of the needy manufacturer, who is his employer, and has therebymade him unable to pay his other bills currently, even of such men'sdrafts who had perhaps good reason to draw.Secondly, it keeps the factor always bare of money, and wounds hisreputation, so that he pays those very bills with discredit, which injustice to himself he ought not to pay at all, and the borrower has themoney, at the expense of the credit of the lender; whereas, indeed, thereproach ought to be to him that borrows, not to him that lends--to himthat draws where there are no effects to warrant his draft, not to himthat pays where he does not owe.But the damage lies on the circumstances of accepting the bill, for thefactor lends his employer the money the hour he accepts the bill, andthe blow to his credit is for not paying when accepted. When the bill isaccepted, the acceptor is debtor to the person to whom the bill ispayable, or in his right to every indorser; for a bill of exchange is inthis case different from a bond, namely, that the right of action istransferable by indorsement, and every indorser has a right to sue theacceptor in his own name, and can transfer that right to another;whereas in a bond, though it be given to me by assignment, I must sue inthe name of the first person to whom the bond is payable, and he may atany time discharge the bond, notwithstanding my assignment.Tradesmen, then, especially such as are factors,[46] are unaccountablyto blame to accept bills for their employers before their goods aresold, and the money received, or within reach: if the employers cannotwait, the reproach should lie on them, not on the factor; and, indeed,the manufacturers all over England are greatly wrong in that part oftheir business; for, not considering the difference between a time ofdemand and a time of glut, a quick or a dead market, they go on in thesame course of making, and, without slackening their hands as toquantity, crowd up their goods, as if it were enough to them that thefactor had them, and that they were to be reckoned as sold when theywere in his hands: but would the factor truly represent to them thestate of the market--that there are great quantities of goods in handunsold, and no present demand, desiring them to slack their hands alittle in making; and at the same time back their directions in a plainand positive way, though with respect too, by telling them they couldaccept no more bills till the goods were sold. This would bring thetrade into a better regulation, and the makers would stop their handswhen the market stopped; and when the merchant ceased to buy, themanufacturers would cease to make, and, consequently, would not crowd orclog the market with goods, or wrong their factors with bills.But this would require a large discourse, and the manufacturers'objections should be answered, namely, that they cannot stop, that theyhave their particular sets of workmen and spinners, whom they areobliged to keep employed, or, if they should dismiss them, they couldnot have them again when a demand for goods came, and the marketsrevived, and that, besides, the poor would starve.These objections are easy to be answered, though that is not my presentbusiness; but thus far it is to my purpose--it is the factor's businessto keep himself within compass: if the goods cannot be sold, the makermust stay till they can; if the poor must be employed, the manufactureris right to keep them at work if he can; but if he cannot, withoutoppressing the factor, then he makes the factor employ them, nothimself; and I do not see the factor has any obligation upon him toconsider the spinners and weavers, especially not at the expense of hisown credit, and his family's safety.Upon the whole, all tradesmen that trade thus, whether by commissionfrom the country, or upon their own accounts, should make it thestanding order of their business not to suffer themselves to beoverdrawn by their employers, so as to straiten themselves in theircash, and make them unable to pay their bills when accepted. It is alsoto be observed, that when a tradesman once comes to suffer himself to bethus overdrawn, and sinks his credit in kindness to his employer, hebuys his employment so dear as all his employer can do for him can neverrepay the price.And even while he is thus serving his employer, he more and more woundshimself; for suppose he does (with difficulty) raise money, and, aftersome dunning, does pay the bills, yet he loses in the very doing it, forhe never pays them with credit, but suffers in reputation by every day'sdelay. In a word, a tradesman that buys upon credit, that is to say, ina course of credit, such as I have described before, may let themerchant or the warehouse-keeper call two or three times, and may puthim off without much damage to his credit; and if he makes them stay onetime, he makes it up again another, and recovers in one good paymentwhat he lost in two or three bad ones.But in bills of exchange or promissory notes, it is quite another thing;and he that values his reputation in trade should never let a bill cometwice for payment, or a note under his hand stay a day after it is due,that is to say, after the three days _of grace,_ as it is called. Thosethree days, indeed, are granted to all bills of exchange, not by law,but by the custom of trade: it is hard to tell how this customprevailed, or when it began, but it is one of those many instances whichmay be given, where custom of trade is equal to an established law; andit is so much a law now in itself, that no bill is protested now, tillthose three days are expired; nor is a bill of exchange esteemed duetill the third day; no man offers to demand it, nor will any goldsmith,or even the bank itself, pay a foreign bill sooner. But that by the way.Bills of exchange being thus sacred in trade, and inland bills being (bythe late law for protesting them, and giving interest and damage uponthem) made, as near as can be, equally sacred, nothing can be of moremoment to a tradesman than to pay them always punctually and honourably.Let no critic cavil at the word _honourably_, as it relates to trade:punctual payment is the honour of trade, and there is a word always usedamong merchants which justifies my using it in this place; and that is,when a merchant draws a bill from abroad upon his friend at London, hiscorrespondent in London answering his letter, and approving his drawingupon him, adds, that he shall be sure to _honour_ his bill when itappears; that is to say, to accept it.Likewise, when the drawer gives advice of his having drawn such a billupon him, he gives an account of the sum drawn, the name of the personit is payable to, the time it is drawn at, that is, the time given forpayment, and he adds thus--'I doubt not your giving my bill duehonour;' that is, of accepting it, and paying it when it is due.This term is also used in another case in foreign trade only, namely--amerchant abroad (say it be at Lisbon, or Bourdeaux) draws a bill of L300sterling upon his correspondent at London: the correspondent happens tobe dead, or is broke, or by some other accident the bill is notaccepted; another merchant on the Exchange hearing of it, and knowing,and perhaps corresponding with, the merchant abroad who drew the bill,and loth his credit should suffer by the bill going back protested,accepts it, and pays it for him. This is called accepting it for thehonour of the drawer; and he writes so upon the bill when he accepts it,which entitles him to re-draw the same with interest upon the drawer inLisbon or Bourdeaux, as above.This is, indeed, a case peculiar to foreign commerce, and is not oftenpractised in home trade, and among shopkeepers, though sometimes I haveknown it practised here too: but I name it on two accounts, first--tolegitimate the word honourable, which I had used, and which has its duepropriety in matters of trade, though not in the same acceptation as itgenerally receives in common affairs; and, secondly, to let thetradesman see how deeply the honour, that is, the credit of trade, isconcerned in the punctual payment of bills of exchange, and the like ofpromissory notes; for in point of credit there is no difference, thoughin matter of form there is.There are a great many variations in the drawing bills from foreigncountries, according as the customs and usages of merchants direct, andaccording as the coins and rates of exchange differ, and according asthe same terms are differently understood in several places; as the word_usance_, and _two usance,_ which is a term for the number of days givenfor payment, after the date of the bill; and though this is a thingparticularly relating to merchants, and to foreign commerce, yet as thenature of bills of exchange is pretty general, and that sometimes aninland tradesman, especially in seaport towns, may be obliged to takeforeign accepted bills in payment for their goods; or if they have moneyto spare (as sometimes it is an inland tradesman's good luck to have),may be asked to discount such bills--I say, on this account, and thatthey may know the value of a foreign bill when they see it, and how farit has to run, before it has to be demanded, I think it not foreign tothe case before me, to give them the following account:--1. As to the times of payment of foreign bills of exchange, and theterms of art ordinarily used by merchants in drawing, and expressed inthe said bills: the times of payment are, as above, either--(1.) At sight; which is to be understood, not the day it is presented,but three days (called days of grace) after the bill is accepted: (2.)usance: (3.) two usance.[47]Usance between London and all the towns in the States Generals'dominions, and also in the provinces now called the Austrian Netherlands[Belgium], is one month. And two usance is two months; reckoning notfrom the acceptance of the bill, but from the date of it. Usance betweenLondon and Hamburgh is two months, Venice is three months; and doubleusance, or two usance, is double that time. Usance payable at Florenceor Leghorn, is two months; but from thence payable at London, usance isthree months. Usance from London to Rouen or Paris, is one month; butthey generally draw at a certain number of days, usually twenty-onedays' sight. Usance from London to Seville, is two months; as likewisebetween London and Lisbon, and Oporto, to or from. Usance from Genoa toRome is payable at Rome ten days after sight. Usance between Antwerp andGenoa, Naples or Messina, is two months, whether to or from. Usance fromAntwerp or Amsterdam, payable at Venice, is two months, payable in bank.There are abundance of niceties in the accepting and paying of bills ofexchange, especially foreign bills, which I think needless to enter uponhere; but this I think I should not omit, namely--That if a man pays a bill of exchange before it is due, though he hadaccepted it, if the man to whom it was payable proves a bankrupt afterhe has received the money, and yet before the bill becomes due, theperson who voluntarily paid the money before it was due, shall be liableto pay it again to the remitter; for as the remitter delivered his moneyto the drawer, in order to have it paid again to such person as heshould order, it is, and ought to be, in his power to divert the paymentby altering the bill, and make it payable to any other person whom hethinks fit, during all the time between the acceptance and the day ofpayment.This has been controverted, I know, in some cases, but I have alwaysfound, that by the most experienced merchants, and especially in placesof the greatest business abroad, it was always given in favour of theremitter, namely, that the right of guiding the payment is in him, allthe time the bill is running; and no bill can or ought to be paid beforeit is due, without the declared assent of the remitter, signified underhis hand, and attested by a public notary. There are, I say, abundanceof niceties in the matter of foreign exchanges, and in the manner ofdrawing, accepting, and protesting bills; but as I am now speaking with,and have confined my discourse in this work to, the inland tradesmen ofEngland, I think it would be as unprofitable to them to meddle withthis, as it would be difficult to them to understand it.[48]I return, therefore, to the subject in hand, as well as to the people towhom I have all along directed my discourse.Though the inland tradesmen do not, and need not, acquaint themselveswith the manner of foreign exchanges, yet there is a great deal ofbusiness done by exchange among ourselves, and at home, and in which ourinland trade is chiefly concerned; and as this is the reason why I speakso much, and repeat it so often to the tradesman for whose instruction Iam writing, that he should maintain the credit of his bills, so it maynot be amiss to give the tradesman some directions concerning suchbills.He is to consider, that, in general, bills pass through a number ofhands, by indorsation from one to another, and that if the bill comesto be protested afterwards and returned, it goes back again through allthose hands with this mark of the tradesman's disgrace upon it, namely,that it has been accepted, but that the man who accepted it is not ableto pay it, than which nothing can expose the tradesman more.He is to consider that the grand characteristic of a tradesman, and bywhich his credit is rated, is this of paying his bills well or ill. Ifany man goes to the neighbours or dealers of a tradesman to inquire ofhis credit, or his fame in business, which is often done upon almostevery extraordinary occasion, the first question is, 'How does he payhis bills?' As when we go to a master or mistress to inquire thecharacter of a maid-servant, one of the first questions generally is ofher probity, 'Is she honest?' so here, if you would be able to judge ofthe man, your first question is, 'What for a paymaster is he? How doeshe pay his bills?'--strongly intimating, and, indeed, very reasonably,that if he has any credit, or any regard to his credit, he will be sureto pay his bills well; and if he does not pay his bills well, he cannotbe sound at bottom, because he would never suffer a slur there, if itwere possible for him to avoid it. On the other hand, if a tradesmanpays his bills punctually, let whatever other slur be upon hisreputation, his credit will hold good. I knew a man in the city, whoupon all occasions of business issued promissory notes, or notes underhis hand, at such or such time, and it was for an immense sum of moneythat he gave out such notes; so that they became frequent in trade, andat length people began to carry them about to discount, which lessenedthe gentleman so much, though he was really a man of substance, that hisbills went at last at twenty per cent, discount or more; and yet thisman maintained his credit by this, that though he would always take asmuch time as he could get in these notes, yet when they came due theywere always punctually paid to a day; no man came twice for his money.This was a trying case, for though upon the multitude of his notes thatwere out, and by reason of the large discount given upon them, hiscredit at first suffered exceedingly, and men began to talk verydubiously of him, yet upon the punctual discharge of them when due, itbegan presently to be taken notice of, and said openly how well he paidhis notes; upon which presently the rate of his discount fell, and in ashort time all his notes were at _par_; so that punctual payment, inspite of rumour, and of a rumour not so ill grounded as rumoursgenerally are, prevailed and established the credit of the person, whowas indeed rich at bottom, but might have found it hard enough to havestood it, if, as his bills had a high discount upon them, they had beenill paid too. All which confirms what I have hitherto alleged, namely,of how much concern it is for a tradesman to pay his bills andpromissory notes very punctually.I might argue here how much it is his interest to do so, and how itenables him to coin as many bills as he pleases--in short, a man whosenotes are currently paid, and the credit of whose bills is establishedby their being punctually paid, has an infinite advantage in trade; heis a bank to himself; he can buy what bargains he pleases; no advantagein business offers but he can grasp at it, for his notes are current asanother man's cash; if he buys at time in the country, he has nothing todo but to order them to draw for the money when it is due, and he gainsall the time given in the bills into the bargain.If he knows what he buys, and how to put it off, he buys a thousandpounds' worth of goods at once, sells them for less time than he buysat, and pays them with their own money. I might swell this discourse toa volume by itself, to set out the particular profit that such a man maymake of his credit, and how he can raise what sums he will, by buyinggoods, and by ordering the people whom he is to pay in the country, todraw bills on him. Nor is it any loss to those he buys of, for as allthe remitters of money know his bills, and they are currently paid, theynever scruple delivering their money upon his bills, so that thecountryman or manufacturer is effectually supplied, and the time givenin the bill is the property of the current dealer on whom they aredrawn.But, then, let me add a caution here for the best of tradesmen not toneglect--namely, as the tradesman should take care to pay his bills andnotes currently, so, that he may do it, he must be careful what notes heissues out, and how he suffers others to draw on him. He that is carefulof his reputation in business, will also be cautious not to let any manhe deals with over draw him, or draw upon him before the money drawn forhis due. And as to notes promissory, or under his hand, he is carefulnot to give out such notes but on good occasions, and where he has theeffects in his hand to answer them; this keeps his cash whole, andpreserves his ability of performing and punctually paying when the notesbecome due; and the want of this caution has ruined the reputation of atradesman many times, when he might otherwise have preserved himself inas good credit and condition as other men.All these cautions are made thus needful on account of that one usefulmaxim, that the tradesman's _all_ depends upon his punctual complyingwith the payment of his bills.FOOTNOTES:[46] [By factors, Defoe seems to mean the class of persons whom we nowname commission-agents.][47] [All bills and promissory notes, inland or foreign, payable in thiscountry, are allowed three days of grace beyond the actual periodexpressed upon them; thus, a bill drawn at thirty days after date, ispayable only on the thirty-third day. If bills be not presented forpayment on the last day of grace, they cannot be protested, andconsitute only an evidence of the debt for legal recovery. If the lastday of grace be a Sunday, the bill is presentible on the Saturdayprevious.][48] [In consequence of the great extension of commerce since the timeof Defoe, a short explanation of the principle and practice of drawingforeign bills of exchange now seems necessary. Foreign bills of exchangeare used, in order to avoid the necessity of transmitting actual moneyfrom one country to another. A merchant, for instance, in Nova Scotia,is owing L100 to a manufacturer in Glasgow: he seeks out some one who isa creditor to that amount to some person in Britain; we shall say hefinds a captain in the army who wishes to draw L100 from his agent inLondon. To this captain the Nova Scotia merchant pays L100, and gets hisorder or bill on the London agent, which bill he sends to themanufacturer in Glasgow, and the manufacturer transmits the bill toLondon for payment; any banker, indeed, will give him the money for it,deducting a small commission. Thus two debts are liquidated, without thetransmission of a farthing in money. The demand for bills in foreigncountries to send to Great Britain, has the effect of raising them to apremium, which is called the rate of exchange, and is a burden whichfalls on the purchaser of the bill. Foreign bills of exchange drawn onparties in Great Britain, have expressed upon them the number of daysafter sight at which they are to be payable. Thus, a merchant onreceiving a foreign bill drawn at 'thirty days after sight,' hastens toget it 'sighted,' or shown to the party on whom it is drawn, and thatparty accepts it, at the same time marking the date of doing so. Thebill is then complete and negociable, and is presented for payment tothe acceptor at the end of the time specified, allowing the usual threedays of grace. Should the bill not be accepted on being 'sighted,' it isa dishonoured bill, and is returned with a legal protest to the foreigncorrespondent. To avert, as far as possible, the loss of foreign billsby shipwreck, a set of three bills is drawn for each transaction, calledfirst, second, and third, of the same tenor. For example: 'Thirty daysafter sight pay this my first bill of exchange, for the sum of L100sterling; second and third of the same tenor being unpaid.' This firstbill is first sent, and by next conveyance the second is sent. Shouldthe first arrive safely, the second, on making its appearance, isdestroyed. The third is retained by the foreign correspondent till hehear whether the former two have arrived at their destination, and issent only if they have been lost. On receiving whichever comes first, itis the duty of the receiver to communicate intelligence of the fact tothe sender.]End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Complete English Tradesman (1839ed.), by Daniel Defoe*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ENGLISH TRADESMAN ******** This file should be named 14444.txt or 14444.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/4/4/4/14444/Produced by Steven Gibbs and the Online Distributed Proofreading TeamUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Butnotwithstanding his application to study, and all the efforts he wascapable of making, such was his propensity to gaining, that he wasoften stript of all his money; and his father severely chiding him, andthreatening to abandon him if he did not reform, he wrote a little essayagainst that vice, and presented it to his father, to convince him ofhis resolution against it[2]. But no sooner did his father die, thanbeing unrestrained by paternal authority, he reassumed the practice, andsoon squandered away several thousand pounds.In the latter end of the year 1641 he published a tragedy called theSophy, which was greatly admired, and gave Mr. Waller occasion to sayof our author, 'That he broke out like the Irish rebellion, threescorethousand strong, when no body was aware, nor in the Ieast expected it.'Soon after this he was pricked for high sheriff for the county of Surry,and made governor of Farnham-Castle for the King; but not being wellskilled in military affairs, he soon quitted that post and retired tohis Majesty at Oxford, where he published an excellent poem calledCooper's-hill, often reprinted before and since the restoration, withconsiderable alterations; it has been universally admired by all goodjudges, and was translated into Latin verse, by Mr. Moses Pengry ofOxford.Mr. Dryden speaking of this piece, in his dedication of his RivalLadies, says, that it is a poem, which, for the Majesty of the stile,will ever be the exact standard of good writing, and the noble author ofan essay on human life, bestows upon it the most lavish encomium[3]. Butof all the evidences in its favour, none is of greater authority, ormore beautiful, than the following of Mr. Pope, in his Windsor Forest.  Ye sacred nine, that all my soul possess,  Whose raptures fire me, and whose visions bless;  Bear me, O bear me, to sequester'd scenes,  The bow'ry mazes, and surrounding greens;  To Thames's bank which fragrant breezes fill,  Or where the muses sport on Cooper's-hill.  (On Cooper's hill eternal wreaths shall grow,  While lasts the mountain, or while Thames shall flow.)  I seem thro' consecrated walks to rove,  I hear soft music die along the grove,  Led by the found, I roam from shade to shade,  By god-like poets venerable made:  Here his last lays majestic Denham sung,  There the last numbers flow'd from Cowley's tongue.In the year 1647 he was entrusted by the Queen with a message to theKing, then in the hands of the army, and employed in other affairs,relating to, his Majesty. In his dedication of his poems to Charles II.he observes, that after the delivery of the person of his royal fatherinto the hands of the army, he undertook for the Queen-mother, to getaccess to his Majesty, which he did by means of Hugh Peters; and uponthis occasion, the King discoursed with him without reserve upon thestate of his affairs. At his departure from Hampton-court, says he,'The King commanded me to stay privately in London, to send to him andreceive from him all his letters, from and to all his correspondents, athome and abroad, and I was furnished with nine several cyphers in orderto it. Which I trust I performed with great safety to the persons withwhom we corresponded; but about nine months after being discovered bytheir knowledge of Mr. Cowley's hand, I happily escaped both for myselfand those who held correspondence with me.'In April 1648 he conveyed away James duke of York, then under thetuition of Algernon earl of Northumberland, from St. James's, andcarried him into France, to the prince of Wales and Queenmother.This circumstance is related by Wood, but Clarendon, who is a higherauthority, says, that the duke went off with colonel Bamfield only,who contrived the means of his escape. Not long after, he was sentembassador to the King of Poland, in conjunction with lord Crofts,to whom he addresses a poem written on their journey; from whence hebrought ten thousand pounds for his Majesty, by the decimation of hisScottish subjects there.About the year 1652, he returned into England, and was well received bythe earl of Pembroke at Wilton, and continued with that nobleman about ayear; for his own fortune by the expence he was at during the civil war,and his unconquerable itch of gaming was quite exhausted. From that yearto the restoration, there are no accounts of our author; but as soonas his Majesty returned, he entered upon the office of surveyor of hisMajesty's buildings, in the room of Inigo Jones, deceased; and at thecoronation of King Charles II. was created a knight of the Bath. Uponsome discontent arising from his second marriage he lost his senses,but soon recovering from that disorder, he continued in great esteem atcourt for his poetical writings. In the dedication of his poems to KingCharles II. he tells us that he had been discouraged by King Charles I.from writing verses.'One morning (says he) when I was waiting upon the King at Causham,smiling upon me, he said he could tell me some news of myself, which wasthat he had seen some verses of mine the evening before (being those toSir Robert Fanshaw) and asking me when I made them, I told him two orthree years since; he was pleased to say, that having never seen thembefore, he was afraid I had written them since my return into England;and though he liked them well he would advise me to write no more:alledging, that when men are young, and having little else to do, theymight vent the over-flowings of their fancy that way, but when they werethought fit for more serious employments, if they still persisted inthat course, it would look as if they minded not the way to any better;whereupon I stood corrected as long as I had the honour to wait uponhim.' This is a strong instance of his duty to the King; but no greatcompliment to his Majesty's taste: nor was the public much obliged tothe Monarch for this admonition to our author.But King Charles II being of an humour more sprightly than his father,was a professed encourager of poetry, and in his time a race of witssprung up, unequalled by those of any other reign.This monarch was particularly delighted with the poetry of our author,especially when he had the happiness to wait upon him, in Holland andFlanders; and he was pleased sometimes to give him arguments to writeupon, and divert the evil hours of their banishment, which now and then,Sir John tells us, he acquitted himself not much short of his Majesty'sexpectation.In the year 1688 Sir John Denham died, at his office in Whitehall, andwas interred in Westminster-Abbey, near the tombs of Chaucer, Spenser,and Cowley.Our author's works are,1.

Cato Major of old Age, a Poem: It is taken from the Latin of Tully,though much alter'd from the original, not only by the change of thestile, but by addition and subtraction. Our author tells us, thatintending to translate this piece into prose (where translation ought tobe strict) finding the matter very proper for verse, he took the libertyto leave out what was only necessary, to that age and place, and to takeor add what was proper to this preset age and occasion, by laying thescene clearer and in fewer words, according to the stile and ear of thetimes.26. The Sophy, a Tragedy; the above pieces have been several timesprinted together, in one volume in 12mo. under the Title of Poems andTranslations; with the Sophy, a Tragedy, written by Sir John Denham.Besides these, Wood mentions a Panegyric on his excellency general Monk1659, in one sheet quarto. Though Denham's name is not to it, it isgenerally ascribed to him. A Prologue to his majesty, at the first playrepresented at the Cock-pit in White-hall, being part of that nobleentertainment, which their majesties received, November 19, 1660, fromhis grace the duke of Albemarle. A new Version of the Psalms ofDavid. The True Presbyterian, without Disguise; or, a Character of aPresbyterian's Ways and Actions, London 1680, in half a sheet in folio.In the year 1666 there were printed by stealth, in octavo, certainPoems, intitled Directions to a Painter, in four copies or parts, eachdedicated to King Charles the IId. They were very satyrically writtenagainst several persons engaged in the Dutch war, in 1661. At the end ofthem was a piece entitled Clarendon's Housewarming; and after that hisEpitaph, both containing bitter reflexions against that earl. Sir JohnDenham's name is to these pieces, but they were generally thought tobe written by Andrew Marvel, Esq; a Merry Droll in Charles the IId'sParliaments, but so very honest, that when a minister once called athis lodgings, to tamper with him about his vote, he found him in meanapartments up two pair of stairs, and though he was obliged to send outthat very morning to borrow a guinea, yet he was not to be corrupted bythe minister, but denied him his vote. The printer of these poems beingdiscovered, he was sentenced to stand in the pillory for the same.We have met with no authors who have given any account of the moralcharacter of Sir John Denham, and as none have mentioned his virtues, sowe find no vice imputed to him but that of gaming; to which it appearshe was immoderately addicted. If we may judge from his works, he wasa good-natur'd man, an easy companion, and in the day of danger andtumult, of unshaken loyalty to the suffering interest of his sovereign.His character as a poet is well known, he has the fairest testimoniesin his favour, the voice of the world, and the sanction of the critics;Dryden and Pope praise him, and when these are mentioned, otherauthorities are superfluous.We shall select as a specimen of Sir John Denham's Poetry, his Elegy onhis much loved and admired friend Mr. Abraham Cowley.  Old mother Wit and nature gave  Shakespear, and Fletcher all they have;  In Spencer and in Johnson art,  Of slower nature, got the start.  But both in him so equal are,  None knows which bears the happiest share.  To him no author was unknown,  Yet what he wrote was all his own:  He melted not the ancient gold,  Nor, with Ben Johnson, did make bold.  To plunder all the Roman stores  Of poets and of orators.  Horace's  wit, and Virgil's state,  He did not steal, but emulate;  And he would like to them appear,  Their garb, but not their cloaths did wear.  He not from Rome alone but Greece,  Like Johnson, brought the golden fleece.  And a stiff gale, (as Flaccus sings)  The Theban swan extends his wings,  When thro' th' aethereal clouds he flies,  To the same pitch our swan doth rise:  Old Pindar's flights by him new-reach'd,  When on that gale, his wings are stretch'd.[Footnote 1: Ath. Oxon. vol. ii.][Footnote 2: Wood.][Footnote 3: In the preface to 2d edition, 1736, 4to.]       *       *       *       *       *THOMAS KILLEGREW,A Gentleman, who was page of honour to king Charles I. and groom of thebed-chamber to king Charles II. with whom he endured twenty-years exile.During his abode beyond sea, he took a view of France, Italy and Spain,and was honoured by his majesty, with the employment of resident at thestate of Venice, whither he was sent in August 1651. During his exileabroad, he applied his leisure hours to the study of poetry, and thecomposition of Several plays, of which Sir John Denham. in a jocularway takes notice, in his copy of verses on our author's return from hisembassy from Venice.I.  Our resident Tom,  From Venice is come,  And hath left the statesman behind him.  Talks at the same pitch,  Is as wise, is as rich,  And just where you left him, you find him.II.  But who says he was not,  A man of much plot,  May repent that false accusation;  Having plotted, and penn'd  Six plays to attend,  The farce of his negotiation.Killegrew was a man of very great humour, and frequently divertedking Charles II, by his lively spirit of mirth and drollery. He wasfrequently at court, and had often access to king Charles when admissionwas denied to the first peers in the realm. Amongst many other merrystories, the following is related of Killegrew. Charles II, who hatedbusiness as much as he loved pleasure, would often disappoint thecouncil in vouchsafing his royal presence when they were met, by whichtheir business was necessarily delay'd and many of the council muchoffended by the disrespect thrown on them: It happened one day while thecouncil were met, and had sat some time in expectation of his majesty,that the duke of Lauderdale, who was a furious ungovernable man, quittedthe room in a passion, and accidentally met with Killegrew, to whom heexpressed himself irreverently of the king: Killegrew bid his grace becalm, for he would lay a wager of a hundred pounds, that he would makehis majesty come to council in less than half an hour. Lauderdale beinga little heated, and under the influence of surprize, took him at hisword;--Killegrew went to the king, and without ceremony told him whathad happened, and added, "I know that your majesty hates Lauderdale,tho' the necessity of your affairs obliges you to behave civilly to him;now if you would get rid of a man you hate, come to the council, forLauderdale is a man so boundlessly avaricious, that rather than paythe hundred pounds lost in this wager, he will hang himself, and neverplague you more." The king was pleased with the archness of thisobservation, and answered, 'then Killegrew I'll positively go,' whichhe did.--It is likewise related, that upon the king's suffering hismistresses to gain so great an ascendant over him as to sacrifice forthem the interest of the state, and neglect the most important affairs,while, like another Sardanapalus, he wasted his hours in the apartmentsof those enchantresses: Killegrew went one day into his apartmentdress'd like a pilgrim, bent upon a long journey. The king beingsurprized at this extraordinary frolic, asked him the meaning of it,and to what distant country he was going, to which Killegrew bluntlyanswered, the country I seek, may it please your majesty, is hell; andwhat to do there? replies the king? to bring up Oliver Cromwel fromthence, returned the wag, to take care of the English affairs, for hissuccessor takes none.--We cannot particularly ascertain the truthof these relations, but we may venture to assert that these are notimprobable, when it is considered how much delighted king Charles theIId. was with a joke, however severe, and that there was not at court amore likely person to pass them than Killegrew, who from his long exilewith the king, and being about his person, had contracted a kind offamiliarity, which the lustre that was thrown round the prince upon hisrestoration was not sufficient to check.Tho' Sir John Denham mentions but six, our author wrote nine Plays inhis travels, and two at London, amongst which his Don Thomaso, in twoparts, and his Parson's Wedding, will always be valued by good judges,and are the best of his performances. The following is a list of hisplays.1. Bellamira's Dream, or Love of Shadows, a Tragi-Comedy; the first partprinted in folio 1663, written in Venice, and dedicated to the lady MaryVilliers, duchess of Richmond and Lennox.2. Bellamira's Dream, the second part, written in Venice; printed infolio, London 1663, and dedicated to the lady Anne Villiers, countess ofEssex.3. Cicilia and Clorinda, or Love in Arms, a Tragi-comedy; the first partprinted in folio, London, 1663, written in Turin.4. Cicilia and Clorinda, the second part, written at Florence 1651, anddedicated to the lady Dorothy Sidney, countess of Sunderland.5. Claracilla, a Tragi-comedy, printed in folio, London 1663; written atRome, and dedicated to his sister in-law lady Shannon; on this play andanother of the author's called the Prisoners, Mr. Cartwright has writtenan ingenious copy of verses.6. The Parson's Wedding, a Comedy, printed in folio, London 1663;written at Basil in Switzerland. This play was revived at the oldTheatre, at little Lincoln's Inn-Fields, and acted all by women; a newprologue and epilogue, being spoken by Mrs. Marshal in Man's cloaths,which Mr. Langbain says is printed in the Covent-Garden Drollery.This was a miscellaneous production of those times, which bore someresemblance to our Magazines; but which in all probability is now out ofprint.7. The Pilgrim, a Tragedy, printed in folio, London 1663; written inParis in the year 1651, and dedicated to the countess of Carnarvon.8. The Princess, or Love at first Sight, a Tragi-Comedy, printed infolio, London 1663; written at Naples, and dedicated to his niece, thelady Anne Wentworth, wife to lord Lovelace.9. The Prisoners, a Tragi-Comedy, printed in folio; London 1663; writtenat London and dedicated to the lady Crompton.10. Don Thomaso, or the Wanderer, a Comedy in two parts, printed infolio, London 1663; and dedicated to the fair and kind friends of princePalatine Polexander. In the first part of this play, the author hasborrowed several ornaments from Fletcher's play called the Captain. Hehas used great freedom with Ben Johnson, for not only the characters ofLopus, but even the very words are repeated from Johnson's Fox, whereVolpone personates Scoto of Mantua. I don't believe that our authordesigned to conceal his assistance, since he was so just as toacknowledge a song against jealousy, which he borrowed from Mr. ThomasCarew, cup-bearer to king Charles the Ist, and sung in a masque atWhitehall, anno 1633. This Chorus, says he, 'I presume to make use ofhere, because in the first design it was written at my request, upona dispute held between Mrs. Cicilia Crofer and myself, when he waspresent; she being then maid of honour. This I have set down, lest anyman should imagine me so foolish as to steal such a poem, from so famousan author.' If he was therefore so scrupulous in committing depredationsupon Carew, he would be much more of Ben Johnson, whose fame was sosuperior to Carew's. All these plays were printed together in one volumein folio, London 1664.       *       *       *       *       *EDWARD HOWARD, _Esq_;Was descended from the noble family of the earl of Berkshire, and wasmore illustrious by his birth than his genius; he addicted himself tothe study of dramatic poetry, and produced four plays, but gained noreputation by any of them.1. The Man of New-Market, a Comedy, acted at the Theatre-Royal; andprinted in quarto, London 1678.2. Six Days Adventure, or the New Utopia, a Comedy, acted at his royalhighness the duke of York's Theatre, printed in quarto 1671. This playmiscarried in the action, as he himself acknowledges in his preface;and the earl of Rochester, with his usual virulence, writ an invectiveagainst it; but, Mrs. Behn, Mr. Ravenscroft, and some other poets,taking compassion on him, sent the author recommendatory verses, whichare printed before that play, and in return he writ a Pindarique to Mrs.Behn, which she printed in a Collection of Poems 1685.3. The Usurper, a Tragedy, acted at the Theatre-Royal, and printed 1668,in which the character of Damocles, is said to have been drawn forOliver Cromwel, and that the play is a parallel of those times.4. Women's Conquest, a Tragi-Comedy, acted at the Duke's Theatre 1677.Besides these plays, Mr. Howard has published an Epic Poem in octavo,called the British Princes, which the earl of Rochester likewise handledpretty severely. There is likewise ascribed to him another Book ofPoems and Essays, with a Paraphrase on Cicero's Laelius, or Tract ofFriendship, printed in 8vo. The Earl of Dorset, who was called bycotemporary writers, the best good man, with the worst natured Muse,has dedicated a few lines to the damnation of this extraordinary epicproduction of Mr. Howard's.The Spectator observes, that this epic piece is full of incongruity,or in other words, abounds with nonsense. He quotes the two followinglines,  A coat of mail Prince Vortiger had on,  Which from a naked pict his grandsire won.Who does not see the absurdity of winning a coat from a naked man?The earl of Dorset thus addresses him;To Mr. EDWARD HOWARD, on his incomparable, incomprehensible POEM calledthe BRITISH PRINCES.  Come on, ye critics, find one fault who dare,  For, read it backward like a witch's prayer,  'Twill do as well; throw not away your jests  On solid nonsense that abides all tests.  Wit, like tierce-claret, when't begins to pall,  Neglected lies, and's of no use at all,  But, in its full perfection of decay,  Turns vinegar, and comes again in play.  Thou hast a brain, such as it is indeed;  On what else mould thy worm of fancy feed?  Yet in a Filbert I have often known  Maggots survive when all the kernel's gone.  This simile shall stand, in thy defence,  'Gainst such dull rogues as now and then write sense.  Thy style's the same, whatever be thy theme,  As some digestion turns all meat to phlegm.  He lyes, dear Ned, who says, thy brain it barren,  Where deep conceits, like vermin breed in carrion.  Thy stumbling founder'd jade can trot as high  As any other Pegasus can fly.  So the dull Eel moves nimbler in the mud,  Than all the swift-finn'd racers of the flood.  As skilful divers to the bottom fall,  Sooner than those that cannot swim at all,  So in the way of writing, without thinking,  Thou hast a strange alacrity in sinking.  Thou writ'st below ev'n thy own nat'ral parts,  And with acquir'd dulness, and new arts  Of studied nonsense, tak'st kind readers hearts.  Therefore dear Ned, at my advice forbear,  Such loud complaints 'gainst critics to prefer,  Since thou art turn'd an arrant libeller:  Thou sett'st thy name to what thyself do'st write;  Did ever libel yet so sharply bite?       *       *       *       *       *Mrs. APHRA BEHN,A celebrated poetess of the last age, was a gentlewoman by birth, beingdescended, as her life-writer says, from a good family in the city ofCanterbury. She was born in Charles Ist's reign[1], but in what year isnot known. Her father's name was Johnson, whose relation to the lordWilloughby engaged him for the advantageous post of lieutenant generalof Surinam, and six and thirty islands, to undertake a voyage, with hiswhole family, to the West-Indies, at which time our poetess was veryyoung. Mr. Johnson died at sea, in his passage thither; but his familyarrived at Surinam, a place so delightfully situated, and aboundingwith such a vast profusion of beauties, that, according to Mrs. Behn'sdescription, nature seems to have joined with art to render it perfectlyelegant: her habitation in that country, called St. John's Hill, she haschallenged all the gardens in Italy, nay, all the globe of the world, toshew so delightful a recess. It was there our poetess became acquaintedwith the story and person of the American Prince Oroonoko, whoseadventures she has so feelingly and elegantly described in thecelebrated Novel of that name, upon which Mr. Southern has built hisTragedy of Oroonoko, part of which is so entertaining and moving, thatit is almost too much for nature. Mrs. Behn tells us, that she herselfhad often seen and conversed with that great man, and been a witness tomany of his mighty actions, and that at one time, he, and Imoinda hiswife, were scarce an hour in a day from her lodgings; that they eatwith her, and that she obliged them in all things she was capable of,entertaining them with the lives of the Romans and great men, whichcharmed him with her company; while she engaged his wife with teachingher all the pretty works she was mistress of, relating stories of Nuns,and endeavouring to bring her to the knowledge of the true God. Thisintimacy between Oroonoko and Mrs. Behn occasioned some reflexions onher conduct, from which the authoress of her life, already quoted,justified her in the following manner; 'Here, says she, I can addnothing to what she has given the world already, but a vindication ofher from some unjust aspersions I find are insinuated about this town,in relation to that prince. I knew her intimately well, and I believeshe would not have concealed any love affair from me, being one of herown sex, whose friendship and secrecy she had experienced, which makesme assure the world that there was no intrigue between that Prince andAstraea. She had a general value for his uncommon virtues, and whenhe related the story of his woes, she might with the Desdemona ofShakespear, cry out, That it was pitiful, wondrous pitiful, which nevercan be construed into an amour; besides, his heart was too violently seton the everlasting charms of his Imoinda, to be shook with those morefaint (in his eye) of a white beauty; and Astrea's relations therepresent kept too watchful an eye over her, to permit the frailty of heryouth, if that had been powerful enough.' After this lady's return toLondon, she was married to Mr. Behn, a Merchant there, but of Dutchextraction. This marriage strengthening her interest, and, perhaps,restoring her character, gave her an opportunity of appearing withadvantage at court. She gave King Charles II. so accurate and agreeablean account of the colony of Surinam, that he conceived a great opinionof her abilities, and thought her a proper person to be entrusted withthe management of some important affairs, during the Dutch war; whichoccasioned her going into Flanders, and residing at Antwerp. Here, byher political intrigues, she discovered the design formed by the Dutch,of sailing up the river Thames, and burning the English ships in theirharbours, which she communicated to the court of England; but herintelligence, though well grounded, as appeared by the event, being onlylaughed at and slighted, she laid aside all other thoughts of stateaffairs, and amused herself during her stay at Antwerp with thegallantries in that city. But as we have mentioned that she discoveredthe design of the Dutch to burn our ships, it would be injustice to thelady, as well as to the reader, not to give some detail of her mannerof doing it. She made this discovery by the intervention of a Dutchman,whom her life-writer calls by the name of Vander Albert. As anambassador, or negociator of her sex could not take the usual means ofintelligence; of mixing with the multitude, and bustling in the cabalsof statesmen, she fell upon another way, perhaps more efficacious, ofworking by her eyes. This Vander Albert had been in love with her beforeher marriage with Mr. Behn, and no sooner heard of her arrival atAntwerp, than he paid her a visit; and after a repetition of his formervows, and ardent professions for her service, pressed her to receivefrom him some undeniable proofs of the vehemence and sincerity of hispassion, for which he would ask no reward, 'till he had by long andfaithful services convinced her that he deserved it. This proposal wasso suitable to her present aim in the service of her country, that sheaccepted it, and employed Albert in such a manner, as made her veryserviceable to the King. The latter end of the year 1666, he senther word, by a special messenger, that he would be with her at a dayappointed, at which time, he revealed to her, that Cornelius de Wit,who, with the rest of that family, had an implacable hatred to theEnglish nation and the house of Orange, had, with de Ruyter, proposed tothe States the expedition abovementioned. This proposal, concurring withthe advice which the Dutch spies in England had given them, of the totalneglect of all naval preparations, was well received, and was resolvedto be put in execution, as a thing neither dangerous nor difficult.Albert having communicated a secret of this importance, and with suchmarks of truth, that she had no room to doubt of it: as soon as theinterview was at an end, she dispatched an account of what she haddiscovered, to England[2].But we cannot conclude Mrs. Behn's gallantries at Antwerp, without beinga little more particular, as we find her attacked by other lovers, andthought she found means to preserve her innocence, yet the accountthat she herself gives of her affairs there, is both humorous andentertaining.In a letter to a friend she proceeds thus, 'My other lover is abouttwice Albert's age, nay and bulk too, tho' Albert "be not the mostBarbary shape you have seen, you must know him by the name of Van Bruin,and he was introduced to me by Albert his kinsman, and was obliged byhim to furnish me in his absence, with what money and other things Ishould please to command, or have occasion for. This old fellow had notvisited me often, before I began to be sensible of the influence of myeyes upon this old piece of touchwood; but he had not the confidenceto tell me he loved me, and modesty you know is no common fault ofhis countrymen. He often insinuated that he knew a man of wealth andsubstance, though striken indeed in years, and on that account notso agreeable as a younger man, was passionately in love with me, anddesired to know whether my heart was so far engaged, that his friendshould not entertain, any hopes. I replied that I was surprized to heara friend of Albert's making an interest in me for another, and that iflove were a passion, I was any way sensible of, it could never be for anold man, and much to that purpose. But all this would not do, in aday or two I received this eloquent epistle from him." Here Mrs. Behninserts a translation of Van Bruin's letter, which was wrote in French,and in a most ridiculous stile, telling her, he had often strove toreveal to her the tempests of his heart, and with his own mouth scalethe walls of her affections; but terrified with the strength of herfortifications, he concluded to make more regular approaches, to attackher at a farther distance, and try first what a bombardment of letterswould do; whether these carcasses of love thrown into the sconces of hereyes, would break into the midst of her breast, beat down the out-guardof her aversion, and blow up the magazine of her cruelty, that she mightbe brought to a capitulation, and yield upon, reasonable terms. He thenconsiders her as a goodly ship under sail for the Indies; her hair isthe pennants, her fore-head the prow, her eyes the guns, her nose therudder. He wishes he could once see her keel above water, and desiresto be her pilot, to steer thro' the Cape of Good-Hope, to the Indies oflove.Our ingenious poetess sent him a suitable answer to this trulyridiculous and Dutchman like epistle. She rallies him for setting out inso unprofitable a voyage as love, and humorously reckons up the expencesof the voyage; as ribbons, and hoods for her pennants, diamond rings,lockets, and pearl-necklaces for her guns of offence and defence, silks,holland, lawn, cambric, &c. for her rigging.Mrs. Behn tells us she diverted herself with Van Bruin in Albert'sabsence, till he began to assume and grow troublesome to her by hisaddresses, so that to rid himself of him, she was forced to disclose thewhole affair to Albert, who was so enraged that he threatened the deathof his rival, but he was pacified by his mistress, and content toupbraid the other for his treachery, and forbid him the house, but thissays Mrs. Behn, 'produced a very ridiculous scene, for 'my Nestorianlover would not give ground to Albert, but was as high as he, challengedhim to sniker-snee for me, and a thousand things as comical; in shortnothing but my positive command could satisfy him, and on that hepromised no more to trouble me. Sure as he thought himself of me, hewas thunder-struck, when he heard me not only forbid him the house, butridicule all his addresses to his rival Albert; with a countenance fullof despair, he went away not only from my lodgings, but the next dayfrom Antwerp, unable to stay in a place where he had met so dreadful adefeat.'The authoress of her life has given us a farther account of her affairswith Vander Albert, in which she contrived to preserve her honour,without injuring her gratitude. There was a woman at Antwerp, who hadoften given Astraea warning of Albert's fickleness and inconstancy,assuring her he never loved after enjoyment, and sometimes changed evenbefore he had that pretence; of which she herself was an instance;Albert having married her, and deserted her on the wedding-night. Ourpoetess took the opportunity of her acquaintance with this lady to putan honest trick upon her lover, and at the same time do justice to aninjured woman. Accordingly she made an appointment with Albert, andcontrived that the lady whose name was Catalina, should meet him inher stead. The plot succeeded and Catalina infinitely pleased with theadventure, appointed the next night, and the following, till at lasthe discovered the cheat, and resolved to gratify both his love andresentment, by enjoying Astaea even against her will. To this purpose hebribed an elderly gentlewoman, whom Mrs. Behn kept out of charity, toput him to bed drest in her night-cloaths in her place, when Astraea waspassing the evening in a merchant's house in the town. The merchant'sson and his two daughters waited on Astraea home; and to conclude theevening's mirth with a frolick, the young gentleman proposed going tobed to the old woman, and that they should all come in with candles andsurprize them together. As it was agreed so they did, but no sooner wasthe young spark put to bed, but he found himself accosted with ardour,and a man's voice, saying, 'have I now caught thee, thou maliciouscharmer! now I'll not let thee go till thou hast done me justice for allthe wrongs thou hast offered my dealing love.' The rest of the companywere extremely surprized to find Albert in Astraea's bed instead of theold woman, and Albert no less surprized to find the young spark insteadof Astraea. In the conclusion, the old woman was discarded, and Albert'sfury at his disappointment appeased by a promise from Mrs. Behn, ofmarrying him at his arrival in England; but Albert returning to Hollandto make preparations for his voyage to England, died of a Feverat Amsterdam[3]. From this adventure it plainly appears, that theobservation of a Dutchman's not being capable to love is false; for bothAlbert, and the Nestorian wooer, seem to have been warm enough in theiraddresses.After passing some time in this manner at Antwerp, she embarked atDunkirk for England; and in her passage, was near being lost, for theship being driven on the coast, foundered within sight of land, but bythe assistance of boats from the shore, they were all saved; and Mrs.Behn arriving in London, dedicated the rest of her life to pleasure andpoetry. Besides publishing three volumes of miscellany poems, shewrote seventeen plays, and some histories and novels. She translatedFontenelle's History of Oracles, and plurality of worlds, to whichlast she annexed an Essay on Translation, and translated Prose. TheParaphrase of Oenone's, Epistle to Paris, in the English Translationof Ovid's Epistles is Mrs. Behn's; as are the celebrated Love Lettersbetween a Nobleman and his Sister. Her wit gained her the esteem of Mr.Dryden, Mr. Southern, &c. and at the same time the love and addresses ofseveral gentlemen, in particular one, with whom she corresponded underthe name of Lycida, who it seems did not return her passion with equalwarmth, and with the earnestness and rapture, she imagined her beautyhad a right to command.Mrs. Behn died after a long indisposition, April 16, 1689, and wasburied in the cloister of Westminster Abbey. We shall beg leave toexhibit her character, as we find it drawn by some of her cotemporaries,and add a remark of our own. 'Mr. Langbain 'thinks her Memory willbe long fresh among all lovers of dramatic poetry, as having beensufficiently eminent, not only for her theatrical performances; butseveral other pieces both in prose and verse, which gained her an esteemamong the wits almost equal to that of the incomparable Orinda, Mrs.Katherine Phillips.'There are several encomiums on Mrs. Behn prefixed to her lover's watch;among the rest, Mr. Charles Cotton, author of Virgil Travesty, throws inhis mite in her praise; though the lines are but poorly writ. But of allher admirers, Mr. Charles Gildon, who was intimately acquainted with ourpoetess, speaks of her with the highest encomiums.In his epistle dedicatory to her histories and novels, he thus expresseshimself. 'Poetry, the supreme pleasure of the mind, is begot, and bornin pleasure, but oppressed and killed with pain. This reflexion ought toraise our admiration of Mrs. Behn, whose genius was of that force, tomaintain its gaiety in the midst of disappointments, which a woman ofher sense and merit ought never to have met with. But she had a greatstrength of mind, and command of thought, being able to write in themidst of company, and yet have the share of the conversation: which Isaw her do in writing Oroonoko, and other parts of her works, in everypart of which you'll find an easy stile and a peculiar happiness ofthinking. The passions, that of love especially, she was mistress of,and gave us such nice and tender touches of them, that without her namewe might discover the author.' To this character of Mrs. Behn may bevery properly added, that given of her by the authoress of her life andmemoirs, in these words.'She was of a generous humane disposition, something passionate, veryserviceable to her friends in all that was in her power, and couldsooner forgive an injury than do one. She had wit, humour, good-natureand judgment. She was mistress of all the pleasing arts of conversation:She was a woman of sense, and consequently a lover of pleasure. For mypart I knew her intimately, and never saw ought unbecoming the justmodesty of our sex; though more gay and free, than the folly of theprecise will allow.'The authors of the Biographia Brittanica say, that her poetry is none ofthe best; and that her comedies, tho' not without humour, are fullof the most indecent scenes and expressions. As to the first, withsubmission to the authority of these writers, the charge is ill-founded,which will appear from the specimen upon which Dryden himself makesher a compliment; as to the latter, I'm afraid it cannot be so welldefended; but let those who are ready to blame her, consider, that her'swas the sad alternative to write or starve; the taste of the times wascorrupt; and it is a true observation, that they who live to please,must please to live.Mrs. Behn perhaps, as much as any one, condemned loose scenes, and toowarm descriptions; but something must be allowed to human frailty. Sheherself was of an amorous complexion, she felt the passions intimatelywhich she describes, and this circumstance added to necessity, might bethe occasion of her plays being of that cast.  The stage how loosely does Astrea tread,  Who fairly puts, all characters to bed.Are lines of Mr. Pope:And another modern speaking of, the vicissitudes to which the stage issubjected, has the following,  Perhaps if skill could distant times explore,  New Behn's, new Durfey's, yet remain in store,  Perhaps, for who can guess th' effects of chance,  Here Hunt[4] may box, and Mahomet[5] may dance.This author cannot be well acquainted with Mrs. Behn's works, who makesa comparison between them and the productions of Durfey. There are marksof a fine understanding in the most unfinished piece of Mrs. Behn, andthe very worst of this lady's compositions are preferable to Durfey'sbell. It is unpleasing to have the merit of any of the Fair Sexlessened. Mrs. Behn suffered enough at the hands of supercilious prudes,who had the barbarity to construe her sprightliness into lewdness;and because she had wit and beauty, she must likewise be charged withprostitution and irreligion.Her dramatic works are,1, 2.

The History of Oroonoko, or the Royal Slave: This was founded on atrue story, the incidents of which happened during her residence atSurinam. It gave birth to Mr. Southern's celebrated play of that name;who in his dedication of it, speaking of his obligation to Mrs. Behn forthe subject, says,'She had a great command of the stage, and I have often wondered thatshe would bury her favorite hero in a novel, when she might have revivedhim in the scene. She thought either, that no actor could represent him,or she could not bear him represented; and I believe the last, when Iremember what I have heard from a friend of her's, that she always tolda story more feelingly than she writ.'2. The Fair Jilt; or the Amours of Prince Tarquin and Miranda. This islikewise said to be derived from a true story, to a great part of whichshe tells she was an eye witness; and what she did not see, she learnedfrom some of the actors concerned in it, the Franciscans of Antwerp,where the scene is laid.3. The Nun, or the perjured Beauty, a true novel.4. The History of Agnes de Castro.5. The Lover's Watch; or the Art of making love. It is taken from M.Bonnecourte's le Montre, or the Watch.

The reader will distinguish theoriginals from translations, by consulting the 2d and 3d tomes ofRecueil des pieces gallantet, en prose et en verse. Paris 1684.We have observed, that in the English translation of Ovid's Epistles,the paraphrase of Oenone's Epistle to Paris is her's. In the preface tothat work Mr. Dryden pays her this handsome compliment."I was desired to say, that the author, who is of the fair sex,understood not Latin; but if she does not, I'm afraid she has given usoccasion to be ashamed who do."Part of this epistle transcribed will afford a specimen of herverification.  Say lovely youth, why wouldst thou, thus betray,  My easy faith, and lead my heart away.  I might some humble shepherd's choice have been,  Had I not heard that tongue, those eyes not seen;  And in some homely cot, in low repose,  Liv'd undisturb'd, with broken vows and oaths;  All day by shaded springs my flocks have kept,  And in some honest arms, at night have slept.  Then, un-upbraided with my wrongs thou'dit been,  Safe in the joys of the fair Grecian queen.  What stars do rule the great? no sooner you  Became a prince, but you were perjured too.  Are crowns and falsehoods then consistent things?  And must they all be faithless who are Kings?  The gods be prais'd that I was humble born,  Ev'n tho' it renders me my Paris' scorn.  And I had rather this way wretched prove,  Than be a queen, dishonest in my love.[Footnote 1: Memoirs prefixed to her Novels, by a lady.][Footnote 2: Memoires ubi supra.][Footnote 3: Memoirs ubi supra.][Footnote 4: A noted boxer.][Footnote 5: A Turk, famous for his performances on a wire, after themanner of rope-dancers.]       *       *       *       *       *Sir GEORGE ETHEREGE,A Celebrated wit in the reign of Charles and James II. He is said tohave been descended of an ancient family of Oxfordshire, and born aboutthe year 1636; it is thought he had some part of his education at theuniversity of Cambridge, but in his younger years he travelled intoFrance, and consequently made no long stay at the university. Upon hisreturn, he, for some time, studied the Municipal Law at one of the Innsof Court, in which, it seems, he made but little progress, and likeother men of sprightly genius, abandoned it for pleasure, and the gayeraccomplishments.In the year 1664 the town was obliged with his first performance forthe stage, entitled the Comical Revenge, or Love in a Tub, the writingwhereof brought him acquainted, as he himself informed us, with the earlof Dorset, to whom it is by the author dedicated. The fame of this play,together with his easy, unreserved conversation, and happy address,rendered him a favourite with the leading wits, such as the duke ofBuckingham, Sir Charles Sedley, the earl of Rochester, Sir Car Scroop.Being animated by this encouragement, in 1668, he brought another comedyupon the stage, entitled She Would if She Could; which gained him noless applause, and it was expected, that by the continuance of hisstudies, he would polish and enliven the theatrical taste, and be noless constant in such entertainments, than the most assiduous of hiscotemporaries, but he was too much addicted to pleasure, and beingimpelled by no necessity, he neglected the stage, and never writ, tillhe was forced to it, by the importunity of his friends. In 1676, hislast comedy called the Man of Mode, or Sir Fopling Flutter, came on thestage, with the most extravagant success; he was then a servant tothe beautiful duchess of York, of whom Dryden has this very singularexpression, 'that he does not think, that at the general resurrection,she can be made to look more charming than now.' Sir George dedicatesthis play to his Royal Mistress, with the most courtly turns ofcompliment. In this play he is said to have drawn, or to use the moderncant, taken off, some of the cotemporary coxcombs; and Mr. Dryden, inan Epilogue to it, has endeavoured to remove the suspicion of personalsatire, and says, that the character of Flutter is meant to ridiculenone in particular, but the whole fraternity of finished fops, theidolaters of new fashions.His words are,  True fops help nature's work, and go to school,  To file and finish God Almighty's fool:  Yet none Sir Fopling, him, or him, can call,  He's Knight o'th' Shire, and represents you all.But this industry, to avoid the imputation of personal satire, butserved to heighten it; and the town soon found out originals to hischaracters. Sir Fopling was said to be drawn for one Hewit, a beau ofthose times, who, it seems, was such a creature as the poet ridiculed,but who, perhaps, like many other coxcombs, would never have beenremembered, but for this circumstance, which transmits his memory toposterity.The character of Dorimant was supposed to represent the earl ofRochester, who was inconstant, faithless, and undetermined in hisamours; and it is likewise said, in the character of Medley, that thepoet has drawn out some sketch of himself, and from the authority of Mr.Bowman, who played Sir Fopling, or some other part in this comedy, itis said, that the very Shoemaker in Act I. was also meant for a realperson, who, by his improvident courses before, having been unableto make any profit by his trade, grew afterwards, upon the publicexhibition of him, so industrious and notable, that he drew a crowd ofthe best customers to him, and became a very thriving tradesman. Whetherthe poet meant to display these characters, we cannot now determine, butit is certain, the town's ascribing them to some particular persons, waspaying him a very high compliment; and if it proved no more, it at leastdemonstrated, a close imitation of nature, a beauty which constitutesthe greatest perfection of a comic poet.Our author, it seems, was addicted to some gay extravagances, such asgaming, and an unlicensed indulgence in women and wine, which broughtsome satirical reflexions, upon him. Gildon in his Lives of the DramaticPoets, says, that upon marrying a fortune, he was knighted; thecircumstances of it are these: He had, by his gaming and extravagance,so embarrassed his affairs, that he courted a rich widow in order toretrieve them; but she being an ambitious woman, would not condescend tomarry him, unless he could make her a lady, which he was obliged todo by the purchase of a knighthood; and this appears in a ConsolataryEpistle to captain Julian, from the duke of Buckingham, in, which thismatch is reflected on. We have no account of any issue he had by thislady, but from the information of Mr. Bowman we can say, that hecohabited, for some time, with the celebrated Mrs. Barry the actress,and had one daughter by her; that he settled 5 or 6000 l. on her, butthat she died young.From the same intelligence, it also appears, that Sir George was, in hisperson, a fair[1], slender, genteel man, but spoiled his countenancewith drinking, and other habits of intemperance. In his deportment hewas very affable and courteous, of a generous disposition, which, withhis free, lively, and natural vein of writing, acquired him the generalcharacter of gentle George, and easy Etherege, in respect of whichqualities, we often find him compared to Sir Charles Sedley. His courtlyand easy behaviour so recommended him to the Duchess of York, thatwhen on the accession of King James II. she became Queen, she sent himambassador abroad, Gildon says, to Hamburgh; but it is pretty evident,that he was in that reign a minister at Ratisbon, at least, from theyear 1686, to the time his majesty left this kingdom, if not later, butit appears that he was there, by his own letters wrote from thence tothe earl of Middleton.After this last comedy, we meet with no more he ever wrote for thestage; however, there are preserved some letters of his in prose,published among a collection of Familiar Letters, by John earl ofRochester; two of which, sent to the duke of Buckingham, have particularmerit, both for the archness of the turns, and the acuteness of theobservations. He gives his lordship a humorous description of some ofthe Germans, their excessive drunkenness; their plodding stupidity andostensive indelicacy; he complains that he has no companion in that partof the world, no Sir Charles Sedleys, nor Buckinghams, and what is stillworse, even deprived of the happiness of a mistress, for, the womenthere, he says, are so coy, and so narrowly watched by their relations,that there is no possibility of accomplishing an intrigue. He mentions,however, one Monsieur Hoffman, who married a French lady, with whom hewas very great, and after the calamitous accident of Mr. Hoffman's beingdrowned, he pleasantly describes the grief of the widow, and the methodshe took of removing her sorrow, by an attempt in which he succeeded.These two letters discover the true character of Etherege, as well asof the noble person to whom they were sent, and mark them as greatlibertines, in speculation as in practice.As for the other compositions of our author, they consist chiefly oflittle airy sonnets, smart lampoons, and smooth panegyrics. All that wehave met with more than is here mentioned, of his writing in prose, isa short piece, entitled An Account of the Rejoicing at the Diet ofRatisbon, performed by Sir George Etherege, Knight, residing there fromhis Majesty of Great Britain, upon Occasion of the Birth of the Princeof Wales; in a Letter from himself, printed in the Savoy 1688. When ourauthor died, the writers of his life have been very deficient; Gildonsays, that after the Revolution, he followed his master into France, anddied there, or very soon after his arrival in England from thence. Butthere was a report (say the authors of the Biograph. Brit. which theyreceived from an ingenious gentleman) 'that Sir George came to anuntimely death, by an unlucky accident at Ratisbon, for, after havingtreated some company with a liberal entertainment at his house there,when he had taken his glass too freely, and, being through his greatcomplaisance too forward, in waiting on his guests at their departure,flushed as he was, he tumbled down stairs, and broke his neck, and sofell a martyr to jollity and civility.'One of the earliest of our author's lesser poems, is that addressed toher Grace the Marchioness of Newcastle, after reading her poems, and asit is esteemed a very elegant panegyric, we shall give the conclusion ofit as a specimen.  While we, your praise, endeavouring to rehearse,  Pay that great duty in our humble verse;  Such as may justly move your anger, now,  Like Heaven forgive them, and accept them too.  But what we cannot, your brave hero pays,  He builds those monuments we strive to raise;  Such as to after ages shall make known,  While he records your deathless fame his own:  So when an artist some rare beauty draws,  Both in our wonder there, and our applause.  His skill, from time secures the glorious dame,  And makes himself immortal in her fame.Besides his Songs, little panegyrical Poems and Sonnets, he wrote twoSatires against Nell Gwyn, one of the King's mistresses, though there isno account how a quarrel happened between them; the one is called MadamNelly's Complaint, beginning,  If Sylla's ghost made bloody Cat'line start.The other is called the Lady of Pleasure, with; its Argument at the Headof it, whereof the first line is,  The life of Nelly truly shewn.Sir George spent a life of ease, pleasure, and affluence, at leastnever was long, nor much, exposed to want. He seems to have possesseda sprightly genius, to have had an excellent turn for comedy, and veryhappy in a courtly dialogue. We have no proof of his being a scholar,and was rather born, than made a poet. He has not escaped the censure ofthe critics; for his works are so extremely loose and licentious, as torender them dangerous to young, unguarded minds: and on this account ourwitty author is, indeed, justly liable to the severest censure of thevirtuous, and sober part of mankind.[Footnote 1: Biogr. Brit. p. 1844.]       *       *       *       *       *THE LIFE OFWILLIAM MOUNTFORD.This gentleman, who was very much distinguished as a player, was born inthe year 1659, but of what family we have no account, farther than thatthey were of Staffordshire; the extraordinary circumstances of Mr.Mountford's death, have drawn more attention upon him, than he mightotherwise have had; and though he was not very considerable as a poet,yet he was of great eminence as an actor. Mr. Cibber, in his Apology forhis own Life, has mentioned him with the greatest respect, and drawn hischaracter with strong touches of admiration. After having delineatedthe theatrical excellences of Kynaston, Sandford, &c. he thus speaks ofMountford. 'Of person he was tall, well made, fair, and of an agreeableaspect, his voice clear, full, and melodious; in tragedy he was themost affecting lover within my memory; his addresses had a resistlessrecommendation from the very tone of his voice, which gave his wordssuch softness, that as Dryden says,  --'Like flakes of feather'd snow,  'They melted as they fell.All this he particularly verified in that scene of Alexander, wherethe hero throws himself at the feet of Statira for pardon of his pastinfidelities. There we saw the great, the tender, the penitent, thedespairing, the transported, and the amiable, in the highest perfection.In comedy he gave the truest life to what we call the fine gentleman;his spirit shone the brighter for being polished by decency. In scenesof gaiety he never broke into the regard that was due to the presenceof equal, or superior characters, tho' inferior actors played them; hefilled the stage, not by elbowing and crossing it before others, ordisconcerting their action, but by surpassing them in true and masterlytouches of nature; he never laughed at his own jest, unless the pointof his raillery upon another required it; he had a particular talentin giving life to bons mots and repartees; the wit of the poet seemedalways to come from him extempore, and sharpened into more wit from hisbrilliant manner of delivering it; he had himself a good share of it,or what is equal to it, so lively a pleasantness of humour, that wheneither of these fell into his hands upon the stage, he wantoned withthem to the highest delight of his auditors. The agreeable was sonatural to him, that even in that dissolute character of the Rover, heseemed to wash off the guilt from vice, and gave it charms and merit;for though it may be a reproach to the poet to draw such characters, notonly unpunished, but rewarded, the actor may still be allowed his duepraise in his excellent performance; and this was a distinction which,when this comedy was acted at Whitehall, King William's Queen Marywas pleased to make in favour of Mountford, notwithstanding herdisapprobation of the play; which was heightened by the considerationof its having been written by a lady, viz. Mrs. Behn, from whom moremodesty might have been expected.'He had, besides all this, a variety in his genius, which few capitalactors have shewn, or perhaps have thought it any addition of theirmerit to arrive at; he could entirely change himself, could at oncethrow off the man of sense, for the brisk, vain, rude, lively coxcomb,the false, flashy pretender to wit, and the dupe of his own sufficiency;of this he gave a delightful instance, in the character of Sparkish, inWycherley's Country Wife: in that of Sir Courtly Nice, by Crown, hisexcellence was still greater; there his whole man, voice, mien, andgesture, was no longer Mountford, but another person; there, theinsipid, soft civility, the elegant and formal mien, the drawlingdelicacy of voice, the stately flatness of his address, and the emptyeminence of his attitudes, were so nicely observed, that had he not beenan entire matter of nature, had he not kept his judgment, as it were acentinel upon himself, not to admit the least likeness of what he usedto be, to enter into any part of his performance, he could not possiblyhave so compleatly finished it.'Mr. Cibber further observes, that if, some years after the death ofMountford, he himself had any success in those parts, he acknowledgesthe advantages he had received from the just idea, and strongimpressions from Mountford's acting them.' 'Had he been remembered (sayshe) when I first attempted them, my defects would have been more easilydiscovered, and consequently my favourable reception in them must havebeen very much, and justly abated. If it could be remembered, how muchhe had the advantage of me in voice and person, I could not here besuspected of an affected modesty, or overvaluing his excellence; for hesung a clear, counter-tenor, and had a melodious, warbling throat,which could not but set off the last scene of Sir Courtly with uncommonhappiness, which I, alas! could only struggle through, with the faintexcuses, and real confidence of a fine singer, under the imperfection ofa feigned, and screaming treble, which, at least, could only shew you.what I would have done, had nature been more favourable to me.'This is the amiable representation which Mr. Cibber makes of his oldfavourite, and whose judgment in theatrical excellences has been everindisputed. But this finished performer did not live to reap theadvantages which would have arisen from the great figure he made uponthe stage.He fell in the 33d year of his age, by the hand of an assassin, whocowardly murdered him, and slid from justice. As we imagine it will notbe unpleasing to the reader to be made acquainted with the most materialcircumstances relating to that affair, we mail here insert them, as theyappear on the trial of lord Mohun, who was arraigned for that murder,and acquitted by his peers. Lord Mohun, it is well known, was a man ofloose morals, a rancorous spirit, and, in short, reflected no honour onhis titles. It is a true observation, that the temper and disposition ofa man may be more accurately known by the company he keeps, than by anyother means of reading the human heart: Lord Mohun had contracted agreat intimacy with one captain Hill, a man of scandalous morals, anddespicable life, and was so fond of this fellow, whom, it seems, naturehad wonderfully formed to be a cut throat, that he entered into hisschemes, and became a party in promoting his most criminal pleasures.This murderer had long entertained a passion for Mrs. Bracegirdle, sowell known, as an excellent actress, and who died not many years ago,that it would be superfluous to give a particular account of her; hispassion was rejected with disdain by Mrs. Bracegirdle, who did not thinksuch a heart as his worth possessing. The contempt with which sheused captain Hill fired his resentment; he valued himself for being agentleman, and an officer in the army, and thought he had a right, atthe first onset, to triumph over the heart of an actress; but in this hefound himself miserably mistaken: Hill, who could not bear the contemptshewn him by Mrs. Bracegirdle, conceived that her aversion must proceedfrom having previously engaged her heart to some more favoured lover;and though Mr. Mountford was a married man, he became jealous of him,probably, from no other reason, than the respect with which he observedMr. Mountford treat her, and their frequently playing together in thesame scene. Confirmed in this suspicion, he resolved to be revenged onMountford, and as he could not possess Mrs. Bracegirdle by gentle means,he determined to have recourse to violence, and hired some ruffians toassist him in carrying her off. His chief accomplice in this scheme waslord Mohun, to whom he communicated his intention, and who concurredwith him in it. They appointed an evening for that purpose, hired anumber of soldiers, and a coach, and went to the playhouse in order tofind Mrs. Bracegirdle, but she having no part in the play of that night,did not come to the house. They then got intelligence that she was gonewith her mother to sup at one Mrs. Page's in Drury-Lane; thither theywent, and fixed their post, in expectation of Mrs. Bracegirdle's comingout, when they intended to have executed their scheme against her. Sheat last came out, accompanied with her mother and Mr. Page: the twoadventurers made a sign to their hired bravo's, who laid their hands onMrs. Bracegirdle: but her mother, who threw her arms round her waist,preventing them from thrusting her immediately into the coach, and Mr.Page gaining time to call assistance, their attempt was frustrated, andMrs. Bracegirdle, her mother, and Mr. Page, were safely conveyed to herown house in Howard-street in the Strand. Lord Mohnn and Hill, enragedat this disappointment, resolved, since they were unsuccessful in onepart of their design, they would yet attempt another; and that nightvowed revenge against Mr. Mountford.They went to the street where Mr. Mountford lived, and there lay in waitfor him: Old Mrs. Bracegirdle and another gentlewoman who had heard themvow revenge against Mr. Mountford, sent to his house, to desire his wifeto let him know his danger, and to warn him not to come home that night,but unluckily no messenger Mrs. Mountford sent was able to find him:Captain Hill and lord Mohun paraded in the streets with their swordsdrawn; and when the watch made enquiry into the cause of this, lordMohun answered, that he was a peer of the realm, and dared them to touchhim at their peril; the night-officers being intimidated at this threat,left them unmolested, and went their rounds. Towards midnight Mr.Mountford going home to his own house was saluted in a very friendlymanner, by lord Mohun; and as his lordship seemed to carry no marks ofresentment in his behaviour, he used the freedom to ask him, how he camethere at that time of night? to which his lordship replied, by asking ifhe had not heard the affair of the woman? Mountford asked what woman? towhich he answered Mrs. Bracegirdle; I hope, says he, my lord, you do notencourage Mr. Hill in his attempt upon Mrs. Bracegirdle; which howeveris no concern of mine; when he uttered these words, Hill, behindhis back, gave him some desperate blows on his head, and before Mr.Mountford had time to draw, and stand on his defence, he basely run himthro' the body, and made his escape; the alarm of murder being given,the constable seized lord Mohun, who upon hearing that Hill had escapedexpressed great satisfaction, and said he did not care if he were hangedfor him: When the evidences were examined at Hicks's-Hall, one Mr.Bencroft, who attended Mr. Mountford, swore that Mr. Mountford declaredto him as a dying man, that while he was talking to lord Mohun, Hillstruck him, with his left hand, and with his right hand run him thro'the body, before he had time to draw his sword.Thus fell the unfortunate Mountford by the hand of an assassin, withouthaving given him any provocation; save that which his own jealousy hadraised, and which could not reasonably be imputed to Mountford as acrime.Lord Mohun, as we have already observed, was tried, and acquitted byhis peers; as it did not appear, that he immediately assisted Hill, inperpetrating the murder, or that they had concerted it before; for tho'they were heard to vow revenge against Mountford, the word murther wasnever mentioned. It seems abundantly clear, that lord Mohun, however,if not active, was yet accessary to the murther; and had his crime beenhigh treason, half the evidence which appeared against him, might havebeen sufficient to cost him his head. This nobleman himself was killedat last in a duel with the duke of Hamilton.[1]Mr. Mountford, besides his extraordinary talents as an actor, is authorof the following dramatic pieces.1. The Injured Lovers, or the Ambitious Father, a Tragedy, acted at theTheatre-Royal 1688, dedicated to James earl of Arran, son to the duke ofHamilton.2. The Successful Strangers, a Tragi-Comedy, acted at the Theatre-Royal1690; dedicated to lord Wharton. The plot is taken from the RivalBrothers, in Scarron's Novels.3. Greenwich-Park, a Comedy, acted at the Theatre-Royal 1691; dedicatedto Algernon earl of Essex.Besides these, he turned the Life and Death of Dr. Faustus into a Farce,with the Humours of Harlequin and Scaramouch, acted at thequeen's theatre in Dorset-Garden, and revived at the Theatre inLincoln's-Inn-Fields 1697.Mr. Mountford has written many Prologues and Epilogues, scattered inDryden's Miscellanies; and likewise several Songs. He seems to have hada sprightly genius, and possessed a pleasing gaiety of humour.--He waskilled in the year 1692; and was buried in St. Clement Danes.[Footnote 1: The foundation of the quarrel between lord Mohun and theduke (however it might be improved by party suggestions) was a law suitbetween these noblemen, on account of part of the earl of Macclesfield'sestate, which Mr. Savage would have been heir to, had not his mother, tofacilitate her designed divorce from that earl (with the pleasing viewof having her large fortune restored to her, and the no less pleasingprospect of being freed from an uncomfortable husband) declared unhappySavage to be illegitimate, and natural son of the then earl Rivers. Ofthis farther notice will be taken in Savage's Life.]       *       *       *       *       *THOMAS SHADWELL.This celebrated poet laureat was descended of a very antient family inStaffordshire; the eldest branch of which has enjoyed an estate thereof five-hundred pounds per ann. He was born about the year 1640, atStanton-Hall in Norfolk, a seat of his father's, and educated at CaiusCollege in Cambridge[1], where his father had been likewise bred; andthen placed in the middle Temple, to study the law; where havingspent some time, he travelled abroad. Upon his return home he becameacquainted with the most celebrated persons of wit, and distinguishedquality, in that age; which was so much addicted to poetry and politeliterature, that it was not easy for him, who had no doubt a nativerelish for the same accomplishments, to abstain from these thefashionable studies and amusements of those times. He applied himselfchiefly to the dramatic kind of writing, in which he had considerablesuccess. At the revolution, Mr. Dryden, who had so warmly espoused theopposite interest, was dispossessed of his place of Poet Laureat, andMr. Shadwell succeeded him in it, which employment he possessed till hisdeath. Mr. Shadwell has been illustrious, for nothing so much as thequarrel which subsisted between him and Dryden, who held him in thegreatest contempt. We cannot discover what was the cause of Mr.Dryden's aversion to Shadwell, or how this quarrel began, unless it wasoccasioned by the vacant Laurel being bellowed on Mr. Shadwell: But itis certain, the former prosecuted his resentment severely, and, inhis Mac Flecknoe, has transmitted his antagonist to posterity in noadvantageous light. It is the nature of satire to be biting, but itis not always its nature to be true: We cannot help thinking that Mr.Dryden has treated Shadwell a little too unmercifully, and hasviolated truth to make the satire more pungent. He says, in the pieceabovementioned,  Others to some saint meaning make pretence,  But Shadwell never deviates into sense.Which is not strictly true. There are high authorities in favour of manyof his Comedies, and the best wits of the age gave their testimony forthem: They have in them fine strokes of humour, the characters are oftenoriginal, strongly mark'd, and well sustained; add to this, that he hadthe greatest expedition in writing imaginable, and sometimes produceda play in less than a month. Shadwell, as it appears from Rochester'sSession of the Poets, was a great favourite with Otway, and as theylived, in intimacy together, it might perhaps be the occasion ofDryden's expressing so much contempt for Otway; which his coolerjudgment could never have directed him to do.Mr. Shadwell died the 19th of December 1692, in the fifty-second yearof his age, as we are informed by the inscription upon his monument inWestminster Abbey; tho' there may be some mistake in that date; for itis said in the title page of his funeral sermon preached by Dr. NicholasBrady, that he was interred at Chelsea, on the 24th of November, thatyear. This sermon was published 1693, in quarto, and in it Dr. Bradytells us, 'That our author was 'a man of great honesty and integrity,an inviolable fidelity and strictness in his word, an unalterablefriendship wherever he professed it, and however the world maybemistaken in him, he had a much deeper sense of religion than many whopretended more to it. His natural and acquired abilities, continues theDr. made him very amiable to all who knew and conversed with him, a veryfew being equal in the becoming qualities, which adorn, and fit off acomplete gentleman; his very enemies, if he have now any left, willgive him this character, at least if they knew him so thoroughly as Idid.--His death seized him suddenly, but he could not be unprepared,since to my certain knowledge he never took a dose of opium, but hesolemnly recommended himself to God by prayer.'When some persons urged to the then lord chamberlain, that there wereauthors who had better pretensions to the Laurel; his lordship replied,'He did not pretend to say how great a poet Shadwell might be, but wassure he was an honest man.'Besides his dramatic works, he wrote several other pieces of poetry; thechief of which are his congratulatory poem on the Prince of Orange'scoming to England; another on queen Mary; his translation of the 10thSatire of Juvenal, &c. Shadwell in his Comedies imitated Ben Johnson,and proposed him as his model of excellence, with what degree of successwe shall not take upon us to determine, but proceed to give an accountof his plays.1. The Sullen Lovers, or the Impertinent, a Comedy; acted at the duke'stheatre, dedicated to William duke of Newcastle: the dedication is datedSeptember 1st, 1668.2. The Humorist, a Comedy; acted by his royal highest servants,dedicated to Margaret duchess of Newcastle.3. The Royal Shepherdess, a Tragi-Comedy; acted by the duke of York'sservants, printed at London 1669, in quarto. This play was originallywritten by Mr. Fountain of Devonshire, but altered throughout by Mr.Shadwell.4. The Virtuoso, a Comedy; acted at the duke's theatre, printed atLondon 1676, in quarto, dedicated to the duke of Newcastle.Mr. Langbaine observes, that no body will deny this play its dueapplause; at least I know, says he, that the university of Oxford, whomay be allowed competent judges of comedy, especially such characters asSir Nicholas Gimcrack, and Sir Formal Trifle, applauded it. And as noman ever undertook to discover the frailties of such pretenders to thiskind of knowledge before Mr. Shadwell, so none since Johnson's time,ever drew so many different characters of humour, and with such success.5. Pysche, a Tragedy; acted at the duke's theatre, printed in London1675 in 4to, and dedicated to the duke of Monmouth. In the preface hetell us, that this play was written in five weeks.6. The Libertine, a Tragedy; acted by his royal highness's servants,printed in London 1676, in quarto, and dedicated to the duke ofNewcastle. In the preface Mr. Shadwell observes, that the story fromwhich he took the hint of this play, is famous all over Spain, Italy,and France. It was first used in a Spanish play, the Spaniards having atradition of such a vicious Spaniard, as is represented in this play;from them the Italian comedians took it; the French borrowed it fromthem, and four several plays have been made upon the story.7. Epsom Wells, a comedy; acted at the duke's theatre; printed at London1676, in 4to, and dedicated to the duke of Newcastle. Mr. Langbainesays, that this is so diverting and so true a comedy, that evenforeigners, who are not in general kind to the wit of our nation, haveextremely commended it.8. The History of Timon of Athens the Manhater; acted at the duke'stheatre, printed at London 1678, in 4to. In the dedication to Georgeduke of Buckingham he observes, that this play was originallyShakespear's, who never made, says he, more masterly strokes than inthis; yet I can truly say, I have made it into a play.9. The Miser, a Comedy; acted at the theatre royal, dedicated tothe earl of Dorset. In the preface our author observes, he took thefoundation of it from Moliere's L'Avare.10. A true Widow, a Comedy; acted at the duke's theatre, printed in1679, in 4to, dedicated to Sir Charles Sidley. The prologue was writtenby Mr. Dryden; for at this time they lived in friendship.11. The Lancashire Witches, and Teague O Divelly, the Irish priest, acomedy; acted at the duke's theatre, printed at London 1682. Our authorhas a long preface to this play, in which he vindicates his piece fromthe charge of reflecting upon the church, and the sacred order. Heapologizes for the magical part, and observes, that he had no hopes ofequaling Shakespear in his fancy, who created his Witches for the mostpart out of his imagination; in which faculty no man ever excelled ledhim, and therefore, says he, I resolve to take mine from authority.12. The Woman Captain, a Comedy; acted by his royal highness's servants.13. The Squire of Alsatia, a Comedy; acted by his Majesty's servants,printed at London 1688, in 4to. and dedicated to the earl of Dorset andMiddlesex.14. Bury-Fair, a Comedy; acted by his Majesty's servants, printedat London 1689 in 4to. and dedicated to the earl of Dorset. In thededication he observes, 'That this play was written during eight monthspainful sickness, wherein all the several days in which he was able towrite any part of a scene amounted not to one month, except some few,which were employed in indispensible business.'15. Amorous Bigot, with the second part of Teague O Divelly, a Comedy,acted by their Majesties servants, printed 1690 in 4to. dedicated toCharles earl of Shrewsbury.16. The Scowerers, a Comedy, acted by their Majesties servants, andprinted in 4to. 1690.17. The Volunteers, or the Stock-Jobbers, a Comedy, acted by theirMajesties servants, dedicated to the Queen by Mrs. Anne Shadwell, ourauthor's widow.In the epilogue the character of Mr. Shadwell, who was then dead, wasgiven in the following lines.  Shadwell, the great support o'th'comic stage,  Born to expose the follies of the age,  To whip prevailing vices, and unite,  Mirth with instruction, profit with delight;  For large ideas, and a flowing pen,  First of our times, and second but to Ben;  Whose mighty genius, and discerning mind,  Trac'd all the various humours of mankind;  Dressing them up, with such successful care  That ev'ry fop found his own picture there.  And blush'd for shame, at the surprising skill,  Which made his lov'd resemblance look so ill.  Shadwell who all his lines from nature drew,  Copy'd her out, and kept her still in view;  Who never sunk in prose, nor soar'd in verse,  So high as bombast, or so low as farce;  Who ne'er was brib'd by title or estate  To fawn or flatter with the rich or great;  To let a gilded vice or folly pass,  But always lash'd the villain and the ass.[Footnote 1: General Dictionary. See the article Shadwell.]       *       *       *       *       *Sir WILLIAM KILLEGREW.The eldest son of Sir Robert Killegrew, Knt. chamberlain to the Queen,was born at the Manor of Hanworth, near Hampton-Court, in the monthof May, 1605. He became a gentleman commoner in St. John's College inMidsummer term 1622; where continuing about three years he travelledbeyond seas, and after his return, was made governor of Pendenniscastle, and of Falmouth haven in Cornwall, with command of the militiain the west part of that county. After this he was called to attend KingCharles I. as one of his gentlemen ushers of his privy chamber; in whichemployment he continued till the breaking out of the great rebellion;and had the command given him of one of the two great troops of horsethat guarded the King's person, during the whole course of the warbetween his Majesty and his Parliament. Our author was in attendanceupon the King when the court resided at Oxford, and was created doctorof the civil laws 1642;[1] and upon the ruin of the King's affairs, hesuffered for his attachment to him, and compounded with the republicansfor his estate.Upon the restoration of King Charles II. he was the first ofhis father's servants that he took any notice of, and made himgentleman-usher of his privy chamber: the same place he enjoyed underthe deceased King. Upon Charles IId's marriage with Donna Catherina ofPortugal, he was created his Majesty's first vice chamberlain, in whichhonourable station he continued twenty-two years.His dramatic works are,1. Orinasdes, or Love and friendship, a tragi-comedy.2. Pandora, or the Converts, a Comedy.3. Siege of Urbin, a Tragi-Comedy.4. Selindra, a Tragi-Comedy.All these plays were printed together in folio, Oxon 1666. There isanother play ascribed to our author, called the Imperial Tragedy,printed in 1699; the chief part was taken out of a Latin play, and muchaltered by him for his own diversion; tho' upon the importunity of hisfriends, he was prevailed upon to publish it, but without his name.The plot is founded upon the history of Zeno, the 12th emperor ofConstantinople after Constantine. Sir William Killegrew's plays havebeen applauded by men very eminent in poetry, particularly Mr. Waller,who addresses a copy of verses to him upon his altering Pandora from atragedy into a comedy, because not approved on the stage.Sir William has also a little poem extant, which was set to music by Mr.Henry Lawes, a man in the highest reputation of any of his profession inhis time. Mr. Wood says, that after our author had retired from court inhis declining age, he wroteThe Artless Midnight Thoughts of a Gentleman at Court; who for manyyears built on sand, which every blast of cross fortune has defaced;but now he has laid new foundations, on the rock of his salvation,&c. London 1684. It is dedicated to King Charles II. and besides 233thoughts in it, there are some small pieces of poetry.Midnight and Daily thoughts in verse and prose, Lond. 1694, withcommendatory verses before it, by H. Briket. He died 1693, and wasburied in Westminster Abbey.[Footnote 1: Wood, Athen. Oxon. vol. 2.]       *       *       *       *       *Sir ROBERT HOWARD.This gentleman was a younger son of Thomas earl of Berkshire, byElizabeth his wife, one of the daughters and coheirs of William lordBurghley, and received his education at Magdalen-college, Oxford, underthe tuition of Dr. E. Drope. During the civil wars, he suffered with therest of his family, who maintained their loyalty to the unfortunate KingCharles I. Upon the restoration, our author was made a knight, and waschosen one of the burgesses for Stockbridge in Hampshire, to servein the Parliament which began at Westminster 8th of May 1661; he wasquickly preferred to the place of auditor of the Exchequer, then worthsome thousand pounds per annum, and was reckoned one of King Charles'screatures, whom he advanced, on account of his faithful services incajoling the Parliament for Money.In the year 1679 he was chosen burgess for Castle-rising in Norfolk,to serve in that Parliament which began at Westminster on the 17thof October 1680. When the revolution was effected, and King Williamascended the throne, he was elected burgess again for Castle-rising, tofit in the Parliament which began the 22d of January 1688, was made oneof the privy council, about the 16th of February took the usual oaths,and commenced from that moment a violent persecutor of the Non-jurors,and disclaimed all manner of conversation and intercourse with any ofthat character. He is said to have been a man extremely positive, and apretender to a more general understanding than he really possessed. Hisobstinacy and pride procured him many enemies, amongst whom the duke ofBuckingham was the first; who intended to have exposed Sir Robert underthe name of Bilboa in the Rehearsal; but the plague which then prevailedoccasioned the theatres to be shut up, and the people of fashion to quitthe town. In this interval he altered his resolution, and levelled hisridicule at a much greater name, under that of Bayes.Thomas Shadwell the poet, tho' a man of the same principles with SirRobert, concerning the revolution and state matters, was yet so angrywith the knight for his supercilious domineering manner of behaving,that he points him out under the name of Sir Positive At All, one of hischaracters in the comedy called the Sullen Lovers, or the Impertinents;and amongst the same persons is the lady Vain, a Courtezan, which thewits then understood to be the mistress of Sir Robert Howard, whom heafterwards thought proper to marry.In February 1692, being then in the decline of life, he married one MrsDives, maid of honour to the Queen. The merit of this author seems tohave been of a low rate, for very little is preserved concerning him,and none of his works are now read; nor is he ever mentioned, but whenthat circumstance of the duke of Buckingham's intending to ridicule him,is talked of.Had Sir Robert been a man of any parts, he had sufficient advantagesfrom his birth and fortune to have made a figure, but the highestnotice which he can claim in the republic of letters, is, that he wasbrother-in-law to Dryden.His works are,Poems, containing a panegyric on the King, and songs and sonnets, Lond.1660, and a panegyric on general Monk.His plays are six in number, viz.1. The Blind Lady, a Comedy.2. The Committee, or the Faithful Irishman, a Comedy, printed folio,London 1665. This comedy is often acted, and the success of it chieflydepends upon the part of Teague being well performed.3. The Great Favourite, or the Duke of Lerma, a Tragi-Comedy, acted atthe theatre-royal 1668. This play was criticised by Mr. Dryden.4. The Indian Queen, a Tragedy.5. Surprizal, a Tragi-comedy, acted at the theatre royal 1665.6. The Vestal Virgin; or the Roman Ladies, a Tragedy, 1665. In hisprologue to this play, Sir Robert has the following couplet, meant as ananswer to Dryden's animadversions on the Duke of Lerma.  This doth a wretched dearth of wit betray,  When things of kind on one another prey.He has written likewise,The History of the Reigns of Edward and Richard II. with Reflections andCharacters on their chief ministers and favourites. As also a comparisonbetween these princes Edward and Richard II. with Edward I. and EdwardIII. London printed 1690.A Letter to Mr. Samuel Johnson, occasioned by a scurrilous pamphlet,entitled, Animadversions on Mr. Johnson's Answer to Jovian, in threeLetters to a country friend, Lond. 1692. At the end of this letter isreprinted the preface before the history of the reigns of Edward andRichard II. before mentioned.The History of Religion, Lond. 1694.The 4th book of Virgil translated into English, which contains the lovesof Dido and AEneas, 1660.Likewise P. Papinius Statius, his Achilles, in five books; to each ofwhich he has subjoined Annotations.       *       *       *       *       *RICHARD FLECKNOEThis poet lived in the reign of King Charles II. and is more remarkablefor having given name to a satire of Mr. Dryden's, than for all his ownworks. He is said to have been originally a jesuit, and to have hadconnexions in consequence thereof, with such persons of distinction inLondon as were of the Roman Catholic persuasion, Langbaine says, hisacquaintance with the nobility was more than with the mules, and he hada greater propensity to rhiming, than genius to poetry.Tho' he wrote several plays, yet he never could obtain the favour tohave more than one of them acted.His dramatic works are:1. Damoiselles a-la-mode, a Comedy, printed 8vo, Lond. 1667, andaddressed to the duke and duchess of Newcastle. This comedy was designedby the author to have been acted by his Majesty's servants, which theythought proper however to refuse, we know not for what reason,--The poetindeed has assigned one, whether true or false is immaterial; but it mayserve to shew his humour.For the acting this comedy (says he) those who have the government ofthe stage have their humours, and would be intreated; and I have mine,and won't entreat them; and were all dramatic writers of my mind, theyshould wear their old plays thread-bare, er'e they should have any new,till they better understood their own interest, and how to distinguishbetween good and bad.'This anger of Mr. Flecknoe's at the players for refusing the piece,bears some resemblance to that of Bayes, when the players went to dinnerwithout his leave. 'How! are the players gone to dinner? If they areI will make them know what it is to injure a person who does them thehonour to write for them, and all that; a company of proud, conceited,humorous, cross-grain'd persons, and all that; I'll make them the mostcontemptible, despicable, inconsiderable persons, and all that; &c. &c.&c.2. Ermina, or the chaste lady; printed in octavo, London 1665.3. Love's Dominion; a dramatic piece, which the author says, is full ofexcellent morality; and is written as a pattern of the reformed stage,printed in octavo, London 1654, and dedicated to the lady ElizabethClaypole. In this epistle the author insinuates the use of plays, andbegs her mediation to gain license to act them.4. Love's Kingdom, a Tragi-Comedy; not as it was acted at the theatrein Lincoln's-Inn; but as it was written and since corrected, printedin octavo, London 1664, and dedicated to his excellency William lordmarquis of Newcastle. This is no more than the former play a littlealter'd, with a new title; and after the king's return, it seems thepoet obtained leave to have it acted, but it had the misfortune to bedamned by the audience, which Mr. Flecknoe stiles the people, and callsthem judges without judgment, for want of its being rightly representedto them; he owns it wants much of the ornaments of the stage, but that,he says, by a lively imagination may be easily supplied. 'To the samepurpose he speaks of his Damoiselles a la Mode:That together with the persons represented, he had set down thecomedians he had designed should represent them; that the reader mighthave half the pleasure of seeing it acted, and a lively imaginationmight have the pleasure of it all entire.5. The Marriage of Oceanus and Britannia, a Masque.Our author's other works consist of Epigrams and Enigmas. There is abook of his writing, called the Diarium, or the Journal; divided intotwelve jornadas, in burlesque verse.Dryden, in two lines in his Mac Flecknoe, gives the character of ourauthor's works.  In prose and verse was own'd without dispute,  Thro' all the realms of nonsense absolute.We cannot be certain in what year Mr. Flecknoe died: Dryden's satirehad perhaps rendered him so contemptible, that none gave themselves thetrouble to record any particulars of his life, or to take any notice ofhis death.       *       *       *       *       *JOHN DRYDEN, Esq;This illustrious Poet was son of Erasmus Dryden, of Tickermish inNorthamptonshire, and born at Aldwincle, near Oundle 1631[1], he had hiseducation in grammar learning, at Westminster-school, under thefamous Dr. Busby, and was from thence elected in 1650, a scholar ofTrinity-College in Cambridge.We have no account of any extraordinary indications of genius given bythis great poet, while in his earlier days; and he is one instance howlittle regard is to be paid to the figure a boy makes at school: Mr.Dryden was turned of thirty before he introduced any play upon thestage, and his first, called the Wild Gallants, met with a veryindifferent reception; so that if he had not been impelled by the forceof genius and propension, he had never again attempted the stage:a circumstance which the lovers of dramatic poetry must ever haveregretted, as they would in this case have been deprived of one of thegreatest ornaments that ever adorned the profession.The year before he left the university, he wrote a poem on the death oflord Hastings, a performance, say some of his critics, very unworthy ofhimself, and of the astonishing genius he afterwards discovered.That Mr. Dryden had at this time no fixed principles, either in religionor politics, is abundantly evident, from his heroic stanzas on OliverCromwel, written after his funeral 1658; and immediately upon therestoration he published Astraea Redux, a poem on the happy restorationof Charles the IId; and the same year, his Panegyric to the king on hiscoronation: In the former of these pieces, a remarkable distich hasexpos'd our poet to the ridicule of the wits.  An horrid stillness first invades the ear,  And in that silence we the tempest hear.Which it must be owned is downright nonsense, and a contradiction interms: Amongst others captain Radcliff has ridiculed this blunder in thefollowing lines of his News from Hell.  Laureat who was both learn'd and florid,  Was damn'd long since for silence horrid:  Nor had there been such clutter made,  But that his silence did invade.  Invade, and so it might, that's clear;  But what did it invade? An ear!In 1662 he addressed a poem to the lord chancellor Hyde, presented onnew-year's-day; and the same year published a satire on the Dutch. Hisnext piece, was his Annus Mirabilis, or the Year of Wonders, 1668, anhistorical poem, which celebrated the duke of York's victory over theDutch. In the same year Mr. Dryden succeeded Sir William Davenant asPoet Laureat, and was also made historiographer to his majesty; and thatyear published his Essay on Dramatic Poetry, addressed to Charles earlof Dorset and Middlesex. Mr. Dryden tells his patron, that the writingthis Essay, served as an amusement to him in the country, when he wasdriven from town by the violence of the plague, which then raged inLondon; and he diverted himself with thinking on the theatres, as loversdo by ruminating on their absent mistresses: He there justifies themethod of writing plays in verse, but confesses that he has quitted thepractice, because he found it troublesome and slow[2]. In the prefacewe are informed that the drift of this discourse was to vindicate thehonour of the English writers from the censure of those who unjustlyprefer the French to them. Langbaine has injuriously treated Mr. Dryden,on account of his dramatic performances, and charges him as a licentiousplagiary. The truth is, our author as a dramatist is less eminent thanin any other sphere of poetry; but, with all his faults, he is even inthat respect the most eminent of his time.The critics have remarked, that as to tragedy, he seldom touches thepassions, but deals rather in pompous language, poetical flights, anddescriptions; and too frequently makes his characters speak better thanthey have occasion, or ought to do, when their sphere in the drama isconsidered: And it is peculiar to Dryden (says Mr. Addison) to make hispersonages, as wise, witty, elegant and polite as himself. That he couldnot so intimately affect the tender passions, is certain, for we find noplay of his, in which we are much disposed to weep; and we are so ofteninchanted with beautiful descriptions, and noble flights of fancy, thatwe forget the business of the play, and are only attentive to the poet,while the characters sleep. Mr. Gildon observes in his laws of poetry,that when it was recommended to Mr. Dryden to turn his thoughts to atranslation of Euripides, rather than of Homer, he confessed that he hadno relish for that poet, who was a great master of tragic simplicity.Mr. Gildon, further observes, as a confirmation that Dryden's taste fortragedy was not of the genuine sort, that he constantly expressed greatcontempt for Otway, who is universally allowed to have succeeded veryhappily in affecting the tender passions: Yet Mr. Dryden, in his prefaceto the translation of M. Du Fresnoy, speaks more favourably of Otway;and after mentioning these instances, Gildon ascribes this taste inDryden, to his having read many French Romances.--The truth is, if apoet would affect the heart, he must not exceed nature too much, norcolour too high; distressful circumstances, short speeches, and patheticobservations never fail to move infinitely beyond the highest rant, orlong declamations in tragedy: The simplicity of the drama was Otway'speculiar excellence; a living poet observes, that from Otway to our owntimes,  From bard to bard, the frigid caution crept,  And declamation roar'd while passion slept.Mr. Dryden seems to be sensible, that he was not born to write comedy;for, says he, 'I want that gaiety of humour which is required in it;my conversation is slow and dull, my humour saturnine and reserved. Inshort, I am none of those who endeavour to break jests in company, andmake repartees; so that those who decry my comedies, do me no injury,except it be in point of profit: Reputation in them is the last thing towhich I shall pretend[3].'This ingenuous confession of inability, one would imagine weresufficient to silence the clamour of the critics against Mr. Drydenin that particular; but, however true it may be, that Dryden did notsucceed to any degree in comedy, I shall endeavour to support myassertion, that in tragedy, with all his faults, he is still the mostexcellent of his time. The end of tragedy is to instruct the mind, aswell as move the passions; and where there are no shining sentiments,the mind may be affected, but not improved; and however prevalent thepassion of grief may be over the heart of man, it is certain that he mayfeel distress in the acutest manner, and not be much the wiser for it.The tragedies of Otway, Lee and Southern, are irresistibly moving, butthey convey not such grand sentiments, and their language is far frombeing so poetical as Dryden's; now, if one dramatic poet writes tomove, and another to enchant and instruct, as instruction is of greaterconsequence than being agitated, it follows naturally, that the latteris the most excellent writer, and possesses the greatest genius.But perhaps our poet would have wrote better in both kinds of the drama,had not the necessity of his circumstances obliged him to comply withthe popular taste. He himself, in his dedication to the Spanish Fryar,insinuates as much. 'I remember, says he, some verses of my own Maximinand Almanzor, which cry vengeance upon me for their extravagance. Allthat I can say for those passages, which are I hope not many, is, thatI knew they were bad when I wrote them. But I repent of them amongst mysins, and if any of their fellows intrude by chance, into my presentwritings, I draw a veil over all these Dalilahs of the theatre, and amresolved, I will settle myself no reputation upon the applause of fools.'Tis not that I am mortified to all ambition, but I scorn as much totake it from half witted judges, as I should to raise an estate bycheating of bubbles. Neither do I discommend the lofty stile in tragedy,which is naturally pompous and magnificent; but nothing is truelysublime that is not just and proper.' He says in another place, 'thathis Spanish Fryar was given to the people, and that he never wrote anything in the dramatic way, to please himself, but his All for Love.'In 1671 Mr. Dryden was publicly ridiculed on the stage, in the duke ofBuckingham's comedy, culled the Rehearsal, under the character of Bays:This character, we are informed, in the Key to the Rehearsal, wasoriginally intended for Sir Robert Howard, under the name of Bilboa;but the representation being put a stop to, by the breaking out of theplague, in 1665, it was laid by for several years, and not exhibited onthe stage till 1671, in which interval, Mr. Dryden being advanced to theLaurel, the noble author changed the name of his poet, from Bilboa toBays, and made great alterations in his play, in order to ridiculeseveral dramatic performances, that appeared since the first writing it.Those of Mr. Dryden, which fell under his grace's lash, were the WildGallant, Tyrannic Love, the Conquest of Granada, Marriage A la-Mode, andLove in a Nunnery: Whatever was extravagant, or too warmly expressed, orany way unnatural, the author has ridiculed by parody.Mr. Dryden affected to despise the satire levelled at him in theRehearsal, as appears from his dedication of the translation of Juvenaland Persius where speaking of the many lampoons, and libels that had,been written against him, he says, 'I answered not to the Rehearsal,because I knew the author sat to himself when he drew the picture, andwas the very Bays of his own farce; because also I knew my betters weremore concerned than I was in that satire; and lastly, because Mr. Smithand Mr. Johnson, the main pillars of it, were two such languishinggentlemen in their conversation, that I could liken them to nothing buttheir own relations, those noble characters of men of wit and pleasureabout town.'In 1679 came out an Essay on Satire, said to be written jointly by Mr.Dryden and the earl of Mulgrave; this piece, which was handed about inmanuscript, containing Reflexions on the Duchess of Portsmouth, and theEarl of Rochester; who suspecting, as Wood says, Mr. Dryden to be theauthor, hired three ruffians to cudgel him in Wills's coffee-house ateight o'clock at night. This short anecdote, I think, cannot be toldwithout indignation. It proved Rochester was a malicious coward, and,like other cowards, cruel and insolent; his foul was incapable of anything that approached towards generosity, and when his resentment washeated, he pursued revenge, and retained the most lasting hatred; he hadalways entertained a prejudice against Dryden, from no other motive thanenvy, Dryden's plays met with success, and this was enough to fire theresentment of Rochester, who was naturally envious. In order to hurt thecharacter, and shake the interest of this noble poet, he recommendedCrown, an obscure man, to write a Masque for the court, which wasDryden's province, as poet-laureat, to perform. Crown in this succeeded,but soon after, when his play called the Conquest of Jerusalem met withsuch extravagant applause, Rochester, jealous of his new favourite, notonly abandoned him, but commenced from that moment his enemy.The other person against whom this satire was levelled, was not superiorin virtue to the former, and all the nation over, two better subjectsfor satire could not have been found, than lord Rochester, and theduchess of Portsmouth. As for Rochester, he had not genius enough toenter the lists with Dryden, so he fell upon another method of revenge;and meanly hired bravoes to assault him.In 1680 came out a translation of Ovid's Epistles in English verse, byseveral hands, two of which were translated by Mr. Dryden, who alsowrote the preface. In the year following our author published Absalomand Achitophel. It was first printed without his name, and is a severesatire against the contrivers and abettors of the opposition againstKing Charles II. In the same year that Absalom and Achitophel waspublished, the Medal, a Satire, was likewise given to the public. Thispiece is aimed against sedition, and was occasioned by the striking of amedal, on account of the indictment against the earl of Shaftsbury forhigh treason being found ignoramus by the grand jury, at the Old Bailey,November 1681: For which the Whig party made great rejoicings by ringingof bells, bonfires, &c. in all parts of London. The poem is introducedwith a very satirical epistle to the Whigs, in which the author says,'I have one favour to desire you at parting, that when you think ofanswering this poem, you would employ the same pens against it, who havecombated with so much success against Absalom and Achitophel, for thenyou may assure yourselves of a clear victory without the least reply.Rail at me abundantly, and not break a custom to do it with wit. By thismethod you will gain a considerable point, which is wholly to wave theanswer of my arguments. If God has not blessed you with the talent ofrhiming, make use of my poor stock and welcome; let your verses run uponmy feet, and for the utmost refuge of notorious blockheads, reduced tothe last extremity of sense, turn my own lines against me, and in utterdespair of my own satire, make me satirize myself.' The whole poem is asevere invective against the earl of Shaftsbury; who was uncle to thatearl who wrote the Characteristics. Mr. Elkanah Settle wrote an answerto this poem, entitled the Medal Reversed. However contemptible Settlewas as a poet, yet such was the prevalence of parties at that time,that, for some years, he was Dryden's rival on the stage. In 1682 cameout his Religio Laici, or a Layman's Faith; this piece is intended as adefence of revealed religion, and the excellency and authority of thescriptures, as the only rule of faith and manners, against Deists,Papists, and Presbyterians. He acquaints us in the preface, that itwas written for an ingenious young gentleman, his friend; upon histranslation of Father Simons's Critical History of the Old Testament,and that the stile of it was epistolary.In 1684 he published a translation of M. Maimbourg's. History of theLeague, in which he was employed by the command of King Charles II. onaccount of the plain parallel between the troubles of France, and thoseof Great Britain. Upon the death of Charles II. he wrote his ThrenodiaAugustalis, a Poem, sacred to the happy memory of that Prince. Soonafter the accession of James II. our author turned Roman Catholic, andby this extraordinary step drew upon himself abundance of ridicule fromwits of the opposite faction; and in 1689 he wrote a Defence of thePapers, written by the late King of blessed memory, found in hisstrong box. Mr. Dryden, in the abovementioned piece, takes occasion tovindicate the authority of the Catholic Church, in decreeing matters offaith, upon this principle, that the church is more visible than thescriptures, because the scriptures are seen by the church, and toabuse the reformation in England, which he affirms was erected onthe foundation of lust, sacrilege, and usurpation. Dr. Stillingfleethereupon answered Mr. Dryden, and treated him with some severity.Another author affirms, that Mr. Dryden's tract is very light, in someplaces ridiculous; and observes, that his talent lay towards controversyno more in prose, than, by the Hind and Panther, it appeared to do inverse. This poem of the Hind and Panther is a direct defence of theRomish Church, in a dialogue between a Hind, which represents the Churchof Rome, and a Panther, which supports the character of the Church ofEngland. The first part of this poem consists most in general charactersand narration, which, says he, 'I have endeavoured to raise, and give itthe majestic turn of heroic poetry. The second being matter of dispute,and chiefly concerning church authority, I was obliged to make as plainand perspicuous as possibly I could, yet not wholly neglecting thenumbers, though I had not frequent occasion for the magnificence ofverse. The third, which has more of the nature of domestic conversation,is, or ought to be, more free and familiar than the two former. Thereare in it two episodes or fables, which are interwoven with the maindesign, so that they are properly parts of it, though they are alsodistinct stories of themselves. In both of these I have made use of thecommon places of satire, whether true or false, which are urged by themembers of the one church against the other.'Mr. Dryden speaks of his own conversion in the following terms;  But, gracious God, how well dost thou provide,  For erring judgments, an unerring guide.  Thy throne is darkness, in th' abyss of light,  A blaze of glory that forbids the sight.  O teach me to believe thee, thus concealed,  And search no further than thyself revealed;  But her alone for my director take,  Whom thou hast promis'd never to forsake!  My thoughtless youth was wing'd with vain desires;  My manhood, long misled by wand'ring fires,  Follow'd false lights; and when their glimpse was gone,  My pride struck out new sparkles of her own.  Such was I, such by nature still I am,  Be thine the glory, and be mine the shame,  Good life be now my talk, my doubts are done.[4]This poem was attacked by Mr. Charles Montague, afterwards Earl ofHallifax, and Mr. Matthew Prior, who joined in writing the Hind andPanther, transversed to the Country Mouse, and City Mouse, Lond. 1678,4to. In the preface to which, the author observes, 'that Mr. Dryden'spoem naturally falls into ridicule, and that in this burlesque, nothingis represented monstrous and unnatural, that is not equally so in theoriginal.' They afterwards remark, that they have this comfort under theseverity of Mr. Dryden's satire, to see his abilities equally lessenedwith his opinion of them, and that he could not be a fit championagainst the Panther till he had laid aside his judgment.Mr. Dryden is supposed to have been engaged in translating M. Varillas'sHistory of Heresies, but to have dropped that design. This we learn froma passage in Burnet's reflexions on the ninth book of the first volumeof M. Varillas's History, being a reply to his answer.I shall here give the picture the Dr. has drawn of this noble poet,which is, like a great many of the doctor's other characters, ratherexhibited to please himself than according to the true resemblance.The doctor says, 'I have been informed from England, that a gentlemanwho is famous both for poetry, and several other things, has spentthree months in translating Mr. Varillas's history; but as soon as myreflexions appeared, he discontinued his labours, finding the credit ofhis author being gone. Now if he thinks it is recovered by his answer,he will, perhaps, go on with his translation; but this may be, for oughtI know, as good an entertainment for him, as the conversation he has seton foot between the Hinds and Panthers, and all the rest of the animals;for whom M. Varillas may serve well enough as an author; and thishistory and that poem are such extraordinary things of their kind, thatit will be but suitable to see the author of the worst poem become thetranslator of the worst history, that the age has produced. If his graceand his wit improve so proportionably, we shall hardly find, that he hasgained much by the change he has made, from having no religion, to chuseone of the worst. It is true he had somewhat to sink from in matter ofwit, but as for his morals, it is scarce possible for him to grow aworse man than he was. He has lately wreaked his malice on me forspoiling his three months labour; but in it he has done me all thehonour a man can receive from him, which is to be railed at by him. If Ihad ill-nature enough to prompt me to wish a very bad wish for him, itshould be that he would go and finish his translation. By that it willappear whether the English nation, which is the most competent judge ofthis matter, has upon seeing this debate, pronounced in M. Varillas'sfavour or me. It is true, Mr. Dryden will suffer a little by it; but atleast it will serve to keep him in from other extravagancies; and if hegains little honour by this work, yet he cannot lose so much by it, ashe has done by his last employment.'When the revolution was compleated, Mr. Dryden having turned Papist,became disqualified for holding his place, and was accordinglydispossessed of it; and it was conferred on a man to whom he had aconfirmed aversion; in consequence whereof he wrote a satire againsthim, called Mac Flecknoe, which is one of the severest and best; writtensatires in our language.Mr. Richard Flecknoe, the new laureat, with whose name it is inscribed,was a very indifferent poet of those times; or rather as Mr. Drydenexpresses it, and as we have already quoted in Flecknoe's life.  In prose and verse was own'd without dispute,  Thro' all the realms of nonsense absolute.This poem furnished the hint to Mr. Pope to write his Dunciad; and itmust be owned the latter has been more happy in the execution of hisdesign, as having more leisure for the performance; but in Dryden's MacFlecknoe there are some lines so extremely pungent, that I am not quitecertain if Pope has any where exceeded them.In the year wherein he was deprived of the laurel, he published the lifeof St. Francis Xavier, translated from the French of father DominicBouchours. In 1693 came out a translation of Juvenal and Persius; inwhich the first, third, sixth, tenth, and fifteenth satires of Juvenal,and Persius entire, were done by Mr. Dryden, who prefixed a long andingenious discourse, by way of dedication, to the earl of Dorset. Inthis address our author takes occasion a while to drop his reflexionson Juvenal; and to lay before his lordship a plan for an epic poem: heobserves, that his genius never much inclined him to the stage; and thathe wrote for it rather from necessity than inclination. He complains,that his circumstances are such as not to suffer him to pursue the bentof his own genius, and then lays down a plan upon which an epic poemmight be written: to which, says he, I am more inclined. Whether theplan proposed is faulty or no, we are not at present to consider; onething is certain, a man of Mr. Dryden's genius would have covered by therapidity of the action, the art of the design, and the beauty of thepoetry, whatever might have been defective in the plan, and produced awork which have been the boast of the nation.We cannot help regretting on this occasion, that Dryden's fortune wasnot easy enough to enable him, with convenience and leisure, to pursuea work that might have proved an honour to himself, and reflected aportion thereof on all, who should have appeared his encouragers on thisoccasion.In 1695 Mr. Dryden published a translation in prose of Du Fresnoy's Artof Painting, with a preface containing a parallel between painting andpoetry. Mr. Pope has addressed a copy of verses to Mr. Jervas in praiseof Dryden's translation. In 1697 his translation of Virgil's works cameout. This translation has passed thro' many editions, and of all theattempts which have been made to render Virgil into English. Thecritics, I think, have allowed that Dryden[5] best succeeded:notwithstanding as he himself says, when he began it, he was past thegrand climacteric! so little influence it seems, age had over him, thathe retained his judgment and fire in full force to the last. Mr. Pope inhis preface to Homer says, if Dryden had lived to finish what he beganof Homer, he, (Mr. Pope) would not have attempted it after him,'No more, says he, than I would his Virgil, his version of whom(notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spiritedtranslation I know in any language.'Dr. Trap charges Mr. Dryden with grossly mistaking his author's sense inmany places; with adding or retrenching as his turn is best served witheither; and with being least a translator where he shines most as apoet; whereas it is a just rule laid down by lord Roscommon, that atranslator in regard to his author should  "Fall as he falls, and as he rises rise"Mr. Dryden, he tells us, frequently acts the very reverse of thisprecept, of which he produces some instances; and remarks in general,that the first six books of the AEneis, which are the best and mostperfect in the original, are the least so in the translation. Dr. Trap'sremarks may possibly be true; but in this he is an instance how easy itis to discover faults in other men's works, and how difficult to avoidthem in our own.Dr. Trap's translation is close, and conveys the author's meaningliterally, so consequently may be fitter for a school-boy, but men ofriper judgment, and superior taste, will hardly approve it; if Dryden'sis the most spirited of any translation, Trap's is the dullest that everwas written; which proves that none but a good poet is fit to translatethe works of a good poet.Besides the original pieces and translations hitherto mentioned, Mr.Dryden wrote many others, published in six volumes of Miscellanies, andin other collections. They consist of translations from the Greek andLatin poets, Epistles to several persons, prologues, and epilogues toseveral plays, elegies, epitaphs, and songs. His last work was hisFables, ancient and modern, translated into verse from Homer, Ovid,Boccace, and Chaucer. To this work, which is perhaps, one of his mostimperfect, is prefixed by way of preface, a critical account of theauthors, from whom the fables are translated. Among the original pieces,the Ode to St. Cecilia's day is justly esteemed one of the most elevatedin any language. It is impossible for a poet to read this without beingfilled with that sort of enthusiasm which is peculiar to the inspiredtribe, and which Dryden largely felt when he composed it. The turnof the verse is noble, the transitions surprizing, the language andsentiments just, natural, and heightened. We cannot be too lavish inpraise of this Ode: had Dryden never wrote any thing besides, his namehad been immortal. Mr. Pope has the following beautiful lines in itspraise.[6]  Hear how Timotheus varied lays surprize,  And bid alternate passions fall and rise!  While, at each change, the son of Lybian Jove  Now burns with glory, and then melts with love:  Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow;  Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow;  Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found,  And the world's victor flood subdued by sound:  The power of music all our hearts allow;  And what Timotheus was, is Dryden now.As to our author's performances in prose, besides his Dedications andPrefaces, and controversial Writings, they consist of the Lives ofPlutarch and Lucian, prefixed to the Translation of those Authors, byseveral Hands; the Life of Polybius; before the Translation of thatHistorian by Sir Henry Sheers, and the Preface to the Dialogueconcerning Women, by William Walsh, Esquire.Before we give an account of the dramatic works of Dryden, it will beproper here to insert a story concerning him, from the life of Congreveby Charles Wilson esquire, which that gentleman received from the ladywhom Mr. Dryden celebrates by the name of Corinna, of whom it appears hewas very fond; and who had the relation from lady Chudleigh. Dryden withall his undemanding was weak enough to be fond of Judicial Astrology,and used to calculate the nativity of his children. When his lady was inlabour with his son Charles, he being told it was decent to withdraw,laid his watch on the table, begging one of the ladies then present, ina most solemn manner, to take exact notice of the very minute the childwas born, which she did, and acquainted him with it. About a week after,when his lady was pretty well recovered, Mr. Dryden took occasionto tell her that he had been calculating the child's nativity, andobserved, with grief, that he was born in an evil hour, for Jupiter,Venus, and the sun, were all under the earth, and the lord of hisascendant afflicted with a hateful square of Mars and Saturn. If helives to arrive at his 8th year (says he) 'he will go near to die aviolent death on his very birth-day, but if he should escape, as I seebut small hopes, he will in the 23d year be under the very same evildirection, and if he should escape that also, the 33d or 34th year is, Ifear'--here he was interrupted by the immoderate grief of his lady, whocould no longer hear calamity prophecy'd to befall her son. The time atlast came, and August was the inauspicious month in which young Drydenwas to enter into the eighth year of his age. The court being inprogress, and Mr. Dryden at leisure, he was invited to the country seatof the earl of Berkshire, his brother-in-law, to keep the long vacationwith him in Charlton in Wilts; his lady was invited to her uncleMordaunt's, to pass the remainder of the summer. When they came todivide the children, lady Elizabeth would have him take John, and sufferher to take Charles; but Mr. Dryden was too absolute, and they parted inanger; he took Charles with him, and she was obliged to be contentwith John. When the fatal day came, the anxiety of the lady's spiritsoccasioned such an effervescence of blood, as threw her into, so violenta fever, that her life was despaired of, till a letter came from Mr.Dryden, reproving her for her womanish credulity, and assuring her,that her child was well, which recovered her spirits, and in six weeksafter she received an ecclaircissement-of the whole affair. Mr. Dryden,either thro' fear of being reckoned superstitious, or thinking it ascience beneath his study, was extremely cautious of letting any oneknow that he was a dealer in Astrology; therefore could not excuse hisabsence, on his son's anniversary, from a general hunting match lordBerkshire had made, to which all the adjacent gentlemen, were invited.When he went out, he took care to set the boy a double exercise in theLatin tongue, which he taught his children himself, with a strict chargenot to stir out of the room till his return; well knowing the task hehad set him would take up longer time. Charles was performing his duty,in obedience to his father, but as ill fate would have it, the stagmade towards the house; and the noise alarming the servants, they hastedout to, see the sport. One of them took young Dryden by the hand, andled him out to see it also, when just as they came to the gate, the stagbeing at bay with the dogs, made a bold push and leaped over the courtwall, which was very low, and very old; and the dogs following, threwdown a part of the wall ten yards in length, under which Charles Drydenlay buried. He was immediately dug out, and after six weeks languishingin a dangerous way he recovered; so far Dryden's prediction wasfulfilled: In the twenty-third year of his age, Charles fell from thetop of an old tower belonging to the Vatican at Rome, occasioned by aswimming in his head, with which he was seized, the heat of the daybeing excessive. He again recovered, but was ever after in a languishingsickly state. In the thirty-third year of his age, being returned toEngland, he was unhappily drowned at Windsor. He had with anothergentleman swam twice over the Thames; but returning a third time, it wassupposed he was taken with the cramp, because he called out for help,tho' too late. Thus the father's calculation proved but too prophetical.Mr. Dryden died the first of May 1701, and was interred in WestminsterAbby. On the 19th of April he had been very bad with the gout, anderisipelas in one leg; but he was then somewhat recovered, and designedto go abroad; on the Friday following he eat a partridge for his supper,and going to take a turn in the little garden behind his house inGerard-street, he was seized with a violent pain under the ball of thegreat toe of his right foot; that, unable to stand, he cried outfor help, and was carried in by his servants, when upon sending forsurgeons, they found a small black spot in the place affected; hesubmitted to their present applications, and when gone called hisson Charles to him, using these words. 'I know this black spot is amortification: I know also, that it will seize my head, and that theywill attempt to cut off my leg; but I command you my son, by your filialduty, that you do not suffer me to be dismembered:' As he foretold,the event proved, and his son was too dutiful to disobey his father'scommands.On the Wednesday morning following, he breathed his last, under the mostexcruciating pains, in the 69th year of his age; and left behind him thelady Elizabeth, his wife, and three sons. Lady Elizabeth survived himeight years, four of which she was a lunatic; being deprived of hersenses by a nervous fever in 1704.John, another of his sons, died of a fever at Rome; and Charles as hasbeen observed, was drowned in the Thames; there is no account when, orat what place Harry his third son died.Charles Dryden, who was some time usher to pope Clement II. was a younggentleman of a very promising genius; and in the affair of his father'sfuneral, which I am about to relate, shewed himself a man of spirit andresolution.[7]The day after Mr. Dryden's death, the dean of Westminster sent word toMr. Dryden's widow, that he would make a present of the ground, and allother Abbey-fees for the funeral: The lord Halifax likewise sent tothe lady Elizabeth, and to Mr. Charles Dryden, offering to defray theexpences of our poet's funeral, and afterwards to bestow 500 l. on amonument in the Abbey: which generous offer was accepted. Accordingly,on Sunday following, the company being assembled, the corpse was putinto a velvet hearse, attended by eighteen mourning coaches. When theywere just ready to move, lord Jefferys, son of lord chancellor Jeffreys,a name dedicated to infamy, with some of his rakish companions ridingby, asked whose funeral it was; and being told it was Mr. Dryden's, heprotested he should not be buried in that private manner, that hewould himself, with the lady Elizabeth's leave, have the honour of theinterment, and would bestow a thousand pounds on a monument in the Abbeyfor him. This put a stop to their procession; and the lord Jefferys,with several of the gentlemen, who had alighted from their coaches, wentup stairs to the lady, who was sick in bed. His lordship repeated thepurport of what he had said below; but the lady Elizabeth refusing herconsent, he fell on his knees, vowing never to rise till his requestwas granted. The lady under a sudden surprise fainted away, and lordJeffery's pretending to have obtained her consent, ordered the body tobe carried to Mr. Russel's an undertaker in Cheapside, and to be leftthere till further orders. In the mean time the Abbey was lighted up,the ground opened, the choir attending, and the bishop waiting somehours to no purpose for the corpse. The next day Mr. Charles Drydenwaited on my lord Halifax, and the bishop; and endeavoured to excuse hismother, by relating the truth. Three days after the undertaker havingreceived no orders, waited on the lord Jefferys; who pretended it was adrunken frolic, that he remembered nothing of the matter, and he mightdo what he pleased with the body. Upon this, the undertaker waited onthe lady Elizabeth, who desired a day's respite, which was granted. Mr.Charles Dryden immediately wrote to the lord Jefferys, who returned foranswer, that he knew nothing of the matter, and would be troubled nomore about it. Mr. Dryden hereupon applied again to the lord Halifax,and the bishop of Rochester, who absolutely refused to do any thing inthe affair.In this distress, Dr. Garth, who had been Mr. Dryden's intimate friend,sent for the corpse to the college of physicians, and proposed asubscription; which succeeding, about three weeks after Mr. Dryden'sdecease, Dr. Garth pronounced a fine latin oration over the body, whichwas conveyed from the college, attended by a numerous train of coachesto Westminster-Abbey, but in very great disorder. At last the corpsearrived at the Abbey, which was all unlighted. No organ played, noanthem sung; only two of the singing boys preceded the corpse, who sungan ode of Horace, with each a small candle in their hand. When thefuneral was over, Mr. Charles Dryden sent a challenge to lord Jefferys,who refusing to answer it, he sent several others, and went oftenhimself; but could neither get a letter delivered, nor admittance tospeak to him; which so incensed him, that finding his lordship refusedto answer him like a gentleman, he resolved to watch an opportunity,and brave him to fight, though with all the rules of honour; whichhis lordship hearing, quitted the town, and Mr. Charles never had anopportunity to meet him, though he sought it to his death, with theutmost application.Mr. Dryden had no monument erected to him for several years; to whichMr. Pope alludes in his epitaph intended for Mr. Rowe, in this line.  Beneath a rude and nameless stone he lies.In a note upon which we are informed, that the tomb of Mr. Dryden waserected upon this hint, by Sheffield duke of Buckingham, to which wasoriginally intended this epitaph.  This Sheffield raised.--The sacred dust below,  Was Dryden once; the rest who does not know.Which was since changed into the plain inscription now upon it, viz.  J. DRYDEN,  Natus Aug. 9. 1631.  Mortus Maii 1. 1701.  Johannes Sheffield, Dux Buckinghamienfis secit.The character of Mr. Dryden has been drawn by various hands; some havedone it in a favourable, others in an opposite manner. The bishop ofSarum in the history of his own times, says, that the stage was defiledbeyond all example. 'Dryden, the great master of dramatic poetry, beinga monster of immodesty and impurities of all sorts.'[8] The late lordLansdown took upon himself to vindicate Mr. Dryden's character from thissevere imputation; which was again answered, and apologies for it, byMr. Burnet, the bishop's son. But not to dwell on these controversiesabout his character, let us hear what Mr. Congreve says in thededication of Dryden's works to the duke of Newcastle: Congreve knew himintimately, and as he could have no motive to deceive the world in thatparticular; and being a man of untainted morals, none can suspect hisauthority; and by his account we shall see, that Dryden was indeed asamiable in private life, as a Man, as he was illustrious in the eye ofthe public, as a Poet.Mr. Dryden (says Congreve) 'had personal qualities, to challenge loveand esteem from all who were truly acquainted with him. He was of anature exceeding humane and compassionate, easily forgiving injuries,and capable of a prompt and sincere reconciliation with those who hadoffended him.--His friendship, where he professed it, went much beyondhis professions.--As his reading had been very extensive, so was he veryhappy in a memory, tenacious of every thing he had read. He was not morepossessed of knowledge, than he was communicative of it; but then,his communication of it was by no means pedantic, or imposed upon theconversation, but just such, and went so far, as by the natural turns ofthe discourse in which he was engaged, it was necessarily prompted, orrequired. He was extremely ready and gentle in the correction of theerrors of any writer, who thought fit to consult him, and full as readyand patient to admit of the reprehension of others in respect of hisown oversight or mistakes. He was of a very easy, I may say, of verypleasing access; but something slow, and as it were dissident in hisadvances to others. He had something in his nature that abhorredintrusion in any society whatsoever; and indeed, it is to be regretted,that he was rather blameable on the other extreme. He was of all men Iever knew, the most modest, and the most easy to be discountenancedin his approaches, either to his superiors or his equals.--As to hiswritings--may venture to say in general terms, that no man hath writtenin our language so much, and so various matter; and in so variousmanners so well. Another thing I may say, was very peculiar to him,which is, that his parts did not decline with his years, but that he wasan improving writer to the last, even to near 70 years of age, improvingeven in fire and imagination as well as in judgment, witness his Odeon St. Cecilia's Day, and his fables, his latest performances. He wasequally excellent in verse and prose: His prose had all the clearnessimaginable, without deviating to the language or diction of poetry, andI have heard him frequently own with pleasure, that if he had any talentfor writing prose; it was owing to his frequently having read thewritings of the great archbishop Tillotson. In his poems, his dictionis, wherever his subject requires it, so sublime and so truly poetical,that it's essence, like that of pure gold cannot be destroyed. Take hisverses, and divest them of their rhimes, disjoint them of their numbers,transpose their expressions, make what arrangement or disposition youplease in his words; yet shall there eternally be poetry, and somethingwhich will be found incapable of being reduced to absolute prose; whathe has done in any one species, or distinct kind of writing, wouldhave been sufficient to have acquired him a very great name. If he hadwritten nothing but his Prefaces, or nothing but his Songs, or hisPrologues, each of them would have entitled him to the preference anddistinction of excelling in its kind.'Besides Mr. Dryden's numerous other performances, we find him the authorof twenty-seven dramatic pieces, of which the following is an account.1. The Wild Gallant, a Comedy, acted at the theatre-royal, and printedin 4to, Lond. 1699.2. The Indian Emperor; or the Conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards, actedwith great applause, and written in verse.3. An Evening's Love; or the Mock Astrologer, a Comedy, acted at thetheatre-royal, and printed in 4to. 1671. It is for the most part takenfrom Corneille's Feint Astrologue, Moliere's Depit Amoreux, and PrecieuxRidicules.4. Marriage A-la-mode, a Comedy, acted at the theatre-royal, and printedin 4to. 1673, dedicated to the earl of Rochester.5. Araboyna, a Tragedy, acted at the theatre-royal, and printed in 4to1673. It is dedicated to the lord Clifford of Chudleigh. The plot ofthis play is chiefly founded in history, giving an account of thecruelty of the Dutch towards our countrymen at Amboyna, A.D. 1618.6. The Mistaken Husband, a Comedy, acted at the theatre-royal, andprinted in 4to. 1675. Mr. Langbaine tells us, Mr. Dryden was not theauthor of this play, tho' it was adopted by him as an orphan, whichmight well deserve the charity of a scene he bestowed on it. It isin the nature of low comedy, or farce, and written on the model ofPlautus's Menaechmi.7. Aurenge-zebe; or the Great Mogul, a Tragedy, dedicated to the earlof Mulgrave, acted 1676. The story is related at large in Taverner'svoyages to the Indies, vol. i. part 2. This play is written in heroicverse.8. The Tempest; or the inchanted Island, a Comedy, acted at the duke ofYork's theatre, and printed in 4to. 1676. This is only an alterationof Shakespear's Tempest, by Sir William Davenant and Dryden. The newcharacters in it were chiefly the invention and writing of Sir William,as acknowledged by Mr. Dryden in his preface.9. Feigned Innocence; or Sir Martin Mar-all, a Comedy, acted at the dukeof York's theatre, and printed in 4to. 1678. The foundation of thisis originally French, the greatest part of the plot and some of thelanguage being taken from Moliere's Eteurdi.10. The Assignation; or Love in a Nunnery, a Comedy, acted at thetheatre-royal, and printed in 4to. 1678, addressed to Sir CharlesSedley. This play, Mr. Langbain tells us, was damned on the stage, or asthe author expresses it in the epistle dedicatory, succeeded ill in therepresentation; but whether the fault was in the play itself, or inthe lameness of the action, or in the numbers of its enemies, who cameresolved to damn it for the title, he will not pretend any more than theauthor to determine.11. The State of Innocence; or the Fall of Man, an Opera, written inheroic verse, and printed in 4to. 1678. It is dedicated to her royalhighness the duchess of York, on whom the author passes the followingextravagant compliment.'Your person is so admirable, that it can scarce receive any additionwhen it shall be glorified; and your soul which shines thro' it, findsit of a substance so near her own, that she will be pleased to pass anage within it, and to be confined to such a palace.'To this piece is prefixed an apology for heroic poetry, and poeticlicence. The subject is taken from Milton's Paradise Lost, of which itmust be acknowledged, it is a poor imitation.12. The Conquest of Granada by the Spaniards, in two parts, twoTragi-Comedies, acted at the theatre-royal, and printed 1678. These twoplays are dedicated to the duke of York, and were received on the stagewith great applause. The story is to be found in Mariana's history ofSpain, B. 25. chap. 18.These plays are written in rhime. To the first is prefixed an essay onheroic plays, and to the second an essay on the dramatic poetry of thelast age.13. All for Love, or the World well Lost, a Tragedy, acted at thetheatre-royal, and printed in quarto, 1678. It is dedicated to the earlof Danby.This is the only play of Mr. Dryden's which he says ever pleasedhimself; and he tells us, that he prefers the scene between Anthony andVentidius in the first act, to any thing he had written in this kind.It is full of fine sentiments, and the most poetical and beautifuldescriptions of any of his plays: the description of Cleopatra in herbarge, exceeds any thing in poetry, except Shakespear's, and his own St.Cecilia.14. Tyrannic Love; or the Royal Martyr, a Tragedy, acted at thetheatre-royal 1679. It is written in rhime, and dedicated to the duke ofMonmouth.15. Troilus and Cressida; or Truth found too late; a Tragedy, acted atthe duke's theatre, and printed in 4to. 1679. It is dedicated to theearl of Sunderland, and has a preface prefixed concerning groundsof criticism in tragedy. This play was originally Shakespear's, andrevised, and altered by Mr. Dryden, who added several new scenes.--Theplot taken from Chaucer's Troilus and Cressida, which that poettranslated from the original story written in Latin verse, by Lollius, aLombard.17. Secret Love; or the Maiden Queen, a Tragi-Comedy, acted at thetheatre-royal, and printed in 4to, 1697. The serious part of the plot isfounded on the history of Cleobuline, Queen of Corinth.18. The Rival Ladies, a Tragi-Comedy, acted at the theatre-royal 1679.It is dedicated to the earl of Orrery. The dedication is in the natureof a preface, in defence of English verse or rhime.19. The Kind Keeper; or Mr. Limberham, a Comedy, acted at the duke'stheatre, printed in 4to. 1680. It is dedicated to John lord Vaughan. Mr.Langbain says, it so much exposed the keepers about town, that all theold letchers were up in arms against it, and damned it the third night.20. The Spanish Fryar; or the Double Discovery, a Tragi Comedy, actedat the duke's theatre, and printed 1681. It is dedicated to John lordHaughton. This is one of Mr. Dryden's best plays, and still keepspossession of the stage. It is said, that he was afterwards so muchconcerned for having ridiculed the character of the Fryar, that itimpaired his health: what effect bigotry, or the influence of priests,might have on him, on this occasion, we leave others to determine.21. Duke of Guise, a Tragedy, acted 1688. It was written by Dryden andLee, and dedicated to Hyde earl of Rochester. This play gave greatoffence to the Whigs, and engaged several writers for and against it.22. Albion and Albanius, an Opera, performed at the Queen's theatre inDorset-Gardens, and printed in folio 1685. The subject of it is whollyallegorical, and intended to expose my lord Shaftfbury and his party.23. Don Sebastian King of Portugal, a Tragedy, acted 1690, dedicated tothe earl of Leicester.24. King Arthur; or the British worthy, a Tragedy, acted 1691, dedicatedto the marquis of Hallifax.25. Amphytrion; or the two Socias, a Comedy, acted 1691, dedicated toSir Leveson Gower, taken from Plautus and Moliere.26. Cleomenes, the Spartan Hero, a Tragedy, acted at the theatre-royal,and printed in 4to. 1692, dedicated to the earl of Rochester. There isprefixed to it the Life of Cleomenes, translated from Plutarch by Mr.Creech. This play was first prohibited by the lord Chamberlain, butupon examination being found innocent of any design to satirize thegovernment, it was suffered to be represented, and had great success.In the preface, the author tells us, that a foolish objection had beenraised against him by the sparks, for Cleomenes not accepting thefavours of Cassandra. 'They (says he) would not have refused a fairlady; I grant they would not, but let them grant me, that they are noheroes.'27. Love Triumphant; or Nature will prevail, a Tragi-comedy, acted 1694.It is dedicated to the earl of Shaftsbury, and is the last Mr. Drydenwrote, or intended for the theatre. It met with but indifferent success,tho' in many parts the genius of that great man breaks out, especiallyin the discovery of Alphonfo's successful love, and in the catastrophe,which is extremely effecting.

'This (says the editor) must beunderstood of his performances for the stage; for as to his personalcharacter, there was nothing remarkably vicious in it: but his playsare, some of them, the fullest of obscenity of any now extant.']       *       *       *       *       *Sir CHARLES SEDLEY, Bart.This gentleman, who obtained a great name in the world of gallantry, wasson of Sir John Sedley, of Aylesford in Kent. When our author was aboutthe age of 17, he became a fellow of Wadham college 1656, but he took nodegree. When he quitted the university, he retired into his own country,and neither went to travel nor to the inns of court. As soon as therestoration was effected, Sir Charles came to London, in order to joinin the general jubilee, and then commenced wit, courtier, poet, andgallant.He was so much applauded in all conversations that he began to be theoracle of the poets; and it was by his judgment every performance wasapproved or condemned; which made the King jest with him, and tellhim, that nature had given him a patent to be Apollo's viceroy. LordRochester bears testimony to this, when he puts him foremost among thejudges of poetry.  I loath the rabble, tis enough for me,  If Sedley, Shadwell, Shepherd, Wycherly,  Godolphin, Butler, Buckhurst, Buckingham,  And some few more, whom I omit to name,  Approve my sense, I count their censure same.It happened by Sir Charles, in respect of the king, as is said of thefamous cardinal Richlieu, viz. That they who recommended him to theRoyal savour, thereby supplanted themselves, and afterwards envied him;but with this difference between the Cardinal and Sir Charles, that thelatter was never ungrateful. When he had a taste of the court, as theKing never would part with him, so he never would part from the King;and yet two things proved particularly detrimental to him in it, firsthis estate, so far from being improved was diminished; and secondly hismorals were debauched. The King delighted in his conversation, and hewas the dearer to his Majesty on this account, that he never asked afavour; whereas some other courtiers by their bold importunity exhaustedthat prince's treasures, who could not deny a man who craved, tho' hehated his forwardness; nor could remember the silent indigence of hisfriend, tho' he applauded the modesty of it. He was deeply immersed inthe public distractions of the times, and is said to have committed manydebaucheries, of which the following instance has been recorded.In the month of June 1663 our author, Charles lord Buckhurst, andSir Thomas Ogle, were convened at a public house in Bow-street,Covent-Garden, and being enflamed with strong liquors, they went up tothe balcony belonging to that house, and there shewed very indecentpostures, and gave great offence to the passengers in the street by veryunmannerly discharges upon them; which done, Sedley stripped himselfnaked, and preached to the people in a gross and scandalous manner;whereupon a riot being raised, the mob became very clamorous, and wouldhave forced the door next to the street; but being opposed, the preacherand his company were driven off the balcony, and the windows of a roominto which they retired were broken by the mob. The frolic being soonspread abroad, and as persons of fashion were concerned in it, it was somuch the more aggravated. The company were summoned to appear before acourt of justice in Westminster-Hall, where being indicted for a riotbefore Sir Robert Hyde, lord chief justice of the Common Pleas, theywere all fined, and Sir Charles being sentenced to pay 500 l. he usedsome very impertinent expressions to the judge; who thereupon asked himif he had ever read a book called the Compleat Gentleman; to which SirCharles made answer, that he had read more books than his lordship.The day for payment being appointed, Sir Charles desired Mr. HenryKillegrew, and another gentleman to apply to his Majesty to have thefine remitted, which they undertook to do; but in place of supplicatingfor it, they represented Sir Charles's frolic rather in an aggravatinglight, and not a farthing was abated.After this affair, Sir Charles's mind took a more serious turn, and hebegan to apply himself to the study of politics, by which he might be ofsome service to his country. He was chosen, says Wood, a recruiter ofthat long parliament, which began at Westminster the 8th of May 1661,to serve for New Romney in Kent, and sat in three succeeding Parlimentssince the dissolution of that.Sir Charles, considered as an author, has great delicacy in his turns,and Eachard observes in his dedication of Plautus's three comedies toSir Charles, that the easiness of his stile, the politeness of hisexpressions in his Bellamira, and even those parts of it which arepurely translation, are very delightful, and engaging to the reader.Lord Rochester, in his imitation of the 10th satire of the first book ofHorace, has the following verses in his commendation.  Sedley has that prevailing gentle art,  That can with a resistless charm impart.  The loosest wishes to the chastest heart:  Raise such a conflict, kindle such a fire,  Betwixt declining virtue and desire;  That the poor vanquish'd maid dissolves away  In dreams all night, in sighs and tears all day.Before we give an account of our author's works, it will not be amiss toobserve, that he was extremely active in effecting the revolution, whichwas thought the more extraordinary, as he had received favours from KingJames II. That Prince, it seems, had fallen in love with a daughter ofSir Charles's, who was not very handsome; for James was remarkable fordedicating his affections to women who were not great beauties; inconsequence of his intrigue with her, and in order to give her greaterlustre in life, he created Miss Sedley countess of Dorchester. Thishonour, so far from pleasing, greatly shocked Sir Charles. Howeverlibertine himself had been, yet he could not bear the thoughts of hisdaughter's dishonour; and with regard to this her exaltation, he onlyconsidered it as rendering her more conspicuously infamous. He thereforeconceived a hatred to James, and readily joined to dispossess him of histhrone and dominions.Being asked one day, why he appeared so warm against the King, who hadcreated his daughter a Countess? It is from a principle of gratitudeI am so warm, returns Sir Charles; for since his Majesty has mademy daughter a Countess, it is fit I should do all I can to make hisdaughter a Queen.Our author's works are,1. The Mulberry Garden, a Comedy, acted by his Majesty's servants at thetheatre-royal 1668, dedicated to the duchess of Richmond and Lennox.2. Anthony and Cleopatra, a Tragedy, acted at the Duke of York's theatre1667. This play was acted with great applause. The Story from Plutarch'sLife of Anthony.3. Bellamira; or the Mistress, a Comedy, acted by his Majesty'sservants, 1687. It is taken from Terence's Eunuch. While this play wasacting, the roof of the play-house fell down, but very few were hurt,except the author: whose merry friend Sir Fleetwood Shepherd told him,that there was so much fire in the play, that it blew up the poet, houseand all: Sir Charles answered, No, the play was so heavy it brought downthe house, and buried the poet in his own rubbish.4. Beauty the Conqueror; or the Death of Mark Anthony, a Tragedy.Besides these plays, Mr. Coxeter says, he is author of the twofollowing, which were never printed till with his works in 2 vols. 8vo.1719, dedicated by Briscoe the bookseller to the duke of Chandois.The Grumbler, a Comedy of three acts, scene Paris.The Tyrant King of Crete, a Tragedy.Sedley's poems, however amorously tender and delicate, yet have not muchstrength; nor do they afford great marks of genius. The softness of hisverses is denominated by the Duke of Buckingham, Sedley's Witchcraft. Itwas an art too successful in those days to propagate the immoralitiesof the times, but it must be owned that in point of chastity he excelsDorset, and Rochester; who as they conceived lewdly, wrote in plainEnglish, and did not give themselves any trouble to wrap up theirribbaldry in a dress tollerably decent. But if Sedley was the morechaste, I know not if he was the less pernicious writer: for thatpill which is gilded will be swallowed more readily, and with lessreluctance, than if tendered in its own disgustful colours. Sedleyinsinuates gently into the heart, without giving any alarm, but is noless fraught with poison, than are those whose deformity bespeaks theirmischief.It would be tedious to enumerate here all the poems of Sir CharlesSedley; let it suffice to say, that they are printed in two smallvolumes along with his plays, and consist of translations of Virgil'sPastorals, original Pastorals, Prologues, Songs, Epilogues, and littleoccasional pieces.We shall present the reader with an original pastoral of Sir Charles's,as a specimen of his works.He lived to the beginning of Queen Anne's reign, and died at an age near90; his wit and humour continuing to the last.A Pastoral Dialogue between THIRSIS and STREPHON.  THIRSIS.    Strephon, O Strephon, once the jolliest lad,  That with shrill pipe did ever mountain glad;  Whilome the foremost at our rural plays,  The pride and envy of our holidays:  Why dost thou sit now musing all alone,  Teaching the turtles, yet a sadder moan?  Swell'd with thy tears, why does the neighbouring brook  Bear to the ocean, what she never took?  Thy flocks are fair and fruitful, and no swain,  Than thee, more welcome to the hill or plain.STREPHON.    I could invite the wolf, my cruel guest,  And play unmov'd, while he on all should feast:  I cou'd endure that very swain out-run,  Out-threw, out-wrestled, and each nymph shou'd shun  The hapless Strephon.----  THIRSIS.    Tell me then thy grief,  And give it, in complaints, some short relief.STREPHON.    Had killing mildews nipt my rising corn,  My lambs been all found dead, as soon as born;  Or raging plagues run swift through every hive,  And left not one industrious bee alive;  Had early winds, with an hoarse winter's found  Scattered my rip'ning fruit upon the ground:  Unmov'd, untoucht, I cou'd the loss sustain,  And a few days expir'd, no more complain.THIRSIS.    E'er the sun drank of the cold morning dew,  I've known thee early the tuskt boar pursue:  Then in the evening drive the bear away,  And rescue from his jaws the trembling prey.  But now thy flocks creep feebly through the fields,  No purple grapes, thy half-drest vineyards yields:  No primrose nor no violets grace thy beds,  But thorns and thistles lift their prickly heads.  What means this change?STREPHON                                                  Enquire no more;  When none can heal, 'tis pain to search the sore;  Bright Galatea, in whose matchless face  Sat rural innocence, with heavenly grace;  In whose no less inimitable mind,  With equal light, even distant virtues shin'd;  Chaste without pride, and charming without art,  Honour the tyrant of her tender heart:  Fair goddess of these fields, who for our sports,  Though she might well become, neglected courts:  Belov'd of all, and loving me alone,  Is from my sight, I fear, for ever gone.THIRSIS.    Thy case indeed is pitiful, but yet  Thou on thy loss too great a price dost set.  Women like days are, Strephon, some be far  More bright and glorious than others are:  Yet none so gay, so temperate, so clear,  But that the like adorn the rowling year,  Pleasures imparted to a friend, increase,  Perhaps divided sorrow may grow less.STREPHON.    Others as fair, to others eyes may seem,  But she has all my love and my esteem:  Her bright idea wanders in my thought,  At once my poison, and my antidote.THIRSIS.    Our hearts are paper, beauty is the pen,  Which writes our loves, and blots 'em out agen.  Phillis is whiter than the rising swan,  Her slender waist confin'd within a span:  Charming as nature's face in the new spring,  When early birds on the green branches sing.  When rising herbs and buds begin to hide,  Their naked mother, with their short-liv'd pride,  Chloe is ripe, and as the autumn fair,  When on the elm the purple grapes appear,  When trees, hedge-rows, and every bending bush,  With rip'ning fruit, or tasteful berries blush,  Lydia is in the summer of her days,  What wood can shade us from her piercing rays?  Her even teeth, whiter than new yean'd lambs,  When they with tender cries pursue their dams.  Her eyes as charming as the evening sun,  To the scorch'd labourer when his work is done,  Whom the glad pipe, to rural sports invites,  And pays his toil with innocent delights.  On some of these fond swain fix thy desire,  And burn not with imaginary fire.STREPHON.    The flag shall sooner with the eagle soar,  Seas leave their fishes naked on the shore;  The wolf shall sooner by the lamkin die,  And from the kid the hungry lion fly,  Than I abandon Galatea's love,  Or her dear image from my thoughts remove.THIRSIS.    Damon this evening carries home his bride,  In all the harmless pomp of rural pride:  Where, for two spotted lambkins, newly yean'd,  With nimble feet and voice, the nymphs contend:  And for a coat, thy Galatea spun,  The Shepherds wrestle, throw the bar, and run.STREPHON.    At that dear name I feel my heart rebound,  Like the old steed, at the fierce trumpet's sound;  I grow impatient of the least delay,  No bastard swain shall bear the prize away.THIRSIS.    Let us make haste, already they are met;  The echoing hills their joyful shouts repeat.       *       *       *       *       *JOHN CROWNEWas the son of an independent minister, in that part of North America,which is called Nova Scotia. The vivacity of his genius made him soongrow impatient of the gloomy education he received in that country;which he therefore quitted in order to seek his fortune in England; butit was his fate, upon his first arrival here, to engage in an employmentmore formal, if possible, than his American education. Mr. Dennis, inhis Letters, vol. i. p. 48, has given us the best account of this poet,and upon his authority the above, and the succeeding circumstances arerelated. His necessity, when he first arrived in England, was extremelyurgent, and he was obliged to become a gentleman usher to an oldindependent lady; but he soon grew as weary of that precise office, ashe had done before of the discipline of Nova Scotia. One would imaginethat an education, such as this, would be but an indifferent preparativefor a man to become a polite author, but such is the irresistableforce of genius, that neither this, nor his poverty, which was verydeplorable, could suppress his ambition: aspiring to reputation, anddistinction, rather than to fortune and power. His writings soon madehim known to the court and town, yet it was neither to the savour of thecourt, nor to that of the earl of Rochester, that he was indebted to thenomination the king made of him, for the writing the Masque of Calypso,but to the malice of that noble lord, who designed by that preference tomortify Mr. Dryden.Upon the breaking out of the two parties, after the pretended discoveryof the Popish plot, the favour he was in at court, and the gaiety ofhis temper, which inclined him to join with the fashion, engaged him toembrace the Tory party. About that time he wrote the City Politicks, inorder to satirize and expose the Whigs: a comedy not without wit andspirit, and which has obtained the approbation of those of contraryprinciples, which is the highest evidence of merit; but after it wasready for the stage, he met with great embarrassments in getting itacted. Bennet lord Arlington (who was then lord chamberlain, wassecretly in the cause of the Whigs, who were at that time potent inParliament, in order to support himself against the power of lordtreasurer Danby, who was his declared enemy) used all his authorityto suppress it. One while it was prohibited on account of its beingdangerous; another while it was laid aside upon pretence of its beingflat and insipid; till Mr. Crowne, at last, was forced to have recourseto the King himself, and engage him to lay his absolute commands onthe lord chamberlain to have it no longer delayed. This command he waspleased to give in his own person, for Charles II. loved comedy aboveall other amusements, except one which was both more expensive, andless innocent, and besides, had a very high opinion of Mr. Crowne'sabilities. While he was thus in favour with the King and court, Mr.Dennis declares, he has more than once heard him say, that though hehad a sincere affection for the King, he had yet a mortal hatred to thecourt. The promise of a sum of money made him sometimes appear there,to sollicit the payment of it, but as soon as he received the sum, hevanished, and for a long time never approached it.It was at the latter end of King Charles's reign, that Mr. Crowne, tiredwith the fatigue of writing, shocked with the uncertainty of theatricalsuccess, and desirous to shelter himself from the resentment of thosenumerous enemies he had made, by his City Politics, immediatelyaddressed the King himself, and desired his Majesty to establish himin some office, that might be a security to him for life: the Kinganswered, he should be provided for; but added, that he would first seeanother comedy. Mr. Crowne endeavouring to excuse himself, by tellingthe King he plotted slowly and awkwardly, his Majesty replied, that hewould help him to a plot, and so put in his hand the Spanish Comedycalled Non Poder Esser. Mr. Crowne was obliged immediately to go towork upon it, but after he had written three acts of it, found, to hissurprize, that the Spanish play had some time before been translated,and acted and damned, under the title of Tarugo's Wiles, or theCoffee-House: yet, supported by the King's command, he went briskly on,and finished it.Mr. Crowne, who had once before obliged the commonwealth of taste, witha very agreeable comedy in his City Politics, yet, in Sir Courtly Nicewent far beyond it, and very much surpassed himself; for though there issomething in the part of Crack, which borders upon farce, the Spanishauthor alone must answer for that: for Mr. Crowne could not omit thepart of Crack, that is, of Tarugo, and the Spanish farce depending uponit, without a downright affront to the King, who had given him the playfor his ground-work. All that is of English growth in Sir Courtly Niceis admirable; for though it has neither the fine designing of BenJohnson, nor the masculine satire of Wycherley, nor the grace, delicacy,and courtly air of Etherege, yet is the dialogue lively and spirited,attractively diversified, and adapted to the several characters. Fourof these characters are entirely new, yet general and important, drawntruly, and graphically and artfully opposed to each other, Surly to SirCourtly, and Hot-head to Testimony: those extremes of behaviour, theone of which is the grievance, and the other the plague of society andconversation; excessive ceremony on the one side, and on the otherrudeness, and brutality are finely exposed in Surly and Sir Courtly:those divisions and animosities in the two great parties of England,which have so long disturbed the public quiet, and undermined thegeneral interest, are happily represented and ridiculed in Testimony andHot-head. Mr. Dennis, speaking of this comedy, says, 'that though hehas more than twenty times read it, yet it still grows upon him, and hedelivers it as his opinion, that the greatest comic poet, who ever livedin any age, might have been proud to have been the author of it.'The play was now just ready to appear to the world. Every one that hadseen it rehearsed, was highly pleased with it. All who had heard of itconceived great expectations, and Mr. Crowne was delighted with theflattering hope of being made happy for the remaining part of his life,by the performance of the King's promise: But upon the very last day ofthe rehearsal, he met Underhill coming from the playhouse, as he himselfwas going towards it, upon which the poet reprimanding the player forneglecting so considerable a part as he had in the comedy, and on a dayof so much consequence, as the very last of the rehearsal. Oh Lord, saysUnderhill, we are all undone! how! says Crowne, is the Playhouse onfire? the whole nation, replies the player, will quickly be so, forthe King is dead; at the hearing of which dismal words, the authorwas thrown almost into distraction; for he who the moment before wasravished with the thought of the pleasure he was about to give the King,and the favours which he was afterwards to receive from him, this momentfound, to his unspeakable sorrow, that his Royal patron was gone forever, and with him all his hopes. The King indeed revived from thisapoplectic fit, but three days after died, and Mr. Crowne by his deathwas replunged into the deepest melancholly.Thus far Mr. Dennis has traced the life of Crowne; in the same letterhe promises a further account of him upon another occasion, which, itseems, never occurred, for we have not been able to find that he has anywhere else mentioned our author.The King's death having put a period to Mr. Crowne's expectations ofcourt-favour (for the reign of his successor was too much hurried withparty designs, to admit of any leisure to reward poetical merit, thoughthe Prince himself, with all his errors about him, was a man of taste,and had a very quick discernment of the power of genius) he, no doubt,had recourse to writing plays again for bread, and supporting himselfthe best way he could by his wits, the most unpleasing, and precariousmanner of life, to which any man can be exposed. We cannot be absolutelycertain when Mr. Crowne died; Mr. Coxeter in his notes says, he wasalive in the year 1703, and as he must then have been much advanced inyears, in all probability he did not long survive it. He is the authorof 17 Plays.1. Juliana, or the Princess of Poland, a Tragi-Comedy; acted at the dukeof York's theatre 1671, dedicated to the earl of Orrery.2. Andromache, a Tragedy; acted at the duke's theatre in Covent Garden,1675. This play was only a translation of M. Racine, by a younggentleman, chiefly in prose, and published by Mr. Crown. It was broughtupon the stage, but without success.3. Calisto, or the Chaste Nymph, a masque, 1675; written by command ofthe queen, and oftentimes performed at court by persons of quality. Itis founded on a story in Ovid's Metamorphoses, lib. 2.4. The Country Wit, a Comedy; acted at the duke's theatre 1675. Thisplay contains a good deal of low humour; and was approved by kingCharles the IId.5. The Destruction of Jerusalem, by Titus Vespasian, in two parts, acted1677; addressed to the duchess of Portsmouth. These Tragedies met withextravagant applause, which excited the envy of lord Rochester so much,that on this account he commenced an enemy to the bard he before had somuch befriended.6. The Ambitious Statesman, or the Royal Favourite, a Tragedy; acted atthe theatre-royal 1679. This play had but indifferent success, thoughesteemed by the author one of the best he ever wrote.7. Charles the VIIIth King of France, or the Invasion of Naples by theFrench; this play is written in heroic verse.8. Henry the VIth, the first part, with the murther of Humphrey duke ofGloucester; acted 1681, dedicated to Sir Charles Sedley. This play wasat first acted with applause; but at length, the Romish faction opposedit, and by their interest at court got it suppressed. Part of this playwas borrowed from Shakespear's Henry the VIth.9. Henry the VIth, the second part; or the Miseries of Civil War; aTragedy, acted 1680.10. Thyestes, a Tragedy; acted at the theatre-royal 1681. The plot fromSeneca's Thyestes.11. City Politics, a Comedy, 1683; of this already we have given someaccount.12. Sir Courtly Nice, or It Cannot be; dedicated to the duke of Ormond,of which we have given an account in the author's life.13. Darius King of Persia, a Tragedy; acted in 1688. For the plot, seeQuint. Curt. lib. 3, 4, and 5.14. The English Fryar, or the Town Sparks, a Comedy; printed in quarto1690, dedicated to William earl of Devonshire. This play had not thesuccess of the other pieces of the same author.15. Regulus, a Tragedy; acted at the theatre-royal 1694. The design ofthis play is noble; the example of Regulus being the most celebratedfor honour, and constancy of any of the Romans. There is a play ofthis name, written by Mr. Havard, a comedian now belonging to thetheatre-royal in Drury-lane.16. The Married Beaux, or the Curious Impertinent, a Comedy; acted atthe theatre-royal, 1694, dedicated to the marquis of Normanby. To thisplay the author has prefixed a preface in vindication of himself, fromthe aspersions cast on him by some persons, as to his morals. The storyis taken from Don Quixot.17. Caligula, Emperor of Rome, a Tragedy; acted at the theatre-royal,1698.Our author's other works are, Pandion and Amphigenia, or the coy Lady ofThessalia; adorned with sculptures, printed in octavo, 1665.Daeneids, or the noble Labours of the great Dean of Notre-Dame in Paris,for the erecting in his choir, a Throne for his Glory; and the eclipsingthe pride of an imperious usurping Chanter, an heroic poem, in fourCanto's; printed in quarto 1692. It is a burlesque Poem, and is chieflytaken from Boileau's Lutrin.We shall shew Mr. Crown's versification, by quoting a speech which heputs into the mouth of an Angel, in the Destruction of Jerusalem. TheAngel is represented as descending over the altar prophesying the fallof that august city.  Stay, stay, your flight, fond men, Heaven does despise  All your vain incense, prayers, and sacrifice.  Now is arriv'd Jerusalem's fatal hour,  When she and sacrifice must be no more:  Long against Heav'n had'st thou, rebellious town,  Thy public trumpets of defiance blown;  Didst open wars against thy Lord maintain,  And all his messengers of peace have slain:  And now the hour of his revenge is come,  Thy weeks are finish'd, and thy slumb'ring doom,  Which long has laid in the divine decree,  Is now arous'd from his dull lethargy;  His army's rais'd, and his commission seal'd,  His order's given, and cannot be repeal'd:  And now thy people, temple, altars all  Must in one total dissolution fall.  Heav'n will in sad procession walk the round,  And level all thy buildings with the ground.  And from the soil enrich'd with human blood,  Shall grass spring up, where palaces have stood,  Where beasts shall seed; and a revenge obtain  For all the thousands at thy altars slain.  And this once blessed house, where Angels came  To bathe their airy wings in holy flame,  Like a swift vision or a flash of light,  All wrapt in fire shall vanish in thy sight;  And thrown aside amongst the common store,  Sink down in time's abyss, and rise no more.       *       *       *       *       *CHARLES SACKVILLE, Earl of DORSET,Eldest son of Richard earl of Dorset, born the 24th of January 1637, wasone of the most accomplished gentlemen of the age in which he lived,which was esteemed one of the most courtly ever known in our nation;when, as Pope expresses it,  The soldiers ap'd the gallantries of France,  And ev'ry flow'ry courtier writ romance.Immediately after the restoration, he was chosen member of parliamentfor East-Grimstead, and distinguished himself while he was in theHouse of Commons. The sprightliness of his wit, and a most exceedinggood-nature, recommended him very early to the favour of Charles theIId, and those of the greatest distinction in the court; but his mindbeing more turned to books, and polite conversation, than publicbusiness, he totally declined the latter, tho' as bishop Burnet[1] says,the king courted him as a favorite. Prior in his dedication of hispoems, observes, that when the honour and safety of his country demandedhis assistance, he readily entered into the most active parts of life;and underwent the dangers with a constancy of mind, which shewed he hadnot only read the rules of philosophy, but understood the practice ofthem. He went a volunteer under his royal highness the duke of York inthe first Dutch war, 1665, when the Dutch admiral Opdam was blown up,and about thirty capital ships taken and destroyed; and his composinga song before the engagement, carried with it in the opinion of manypeople to sedate a presence of mind, and such unusual gallantry, that ithas been much celebrated.This Song, upon so memorable an occasion, is comprised in the followingstanzas.  I.  To all you ladies, now at land,       We men at sea indite,  But first would have you understand,    How hard it is to write;  The Muses now, and Neptune too,    We must implore to write to you,                                  With a fa, la, la, la, la.  II.  For tho' the Muses should prove kind,    And fill our empty brain;  Yet if rough Neptune rouze the wind,    To wave the azure main,  Our paper, pen and ink, and we,    Roll up and down our ships at sea,                                                   With a la fa, &c.  III.  Then if we write not, by each post,    Think not, we are unkind;  Nor yet conclude our ships are lost,    By Dutchmen or by wind:  Our tears, we'll send a speedier way,    The tide shall waft them twice a day.                                                  With a fa, &c.  IV.  The king with wonder, and surprize,    Will swear the seas grow bold;  Because the tides will higher rise,    Then e'er they did of old:  But let him knew it is our tears,    Bring floods of grief to Whitehall-Stairs.                                                  With a fa, &c.  V.  Should foggy Opdam chance to know;    Our sad and dismal story;  The Dutch would scorn so weak a foe,    And quit their fort at Goree:  For what resistance can they find,    From men who've left their hearts behind.                                                   With a fa, &c.  VI.  Let wind, and weather do its worst,    Be you to us but kind;  Let Dutchmen vapour, Spaniards curse,    No sorrow we shall find;  'Tis then no matter, how things go,    Or who's our friend, or who's our foe.                                                  With a fa, &c.  VII.  To pass our tedious hours away,    We throw a merry main;  Or else at serious Ombre play;    But why should we in vain  Each other's ruin thus pursue?    We were undone, when we left you.                                                 With a fa, &c.  VIII.  But now our fears tempestuous grow,    And cast our hopes away;  Whilst you, regardless of our woe,    Sit carelessly at play;  Perhaps permit some happier man,    To kiss your hand, or flirt your fan.                                               With a fa, &c.  IX.  When any mournful tune, you hear,    That dies in every note;  And if it sigh'd with each man's care,    For being so remote;  Think then, how often love we've made    To you, when all those tunes were play'd.                                               With a fa, &c.  X.  In justice, you cannot refuse,    To think of our distress;  When we for hopes of honour lose,    Our certain happiness;  All those designs are but to prove,    Ourselves more worthy of your love.                                             With a fa, &c.  XI.  And, now we've told you all our loves,    And likewise all our fears;  In hopes this declaration moves,    Some pity for our tears:  Let's hear of no inconstancy,    We have too much of that at sea.                                            With a fa, &c.To maintain an evenness of temper in the time of danger, is certainlythe highest mark of heroism; but some of the graver cast have been aptto say, this sedate composure somewhat differs from that levity ofdisposition, or frolic humour, that inclines a man to write a song.But, let us consider my lord's fervour of youth, his gaiety of mind,supported by strong spirits, flowing from an honest heart, and, Ibelieve, we shall rather be disposed to admire, than censure him on thisoccasion. Remember too, he was only a volunteer. The conduct of thebattle depended not on him. He had only to shew his intrepidity anddiligence, in executing the orders of his commander, when called on; ashe had no plans of operation to take up his thoughts why not write asong? there was neither indecency, nor immorality in it: I doubt not,but with that chearfulness of mind he composed himself to rest, with asright feelings, and as proper an address to his maker, as any one of amore melancholly disposition, or gloomy aspect.Most commanders, in the day of battle, assume at least a brilliancy ofcountenance, that may encourage their soldiers; and they are admiredfor it: to smile at terror has, before this, been allowed the mark of ahero. The dying Socrates discoursed his friends with great composure; hewas a philosopher of a grave cast: Sir Thomas Moore (old enough to bemy lord's father) jok'd, even on the scaffold; a strong instance of hisheroism, and no contradiction to the rectitude of his mind. The versesthe Emperor Adrian wrought on his death-bed (call them a song if youwill) have been admired, and approved, by several great men; Mr. Popehas not only given his opinion in their favour, but elegantly translatedthem, nay, thought them worthy an imitation, perhaps exceeding theoriginal. If this behaviour of my lord's is liable to differentconstructions, let good nature, and good manners, incline us to bestowthe most favourable thereon.After his fatigues at sea, during the remainder of the reign of Charlesthe IId, he continued to live in honourable leisure. He was of thebed-chamber to the king, and possessed not only his master's favour, butin a great degree his familiarity, never leaving the court but when hewas sent to that of France, upon some short commission, and embassies ofcompliment; as if the king designed to rival the French in thearticle of politeness, who had long claimed a superiority in thataccomplishment, by shewing them that one of the most finished gentlemenin Europe was his subject; and that he understood his worth so well,as not to suffer him to be long out of his presence. Among othercommissions he was sent in the year 1669, to compliment the French kingon his arrival at Dunkirk, in return of the compliment of that monarch,by the duchess of Orleans, then in England.Being possessed of the estate of his uncle the earl of Middlesex, whodied in the year 1674, he was created earl of that county, and baron ofCranfield, by letters patent, dated the fourth of April, 1675. 27 C. II;and in August 1677 succeeded his father as earl of Dorset; as also, inthe post of lord lieutenant of the county of Sussex, having been joinedin the commission with him in 1670[2]. Also the 20th of February 1684 hewas made custos rotulorum for that county.Having buried his first lady, Elizabeth, daughter of Harvey Bagot, ofWhitehall in the county of Warwick, Esq; widow of Charles Berkley, earlof Falmouth, without any issue by her, he married, in the year 1684, thelady Mary, daughter of James Compton, earl of Northampton, famed for herbeauty, and admirable endowments of mind, who was one of the ladies ofthe bed-chamber to Queen Mary, and left his lordship again a widower,August 6, 1691, leaving issue by him one son, his grace Lionel now dukeof Dorset, and a daughter, the lady Mary, married in the year 1702 toHenry Somerset duke of Beaufort, and dying in child-bed, left no issue.The earl of Dorset appeared in court at the trial of the seven bishops,accompanied with other noblemen, which had a good effect on the jury,and brought the judges to a better temper than they had usually shewn.He also engaged with those who were in the prince of Orange's interest;and carried on his part of that enterprize in London, under the eye ofthe court, with the same courage and resolution as his friend the dukeof Devonshire did in open arms, at Nottingham. When prince George ofDenmark deserted King James, and joined the prince of Orange, theprincess Anne was in violent apprehensions of the King's displeasure,and being desirous of withdrawing herself, lord Dorset was thought theproperest guide for her necessary flight[3]. She was secretly broughtto him by his lady's uncle, the bishop of London: who furnished theprincess with every thing necessary for her flight to the Prince ofOrange, and attended her northward, as far as Northampton, where hequickly brought a body of horse to serve for her guard, and went fromthence to Nottingham, to confer with the duke of Devonshire. Afterthe misguided monarch had withdrawn himself, lord Dorset continuedat London, and was one of those peers who sat every day in theCouncil-chamber, and took upon them the government of the realm, in thisextremity, till some other power should be introduced. In the debates inParliament immediately after this confusion, his lordship voted for thevacancy of the throne, and that the prince and princess of Orange shouldbe declared King and Queen of England, &c. When their Majesties hadaccepted the crown of these realms, his lordship was the next day swornof the privy-council, and declared lord chamberlain of the household,'A place, says Prior, which he eminently adorned by the grace of hisperson, the fineness of his breeding, and the knowledge and practice ofwhat was decent and magnificent.' It appears by the history of England,that he had the honour to stand godfather, with King William to a son ofthe prince and princess of Denmark, born at Hampton-court, the 24th ofJuly 1689, and christened the 27th by the name of William, whom hisMajesty declared duke of Gloucester. When the King had been earnestlyentreated by the States of Holland, and the confederate princes inGermany, to meet at a general congress to be held at the Hague, inorder to concert matters for the better support of the confederacy, andthereupon took shipping the 16th of January 1692, his lordship wasamong the peers, who to honour their King and Country, waited on theirsovereign in that cold season. When they were two or three leagues offGoree, his Majesty having by bad weather been four days at sea, was soimpatient to go on shore, that taking boat, and a thick fog rising soonafter, they were surrounded so closely with ice, as not to be ableeither to make the shore, or get back to the ship; so that lyingtwenty-two hours, enduring the most bitter cold, and almost despairingof life, they could hardly stand or speak at their landing; and hislordship was so lame, that for some time he did not recover; yet onhis return to England, he neither complained of the accident nor theexpence.On the 2d of February 1691, at a chapter of the most noble order of thegarter, held at Kensington, his lordship was elected one of the knightscompanions of this order, with his highness John-George, the fourthelector of Saxony, and was installed at Windsor on the Februaryfollowing. He was constituted four times one of the regents of thekingdom in his Majesty's absence. About the year 1698, his healthsensibly declining, he left public business to those who more delightedin it, and appeared only sometimes at council, to shew his respect tothe commission which he bore, for he had already tasted all the comfortwhich court favour could bestow; he had been high in office, respectedby his sovereign and the idol of the people; but now when the eveningof life approached, he began to look upon such enjoyments with lessveneration, and thought proper to dedicate some of his last hours toquiet and meditation. Being advised to go to Bath for the recovery ofhis health, he there ended his life on the 29th of January 1705-6, andwas buried at Witham on the 17th of February following.Lord Dorset was a great patron of men of letters and merit. Dr. Sprat,bishop of Rochester, celebrated for his polite writings, appealed to himwhen under a cloud, for the part he acted in the reign of King JamesII. and by his lordship's interest preserved himself. To him Mr. Drydendedicated his translation of Juvenal, in which he is very lavish in hislordship's praise, and expresses his gratitude for the bounty he hadexperienced from him.Mr. Prior (among others who owed their life and fortune to my lordDorset) makes this public acknowledgment, 'That he scarce knew what lifewas, sooner than he found himself obliged to his favour; or had reasonto feel any sorrow so sensibly as that of his death.' Mr. Prior thenproceeds to enumerate the valuable qualities of his patron; in which thewarmth of his gratitude appears in the most elegant panegyric. I cannotimagine that Mr. Prior, with respect to his lordship's morals, hasin the least violated truth; for he has shewn the picture in variouslights, and has hinted at his patron's errors, as well as his graces andvirtues. Among his errors was that of indulging passion, which carriedhim into transports, of which he was often ashamed; and during theselittle excesses (says he) 'I have known his servants get into his way,that they might make a merit of it immediately after; for he who had thegood fortune to be chid, was sure of being rewarded for it.'His lordship's poetical works have been published among the minorpoets 1749, and consist chiefly of a poem to Mr. Edward Howard, on hisincomprehensible poem called the British Princes, in which his lordshipis very satyrical upon that author.Verses to Sir Thomas St. Serfe, on his printing his play called Tarugo'sWiles, acted 1668.An Epilogue to Moliere's Tartuff.An epilogue on the revival of Ben Johnson's play called Every Man in hisHumour.A Song writ at Sea, in the time of the Dutch war 1665, the night beforean engagement.Verses addressed to the Countess of Dorchester.A Satirical piece, entitled, A Faithful Catalogue of our most eminentNinnies; written in the year 1683.Several Songs.From the specimens lord Dorset has given us of his poetical talents, weare inclined to wish, that affairs of higher consequence had permittedhim to have dedicated more of his time to the Muses. Though some criticsmay alledge, that what he has given the public is rather pretty thangreat; and that a few pieces of a light nature do not sufficientlyentitle him to the character of a first rate poet; yet, when weconsider, that notwithstanding they were merely the amusement of hisleisure hours, and mostly the productions of his youth, they containmarks of a genius, and as such, he is celebrated by Dryden, Prior,Congreve, Pope, &c.We shall conclude his life with the encomium Pope bestows on him, in thefollowing beautiful lines.  Dorset, the grace of courts, the muses pride,  Patron of arts, and judge of nature, dy'd:  The scourge of pride, the sanctify'd or great,  Of fops in learning, and of knaves in state.  Yet soft his nature, tho severe his lay,  His anger moral, and his wisdom gay.  Blest satyrist, who touch'd the mean so true,  As shew'd vice had his hate and pity too.  Blest courtier! who could King and Country please,  Yet sacred keep his friendship, and his ease.  Blest peer! his great forefathers ev'ry grace  Reflecting, and reflected in his race;  Where other Buckhursts, other Dorsets thine.  And patriots still, or poets deck the line[Footnote 1: History of his own times; p. 264.][Footnote 2: Collin's Peerage, p. 575. vol. I.][Footnote 3: Burnet's Hist. of his own times.]       *       *       *       *       *Mr. GEORGE FARQUHARWas descended of a Family of no mean rank in the North of Ireland; wehave been informed that his father was dean of Armagh, but we have notmet with a proper confirmation of this circumstance; but it is onall hands agreed, that he was the son of a clergyman, and born atLondon-Derry in that kingdom, in the year 1678, as appears from SirJames Ware's account of him. There he received the rudiments ofeducation, and discovered a genius early devoted to the Muses; Before hewas ten years of age he gave specimens of his poetry, in which, force ofthinking, and elegance of turn and expression are manifest; and ifthe author, who has wrote Memoirs of his life, may be credited, thefollowing stanza's were written by him at that age,  The pliant soul of erring youth,    Is like soft wax, or moisten'd clay;  Apt to receive all heavenly truth    Or yield to tyrant ill the sway.  Slight folly in your early years,    At manhood may to virtue rise;  But he who in his youth appears    A fool, in age will ne'er be wise.His parents, it is said, had a numerous family, so could bestow nofortune upon him, further than a genteel education. When he wasqualified for the university, he was, in 1694, sent to Trinity Collegein Dublin: here, by the progress he made in his studies, he acquired aconsiderable reputation[1], but it does not appear, that he there tookhis degree of bachelor of arts; for his disposition being volatile andgiddy, he soon grew weary of a dull collegiate life; and his own opinionof it, in that sense, he afterwards freely enough displayed in severalparts of his comedies, and other writings. Besides, the expence of it,without any immediate prospect of returns, might be inconsistent withhis circumstances. The polite entertainments of the town more forciblyattracted his attention, especially the diversions of the Theatre, forwhich, he discovered a violent propension. When Mr. Ashbury, who thenwas manager of Dublin Theatre, had recruited his company with thecelebrated Mr. Wilks (who had for some seasons engaged with Mr.Christopher Rich at Drury-Lane, from whom his encouragement was notequal to his merit) Farquhar having acquaintance with him, Mr. Wilks,was soon introduced upon the stage by his means, where he did not longcontinue, nor make any considerable figure. His person was sufficientlyadvantageous, he had a ready memory, proper gesture, and just elocution,but then he was unhappy in his voice, which had not power enough torouse the galleries, or to rant with any success; besides, he wasdefective in point of assurance, nor could ever enough overcome hisnatural timidity. His more excellent talents however might, perhaps,have continued the player at Dublin, and lost the poet at London; butfor an accident, which was likely to turn a feigned tragedy into a realone: The story is this.Mr. Farquhar was extremely beloved in Ireland; having the advantage ofa good person, though his voice was weak; he never met with the leastrepulse from the audience in any of his performances: He thereforeresolved to continue on the stage till something better should offer,but his resolution was soon broke by an accident. Being to play the partof Guyomar in Dryden's Indian Emperor, who kills Vasquez, one of theSpanish generals; and forgetting to exchange his sword for a foil, inthe engagement he wounded his brother tragedian, who acted Vasquez, verydangerously; and though it proved not mortal, yet it so shocked thenatural tenderness of Mr. Farquhar's temper, that it put a period to hisacting ever after.Soon after this, Mr. Wilks received from Mr. Rich a proposal of fourpounds a week, if he would return to London (such was the extent of thesalaries of the best players in that time, which, in our days, is notequal to that of a second rate performer) which he thought proper toaccept of; and Mr. Farquhar, who now had no inducement to remain atDublin, accompanied Mr. Wilks to London, in the year 1696. Mr. Wilks,who was well acquainted with the humour and abilities of our author,ceased not his solicitation 'till he prevailed upon him to write a play,assuring him, that he was considered by all who knew him in a muchbrighter light than he had as yet shewn himself, and that he was fitterto exhibit entertaining compositions for the stage, than to echo thoseof other poets upon it.But he received still higher encouragement by the patronage of the earlof Orrery, who was a discerner of merit, and saw, that as yet, Mr.Farquhar's went unrewarded. His lordship conferred a lieutenant'scommission upon him in his own regiment then in Ireland, which heheld several years[2] and, as an officer, he behaved himself withoutreproach, and gave several instances both of courage and conduct:Whether he received his commission before or after he obliged the townwith his first comedy, we cannot be certain.In the year 1698, his first Comedy called Love and a Bottle appearedon the stage, and for its sprightly dialogue, and busy scenes was wellreceived by the audience, though Wilks had no part in it. In 1699the celebrated Mrs. Anne Oldfield was, partly upon his judgment, andrecommendation, admitted on the Theatre.Now we have mentioned Mrs. Oldfield, we shall present the reader withthe following anecdote concerning that celebrated actress, whichdiscovers the true manner of her coming on the stage; the account wehave from a person who belonged to Mr. Rich, in a letter he wrote to theeditor of Mrs. Oldfield's Life, in which it is printed in these words;  SIR,  In your Memoirs of Mrs. Oldfield, it may  not be amiss to insert the following facts, on the  truth of which you may depend. Her father,  captain Oldfield, not only run out all the military,  but the paternal bounds of his fortune, having  a pretty estate in houses in Pall-mall. It was  wholly owing to captain Farquhar, that Mrs.  Oldfield became an actress, from the following  incident; dining one day at her aunt's, who kept  the Mitre Tavern in St. James's Market, he  heard miss Nanny reading a play behind the bar,  with so proper an emphasis, and so agreeable  turns suitable to each character, that he swore  the girl was cut out for the stage, for which she  had before always expressed an inclination, being  very desirous to try her fortune that way.  Her mother, the next time she saw captain Vanburgh,  who had a great respect for the family,  told him what was captain Farquhar's opinion;  upon which he desired to know whether in the  plays she read, her fancy was most pleased with  tragedy or comedy; miss being called in, said  comedy, she having at that time gone through all  Beaumont and Fletcher's comedies, and the play  she was reading when captain Farquhar dined  there, was the Scornful Lady. Captain Vanburgh,  shortly after, recommended her to Mr.  Christopher Rich, who took her into the house  at the allowance of fifteen shillings a week. However,  her agreeable figure, and sweetness of voice,  soon gave her the preference, in the opinion of the  whole town, to all our young actresses, and his grace  the late duke of Bedford, being pleased to speak,  to Mr. Rich in her favour, he instantly raised her  allowance to twenty shillings a week; her fame  and salary at last rose to her just merit,  Your humble servant,  Nov. 25, 1730[3].  CHARLES TAYLOUR.'In the beginning of the year 1700, Farquhar brought his Constant Couple,or Trip to the Jubilee, upon the stage, it being then the jubilee yearat Rome; but our author drew so gay, and airy a figure in Sir HarryWildair, so suited to Mr. Wilks's talents, and so animated by hisgesture, and vivacity of spirit, that it is not determined whether thepoet or the player received most reputation by it. Towards the latterend of this year we meet with Mr. Farquhar in Holland, probably uponhis military duty, from whence he has given a description in two of hisletters dated that year from Brill, and from Leyden, no less true thanhumorous, as well of those places as the people; and in a third, datedfrom the Hague he very facetiously relates how merry he was there, ata treat made by the earl of Westmoreland, while, not only himself, butking William, and other of his subjects were detained there by a violentstorm, which he has no less humorously described, and has, among hispoems, written also an ingenious copy of verses to his mistress on thesame subject. Whether this mistress was the same person he calls hischarming Penelope, in several of his love letters addressed to her, weknow not, but we have been informed by an old officer in the army, whowell knew Mr. Farquhar, that by that name we are to understand Mrs.Oldfield, and that the person meant by Mrs. V---- in one of them, saidto be her bedfellow, was Mrs. Verbruggen the actress, the same who wassome years before Mrs. Mountfort, whom Mrs. Oldfield succeeded,(when Mrs. V---- died some years after in child-bed) with singularcommendation, in her principal parts; and from so bright a flame it wasno wonder that Farquhar was more than ordinarily heated. The author ofMrs. Oldfield's life says, that she has often heard her mention someagreeable hours she spent with captain Farquhar: As she was a lady oftrue delicacy, nor meanly prostituted herself to every adorer, itwould be highly ungenerous to suppose, that their hours ever passed incriminal freedoms. And 'tis well known, whatever were her failings, shewronged no man's wife; nor had an husband to injure.Mr. Farquhar, encouraged by the success of his last piece, made acontinuation of it in 1701, and brought on his Sir Harry Wildair; inwhich Mrs. Oldfield received as much reputation, and was as greatlyadmired in her part, as Wilks was in his.In the next year he published his Miscellanies, or Collection of Poems,Letters, and Essays, already mentioned, and which contain a variety ofhumorous, and pleasant sallies of fancy: There is amongst them a copy ofverses addressed to his dear Penelope, upon her wearing her Masque theevening before, which was a female fashion in those days, as well atpublic walks, as among the spectators at the Playhouse. These versesnaturally display his temper and talents, and will afford a very clearidea of them; and therefore we shall here insert them.'The arguments you made use of last night for keeping on your masque, Iendeavoured to defeat with reason, but that proving ineffectual, I'lltry the force of rhyme, and send you the heads of our chat, in apoetical dialogue between You and I.'  You.  Thus images are veil'd which you adore;  Your ignorance does raise your zeal the more.  I.  All image worship for false zeal is held;  False idols ought indeed to be conceal'd.  You.  Thus oracles of old were still receiv'd;  The more ambiguous, still the more believ'd.  I.  But oracles of old were seldom true,  The devil was in them, sure he's not in you.  You.  Thus mask'd in mysteries does the godhead stand:  The more obscure, the greater his command.  I.  The Godhead's hidden power would soon be past,  Did we not hope to see his face at last.  You.  You are my slave already sir, you know,  To Shew more charms, would but increase your  woe,  I scorn an insult to a conquer'd foe.  I.  I am your slave, 'tis true, but still you see,  All slaves by nature struggle to be free;  But if you would secure the stubborn prize,  Add to your wit, the setters of your eyes;  Then pleas'd with thraldom, would I kiss my  chain  And ne'er think more of liberty again.[4]It is said, some of the letters of which we have been speaking, werepublished from the copies returned him at his request, by Mrs. Oldfield,and that she delighted to read them many years after they were printed,as she also did the judicious essay at the end of them, which is calleda Discourse upon Comedy, in Reference to the English Stage; but whatgives a yet more natural and lively representation of our author still,is one among those letters, which he calls the Picture, containing adescription and character of himself, which we should not now omittranscribing, if his works were not in every body's hands.In 1703 came out another Comedy, entitled the Inconstant, or the Way toWin Him, which had sufficient merit to have procured equal success tothe rest; but for the inundation of Italian, French, and other farcicalinterruptions, which, through the interest of some, and the depravedtaste of others, broke in upon the stage like a torrent, and swept downbefore thorn all taste for competitions of a more intrinsic excellence.These foreign monsters obtained partisans amongst our own countrymen, inopposition to English humour, genuine wit, and the sublime efforts ofgenius, and substituted in their room the airy entertainments of dancingand singing, which conveyed no instruction, awakened no generouspassion, nor filled the breast with any thing great or manly. Such wasthe prevalence of these airy nothings, that our author's comedy wasneglected for them, and the tragedy of Phaedra slid Hippolitus, which forpoetry is equal to any in our tongue, (and though Mr. Addison wrotethe prologue, and Prior the epilogue) was suffered to languish, whilemultitudes flocked to hear the warblings of foreign eunuchs, whosehighest excellence, as Young expresses it, was,  'Nonsense well tun'd with sweet stupidity.'Very early in the year 1704, a farce: called the Stage Coach, in thecomposition whereof he was jointly concerned with another, made itsfirst appearance in print, and it has always given satisfaction.Mr. Farquhar had now been about a twelve-month married, and it was atfirst reported, to a great fortune; which indeed he expected, but wasmiserably disappointed. The lady had fallen in love with him, and soviolent was her passion, that she resolved to have him at any rate; andas she knew Farquhar was too much dissipated in life to fall in love, orto think of matrimony unless advantage was annexed to it, she fell uponthe stratagem of giving herself out for a great fortune, and then tookan opportunity of letting our poet know that she was in love with him.Vanity and interest both uniting to persuade Farquhar to marry, he didnot long delay it, and, to his immortal honour let it be spoken, thoughhe found himself deceived, his circumstances embarrassed, and his familygrowing upon him, he never once upbraided her for the cheat, but behavedto her with, all the delicacy, and tenderness of an indulgent husband.His next comedy named the Twin-Rivals, was played in 1705.Our poet was possessed of his commission in the army when the Spanishexpedition was made under the conduct of the earl of Peterborough, tho'it seems he did not keep it long after, and tho' he was not embarked inthat service, or present at the defeat of the French forces, andthe conquest of Barcelona; yet from some military friends in thatengagement, he received such distinct relations of it in theirepistolary correspondency, that he wrote a poem upon the subject, inwhich he has made the earl his hero. Two or three years after it waswritten, the impression of it was dedicated by the author's widow to thesame nobleman, in which are some fulsome strains of panegyric, whichperhaps her necessity excited her to use, from a view of enhancing herinterest by flattery, which if excusable at all, is certainly so in awoman left destitute with a family, as she was.In 1706 a comedy called the Recruiting Officer was acted at thetheatre-royal. He dedicates to all friends round the Wrekin, a notedhill near Shrewsbury, where he had been to recruit for his company; andwhere, from his observations on country-life, the manner that serjeantsinveigle clowns to enlist, and the behaviour of the officers towards themilk-maids and country-wenches, whom they seldom fail of debauching, hecollected matter sufficient to build a comedy upon, and in which hewas successful: Even now that comedy fails not to bring full houses,especially when the parts of Captain Plume, Captain Brazen, Sylvia, andSerjeant Kite are properly disposed of.His last play was the Beaux--Stratagem, of which he did not live toenjoy the full success.Of this pleasing author's untimely end, we can give but a melancholyaccount.He was oppressed with some debts which obliged him to make applicationto a certain noble courtier, who had given him formerly many professionsof friendship. He could not bear the thought that his wife and familywould want, and in this perplexity was ready to embrace any expedientfor their relief. His pretended patron persuaded him to convert hiscommission into the money he wanted, and pledged his honour, that in avery short time he would provide him another. This circumstance appearedfavourable, and the easy bard accordingly sold his commission; but whenhe renewed his application to the nobleman, and represented his needysituation, the latter had forgot his promise, or rather, perhaps, hadnever resolved to fulfil it.This distracting disappointment so preyed upon the mind of Mr. Farquhar,who saw nothing but beggary and want before him, that by a sure, tho'not sudden declension of nature, it carried him off this worldlytheatre, while his last play was acting in the height of success at thatof Drury-lane; and tho' the audience bestowed the loudest applauses uponthe performance, yet they could scarce forbear mingling tears with theirmirth for the approaching loss of its author, which happened in thelatter end of April 1707, before he was thirty years of age.Thus having attended our entertaining dramatist o'er the contractedstage of his short life, thro' the various characters he performed init, of the player, the lover, and the husband, the soldier, the critic,and the poet, to his final catastrophe, it is here time to close thescene. However, we shall take the liberty to subjoin a short characterof his works, and some farther observations on his genius.It would be injurious to the memory of Wilks not to take notice here, ofhis generous behaviour towards the two daughters of his deceased friend.He proposed to his brother managers, (who readily came into it) to giveeach of them a benefit, to apprentice them to mantua-makers; which is aninstance amongst many others that might be produced, of the great worthof that excellent comedian.The general character which has been given of Mr. Farquhar's comediesis, 'That the success of the most of them far exceeded the author'sexpectations; that he was particularly happy in the choice of hissubjects, which he took care to adorn with a variety of charactersand incidents; his style is pure and unaffected, his wit natural andflowing, and his plots generally well contrived. He lashed the vices ofthe age, tho' with a merciful hand; for his muse was good-natured, notabounding over-much with gall, tho' he has been blamed for it by thecritics: It has been objected to him, that he was too hasty in hisproductions; but by such only who are admirers of stiff and elaborateperformances, since with a person of a sprightly fancy, those things areoften best, that are struck off in a heat[5]. It is thought that in allhis heroes, he generally sketched out his own character, of a young,gay, rakish spark, blessed with parts and abilities. His works areloose, tho' not so grossly libertine, as some other wits of his time,and leave not so pernicious impressions on the imagination as otherfigures of the like kind more strongly stampt by indelicate and heavierhands.'He seems to have been a man of a genius rather sprightly than great,rather flow'ry than solid; his comedies are diverting, because hischaracters are natural, and such as we frequently meet with; but he hasused no art in drawing them, nor does there appear any force of thinkingin his performances, or any deep penetration into nature; but rather asuperficial view, pleasant enough to the eye, though capable of leavingno great impression on the mind. He drew his observations chieflyfrom those he conversed with, and has seldom given any additionalheightening, or indelible marks to his characters; which was thepeculiar excellence of Shakespear, Johnson, and Congreve.Had he lived to have gained a more general knowledge of life, or had hiscircumstances not been straitened, and so prevented his mingling withpersons of rank, we might have seen his plays embellished with morefinished characters, and with a more polished dialogue.He had certainly a lively imagination, but then it was capable of nogreat compass; he had wit, but it was of no peculiar a sort, as notto gain ground upon consideration; and it is certainly true, that hiscomedies in general owe their success full as much to the player, as toany thing intrinsically excellent in themselves.If he was not a man of the highest genius, he seems to have hadexcellent moral qualities, of which his behaviour to his wife andtenderness to his children are proofs, and deserved a better fate thanto die oppressed with want, and under the calamitous apprehensions ofleaving his family destitute: While Farquhar will ever be rememberedwith pleasure by people of taste, the name of the courtier who thusinhumanly ruined him, will be for ever dedicated to infamy.[Footnote 1: Memoirs of Wilks by Obrian, 8vo. 1732.][Footnote 2: Memoirs of Mr. Farquhar, before his Works.][Footnote 3: For the moral character of Mrs. Oldfield, see the Life ofSavage.][Footnote 4: Farquhar's Letters.][Footnote 5: Memoirs, ubi. supra.]       *       *       *       *       *EDWARD RAVENSCROFT.This gentleman is author of eleven plays, which gives him a kind ofright to be named in this collection. Some have been of opinion, he wasa poet of a low rate, others that he was only a wit collector; be thisas it may, he acquired, some distinction by the vigorous opposition hemade to Dryden: And having chosen so powerful an antagonist, he hasacquired more honour by it, than by all his other works put together; heaccuses Dryden of plagiary, and treats him severely.Mr. Dryden, indeed, had first attacked his Mamamouchi; which provokedRavenscroft to retort so harshly upon him; but in the opinion of Mr.Langbain, the charge of plagiarism as properly belonged to Ravenfcrofthimself as to Dryden; tho' there was this essential difference betweenthe plagiary of one and that of the other; that Dryden turned whateverhe borrowed into gold, and Ravenscroft made use of other people'smaterials, without placing them in a new light, or giving them anygraces, they had not before.Ravenscroft thus proceeds against Mr. Dryden: 'That I may maintainthe character of impartial, to which I pretend, I must pull off hisdisguise, and discover the politic plagiary that lurks under it. I knowhe has endeavoured to shew himself matter of the art of swift writing,and would persuade the world that what he writes is extempore wit,currente calamo. But I doubt not to shew that tho' he would be thoughtto imitate the silk worm that spins its webb from its own bowels, yet Ishall make him appear like the leech that lives upon the blood of men,drawn from the gums, and when he is rubbed with salt, spues it up again.To prove this, I shall only give an account of his plays, and by thatlittle of my own knowledge, that I shall discover, it will be manifest,that this rickety poet, (tho' of so many years) cannot go without othersassistance; for take this prophecy from your humble servant, or Mr.Ravenscroft's Mamamouchi, which you please,  'When once our poet's translating vein is past,  From him, you can't expect new plays in haste.Thus far Mr. Ravenscroft has censured Dryden; and Langbain, in order toprove him guilty of the same poetical depredation, has been industriousto trace the plots of his plays, and the similarity of his characterswith those of other dramatic poets; but as we should reckon it tediousto follow him in this manner, we shall only in general take notice ofthose novels from which he has drawn his plots.We cannot ascertain the year in which this man died; he had been breda templer, which he forsook as a dry unentertaining study, and muchbeneath the genius of a poet.His dramatic works are,1. The Careless Lovers, a Comedy, acted at the duke's theatre, 4to.1673. The scene Covent-Garden, part of this play is borrowed fromMoliere's Monsieur de Pourceaugnac.2. Mamamouchi; or the Citizen turned Gentleman, a Comedy, acted at theduke's theatre, 4to. 1675, dedicated to his Highness prince Rupert. Partof this play is taken from Moliere's le Bourgeois Gentilliome. SceneLondon.3. Scaramouch a Philosopher, Harlequin a schoolboy, Bravo Merchant andMagician; a Comedy, after the Italian manner, acted at the theatre-royal1677. The poet in his preface to this play boasts his having brought anew sort of Comedy on our stage; but his critics will not allow any onescene of it to be the genuine offspring of his own brain, and denominatehim rather the midwife than the parent of this piece; part of it istaken from le Burgeois Gentilhome, & la Marriage Force.4. The Wrangling Lovers; or the Invisible Mistress, a Comedy, acted atthe duke's theatre, 4to. 1677. This play is founded upon Corneille's LesEngagements du Hazard, and a Spanish Romance, called, Deceptio visus; orseeing and believing are two things.5. King Edgar, and Alfreda, a Tragedy, acted at the theatre-royal 1677.The story is taken from the Annals of Love, a novel, and Malmesbury,Grafton, Stow, Speed, and other English chronicles.6. The English Lawyer, a Comedy; acted at the theatre-royal 1678; thisis only a translation of the celebrated latin comedy of Ignoramus,written by Mr. Ruggle of Clare-hall, Cambridge. Scene Bourdeaux.7. The London Cuckolds, a Comedy; acted at the duke of York's theatre.This play is collected from the novels of various authors, and isesteemed one of the most diverting, though perhaps the most offensiveplay of the author's; it was first acted 1682. This play has hithertokept possession of the flags, a circumstance owing to the annualcelebration of the lord mayor's inauguration: Though it seems to begrowing into a just disesteem. It was deprived of its annual appearanceat Drury-Lane Theatre, in the year 1752, by Mr. Garrick; whose goodsense would not suffer him to continue so unwarrantable and ridiculousan insult, upon so respectable a body of men as the magistrates of thecity of London.The citizens are exposed to the highest ridicule in it; and the scenesare loose and indecent. The reason why the comic poets have so oftendeclared themselves open enemies to the citizens, was plainly this: Thecity magistrates had always opposed the court, on which the poets hadtheir dependance, and therefore took this method of revenge.8. Dame Dobson, or the Cunning Woman, a Comedy; acted and damn'd at theduke's theatre, printed in quarto, 1684. This is a translation of aFrench comedy.9. The Canterbury Guests, or a Bargain Broken, a Comedy; acted at thetheatre-royal, in 1695.10. The Anatomist, or the Sham Doctor, a Comedy; acted at thetheatre-royal in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, 1697.11. The Italian Husband, a Tragedy; acted at the theatre inLincoln's-Inn-Fields 1698. To this play, besides the prologue, isprefixed a dialogue, which the author calls the prelude, managed by thepoet, a critic, and one Mr. Peregrine the poet's friend. The author hereseems to be under the same mistake with other modern writers, who arefond of barbarous and bloody stories. The Epilogue is written by Jo.Haynes.       *       *       *       *       *JOHN PHILIPS,A poet of very considerable eminence, was son of Dr. Stephen Philips,arch-deacon of Salop, and born at Brampton in Oxfordshire, December 30,1676. After he had received a grammatical education at home, he was sentto Winchester school, where he made himself master of the Latin andGreek languages, and was soon distinguished for an happy imitation ofthe excellences which he discovered in the best classical authors. Withthis foundation he was removed to Christ's Church in Oxford, where heperformed all his university exercises with applause, and besides othervaluable authors in the poetical way, he became particularly acquaintedwith, and studied the works of Milton. The ingenious Mr. George Sewel,in his life and character of our author, observes, 'that there was notan allusion in Paradise Lost, drawn from the thoughts and expressions ofHomer or Virgil, which Mr. Philips could not immediately refer to, andby that he perceived what a peculiar life and grace their sentimentsadded to English poetry; how much their images raised its spirit,and what weight and beauty their words, when translated, gave to itslanguage: nor was he less curious in observing the force and elegance ofhis mother tongue; but by the example of his darling Milton, searchedbackwards into the works of our old English poets, to furnish him withproper sounding, and significant expressions, and prove the due extent,and compass of the language. For this purpose he carefully read overChaucer and Spencer, and afterwards, in his writings, did not scrupleto revive any words or phrases which he thought deserved it, with thatmodesty, and liberty which Horace allows of, either in the coining ofnew, or the restoring of ancient expressions.' Our author, however,was not so much enamoured of poetry, as to neglect other parts ofliterature, but was very well acquainted with the whole compass ofnatural philosophy. He seems in his studies, as well as his writings, tohave made Virgil his pattern, and often to have broken out with him inthe following rapturous wish, in the Second Book of the Georgies which,for the sake of the English reader, we shall give in Mr. Dryden'stranslation.  'Give me the ways of wand'ring stars to know,  The depths of heav'n above, or earth below;  Teach me the various labours of the moon,  And whence proceed the eclipses of the sun.  Why slowing tides prevail upon the main,  And in what dark recess they shrink again.  What shakes the solid earth, what cause delays  The summer-nights, and the short winter days.'Mr. Philips was a passionate admirer of nature, and it is not improbablebut he drew his own character in that description which he gives of aphilosophical and retired life, at the latter end of the first Book ofhis Cyder.  --He to his labour hies,  Gladsome intent on somewhat that may ease  Unearthly mortals and with curious search  Examine all the properties of herbs,  Fossils, and minerals, that th' embowell'd earth  Displays, if by his industry he can  Benefit human race.Though the reader will easily discover the unpoetical flatness of theabove lines, yet they shew a great thirst after natural knowledge, andwe have reason to believe, that much might have been attained, and manynew discoveries made, by so diligent an enquirer, and so faithful arecorder of physical operations. However, though death prevented thehopes of the world in that respect, yet the passages of that kind, whichwe find in his Poem on Cyder, may convince us of the niceness of hisobservations in natural causes. Besides this, he was particularlyskilled in antiquities, especially those of his own country; and partof this study too, he has with much art and beauty intermixed with hispoetry.While Mr. Philips continued at the university, he was honoured with theacquaintance of the best and politest men in it, and had a particularintimacy with Mr. Edmund Smith, author of Phaedra and Hippolitus. Thefirst poem which got him reputation, was his Splendid Shilling, whichthe author of the Tatler has stiled the best burlesque poem in theEnglish Language; nor was it only, says Mr. Sewel, 'the finest of thatkind in our tongue, but handled in a manner quite different from whathad been made use of by any author of our own, or other nation, thesentiments, and stile being in this both new; whereas in those, the jestlies more in allusions to the thoughts and fables of the ancients, thanin the pomp of expression. The same humour is continued thro' the whole,and not unnaturally diversified, as most poems of that nature had beenbefore.Out of that variety of circumstances, which his fruitful invention mustsuggest to him, on such a subject, he has not chosen any but what arediverting to every reader, and some, that none but his inimitable dresscould have made diverting to any: when we read it, we are betrayedinto a pleasure which we could not expect, tho' at the same time thesublimity of the stile, and the gravity of the phrase, seem to chastisethat laughter which they provoke.' Mr. Edmund Smith in his beautifulverses on our Author's Death, speaks thus concerning this poem;  'In her best light the comic muse appears,  When she with borrowed pride the buskin  wears.'This account given by Mr. Sewel of the Splendid Shilling, is perhapsheightened by personal friendship, and that admiration which wenaturally pay to the productions of one we love. The stile seems tobe unnatural for a poem which is intended to raise laughter; for thatlaboured gravity has rather a contrary influence; disposing the mind tobe serious: and the disappointment is not small, when a man finds hehas been betrayed into solemn thinking, in reading the description of atrifle; if the gravity of the phrase chastises the laughter, the purposeof the poem is defeated, and it is a rule in writing to suit thelanguage to the subject. Philips's Splendid Shilling may have pleased,because, its manner was new, and we often find people of the best sensethrow away their admiration on monsters, which are seldom to be seen,and neglect more regular beauty, and juster proportion.It is with reserve we offer this criticism against the authority of Dr.Sewel, and the Tatler; but we have resolved to be impartial, and thereader who is convinced of the propriety and beauty of the SplendidShilling, has, no doubt, as good a right to reject our criticism, as wehad to make it.Our author's coming to London, we are informed, was owing to thepersuasion of some great persons, who engaged him to write on the Battleof Blenheim; his poem upon which introduced him to the earl of Oxford,and Henry St. John, esq; afterwards lord viscount Bolingbroke, and othernoble patrons. His swelling stile, it must be owned, was better suitedto a subject of this gravity and importance, than to that of a light andludicrous nature: the exordium of this piece is poetical, and has anallusion to that of Spencer's Fairy Queen:  From low and abject themes the grov'ling muse  Now mounts aerial to sing of arms  Triumphant, and emblaze the martial acts  Of Britain's hero.The next poem of our author was his Cyder, the plan of which he laid atOxford, and afterwards compleated it in London. He was determined tomake choice of this subject, from the violent passion he had for theproductions of nature, and to do honour to his native country. The poemwas founded upon the model of Virgil's Georgics, and approaches prettynear it, which, in the opinion of critics in general, and Mr. Dryden inparticular, even excels the Divine AEneid: He imitates Virgil rather likea pursuer, than a follower, not servilely tracing, but emulating hisbeauties; his conduct and management are superior to all other copiersof that original; and even the admired Rapin (says Dr. Sewel) is muchbelow him, both in design and success, 'for the Frenchman either fillshis garden with the idle fables of antiquity, or new transformationsof his own; and, in contradiction of the rules of criticism, hasinjudiciously blended the serious, and sublime stile of Virgil, with theelegant turns of Ovid in his Metamorphosis; nor has the great genius ofCowley succeeded better in his Books of Plants, who, besides the samefaults with the former, is continually varying his numbers from one sortof verse to another, and alluding to remote hints of medicinal writers,which, though allowed to be useful, are yet so numerous, that theyflatten the dignity of verse, and sink it from a poem, to a treatise ofphysic,' Dr. Sewel has informed us, that Mr. Philips intended to havewritten a poem on the Resurrection, and the Day of Judgment, and we mayreasonably presume, that in such a work, he would have exceeded hisother performances. This awful subject is proper to be treated in asolemn stile, and dignified with the noblest images; and we need notdoubt from his just notions of religion, and the genuine spirit ofpoetry, which were conspicuous in him, he would have carried his readersthrough these tremendous scenes, with an exalted reverence, which,however, might not participate of enthusiasm. The meanest soul, and thelowest imagination cannot contemplate these alarming events describedin Holy Writ, without the deepest impressions: what then might we notexpect from the heart of a good man, and the regulated flights andraptures of a christian poet? Our author's friend Mr. Smith, who hadprobably seen the first rudiments of his design, speaks thus of it, in apoem upon his death.  O! had relenting Heaven prolong'd his days,  The tow'ring bard had sung in nobler lays:  How the last trumpet wakes the lazy dead;  How saints aloft the cross triumphant spread;  How opening Heav'ns their happier regions, shew,  And yawning gulphs with flaming vengeance glow,  And saints rejoice above, and sinners howl below.  Well might he sing the day he could not fear,  And paint the glories he was sure to wear.All that we have left more of this poet, is a Latin Ode to Henry St.John, esq; which is esteemed a master-piece; the stile being pure andelegant, the subject of a mixt nature, resembling the Jublime spirit,and gay facetious humour of Horace. He was beloved, says Dr. Sewel, 'byall who knew him; somewhat reserved and silent amongst strangers, butfree, familiar, and easy with his friends; he was averse to disputes,and thought no time so ill spent, and no wit so ill used, as that whichwas employed in such debates; his whole life was distinguished by anatural goodness, and well-grounded and unaffected piety, an universalcharity, and a steady adherence to his principles; no one observed thenatural and civil duties of life with a stricter regard, whether a son,a friend, or a member of society, and he had the happiness to fill everyone of these parts, without even the suspicion either of undutifulness,insincerity, or disrespect. Thus he continued to the last, not owing hisvirtues to the happiness of his constitution, but the frame of hismind, insomuch, that during a long sickness, which is apt to ruffle thesmoothest temper; he never betrayed any discontent or uneasiness, theintegrity of his life still preserving the chearfulness of his spirits;and if his friends had measured their hopes of his life, only by hisunconcern in his sickness, they could not but conclude, that either hisdate would be much longer, or that he was at all times prepared fordeath.' He had long been troubled with a lingering consumption, attendedwith an asthma; and the summer before he died, by the advice of hisphysicians, he removed to Batly, where he got only some present ease,but went from thence with but small hopes of recovery; and upon thereturn of the distemper, he died at Hereford the 15th of February,1708. He was interred in the Cathedral church of that city, with aninscription upon his grave-stone, and had a monument erected to hismemory in Westminster-abbey by Sir Simon Harcourt, afterwards lordchancellor; the epitaph of which was written by Dr. Friend.       *       *       *       *       *WILLIAM WALSH, Esq;This poet was the son of Joseph Walsh, of Aberley in Worcestershire. Hebecame a gentleman-commoner of Wadham-College Oxford, in Easter-Term,1678, when he was only fifteen years of age; he left it without adegree, retired to his native county, and some time after went toLondon. He wrote a Dialogue concerning Women, being a Defence of theFair-Sex, addressed to Eugenia, and printed in the year 1691. Thisis the most considerable of our author's productions, and it will besomewhat necessary to take further notice of it, which we cannotmore effectually do, than by transcribing the words of Dryden in itscommendation.--That great critic thus characterises it. 'The perusal ofthis dialogue, in defence of the Fair-Sex, written by a gentleman of myacquaintance, much surprised me: For it was not easy for me to imagine,that one so young could have treated so nice a subject with so muchjudgment. It is true, I was not ignorant that he was naturallyingenious, and that he had improved himself by travelling; and fromthence I might reasonably have expected, that air of gallantry which isso visibly diffused through the body of the work, and is, indeed, thesoul that animates all things of this nature; but so much variety ofreading, both in ancient and modern authors, such digestion of thatreading, so much justness of thought, that it leaves no room foraffectation or pedantry; I may venture to say, are not over commonamongst practised writers, and very rarely to be found amongstbeginners. It puts me in mind of what was said of Mr. Waller, the fatherof our English numbers, upon the sight of his first verses, by the witsof the last age; that he came out into the world forty-thousandstrong, before they had heard of him. Here in imitation of my friend'sapostrophes, I hope the reader need not be told, that Mr. Waller is onlymentioned for honour's sake, that I am desirous of laying hold on hismemory on all occasions, and thereby acknowledging to the world, thatunless he had written, none of us all could write. My friend, had not itseems confidence enough to send this piece out into the world, withoutmy opinion of it, that it might pass securely, at least among the fairreaders, for whose service it was principally designed. I am not sopresuming, as to think my opinion can either be his touch-stone, or hispassport; but, I thought I might send him back to Ariosto, who has madeit the business of almost thirty stanza's, in the beginning of thethirty-seventh book of his Orlando Furioso; not only to praise thatbeautiful part of the creation, but also to make a sharp satire on theirenemies; to give mankind their own, and to tell them plainly, that fromtheir envy it proceeds, that the virtue and great actions of women arepurposely concealed, and the failings of some few amongst them exposed,with all the aggravating circumstances of malice. For my own part, whohave always been their servant, and have never drawn my pen againstthem, I had rather see some of them praised extraordinarily, than anyof them suffer by detraction, and that at this age, and at this timeparticularly, wherein I find more heroines, than heroes; let metherefore give them joy of their new champion: If any will think me morepartial to him, than I really am, they can only say, I have returned hisbribe; and he word I wish him is, that he may receive justice from themen, and favour only from the ladies.'This is the opinion of Mr. Dryden in favour of this piece, which issufficient to establish its reputation. Mr. Wood, the antiquarian,observes, that this Eugenia was the mistress of Walsh; but for thishe produces no proof, neither is it in the lead material whether thecircumstance is true or no. Mr. Walslh is likewise author of severaloccasional poems, printed 1749, amongst the works of the Minor Poets,and which he first published in the year 1692, with some lettersamorous, and gallant, to which is prefixed the following address to thepublic.  Go, little book, and to the world impart  The faithful image of an amorous heart;  Those who love's dear deluding pains have known,  May in my fatal sorrows read their own:  Those who have lived from all its torments free,  May find the things they never, felt by me.  Perhaps advis'd avoid the gilded bait,  And warn'd by my example shun my fate.  Whilst with calm joy, safe landed on the coast  I view the waves, on which I once was tost.  Love is a medley of endearments, jars,  Suspicions, quarrels, reconcilements, wars;  Then peace again. O would it not be best,  To chase the fatal poison from our breast?  But since, so few can live from passion free,  Happy the man, and only happy he,  Who with such lucky stars begins his love,  That his cool judgment does his choice approve.  Ill grounded passions quickly wear away;  What's built upon esteem can ne'er decay.Mr. Walsh was of an amorous complexion, and in one of his lettersmentions three of his amours, in pretty singular terms. 'I valued (sayshe) one mistress, after I left loving her; I loved another after I leftvaluing her; I love and value the third, after having lost all hopes ofher; and according to the course of my passions, I should love the nextafter having obtained her. However, from this time forward, upon whatfollies soever you fall, be pleased, for my sake, to spare those oflove; being very well satisfied there is not one folly of that kind(excepting marriage) which I have not already committed. I have been,without raillery, in love with the beauty of a woman whom I have neverseen; with the wit of one whom I never heard speak, nor seen any thingshe has written, and with the heroic virtues of a woman, without knowingany one action of her, that could make me think; she had any; Cupid willhave it so, and what can weak mortals do against so potent a god?' Suchwere the sentiments of our author when he was about 30 years of age.Queen Anne constituted Mr. Walsh her master of the horse. On whataccount this place, in particular, was allotted him, we know not; but,with regard to his literary abilities, Mr. Dryden in his postscript tohis translation of Virgil, has asserted, that Mr. Walsh was the bestcritic then living; and Mr. Pope, speaking of our author, thus concludeshis Essay on Criticism, viz.  To him, the wit of Greece, and Rome was known,  And ev'ry author's merit, but his own.  Such late was Walsh: the muses judge and friend,  Who justly knew to blame, or to commend;  To failings mild, but zealous for desert,  The clearest head, and the sincerest heart.In the year 1714 the public were obliged with a small posthumous pieceof Mr. Walsh's, entitled AEsculapius, or the Hospital of Fools, inimitation of Lucian. There is printed amongst. Mr. Walsh's otherperformances, in a volume of the Minor Poets, an Essay on PastoralPoetry, with a Short Defence of Virgil, against some of the reflexionsof M. Fontenelle. That critic had censured Virgil for writing hispastorals in a too courtly stile, which, he says, is not proper for theDoric Muse; but Mr. Walsh has very judiciously shewn, that the Shepherdsin Virgil's time, were held in greater estimation, and were persons of amuch superior figure to what they are now. We are too apt to figure theancient countrymen like our own, leading a painful life in poverty,and contempt, without wit, or courage, or education; but men had quitedifferent notions of these things for the first four thousand yearsof the world. Health and strength were then more in esteem, than therefinements of pleasure, and it was accounted, more honourable to tillthe ground, and keep a flock of sheep, than to dissolve in wantonness,and effeminating sloth.Mr. Walsh's other pieces consist chiefly of Elegies, Epitaphs, Odes, andSongs; they are elegant, tho' not great, and he seems to have had a wellcultivated, tho' not a very extensive, understanding. Dryden and Popehave given their sanction in his favour, to whom he was personallyknown, a circumstance greatly to his advantage, for had there been nopersonal friendship, we have reason to believe, their encomiums wouldhave been less lavish; at least his works do not carry so high an ideaof him, as they have done. Mr. Walsh died about the year 1710.       *       *       *       *       *THOMAS BETTERTON.(Written by R.S.[1])Almost every circumstance relating to the life of this celebrated actor,is exposed to dispute, and his manner of first coming on the stage, aswell as the action of his younger years have been controverted. He wasson of Mr. Betterton, undercook to king Charles the Ist, and was born inTothill-street Westminster, some time in the year 1635. Having receivedthe rudiments of a genteel education, and discovering a great propensityto books, it was once proposed he should have been educated to somelearned profession; but the violence and confusion of the times puttingthis out of the power of his family, he was at his own request boundapprentice to a bookseller, one Mr. Holden, a man of some eminence, andthen happy in the friendship of Sir William Davenant. In the year 1656it is probable Mr. Betterton made his first appearance on thestage, under the direction of Sir William, at the Opera-house inCharter-house-yard. It is said, that going frequently to the stage abouthis mailer's business, gave Betterton the first notion of it, who shewedsuch indications of a theatrical genius, that Sir William readilyaccepted him as a performer. Immediately after the restoration twodistinct companies were formed by royal authority; the first in virtueof a patent granted to Henry Killegrew, Esq; called the king's company,the other in virtue of a patent granted to Sir William Davenant, whichwas stiled the duke's company.[2] The former acted at the theatre royalin Drury-lane, the other at that in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. In order thatthe theatres might be decorated to the utmost advantage, and want noneof the embellishments used abroad, Mr. Betterton, by command of CharlesII. went to Paris, to take a view of the French stage, that he might thebetter judge what would contribute to the improvement of our own. Uponhis return, Mr. Betterton introduced moving scenes into our theatre,which before had the stage only hung with tapestry. The scenes no doubthelp the representation, by giving the spectator a view of the place,and increase the distress, by making the deception more powerful,and afflicting the mind with greater sensibility. The theatre inLincoln's-Inn-Fields being very inconvenient, another was built for themin Dorset-Garden, called the duke's theatre, to which they removed andfollowed their profession with great success, during all that reign ofpleasure.The stage at this time was so much the care of the state, that when anydisputes arose, they were generally decided by his majesty himself orthe duke of York, and frequently canvassed in the circle. Mr. Cibberassigns very good reasons, why at this time, theatrical amusements wereso much in vogue; the first is, that after a long eclipse of gallantryduring the rage of the civil war, people returned to it with doubleardour; the next is, that women were then introduced on the stage, theirparts formerly being supplied by boys, or effeminate young men, of whichthe famous Kynaston possessed the capital parts. When any art is carriedto perfection, it seldom happens, that at that particular period, theprofits arising from it are high; and at this time the advantages ofplaying were very inconsiderable: Mr. Hart the greatest performer at theking's theatre, had but three pounds a week, and Mr. Betterton, then butyoung, very probably had not so much, and besides, benefits then werethings unheard of.In 1670 Mr. Betterton married a gentlewoman on the same stage, one Mrs.Saunderson, who excelled as an actress, every thing but her own conductin life. In her, he was compleatly happy, and by their joint endeavourseven in those days, they were able not only to acquire a genteelsubsistence, but also to save what might support them in an advancedage[3].After Sir William Davenant's death, the patent came into the handsof his son, Dr. Charles Davenant, so well known to the world by hispolitical, writings; but, whether his genius was less fit than hisfather's for such an administration, or the king's Company were reallysuperior to his in acting, we cannot determine; but they gained uponthe town, and Dr. Davenant was obliged to have recourse to the dramaticopera, rich scenes, and fine music, to support the stage on whichBetterton played. The Dr. himself wrote the Opera of Circe, which camefirst on the stage in 1675, and was received with, such applause, asgave hopes of succeeding in this new way. The same year a Pastoral,called Calista, or the Chaste Nymph, written by Mr. Crowne, at thedesire of queen Katherine, was represented at court; and the ladies,Mary and Anne, daughters to the duke of York, played parts in it. Onthis occasion Mr. Betterton instructed the actors, and Mrs. Bettertongave lessons to the princesses; in grateful remembrance of which queenAnne settled a pension of 100 l. per annum upon her. During this time anemulation subsisted between the two companies, and a theatrical war wasproclaimed aloud, in which the town reaped the advantage, by seeingthe parts performed with the greater life. The duke's company howevermaintained it's superiority, by means of the new-invented artillery, ofmusic, machines, and scenery, and other underhand dealings, and bribingof actors in the opposite faction from performing their duty. By thesemeasures, a coalition was effected, and the two companies joinedtogether, and being united formed one of the perfectest that ever filleda stage, in 1682. It was in this united company that the merit ofBetterton shone with unrivalled lustre, and having survived the greatactors on whose model he had formed himself he was at liberty todiscover his genius in its full extent, by replacing many of them withadvantage in these very characters, in which, during their life-times,they had been thought inimitable; and all who have a taste for scenicalentertainments cannot but thank the present laureat, for preserving forthem so lively a portrait of Betterton, and painting him in so true alight, that without the imputation of blind adulation, he may be justlystiled the British Roscius.This account is too important and picturesque to be here omitted; andit would be an injury to Betterton not to shew him in that commandinglight, in which the best judge of that species of excellence has placedhim."Betterton was an actor, as Shakespear was an author, both withoutcompetitors! form'd for the mutual assistance, and illustration of eachothers genius! how Shakespear wrote, all men who have a taste for naturemay read, and know--but with what higher rapture would he still be read,could they conceive how Betterton play'd him! then might they know, theone was born alone to speak what the other only knew to write! Pity itis, that the momentary beauties flowing from an harmonious elocutioncannot, like those of poetry, be their own record! that the animatedgraces of the player can live no longer than the instant breath andmotion that presents them; or at belt can but faintly glimmer throughthe memory, or imperfect attestation of a few surviving spectators.Could how Betterton spoke, be as easily known as what he spoke; thenmight you see the muse of Shakespear in her triumph, with all theirbeauties in their belt array, rising into real life, and charming herbeholders. But alas! since all this is so far out of the reach ofdescription, how shall I shew you Betterton? Should I therefore tellyou, that all the Othellos, Hamlets, Hotspurs, Mackbeths, and Brutus's,whom you may have seen since his time have fallen far short of him: Thisstill would give you no idea of his particular excellence. Let us seethen what a particular comparison may do! whether that may yet draw himnearer to you?You have seen a Hamlet perhaps, who, on the first appearance of hisfather's spirit, has thrown himself into all the straining vociferationrequisite to express rage and fury, and the house has thundered withapplause; tho' the misguided actor was all the while (as Shakespearterms it) tearing a passion into rags--am the more bold to offer youthis particular instance, because the late Mr. Addison, while I sate byhim, to see this scene acted, made the same observation, asking me withsome surprize, if I thought Hamlet should be in so violent a passionwith the Ghost, which though it might have astonished, it had notprovok'd him? for you may observe that in this beautiful speech, thepassion never rises beyond an almost breathless astonishment, or animpatience, limited by filial reverence, to enquire into the suspectedwrongs that may have rais'd him from his peaceful tomb! and a desireto know what a spirit so seemingly distress, might wish or enjoin asorrowful son to execute towards his future quiet in the grave? this wasthe light into which Betterton threw this scene; which he open'd witha pause of mute amazement! then rising slowly, to a solemn, tremblingvoice, he made the Ghost equally terrible to the spectator, as tohimself! and in the descriptive part of the natural emotions which theghastly vision gave him, the boldness of his expostulation was stillgoverned by decency, manly, but not braving; his voice never rising intothat seeming outrage, or wild defiance of what he naturally rever'd. Butalas! to preserve this medium, between mouthing, and meaning too little,to keep the attention more pleasingly awake, by a tempered spirit, thanby meer vehemence of voice, is of all the master-strokes of an actor themost difficult to reach. In this none yet have equall'd Betterton. ButI am unwilling to shew his superiority only by recounting the errorsof those, who now cannot answer to them; let their farther failingstherefore be forgotten! or rather shall I in some measure excuse them?for I am not yet sure, that they might not be as much owing to the falsejudgment of the spectator, as the actor. While the million are so apt tobe transported, when the drum of their ear is so roundly rattled; whilethey take the life of elocution to lie in the strength of the lungs,it is no wonder the actor, whose end is applause, should be so oftentempted, at this easy rate, to excite it. Shall I go a little farther?and allow that this extreme is more pardonable than its opposite error.I mean that dangerous affectation of the monotone, or solemn sameness ofpronunciation, which to my ear is insupportable; for of all faults thatso frequently pass upon the vulgar, that of flatness will have thefewest admirers. That this is an error of ancient standing seems evidentby what Hamlet says, in his instructions to the players, viz.  Be not too tame, neither, &c.The Actor, doubtless, is as strongly ty'd down to the rule of Horace, asthe writer.      Si vis me flere, dolendum est  Primum ipsi tibi----He that feels not himself the passion he would raise, will talk to asleeping audience: But this never was the fault of Betterton; and it hasoften amaz'd me, to see those who soon came after him, throw out insome parts of a character, a just and graceful spirit, which Bettertonhimself could not but have applauded. And yet in the equally shiningpassages of the same character, have heavily dragg'd the sentimentalong, like a dead weight; with a long ton'd voice, and absent eye, asif they had fairly forgot what they were about: If you have never madethis observation, I am contented you should not know where to apply it.A farther excellence in Betterton, was that he could vary his spirit tothe different characters he acted. Those wild impatient starts, thatfierce and flaming fire, which he threw into Hotspur, never came fromthe unruffled temper of his Brutus (for I have more than once seen aBrutus as warm as Hotspur) when the Betterton Brutus was provoked, inhis dispute with Cassius, his spirit flew only to his eye; his steadylook alone supply'd that terror, which he disdain'd, an intemperance inhis voice should rise to. Thus, with a settled dignity of contempt, likean unheeding rock, he repell'd upon himself the foam of Cassius. Perhapsthe very words of Shakespear will better let you into my meaning:  Must I give way, and room, to your rash choler?  Shall I be frighted when a madman flares?And a little after,  There is no terror, Cassius, in your looks! &c.Not but, in some part of this scene, where he reproaches Cassius, histemper is not under this suppression, but opens into that warmth whichbecomes a man of virtue; yet this is that hasty spark of anger, whichBrutus himself endeavours to excuse.But with whatever strength of nature we see the poet shew, at once, thephilosopher and the heroe, yet the image of the actor's excellence willbe still imperfect to you, unless language cou'd put colours in ourwords to paint the voice with.Et si vis similem pingere, pinge sonum, is enjoining an impossibility.The most that a Vandyke can arrive at, is to make his portraits of greatpersons seem to think; a Shakespear goes farther yet, and tells you whathis pictures thought; a Betterton steps beyond 'em both, and calls themfrom the grave, to breathe, and be themselves again, in feature, speech,and motion. When the skilful actor shews you all these powers united,he gratifies at once your eye, your ear, and your understanding. Toconceive the pleasure rising from such harmony, you must have beenpresent at it! 'tis not to be told you!Thus was Betterton happy in his fortune, in the notice of his sovereign,in his fame and character, and in a general respect of all ranks oflife; thus happy might he have continued, had he not been persuaded toattempt becoming rich, and unluckily engaged in a scheme that swept awayall his capital, and left him in real distress. This accident fellout in 1692; and is of too particular a kind to pass unnoticed. Mr.Betterton had a great many friends amongst the wealthy traders in thecity, and so amiable was his private life, that all who knew him wereconcerned, and interested in his success: Amongst these, there was agentleman, whose name the author of his life thinks proper to conceal,who entered into the strictest amity with this actor. This gentleman inthe year 1692 was concerned in an adventure to the East-Indies, upon thefooting then allowed by the company's charter, which vessels so employedwere stiled interlopers. The project of success was great, the gainunusually high; and this induced Mr. Betterton, to whom his friendoffered any share in the business he pleased, to think of so large a sumas eight-thousand pounds; but it was not for himself, as he had no suchsum in his power: and whoever considers the situation of the stage atthat time will need no other argument to convince him of it. Yet he hadanother friend whom, he was willing to oblige, which was the famous Dr.Radcliffe; so Mr. Betterton advanced somewhat more than two-thousandpounds, which was his all, and the Dr. made it up eight-thousand. Thevessel sailed to the East-Indies, and made as prosperous a voyage asthose concerned in her could wish, and the war with France being then,very warm, the captain very prudently came home north about, and arrivedsafe in Ireland; but in his passage from thence he was taken by theFrench. His cargo was upwards of 120,000 l. which ruined Mr. Betterton,and broke the fortune and heart of his friend in the city: As for doctorRadcliffe, he expressed great concern for Mr. Betterton, but none forhimself; the Dr. merrily consoled himself with observing, 'that it wasonly trotting up 200 pair of stairs more, and things are as they were.'This accident, however fatal to Mr. Betterton's fortune, yet provednot so to his peace, for he bore it without murmur, and even withoutmention; so far from entertaining resentment against his friend in thecity, who doubtless meant him well, he continued his intimacy tillhis death, and after his decease took his only daughter under hisprotection, and watched over her education till she thought proper todispose of herself in marriage to Mr. Bowman the player, whose behaviourwas such, as to gain the esteem of all that knew him; he has not beenmany years dead, and reflected credit on the reports of the excellencyof the old stage.Such the virtue, such the honour of Mr. Betterton! who in his privatecharacter was as amiable as any he borrowed from the poets, andtherefore was always deservedly considered as the head of the theatre,though vetted there with very little power. The managers, as thecompanies were now united, exercised the mod despotic stage-tyranny; andobliged our author to remonstrate to them the hardships they inflictedon their actors, and represent that bad policy of the few, forgettingtheir obligations to the many. This language in the ears of thetheatrical ministry, sounded like treason; and therefore, instead ofconsidering how to remedy the mischiefs complained of, they bent theirthoughts to get rid of their monitor: as if the not hearing of faultswas equivalent to mending them. It was with this view they began to giveaway some of Betterton's first parts to young actors,[4] supposing thiswould abate his influence. This policy ruined them, and assisted him:The public resented their having plays ill acted when they knew theymight have better.The best players attached themselves wholly to Betterton, and desiredhim to turn his thoughts on some method of procuring himself and themjustice. Thus theatrical despotism produced its own definition, and thevery steps taken to render Betterton desperate, pointed out the way forhis deliverance. Mr. Betterton, who had a general acquaintance withpeople of fashion, represented his case to them, and at last by theinterposition of the earl of Dorset, a patent was granted him forbuilding a new play-house in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, which he effected bya subscription. The patentees, in order to make head against them, gotover to their party Mr. Williams, and Mrs. Mountford, both eminentplayers; they had also recruits from the country, but with all theart of which they were capable, they continued still unequal to Mr.Betterton's company. The new theatre was opened in 1695, with very greatadvantages: Mr. Congreve accepted of a share with this company, as Mr.Dryden had formerly with the king's; and the first play they actedwas Congreve's Comedy of Love for Love. The king honoured it with hispresence, there was a large and splendid audience, Mr. Betterton spoke aPrologue, and Mrs. Bracegirdle an Epilogue suited to the occasion, andit appeared by the reception they met with, that the town knew how toreward the merit of those the patentees used so ill. But with all thesevast advantages, Betterton's company were not able to maintain this flowof prosperity, beyond two or three seasons: Mr. Congreve was a slowwriter, Vanbrugh, and Mr. Cibber, who wrote for the other house, weremore expeditious; and if they did not finish, they at least writpleasing Comedies.The frequency of new pieces, however, gave such a turn in their favour,that Betterton's company with all their merit, had been undone, had notthe Mourning Bride, and the Way of the World, come like reprieves, andsaved them from the last gasp[5]. In a few years however, it appearingplainly, that without a new support from their friends, it wasimpossible for them to maintain their superiority, or independance; thepatrons of Mr. Betterton set about a new subscription, for building atheatre in the Hay-market, under the direction of Sir John Vanbrugh,which was finished in 1706[6]; and was to be conducted upon a new plan;music and scenery to be intermixed with the drama, which with thenovelty of a new house, was likely to retrieve Mr. Betterton's affairs.This favour was kindly received by Mr. Betterton; but he was now grownold, his health and strength much impaired by constant application,and his fortune still worse than his health; he chose therefore (as amutinous spirit, occasioned by disappointments, grew up amongst theactors) to decline the offer, and so put the whole design under theconduct of Sir John Vanbrugh, and Mr. Congreve, the latter of whom soonabandoned it entirely; and Mr. Betterton's strength failing, many of theold players dying, and other accidents intervening, a reunion of thecompanies became absolutely necessary, and soon after took place.Hitherto, Betterton is considered as at the head of his company, andthe affairs of the stage are naturally connected with his, as thetransactions of a nation are interwoven with the life of a prince. Afterour author reached seventy, his infirmities grew upon him greatly, hisfits of the gout were more lasting, and more severe: His circumstancesalso, which had not been mended since he took upon him the conduct ofthe theatre, grew more necessitous, and all this joined to his wife'sill state of health, made his condition melancholy, at a time when thehighest affluence could not have made them chearful. Yet under all thesepressures, he kept up his spirit, and though less active, was as sereneas ever. The public in those days, had a grateful remembrance ofthe pleasure Betterton had given them, and would not suffer sodistinguished, and so deserving a man, after fifty-years service, towithdraw, till he had received from them some marks of their favour.In the spring of 1709 a benefit was granted to Mr. Betterton, and theplay of Love for Love was acted for that purpose. Two of the bestactresses that ever graced the stage appeared on it upon that occasion,tho' they had long quitted it, to render the benefit more advantageous:The part of Valentine was performed by Mr. Betterton, Angelica by Mrs.Bracegirdle, and Mrs. Barry performed that of Frail. The epilogue waswritten by Mr. Rowe. Mrs. Bracegirdle, Mrs. Barry, and Mr. Betterton,appeared on the stage together, and the ladies taking hold of him,represented his infirmities of age, and pleaded his ancient merit, in avery natural and moving manner: This epilogue is exquisite in its kind.The profits arising from that benefit, we are told, amounted to 500 l.He had also a promise that the favour should be annually continued.These extraordinary acts of public gratitude had a proper effect uponMr. Betterton; who instead of indulging himself on their bounty, exertedthe spirit given by this generosity, in their service, and appeared andacted as often as his health would permit[7]. On the 20th of Septemberfollowing, in particular, he performed the part of Hamlet, with suchvivacity, as well as justice, that it gave ample satisfaction to thebest judges. This activity in the winter kept off the gout longer thanusual, but the fit returning in the spring, was the more unlucky, as ithappened at the time of his benefit, when the success of his play wassure to depend in a great measure upon his own performance. The play hemade choice of was the Maid's Tragedy, in which he acted the part ofMelantius; and notice was accordingly given by his good friend theTatler; but the fit intervened; and that he might not disappoint thetown, Mr. Betterton was forced to submit to outward applications, toreduce the swelling of his feet: Which had such an effect, that he wasable to appear on the stage, though he was obliged to use a slipper. Heacted that day, says the Laureat, with unusual spirit, and briskness,by which he obtained universal applause; but this could not prevent hispaying a very dear price for these marks of approbation, since the goutyhumour, repelled by fomentations, soon seized upon the nobler parts;which being perhaps weakened by his extraordinary fatigue on thatoccasion, he was not able to make a long resistance: But on the 28th ofApril, 1710, he paid the debt to nature; and by his death occasioned themost undissembled mourning amongst people of rank and fashion.His behaviour as a man, and his abilities as a player, raised hischaracter, and procured him the esteem of all worthy and good men; andsuch honours were paid his memory, as only his memory could deserve.On the second of May, his corpse was with much ceremony interred inWestminster Abbey, and the excellent author of the Tatler, has givensuch an account of the solemnity of it, as will outlast the Abbeyitself. And it is no small mortification to us, that it is inconsistentwith our proposed bounds, to transcribe the whole: It is writ with anoble spirit; there is in it an air of solemnity and grandeur; thethoughts rise naturally from one another; they fill the mind with anawful dread, and consecrate Mr. Betterton to immortality, with thewarmth of friendship, heightened by admiration.As to the character of this great man in his profession, the reader needbut reflect on Mr. Colley Cibber's account here inserted, who was wellqualified to judge, and who, in his History of the Stage, has drawn themost striking pictures that ever were exhibited; even the famous lordClarendon, whose great excellence is characterising, is not more happyin that particular, than the Laureat; no one can read his portraits ofthe players, without imagining he sees the very actors before his eyes,their air, their attitudes, their gesticulations.Mr. Betterton was a man of great study and application; and, withrespect to the subjects that employed his attention, he was as much amaster of them as any man. He was an excellent critic, more especiallyon Shakespear, and Fletcher. Mr. Rowe, who was a good judge, and alsostudied the same authors with deep attention, gives this testimony inhis favour, and celebrates, in the warmest manner, Betterton's criticalabilities. His knowledge of Shakespear's merit, gave him so strong,and so perfect an esteem for him, that he made a pilgrimage intoStaffordshire to visit his tomb, and to collect whatever particularstradition might have preserved in relation to his history; and these hefreely communicated to the same friend, who candidly acknowledges, thatthe Memoirs of Shakespear's Life he published, were the produce of thatjourney, and freely bestowed upon him by the collector. Mr. Booth, whoknew him only in his decline, frequently made mention of him, and said,he never saw him either off, or on the stage, without learning somethingfrom him; he frequently observed, that Mr. Betterton was no actor, buthe put on his part with his clothes, and was the very man he undertookto be, 'till the play was over, and nothing more. So exact was he infollowing nature, that the look of surprize he assumed in the characterof Hamlet so astonished Booth (when he first personated the Ghost) asto disable him for some moments from going on. He was so communicative,that in the most capital parts, he would enter into the grounds of hisaction, and explain, the principles of his art. He was an admirablemaster of the action of the stage, considered as independent ofsentiment; and knew perfectly the connection, and business of thescenes, so as to attract, preserve, and satisfy the attention of artaudience: An art extremely necessary to an actor, and very difficult tobe attained.What demonstrated his thorough skill in dramatic entertainments,was, his own performance, which was sufficient to establish a highreputation, independent of his other merit. As he had the happiness topass through life without reproach, a felicity few attain, so he wasequally happy in the choice of a wife, with whom he spent his days indomestic quiet, though they were of very different tempers; he wasnaturally gay and chearful, she of a melancholy reserved disposition.She was so strongly affected by his death, which was, in some measure,sudden, that she ran distracted, tho' she appeared rather a prudent andconstant, than a fond and passionate wife: She was a great ornament tothe stage, and her death, which happened soon after, was a public loss.The Laureat, in his Apology, thus characterises her: 'She was, says he,though far advanced in years, so great a mistress of nature, that evenMrs. Barry, who acted Lady Macbeth after her, could not in that part,with all her superior strength, and melody of voice, throw out thosequick and careless strokes of terror, from the disorder of a guiltymind, which the other gave us, with a facility in her manner thatrendered them at once tremendous and delightful. Time could not impairher skill, though it brought her person to decay: she was to the lastthe admiration of all true judges of nature, and lovers of Shakespear,in whose plays she chiefly excelled, and without a rival. When shequitted the stage, several good actresses were the better for herinstruction. She was a woman of an unblemished and sober life, and hadthe honour to teach Queen Anne, when Princess, the part of Semandra inMithridates, which she acted at court in King Charles's time. After thedeath of Mr. Betterton, that Princess, when Queen, ordered her a pensionfor life, but she lived not to receive more than the first half year ofit.' Thus we have seen, that it is not at all impossible for personsof real worth, to transfer a reputation acquired on the stage, to thecharacters they possess in real life, and it often happens, as in thewords of the poet,  That scenic virtue forms the rising age,  And truth displays her radiance from the stage.The following are Mr. Betterton's dramatic works;1. The Woman made a Justice; a Comedy.2. The Unjust Judge, or Appius and Virginia; a Tragedy, writtenoriginally by Mr. John Webster, an old poet, who lived in the reign ofJames I. It was altered only by Mr. Betterton, who was so cautious, andreserved upon this head, that it was by accident the fact was known, atleast with certainty.3. The Amorous Widow, or the Wanton Wife, a Play, written on the plan ofMoliere's George Dandin. The Amorous Widow has an under-plot interwoven,to accommodate the piece to the prevailing English taste. Is was actedwith great applause, but Mr. Betterton, during his life, could never beinduced to publish it; so that it came into the world as a posthumousperformance.The chief merit of this, and his other pieces, lies in the exactdisposition of the scenes; their just length, great propriety, andnatural connexions; and of how great consequence this is to the fate ofeither tragedy or comedy, may be learned from all Banks's plays, which,though they have nothing else to recommend them, yet never fail to movean audience, much more than some justly esteemed superior. Who ever sawBanks's earl of Essex represented without tears; how few bestow themupon the Cato of Addison.Besides these pieces, Betterton wrote several occasional Poems,translations of Chaucer's Fables, and other little exercises. In a word,to sum up all that we have been saying, with regard to the character ofthis extraordinary person, as he was the most perfect model of dramaticaction, so was he the most unblemished pattern of private and socialqualities: Happy is it for that player who imitates him in the one, andstill more happy that man who copies him in the other.[8][Footnote 1: Mr. Theophilus Cibber being about to publish, in a workentirely undertaken by himself the Lives and Characters of all ourEminent Actors and Actresses, from Shakespear to the present time;leaves to the other Gentlemen concerned in this collection, the accountsof some players who could not be omitted herein, as Poets.][Footnote 2: Cibber's apology.][Footnote 3: Biograph.

It was there observed that he formedhimself upon Alleyn, the famous founder of Dulwich-Hospital, and copiedhis theatrical excellencies: which, upon a review of Betterton's life,we find could not possibly happen as Alleyn was dead several yearsbefore Betterton was born: The observation should have been made ofHart.]       *       *       *       *       *JOHN BANKS.This gentleman was bred a lawyer, and was a member of the society at NewInn. His genius led him to make several attempts in dramatic poetry, inwhich he had various success; but even when he met with the greatestencouragement, he was very sensible of his error, in quitting theprofitable practice of the law, to pursue the entertainments of thestage, but he was fired with a thirst of fame which reconciled to hismind the many uneasy sensations, to which the precarious success of hisplays, and the indigence of his profession naturally exposed him: Mr.Banks no doubt has gained one part of his design by commencing poet,namely, that of being remembered after death, which Pope somewhere callsthe poor estate of wits: For this gentleman has here a place amongstthe poets, while nine tenths of the lawyers of his time, now sleep withtheir fathers secure in oblivion, and of whom we can only say, theylived, and died.Mr. Banks's genius was wholly turned for tragedy; his language iscertainly unpoetical, and his numbers unharmonious; but he seems not tohave been ignorant of the dramatic art: For in all his plays he has veryforcibly rouzed the passions, kept the scene busy, and never sufferedhis characters to languish.In the year 1684 Mr. Banks offered a tragedy to the stage called theIsland Queens, or the Death of Mary Queen of Scots, which, it seems,was rejected, whether from its want of merit, or motives of a politicalkind, we cannot now determine, but Mr. Banks thought proper then topublish it. In the year 1706, he obtained the favour of Queen Anneto command it to be acted at the Theatre-Royal, which was done withsuccess, for it is really a very moving tragedy. It has been oftenrevived, and performed at the Theatres, with no inconsiderable applause.His dramatic works are,1. The Rival Kings, or the Loves of Oroondates and Statira, a Tragedy,acted at the Theatre-Royal 1677. This play is dedicated to the LadyCatherine Herbert, and is chiefly formed on the Romance of Cassandra.2. The Destruction of Troy, a Tragedy, acted 1679. This play met withbut indifferent success.3. Virtue Betrayed, or Anna Bullen, a Tragedy, acted 1682. This play hasbeen often acted with applause.4. The Earl of Essex, or the Unhappy Favourite, acted 1682, with themost general applause. Mr. Dryden wrote the Prologue, and Epilogue. Itwill be naturally expected, that, having mentioned the earl of Essex byBanks, we should say something of a Tragedy which has appeared thisyear on the Theatre at Covent-Garden, of the same name. We cannot butacknowledge, that Mr. Jones has improved the story, and heightened theincident in the last act, which renders the whole more moving; afterthe scene of parting between Essex, and Southampton, which is veryaffecting, Rutland's distress upon the melancholy occasion of partingfrom her husband, is melting to the last degree. It is in this scene Mr.Barry excells all his cotemporaries in tragedy; he there shews his powerover our passions, and bids the heart bleed, in every accent of anguish.After Essex is carried out to execution, Mr. Jones introduces the queenat the tower, which has a very happy effect, and her manner of behavingon that occasion, makes her appear more amiable than ever she did in anyplay on the same subject. Mr. Jones in his language (in this piece)does not affect being very poetical;--nor is his verification alwaysmellifluent, as in his other writings;--but it is well adapted forspeaking: The design is well conducted, the story rises regularly, thebusiness is not suspended, and the characters are well sustained.5. The Island Queens, a Tragedy, of which we have already given someaccount; the name of it was afterwards changed to the Albion Queens.6. The Innocent Usurper, or the Death of Lady Jane Gray, a Tragedy,printed 1694. It was prohibited the stage, on account of some groundlessinsinuations, that it reflected upon the government. This play, inBanks's own opinion, is inferior to none of his former. Mr. Rowe haswritten likewise a Tragedy on this subject, which is a stock play atboth houses; it is as much superior to that of our author, as the geniusof the former was greater than that of the latter.7. Cyrus the Great, a Tragedy. This play was at first rejected, but itafterwards got upon the stage, and was acted with great success; theplot is taken from Scudery's Romance of the Grand Cyrus.We cannot ascertain the year in which Banks died. He seems to have beena man of parts; his characteristic fault as a writer, was aiming at thesublime, which seldom failed to degenerate into the bombast; fire hehad, but no judgment to manage it; he was negligent of his poetry,neither has he sufficiently marked, and distinguished his characters; hewas generally happy in the choice of his fables, and he has found a wayof drawing tears, which many a superior poet has tried in vain.       *       *       *       *       *LADY CHUDLEIGHWas born in the year 1656, and was daughter of Richard Lee of Winslade,in the county of Devon, esq; She had an education in which literatureseemed but little regarded, being taught no other language than hernative tongue; but her love of books, incessant industry in the readingof them, and her great capacity to improve by them, enabled her to makea very considerable figure in literature.She was married to Sir George Chudleigh of Ashton in the county ofDevon, Bart, by whom she had issue Eliza Maria, who died in the bloom oflife, (much lamented by her mother, who poured out her griefs on thatoccasion, in a Poem entitled a Dialogue between Lucinda and Marissa) andGeorge, who succeeded to the title and estate, Thomas, and others.She was a lady of great virtue, as well as understanding, and she madethe latter of these subservient to the promotion of the former, whichwas much improved by study; but though she was enamoured of the charmsof poetry, yet she dedicated some part of her time to the severer studyof philosophy, as appears from her excellent essays, which discover anuncommon degree of piety, and knowledge, and a noble contempt of thosevanities which the unthinking part of her sex so much regard, and soeagerly pursue.The works which this lady produced, are,The Ladies Defence, or the Bride-Woman's Counsellor answered, a Poem; ina Dialogue between Sir John Brute, Sir William Loveall, Melissa, and aParson. This piece has been several times printed; the writing it wasoccasioned by an angry sermon preached against the fair sex, of whichher ladyship gives the following account; 'Mr. Lintot, says she, sometime since, intending to reprint my poems, desired me to permit himto add to them a Dialogue I had written in the year 1700, on a Sermonpreached by Mr. Sprint, a Nonconformist, at Sherbourne in Dorsetshire;I refusing, for several reasons, to grant his request, he, without myknowledge, bought the copy of the Bookseller who formerly printed it,and, without my consent, or once acquainting me with his resolution,added to it the second edition of my poems; and that which makes theinjury the greater, is, his having omitted the Epistle Dedicatory, andthe Preface, by which means he has left the reader wholly in the dark,and exposed me to censure. When it was first printed I had reason tocomplain, but not so much as now: Then the Dedication was left entire asI had written it, but the Preface so mangled, altered, and considerablyshortened, that I hardly knew it to be my own; but being then publishedwithout a name, I was the less concerned, but since, notwithstanding thegreat care I took to conceal it, it is known to be mine; I think myselfobliged, in my own defence, to take some notice of it[1].' The omissionof this Preface, which contained an answer to part of the sermon, andgave her reasons for writing the poem, had occasioned some people tomake ill-natured reflexions on it: this put her ladyship on justifyingherself, and assuring her readers, that there are no reflexions in itlevelled at any particular persons, besides the author of the Sermon;him (says she) I only blame for being too angry, for his not telling usour duty in a softer more engaging way: address, and good manners renderreproofs a kindness; but where they are wanting, admonitions are alwaystaken ill: as truths of this sort ought never to be concealed from us,so they ought never to be told us with an indecent warmth; a respectfultenderness would be more becoming a messenger of peace, the disciple ofan humble, patient, meek, commiserating Saviour.'Besides this lady's poems, of which we shall give some account when wequote a specimen; she wrote Essays upon several subjects, in prose andverse, printed in 8vo. 1710. These Essays are upon Knowledge, Pride,Humility, Life, Death, Fear, Grief, Riches, Self-love, Justice, Anger,Calumny, Friendship, Love, Avarice, Solitude, and are much admired forthe delicacy of the stile, there being not the least appearance of falsewit, or affected expression, the too common blemishes of this sort ofwriting: they are not so much the excursions of a lively imagination,which can often expatiate on the passions, and actions of men, withsmall experience of either, as the deliberate result of observations onthe world, improved with reading, regulated with judgment, softened bygood manners, and heightened with sublime thoughts, and elevated piety.This treatise is dedicated to her Royal Highness the Princess Sophia,Electress, and Duchess Dowager of Brunswick, on which occasion thatPrincess, then in her 80th year, honoured her with the followingepistle, written by the Electress in French, but which we shall herepresent to the reader in English.  Hanover June 25, 1710.  LADY CHUDLEIGH,  You have done me a very great pleasure in letting  me know by your agreeable book, that there  is such a one as you in England, and who has so  well improved herself, that she can, in a fine manner,  communicate her sentiments to all the world.  As for me I do not pretend to deserve the commendations  you give me, but by the esteem which I  have of your merit, and of your good sense, I will  be always entirely  Your affectionate friend  to serve you,  SOPHIA ELECTRICE.At the end of the second volume of the duke of Wharton's poems, are fiveletters from lady Chudleigh, to the revd. Mr. Norris of Bemmerton, andMrs. Eliz. Thomas, the celebrated Corinna of Dryden.She wrote several other things, which, though not printed, are carefullypreserved in the family, viz. two Tragedies, two Operas, a Masque, someof Lucian's Dialogues, translated into Verse, Satirical Reflexions onSaqualio, in imitation of one of Lucian's Dialogues, with several smallPoems on various Occasions.She had long laboured under the pains of a rheumatism, which hadconfined her to her chamber a considerable time before her death, whichhappened at Ashton in Devonshire, December 15, 1710, in the 55th year ofher age, and lies buried there without either monument or inscription.The poetical Works of this Lady consist chiefly in the Song of the ThreeChildren Paraphrased, some Pindaric Odes, Familiar Epistles, and Songs.We shall select as a specimen, a Dialogue between Lucinda and Marissa,occasioned by the death of her Ladyship's Daughter, in the early bloomof her youth. It is of a very melancholy cast, and expressive of thegrief me must have felt upon that tender occasion. Her ladyship hasinformed us in her preface to her poems, that she generally chosesubjects suited to her present temper of mind. 'These pieces (says she)were the employments of my leisure hours, the innocent amusements of asolitary life; in them the reader will find a picture of my mind, mysentiments all laid open to their view; they will sometimes see mechearful, pleased, sedate, and quiet; at other times, grieving,complaining, and struggling with my passions, blaming myself,endeavouring to pay homage to my reason, and resolving for the futurewith a decent calmness, an unshaken constancy, and a resigning temper,to support all the troubles, all the uneasiness of life, and then,by unexpected emergencies, unforeseen disappointments, sudden, andsurprising turns of fortune, discomposed, and shock'd, 'till I haverallied my scattered fears, got new strength, and by making unweariedresistance, gained the better of my afflictions, and restored my mind toits former tranquility. Would we (continues her ladyship) contract ourdesires, and learn to think that only necessary, which nature has madeso; we should be no longer fond of riches, honours, applauses, andseveral other things, which are the unhappy occasions of much mischiefto the world; and doubtless, were we so happy as to have a true notionof the dignity of our nature, of those great things for which we weredesigned, and of the duration and felicity of that state to which we arehastening, we should scorn to stoop to mean actions, and blush at thethoughts of doing any thing below our character.' In this manner doesour authoress discover her sentiments of piety. We now shall subjoin thespecimen;DIALOGUE.MARISSA.  O my Lucinda! O my dearest friend!  Must my afflictions never, never end!  Has Heav'n for me, no pity left in store,  Must I! O must I ne'er be happy more!  Philanda's loss had almost broke my heart,  From her alas! I did but lately part:  And must there still be new occasions found  To try my patience, and my soul to wound?  Must my lov'd daughter too be snatch'd away,  Must she so soon the call of fate obey?  In her first dawn, replete with youthful charms,  She's fled, she's fled, from my deserted arms.  Long did she struggle, long the war maintain,  But all th' efforts of life, alas! were vain.  Could art have saved her, she had still been  mine,  Both art and care together did combine:  But what is proof against the will divine?  Methinks I still her dying conflict view,  And the sad sight does all my grief renew;  Rack'd by convulsive pains, she meekly lies,  And gazes on me with imploring eyes;  With eyes which beg relief, but all in vain,  I see but cannot, cannot ease her pain.  She must the burden unassisted bear,  I cannot with her in her tortures share:  Would they were mine, and me flood easy by;  For what one loves, sure 'twere not hard to die.  See how me labours, how me pants for breath,  She's lovely still, she's sweet, she's sweet in  death!  Pale as she is, me beauteous does remain,  Her closing eyes their lustre still retain:  Like setting suns with undiminish'd light,  They hide themselves within the verge of night.  She's gone, she's gone, she sigh'd her soul away!  And can I, can I any longer stay?  My life alas has ever tiresome been,  And I few happy easy days have seen;  But now it does a greater burden grow,  I'll throw it off, and no more sorrow know,  But with her to calm peaceful regions go.  Stay, thou dear innocence, retard thy flight,  O stop thy journey to the realms of light;  Stay 'till I come: to thee I'll swiftly move,  Attracted by the strongest passion, love.LUCINDA.  No more, no more let me such language hear,  I can't, I can't the piercing accents bear:  Each word you utter stabs me to the heart,  I could from life, not from Marissa part:  And were your tenderness as great as mine,  While I were left, you would net thus repine.  My friends are riches, health, and all to me;  And while they're mine I cannot wretched be.MARISSA.  If I on you could happiness bestow,  I still the toils of life would undergo,  Would still contentedly my lot sustain,  And never more of my hard fate complain:  But since my life to you will useless prove,  O let me hasten to the joys above:  Farewel, farewel, take, take my last adieu,  May Heaven be more propitious still to you,  May you live happy when I'm in my grave,  And no misfortunes, no afflictions have:  If to sad objects you'll some pity lend  And give a sigh to an unhappy friend,  Think of Marissa, and her wretched state,  How's she's been us'd by her malicious fate;  Recount those storms which she has long sustain'd,  And then rejoice that she the part has gain'd;  The welcome haven of eternal rest,  Where she shall be for ever, ever bless'd;  And in her mother's, and her daughter's arms  Shall meet with new, with unexperienc'd charms,  O how I long those dear delights to taste;  Farewel, farewel, my soul is much in haste.  Come death; and give the kind releasing blow,  I'm tir'd of life, and overcharg'd with woe:  In thy cool silent, unmolested shade  O let me be by their dear relics laid;  And there with them from all my troubles free,  Enjoy the blessing of a long tranquillity.LUCINDA.  O thou dear sufferer, on my breast recline  Thy drooping head, and mix thy tears with  mine:  Here rest awhile, and make a truce with grief:  Consider; sorrow brings you no relief.  In the great play of life, we must not chuse,  Nor yet the meanest character refuse.  Like soldiers we our general must obey,  Must stand our ground, and not to fear give  way,  But go undaunted on'till we have won the day.  Honour is ever the reward of pain,  A lazy virtue no applause will gain.  All such as to uncommon heights would rise,  And on the wings of fame ascend the skies,  Must learn the gifts of fortune to despise;  They to themselves their bliss must still confine,  Must be unmoved, and never once repine:  But few to this perfection can attain,  Our passions often will th' ascendant gain,  And reason but alternately does reign;  Disguised by pride we sometimes seem to bear  A haughty port, and scorn to shed a tear;  While grief within still acts a tragic part,  And plays the tyrant in the bleeding heart.  Your sorrow is of the severest kind,  And can't be wholly to your soul confin'd,  Losses like yours may be allowed to move  A gen'rous mind, that knows what 'tis to love.  These afflictions;--  Will teach you patience, and the careful skill  To rule your passions, and command your will;  To bear afflictions with a steady mind,  Still to be easy, pleas'd, and still resign'd,  And look as if you did no inward sorrow find.MARISSA.  I know Lucinda this I ought to do,  But oh! 'tis hard my frailties to subdue;  My headstrong passions will resistance make,  And all my firmed resolutions make.  I for my daughter's death did long prepare,  And hop'd I should the stroke with temper bear,  But when it came grief quickly did prevail,  And I soon found my boasted courage fail:  Yet still I strove, but 'twas alas! in vain,  My sorrow did at length th' ascendant gain:  But I'm resolv'd I will no longer yield;  By reason led, I'll once more take the field,  And there from my insulting passions try,  To gain a full, a glorious victory:  Which 'till I've done, I never will give o'er  But still fight on, and think of peace no more;  With an unwearied courage still contend,  'Till death, or conquest, doth my labour end.[Footnote 1: Preface to her Essays.]       *       *       *       *       *THOMAS CREECH.This gentleman was born near Sherborne in Dorsetshire, and bred up atthe free school in that town, under Mr. Carganven, a man of eminentcharacter, to whom in gratitude he inscribes one of the Idylliums ofTheocritus, translated by him. His parents circumstances not beingsufficient to bestow a liberal education upon him, colonel Strangeways,who was himself a man of taste and literature, took notice of the earlycapacity of Creech, and being willing to indulge his violent propensityto learning, placed him at Wadham College in Oxford, in the 16th yearof his age, anno 1675, being then put under the tuition of two of thefellows. In the year 1683 he was admitted matter of arts, andsoon elected fellow of All-soul's College; at which time he gavedistinguished proofs of his classical learning, and philosophy, beforethose who were appointed his examiners. The first work which broughtour author into reputation, was his translation of Lucretius, whichsucceeded so well, that Mr. Creech had a party formed for him, whoventured to prefer him to Mr. Dryden, in point of genius. Mr. Drydenhimself highly commended his Lucretius, and in his preface to the secondvolume of Poetical Miscellanies thus characterises it. 'I now call tomind what I owe to the ingenious, and learned translator of Lucretius.I have not here designed to rob him of any part of that commendation,which he has so justly acquired by the whole author, whose fragmentsonly fall to my portion. The ways of our translation are very different;he follows him more closely than I have done, which became aninterpreter to the whole poem. I take more liberty, because it bestsuited with my design, which was to make him as pleasing as I could. Hehad been too voluminous, had he used my method, in so long a work; andI had certainly taken his, had I made it my business to translate thewhole. The preference then is justly his; and I join with Mr. Evelyn inthe confession of it, with this additional advantage to him, that hisreputation is already established in this poet; mine is to make itsfortune in the world. If I have been any where obscure in followingour common author; or if Lucretius himself is to be condemned, I refermyself to his excellent annotations, which I have often read, and alwayswith some pleasure.'Many poets of the first class, of those times, addressed Mr. Creech incommendatory verses, which are prefixed to the translation of Lucretius:but this sudden blaze of reputation was soon obscured, by his failingin an arduous task, which the success of his Lucretius prompted him toattempt. This was a translation of the works of Horace, an author morediversified, and consequently more difficult than Lucretius. Some haveinsinuated, that Mr. Dryden, jealous of his rising fame, and willingto take advantage of his vanity, in order to sink his reputation,strenuously urged him to this undertaking, in which he was morallycertain Creech could not succeed. Horace is so, various, so exquisite,and perfectly delightful, that he who culls flowers in a garden soreplenished with nature's productions, must be well acquainted with herform, and able to delineate her beauties. In this attempt Creech failed,and a shade was thrown over his reputation, which continued to obscureit to the end of his life. It is from this circumstance alleged, thatMr. Creech contracted a melancholy, and moroseness of temper, whichoccasioned the disinclination of many towards him, and threw him intohabits of recluseness, and discontent. To this some writers likewiseimpute the rash attempt on his own life, which he perpetrated at Oxford,in 1701. This act of suicide could not be occasioned by want, for Mr.Jacob tells us, that just before that accident, he had been presented bythe college to the living of Welling in Hertfordshire. Mr. Barnardin his Nouvelles de la Republiques de Lettres, assigns another causebesides the diminution of his fame, which might occasion this disastrousfate. Mr. Creech, though a melancholy man, was yet subject to thepassion of love. It happened that he fixed his affections on a lady whohad either previously engaged hers, or who could not bestow them uponhim; this disappointment, which was a wound to his pride, so affectedhis mind, that, unable any longer to support a load of misery, he hangedhimself in his own chamber. Which ever of these causes induced him,the event was melancholy, and not a little heightened by his being aclergyman, in whose heart religion should have taken deeper root, andmaintained a more salutary influence, than to suffer him thus to stainhis laurels with his own blood.Mr. Creech's works, besides his Lucretius already mentioned, are chieflythese,The Second Elegy of Ovid's First Book of Elegies. The 6th, 7th, 8th, and12th Elegies of Ovid's Second Book of Elegies. The 2d and 3d Eclogue ofVirgil. The Story of Lucretia, from Ovid de Fastis. B. ii. The Odes,Satires, and Epistles of Horace already mentioned, dedicated to JohnDryden, esq; who is said to have held it in great contempt, which gavesuch a shock to Mr. Creech's pride. The author in his preface tothis translation has informed us, that he had not an ear capable ofdistinguishing one note in music, which, were there no other, was asufficient objection against his attempting the most musical poet in anylanguage.The same year he published his Translation of the Idylliums ofTheocritus, with Rapin's Discourse on Pastorals, as also the Life ofPhelopidas, from the Latin of Cornelius Nepos.In Dryden's Translation of Juvenal and Persius, Mr. Creech did the 13thSatire of Juvenal, and subjoined Notes. He also translated into English,the verses before Mr. Quintenay's Compleat Gardiner. The Life of Solon,from the Greek of Plutarch. Laconic Apophthegms, or Remarkable Sayingsof the Spartans, printed in the first Volume of Plutarch's Morals.A Discourse concerning Socrates's Daemon. The two First Books of theSymposiacs.These are the works of Mr. Creech: A man of such parts and learning,according to the accounts of all who have written of him, that, had henot by the last act of his life effaced the merit of his labours, hewould have been an ornament as well to the clerical profession, as hiscountry in general. He well understood the ancients, had an unusualpenetration in discovering their beauties, and it appears by his owntranslation of Lucretius, how elegantly he could cloath them in anEnglish attire. His judgment was solid; he was perfectly acquainted withthe rules of criticism, and he had from nature an extraordinary genius.However, he certainly over-rated his importance, or at lead his friendsdeceived him, when they set him up as a rival to Dryden! but if he wasinferior to that great man in judgment, and genius, there were few ofthe same age to whom he needed yield the palm. Had he been content to bereckoned only the second, instead of the first genius of the times, hemight have lived happy, and died regreted and reverenced, but like Caesarof old, who would rather be the lord of a little village, than thesecond man in Rome, his own ambition overwhelmed him.We shall present the reader with a few lines from the second Book ofLucretius, as a specimen of our author's versification, by which it willbe found how much he fell short of Dryden in point of harmony, though heseems to have been equal to any other poet, who preceded Dryden, in thatparticular.  'Tis pleasant, when the seas are rough, to stand,  And view another's danger, safe at land:  Not 'cause he's troubled, but 'tis sweet to see  Those cares and fears, from which our selves are free.  'Tis also pleasant to behold from far  How troops engage, secure ourselves from war.  But above all, 'tis pleasantest to get  The top of high philosophy, and sit  On the calm, peaceful, flourishing head of it:  Whence we may view, deep, wondrous deep below,  How poor mistaken mortals wand'ring go,  Seeking the path to happiness: some aim  At learning, wit, nobility, or fame:  Others with cares and dangers vex each hour  To reach the top of wealth, and sov'reign pow'r:  Blind wretched man! in what dark paths of strife  We walk this little journey of our life!  While frugal nature seeks for only ease;  A body free from pains, free from disease;  A mind from cares and jealousies at peace.  And little too is needful to maintain  The body sound in health, and free from pain:  Not delicates, but such as may supply  Contented nature's thrifty luxury:  She asks no more. What tho' no boys of gold  Adorn the walls, and sprightly tapers hold,  Whose beauteous rays, scatt'ring the gawdy light,  Might grace the feast, and revels of the night:  What tho' no gold adorns; no music's sound  With double sweetness from the roofs rebound;  Yet underneath a loving myrtle's shade,  Hard by a purling stream supinely laid,  When spring with fragrant flow'rs the earth has spread,  And sweetest roses grow around our head;  Envy'd by wealth and pow'r, with small expence  We may enjoy the sweet delights of sense.  Who ever heard a fever tamer grown  In cloaths embroider'd o'er, and beds of down.  Than in coarse rags?  Since then such toys as these  Contribute nothing to the body's ease,  As honour, wealth, and nobleness of blood,  'Tis plain they likewise do the mind no good:  If when thy fierce embattell'd troops at land  Mock-fights maintain; or when thy navies Hand  In graceful ranks, or sweep the yielding seas,  If then before such martial fights as these,  Disperse not all black jealousies and cares,  Vain dread of death, and superstitious fears  Not leave thy mind; but if all this be vain,  If the same cares, and dread, and fears remain,  If Traytor-like they seize thee on the throne,  And dance within the circle of a crown;  If noise of arms, nor darts can make them fly,  Nor the gay sparklings of the purple dye.  If they on emperors will rudely seize,  What makes us value all such things as these,  But folly, and dark ignorance of happiness?  For we, as boys at night, by day do fear  Shadows as vain, and senseless as those are.  Wherefore that darkness, which o'erspreads our fouls,  Day can't disperse; but those eternal rules,  Which from firm premises true reason draws,  And a deep insight into nature's laws.       *       *       *       *       *ARTHUR MAYNWARING, Esq;A Gentleman distinguished both for poetry and politics, as well as thegay accomplishments of life. He was born at Ightfield, in the year 1668,and educated at the grammar-school at Shrewsbury, where he remainedfour or five years; and at about seventeen years of age, was removed toChrist's Church in Oxford, under the tuition of Mr. George Smalridge,afterwards bishop of Bristol. After he removed from Oxford, he wentinto Cheshire, where he lived several years with his uncle, Mr. FrancisCholmondley, a gentleman of great integrity and honour; but by apolitical prejudice, very averse to the government of William the IIId,to whom he refused to take the oaths, and instilled anti-revolutionprinciples into his nephew,[1] who embraced them warmly; and on hisfirst entry into life, reduced to practice what he held in speculation.He wrote several pieces in favour of James the IId's party: amongstwhich was a Panegyric on that King. He wrote another intitled the Kingof Hearts, to ridicule lord Delamere's entry into London, at his firstcoming to town after the revolution. This poem was said to be Dryden's,who was charged with it by Mr. Tonson; but he disowned it, and told himit was written by an ingenious young gentleman, named Maynwaring, thenabout twenty two years of age.When our author was introduced to the acquaintance of the duke ofSomerset, and the earls of Dorset, and Burlington, he began to entertain(says Oldmixon) very different notions of politics: Whether from theforce of the arguments made use of by those noblemen; or, from adesire of preferment, which he plainly saw lay now upon the revolutioninterest, cannot be determined; but he espoused the Whig ministry, aszealously as he had formerly struggled for the exiled monarch.Our author studied the law till he was five or six and twenty yearsold, about which time his father died, and left him an estate of neareight-hundred pounds a year, but so incumbred, that the interest moneyamounted to almost as much as the revenue. Upon the conclusion of thepeace of Ryswick, he went to Paris, where he became acquainted withMonsieur Boileau, who invited him to his country house, entertained himvery elegantly, and spoke much to him of the English poetry, but all byway of enquiry; for he affected to be as ignorant of the English Muse,as if our nation had been as barbarous as the Laplanders.A gentleman, a friend of Mr. Maynwaring, visiting him some time after,upon the death of Mr. Dryden 'Boileau, said that he was wonderfullypleased to see by the public papers, that the English nation had paid soextraordinary honours to one of their poets, burying him at the publiccharge;' and then asked the gentleman who that poet was, with as muchindifference as if he had never heard Dryden's name; which he could nomore be unacquainted with, than our country was with his; for he oftenfrequented lord Montague's house, when he was embassador in France, andbeing also an intimate friend of Monsieur De la Fontaine, who had spentsome time in England, it was therefore impossible he could be ignorantof the fame of Dryden; but it is peculiar to that nation to hold allothers in contempt. The French would as fain monopolize wit, as thewealth and power of Europe; but thanks to the arms and genius ofBritain, they have attempted both the one and the other without success.Boileau's pretending not to know Dryden, to use the words of Milton,'argued himself unknown.' But perhaps a reason may be assigned, why thewits of France affected a contempt for Mr. Dryden, which is this. Thatpoet, in many of his Prefaces and Dedications, has unanswerably shewn,that the French writers are really deficient in point of genius;' thatthe correctness for which they are remarkable, and that even pace whichthey maintain in all their dramatic compositions, is a proof that theyare not capable of sublime conceptions; that they never rise to anydegree of elevation, and are in truth uninspired by the muses:--Judgmentthey may have to plan and conduct their designs; but few French poetshave ever found the way of writing to the heart. Have they attained thesublime height of Shakespear, the tenderness of Otway, or the pomp ofRowe? and yet these are names which a French versifier will pretend,with an air of contempt, never to have heard of.The truth is, our poets have lately done the French too much honour, bytranslating their pieces, and bringing them on the stage; as if our ownstock was exhausted and the British genius had failed: But it is somesatisfaction that these attempts seem now to be discouraged; we haveseen a late play of theirs (we call it a play, for it was neither atragedy nor a comedy) translated by a languid poet of our own, receivedwith the coolness it deserved.But to return to Mr. Maynwaring. Upon his arrival in England, fromFrance, he was made one of the commissioners of the customs, in whichpost he distinguished himself by his skill and fidelity. Of the latterof these qualities we have an instance, in his treatment of a man, whosollicited to be a tide-waiter: Somebody had told him that his best wayto succeed would be to make a present. The advice had been perhapsgood enough if he had not mistaken his man. For understanding thatMr. Maynwaring had the best interest at the board of any of thecommissioners, with the lords of the treasury; he sent him a letter,with a purse of fifty-guineas, desiring his favour towards obtaining theplace he sollicited: Afterwards he delivered a petition to the board,which was read, and several of the commissioners having spoke to it, Mr.Maynwaring took out the purse of fifty guineas, and the letter, tellingthem that as long as he could prevent it, that man should never havethis, or any other place in the revenue[2].Mr. Maynwaring was admitted a member of the Kit-Kat Club, and wasconsidered as one of the chief ornaments of it, by his pleasantry andwit.In the beginning of queen Anne's reign, lord treasurer Godolphin,engaged Mr. Donne, to quit the office of auditor of the imprests, hislordship paying him several thousand pounds for his doing it, and henever let Mr. Maynwaring know what he was doing for him, till he madehim a present of a patent for that office, worth about two-thousandpounds a year in time of business. In the Parliament which met in 1705,our author was chosen a burgess for Preston in Lancashire[3].He had a considerable share in the Medley, and was author of severalother pieces, of which we shall presently give some account.He died at St. Albans, November the 13th, 1712, having some time beforemade his will; in which he left Mrs. Oldfield, the celebrated actresshis executrix, by whom he had a son, named Arthur Maynwaring. He dividedhis estate pretty equally between that child, Mrs. Oldfield, and hissister; Mr. Oldmixon tells us, that Mr. Maynwaring loved this actress,for nine or ten years before his death, with the strongest passion:It was in some measure owing to his instructions that she became sofinished a player; for he understood the action of the stage as wellas any man, and took great pleasure to see her excell in it. He wroteseveral Prologues and Epilogues for her, and would always hear herrehearse them in private, before she spoke them on the stage. Hisfriends of both sexes quarrelled with him for his attachment to her, andso much resented it, that Mrs. Oldfield frequently remonstrated to him,that it was for his honour and interest to break off the intrigue: whichfrankness and friendship of hers, did, as he often confessed, but engagehim the more firmly; and all his friends at last gave over importuninghim to leave her, as she gained more and more upon him.In honour of our author, Mr. Oldmixon observes, that he had anabhorrence of those that swore, or talked profanely in conversation.He looked upon it as a poor pretence to wit, and never excused it inhimself or others.--I have already observed, that our author had ashare in the Medley, a paper then set up in favour of the Hanoveriansuccession, in which he combats the Examiner, who wrote on the opposite,or, at least, the High-Church Interest.He also wrote the following pieces.1. Remarks on a late Romance, intitled the Memorial of the Church ofEngland, or the History of the Ten Champions.2. A Translation of the second Ode, of the first book of Horace.3. A Translation of the fifth Book of Ovid's Metamorphoses.4. A Character of the new Ministers, 1710.5. Several Songs, Poems, Prologues and Epilogues.6. There was a Manuscript given him to peruse, which contained Memoirsof the duke of Marlborough's famous march to Blenheim: It was written bya chaplain of the duke's, with great exactness as to the incidents, butwas defective in form. Mr. Maynwaring was desired to alter and improveit, which he found too difficult a task; but being greatly pleased withthe particular account of all that pass'd in that surprizing march,he resolved that it should not be lost, and to give it a new and moreperfect form himself, by reducing a kind of diary into a regularhistory. These papers fell into the hands of Sir Richard Steel.7. A Translation of part of Tully's Offices.8. Four Letters to a Friend in North-Britain, written upon thepublishing Dr. Sacheveral's Trial.9. The History of Hannibal, and Hanno, from the best authors: In thispiece he is supposed to intend by Hannibal, the duke of Marlborough; byHanno, the lord treasurer Oxford, by Valerius Flaccus, count Tallard,and by Asdrubal, Dr. Robinson, bishop of Bristol.10. The Speech of Alcibiades to the Athenians, printed in theWhig-Examiner, Numb. 3.11. The French King's Promise to the Pretender.12. A Short Account, and Defence of the Barrier Treaty.13. Remarks upon the present Negotiation of Peace, begun betweenGreat-Britain and France.14. The Bewdley Cafe.15. He had a considerable hand in a Letter to a High-Churchman.16. He revived and published a treatise called Bouchain, in a Dialoguebetween the Medley and the Examiner, about the management of the war in1711.17. He wrote a Letter to the Free-holders, a little before the electionof the new Parliament.18. He had a great hand in a pamphlet, entitled the British Academy,wherein he rallied Dr. Swift's Letter to the lord treasurer Oxford,about altering the English language.19. The Letter from Doway, was written by him, or some friend of his,with his assistance.These are chiefly the works of Maynwaring, who was a gentleman ofgenius, and appears to have been a good-natur'd honest man. His morallife has only been blamed for his intrigue with Mrs. Oldfield; but Iam persuaded when the accomplishments of that lady are remembered, (sobright) is employed in the composition of one book, a bookseller maypublish twenty; so that in the very nature of things, a booksellerwithout oppression, a crime which by unsuccessful writers is generallyimputed to them, may grow rich, while the most industrious and ableauthor can arrive at no more than a decent competence: and even to that,many a great genius has never attained.No sooner had Mr. Head a little recovered himself, than we find himcheated again by the syren alurements of pleasure and poetry, in thelatter of which, however, it does not appear he made any proficiency.He failed a second time, in the world, and having recourse to his pen,wrote the first part of the English Rogue, which being too libertine,could not be licensed till he had expunged some of the most lusciousdescriptions out of it.Mr. Winstanley, p. 208, has informed us, that at the coming out of thisfirst part, he was with him at the Three Cup tavern in Holborn drinkinga glass of Rhenish, and made these verses upon him,  What Gusman, Buscan, Francion, Rablais writ,  I once applauded for most excellent wit;  But reading thee, and thy rich fancy's store,  I now condemn, what I admir'd before.  Henceforth translations pack away, be gone,  No Rogue so well writ, as the English one.We cannot help observing, that Winstanley has a little ridiculouslyshewn his vanity, by informing the world, that he could afford to drinka glass of Rhenish; and has added nothing to his reputation by theverses, which have neither poetry nor wit in them.[Footnote 1: Oldmixon's Life of Maynwaring.][Footnote 2: Life, p. xviii. xix.][Footnote 3: Ibid. p. xxii.]       *       *       *       *       *The HON. Mrs. MONK.This Lady was the daughter of the Right Hon. the Lord Molesworth, anobleman of Ireland, and wife of George Monk, Esq; By the force of hernatural genius, she learnt the Latin, Italian, and Spanish tongues, andby a constant reading of the best authors in those languages, became sogreat a proficient, especially in poetry, that she wrote many piecesthat were deemed worthy of publication, and soon after her death, wereprinted and published with the following title, Marinda. Poems, andTranslations upon several occasions, printed in London, 1716. The bookis addressed to her Royal Highness Carolina Princess of Wales, in along dedication, dated March 26, 1716, written by her father, who thusaffectionately speaks of the poems and their author.'Most of them (says he) are the product of the leisure hours of a younggentlewoman lately deceased; who in a remote country retirement, withoutomitting the daily care due to a large family, not only perfectlyacquired the several languages here made use of; but the good morals andprinciples contained in those books, so as to put them in practice, aswell during her life and languishing sickness, as the hour of her death;in short she died not only like a Christian, but a Roman lady, and sobecame at once the object of the grief, and comfort of her relations. Asmuch as I am obliged to be sparing in commending what belongs to me, Icannot forbear thinking some of these circumstances uncommon enough tobe taken notice of: I loved her more, because she deserved it, thanbecause she was mine, and I cannot do greater honour to her memory, thanby consecrating her labours, or rather diversion to your Royal Highness,as we found most of them in her escrutore, after her death, written withher own hand, little expecting, and as little desiring the public shouldhave any opportunity, either of applauding or condemning them.'Mr. Jacob tells us, that these Poems and Translations, shew the truespirit, and numbers of poetry, a delicacy of turn, and justness ofthought and expression. They consist of Ecclogues; the Masque of theVirtues against Love, from Guarini; some translations from the Frenchand Italians; Familiar Epistles, Odes and Madrigals.Her poetry has great warmth, and tenderness of sentiment. The followingEpitaph on a lady of pleasure, was written by her,  O'er this marble drop a tear,  Here lies fair Rosalinde,  All mankind was pleas'd with her,  And she with all mankind.And likewise this Epigram upon another lady of the same character.  Chloe, her gossips entertains,  With stories of her child-bed pains,  And fiercely against Hymen rails:  But Hymen's not so much to blame;  She knows, unless her memory fails,  E'er she was wed, 'twas much the same.The following verses, which breathe a true spirit of tenderness, werewritten by her, on her death-bed at Bath, when her husband was inLondon,  Thou, who dost all my worldly thoughts employ,  Thou pleasing source of all my earthly joy:  Thou tenderest husband, and thou best of friends,  To thee, this first, this last adieu I send.  At length the conqueror death asserts his right,  And will forever veil me from thy sight.  He wooes me to him, with a chearful grace;  And not one terror clouds his meagre face.  He promises a lasting rest from pain;  And shews that all life's fleeting joys are vain.  Th' eternal scenes of Heaven he sets in view,  And tells me, that no other joys are true.  But love, fond love, would yet resist his power;  Would fain a-while defer the parting hour:  He brings the mourning image to my eyes,  And would obstruct my journey to the skies.  But say thou dearest, thou unwearied friend;  Say should'st thou grieve to see my sorrows end?  Thou know'st a painful pilgrimage I have past,  And should'st thou grieve, that rest is come at last;  Rather rejoice to see me shake off life,  And die as I have liv'd, thy faithful wife.       *       *       *       *       *Mr. THOMAS BROWN.This humorous poet was the son of a considerable Farmer of Shiffnall,in Shropshire, and educated at Newport-school in that county, under thereverend and learned Dr. Edwards, a gentleman who had the honour toqualify many persons of distinction for the university. Under thetuition of this master, he attained a knowledge of the Latin, Greek,French, Italian, and Spanish languages, and his exercises were generallyso well performed, that the Dr. was filled with admiration of his parts.From Newport school he removed to Christ's-Church College in Oxford, anddistinguished himself there for his easy attainments in literature; butsome little irregularities of his life would not suffer him tocontinue long at the university. It is probable he became sick of thatdiscipline, which they who spend their life in the recluseness of acollege, are in some measure obliged to submit to. The father of Mr.Brown, who intended to have him educated to some profession, was notmade acquainted with his design of quitting the university, and havingremitted him a sum of money, to be appropriated for the promotion of hisstudies, his son thought proper to defeat his kind intentions. With thismoney, our author plann'd a scheme of going to London, which he soonafter executed, not very advantageously.--'My first business, says he,was to apply myself to those few friends I had there, who conjecturingI had left the university, exclusive of my father's knowledge, gave butslender encouragement to a young beginner. However, no whit daunted (myfirst resolution still standing by me) I launched forth into the world,committing myself to the mercy of fortune, and the uncertain temper ofthe town. I soon acquired a new set of acquaintance; and began to havea relish of what I had only tasted before by hearsay; and indeed, everything served to convince me, I had changed for the better, except thatmy slender subsistance began to waste extremely; and ruminating upon thedifficulty of obtaining a supply, I was then laid under the necessityof thinking what course to steer. I knew how justly I had incurred thedispleasure of an indulgent father, and how far I had put myself fromretrieving his favour. Amidst this serious contemplation! I resolved togo through stitch with my enterprize, let what will come on't: However,that I might use discretion, to palliate an unforeseen event, Idetermined 'twere better to trust to the flexibility of a father'stemper, than to lay too great a stress upon the humanity of fortune,who would let a man of morals starve if he depended on her favours.Therefore, without more ado (having taken my sorrowful leave of my lastguinea, and reduced Carolus Secundus, from a whole number, to decimalfractions) I dispatched a letter into the country, full of excuse, andpenitence, baited with all the submissive eloquence imaginable. In themean time, I was no less sedulous to find out some employment, thatmight suit with my genius, and with my dependencies at home, render mylife easy.'Whether his father was touched by the epistle which our author inconsequence of this resolution wrote to him, we cannot ascertain, asthere is no mention made of it. Soon after this, we find him schoolmaster of Kingston upon Thames, and happy for him, had he continued inthat more certain employment, and not have so soon exchanged it forbeggary and reputation. Mr. Brown, impatient of a recluse life, quittedthe school, and came again to London; and as he found his old companionsmore delighted with his wit, than ready to relieve his necessities, hehad recourse to scribbling for bread, which he performed with varioussuccess. Dr. Drake, who has written a defence of our author's character,prefixed to his works, informs us, that the first piece which broughthim into reputation, was an account of the conversion of Mr. Bays, in aDialogue, which met with a reception suitable to the wit, spirit, andlearning of it. But though this raised his fame, yet it added verylittle to his profit: For, though it made his company exceedinglycoveted, and might have recommended him to the great, as well as tothe ingenious, yet he was of a temper not to chuse his acquaintance byinterest, and slighted such an opportunity of recommending himself tothe powerful and opulent, as, if wisely improved, might have procuredhim dignities and preferments. The stile of this dialogue, was like thatof his ordinary conversation, lively and facetious. It discovered nosmall erudition, but managed with a great deal of humour, in a burlesqueway; which make both the reasoning and the extensive reading, which areabundantly shewn in it, extremely surprizing and agreeable. The samemanner and humour runs through all his writings, whether Dialogues,Letters, or Poems.The only considerable objection, which the critics have made to hisworks is, that they want delicacy. But in answer to this, it may beaffirmed, that there is as much refinement in his works, as the natureof humorous satire, which is the chief beauty of his compositions, willadmit; for, as satire requires strong ideas, the language will sometimesbe less polished. But the delicacy so much demanded, by softening thecolours weakens the drawing. Mr. Brown has been charged with inequalityin his writings: which is inseparable from humanity.Our author's letters, though written carelesly to private friends, bearthe true stamp and image of a genius. The variety of his learning may beseen in the Lacedaemonian Mercury, where abundance of critical questionsof great nicety, are answered with much solidity and judgment, aswell as wit, and humour. But that design exposing him too much to thescruples of the grave and reserved, as well as to the censure, andcuriosity of the impertinent, he soon discontinued it. Besides, as thiswas a periodical work, he who was totally without steadiness, was veryill qualified for such an undertaking. When the press called upon himfor immediate supply, he was often found debauching himself at a tavern,and by excessive drinking unable to perform his engagements with thepublic, by which no doubt the work considerably suffered.But there is yet another reason why Mr. Brown has been charged withinequality in his writings, viz. that most of the anonymous pieces whichhappened to please the town, were fathered upon him. This, though inreality an injury to him, is yet a proof of the universality of hisreputation, when whatever pleased from an unknown hand was ascribedto him; but by these means he was reputed the writer of many thingsunworthy of him. In poetry he was not the author of any long piece, forhe was quite unambitious of reputation of that kind. They are generallyOdes, Satires, and Epigrams, and are certainly not the best part of hisworks. His Translations in Prose are many, and of various kinds. Hisstile is strong and masculine; and if he was not so nice in the choiceof his authors, as might be expected from a man of his taste, he must beexcused; for he performed his translations as a talk, prescribed himby the Booksellers, from whom he derived his chief support. It was themisfortune of our author to appear on the stage of the world, whenfears, and jealousies had soured the tempers of men, and politics, andpolemics, had almost driven mirth and good nature out of the nation:so that the careless gay humour, and negligent chearful wit, whichin former days of tranquility, would have recommended him to theconversation of princes, was, in a gloomy period, lost upon a peopleincapable of relishing genuine humour.An anonymous author who has given the world some account of Mr. Brown,observes, 'that it was not his immorality that hindered him fromclimbing to the top of poetry, and preferment; but that he had aparticular way of sinning to himself. To speak in plain English (sayshe) Tom Brown had less the spirit of a gentleman than the rest ofthe Wits, and more of a Scholar. Tom thought himself as happy with aretailer of damnation in an obscure hole, as another to have gone tothe devil with all the splendour of a fine equipage. 'Twas not thebrightness of Caelia's eyes, nor her gaudy trappings that attracted hisheart. Cupid might keep his darts to himself; Tom always carried hisfire about him. If he had but a mouth, two eyes, and a nose, he neverenquired after the regularity of her dress, or features. He alwaysbrought a good stomach with him, and used but little ceremony in thepreface. As of his mistresses, so he was very negligent in the choice ofhis companions, who were sometimes mean and despicable, a circumstancewhich never fails to ruin a man's reputation. He was of a lazy temper,and the Booksellers who gave him credit enough as to his capacity, hadno confidence to put in his diligence. The same gentleman informs us,that though Tom Brown was a good-natured man, yet he had one perniciousquality, which eternally procured him enemies, and that was, rather tolose his friend, than his joke.One of his lampoons had almost cost him a procession at the cart's tail;nor did he either spare friend or foe, if the megrim of abuse onceseized him. He had a particular genius for scandal, and dealt it outliberally when he could find occasion. He is famed for being the authorof a Libel, fixed one Sunday morning on the doors of Westminster-abbey,and many others, against the clergy and quality. As for religion, Brownnever professed any, and used to say, that he understood the worldbetter than to have the imputation of righteousness laid to his charge:and the world, to be even with him, really thought him an Atheist. Butthough Brown never made any professions of religion, yet it proceededmore from affectation than conviction. When he came upon his death-bed,he expressed remorse for his past life, and discovered at that period,sentiments which he had never before suffered to enter his mind. Thispenitential behaviour, in the opinion of some, was the occasion why allhis brethren neglected him, and did not bestow on his memory one elegiacsong, nor any of the rites of verse. We find no encomiums upon him, butwhat appeared in a Grubstreet Journal, which, however, are much superiorto what was usually to be found there.  ----A mournful muse from Albion swains produce,  Sad as the song a gloomy genius chuse,  In artful numbers let his wit be shewn,  And as he sings of Doron's speak his own;  Such be the bard, for only such is fit,  To trace pale Doron thro' the fields of wit.Towards the latter end of our author's life, we are informed by Mr.Jacob, that he was in favour with the earl of Dorset, who invited him todinner on a Christmas-day, with Mr. Dryden, and some other gentlemen,celebrated for ingenuity, (according to his lordship's usual custom)when Mr. Brown, to his agreeable surprize, found a Bank Note of 50 l.under his plate, and Mr. Dryden at the same time was presented withanother of 100 l. Acts of munificence of this kind were very common withthat generous spirited nobleman.Mr. Brown died in the year 1704, and was interred in the Cloyster ofWestminster-abbey, near the remains of Mrs. Behn, with whom he wasintimate in his life-time. His whole works consisting of Dialogues,Essays, Declamations, Satires, Letters from the Dead to the Living,Translations, Amusements, &c. were printed in 4 vol. 12mo, 1707. Inorder that the reader may conceive a true idea of the spirit and humour,as well as of the character of Tom Brown, we shall here insert anImaginary Epistle, written from the Shades to his Friends among theLiving; with a copy of Verses representing the Employment of hispoetical Brethren in that fancied Region.TOM. BROWN to his Friends among the Living.GENTLEMEN,I bear it with no little concern to find myself so soon forgot among ye;I have paid as constant attendance to post-hours, in expectation to hearfrom ye, as a hungry Irish Man (at twelve) to a three-penny ordinary, ora decayed beau for nice eating to a roasting-cock's. No amorous-keepingfool, banished from his Chloris in town, to his country solitude, haswaited with greater impatience for a kind epistle from her, than I forone from you. I have searched all private packets, and examined everystraggling ghost that came from your parts, without being able to getthe least intelligence of your affairs. This is the third since myarrival in these gloomy regions, and I can give myself no reason why Ihave received none in answer, unless the packet-boat has been takenby the French, or that so little time has quite excluded me from yourmemories. In my first I gave you an account of my journey hither, and myreception among the ingenious in these gloomy regions.I arrived on the Banks of Acheron, and found Charon scooping his wherry,who seeing me approach him, bid me sit down a little, for he had beenhard worked lately, and could not go with a single passenger: I waswilling enough to embrace the proposal, being much fatigued and weary.Having finished what he was about, he cast his rueful aspect up tothe clouds, and demonstrating from thence (as I suppose) it was neardinner-time, he took from out a locker or cupboard in the stern of hispinnace, some provender pinned up in a clean linnen clout, and a jack ofliquor, and fell too without the least shew of ceremony, unless indeedit were to offer me the civility of partaking with him. He mutteredsomething to himself, which might be grace as far as I know; but if itwere, 'twas as short as that at an Auction-dinner, nor did he devourwhat was before him with less application than I have seen some there.For my part, I could not but contemplate on his shaggy locks, hiswither'd sun-burnt countenance, together with the mightiness andsanctity of his beard; but above all, his brawny chopt knuckles employedmy attention: In short, having satisfied the cormorant in his guts,he had time to ask me what country-man I was? to which I submissivelyanswered, an English-man: O, says he, those English-men are merryrogues, and love mischief; I have sometimes a diverting story fromthence: What news have you brought with you? truly I told his highnessI came away a little dissatisfied, and had not made any remarks on theworld for some time before my death; and for news I had not leisure tobring any thing of moment. But ere we had talked much more, we sawtwo other passengers approach us, who, by their often turning to oneanother, and their laying down arguments with their hands, seemed to bein warm debate together; which was as we conjectured; for when theydrew nearer to us, they proved to be a termagant High-Flyer, and apuritanical Scripturian, a fiery Scotchman: Occasional Conformity wastheir subject; for I heard the Scot tell him 'twas all popery, downrightpopery, and that the inquisition in Spain was christianity to it, byretarding the sons of grace from partaking of the gifts of the Lord; hesaid it was the building of Babel, and they were confounded in the worksof their hands by the confusion of tongues; such crys, says he, wentforth before the desolation of the great city.Thou the son of grace, says the other, thou art a son of Satan, and hastpreached up iniquity; ye are the evil tares, and the land can neverprosper 'till ye are rooted out from among the good corn.Thou art an inventer of lies, said the disciple of John Calvin, and thetruth is not in thee; ye are bloody minded wretches, and your fury isthe only sign of your religion, as the steeple is to the church; yourorgans are the prophane tinkling of the cimbals of Satan, that ticklethe ears with vanity.Thus the dispute lasted till they came to us, and getting into the boat,they jostled for preeminence, which might have proved a sharp conflict,had not the old fellow took up a stretcher and parted them. After whichwe parted peaceably over to the other side: being-landed, the Scot and Itook our way together, and left the furious churchman to vent his spleenby himself. We had not travelled long before we came to a populousvillage, where, from the various multitude, our eyes encountered at adistance, we might easily conjecture that something more than ordinaryhad gathered them together in that manner; it resembled (as near asI can describe it) that famous place called Sherrick-fair, or aStaffordshire-Wake. While we were applying our admiration that way, wearrived at a small hut erected for that purpose, where Nero the tyrant,like a blind fiddler, was surrounded by a confused tribe of all sortsand sexes, like another Orpheus among the beasts.The various remarks I made (some dancing, some prancing; some clapping,some knapping; some drinking, some winking; some kissing, some pissing;some reeling, some stealing) urged my curiosity to enquire for whatit was possible those noble sports might be ordained, and was soonsatisfied it was the Anniversary Feast of their Great Lady Proserpine'sbirth-day. But these things that I took to be diverting, so elevated thespleen of my Puritan companion, that he began loudly to exclaim againstthose prophane exercises: he said, they were impure, and lifted upthe mind to lewdness; that those that followed them, were the sons ofBelial, and wore the mark of the beast in their foreheads. I endeavouredto pacify the sanctified brother, by putting him in mind where we were,and that his rashness might draw us into danger, being in a strangeplace; but all was in vain, I but stirred up his fury more; for, turninghis rebukes upon me, he told me, I was myself one of the wicked, and didrejoice in my heart at the deeds of darkness: no, says he, I will not bepacified, I will roar aloud to drown their incantations; yea, I will setout a throat even as the beast that belloweth! so that perceiving themob gather about him, I thought it prudence to steal off, and leave himto the fury of those, whose displeasure he was about to incur.I had not gone far, but I 'spied two brawney champions at a rubbersof cuffs, which by the dexterity of their head's, hands, and heels,I judged could be no other than Englishmen: nor were my sentimentsgroundless, for presently I heard the mob cry out, O! rare Jo! O! rareJo! and attentively Surveying the combatants, I found it to be the merryJo Haynes, fallen out with Plowden the famous Lawyer, about a gameat Nine-holes; and that shout had proclaimed Joe victorious. I wassomething scrupulous of renewing my acquaintance, not knowing how theconqueror, in the midst of his success, might use me for making boldwith his character in my letters from the read; though I felt a secretdesire to discover myself, yet prudence withstood my inclination, 'tilla more convenient season might so that I brushed off to a place where Isaw a concourse of the better sort of people; there I found Millingtonthe famous Auctioneer, among a crowd of Lawyers, Physicians, Scholars,Poets, Critics, Booksellers, &c. exercising his old faculty; for which,gentlemen, he is as particularly famed in these parts, as Herostratusfor firing the famous Temple, or Barthol Swarts, for the invention ofGunpowder. He is head journey-man to Ptolemy, who keeps a Bookseller'sshop here, and rivals even Jacob Tonson in reputation among the greatwits.But most of all I was obliged to admire my friend Millington, who, byhis powerful knack of eloquence, to the wonder of the whole company,sold Cave's Lives of the Fathers to Solomon the Magnificent, and theScotch Directory to the Priests of the Sun; nay, he sold-ArchbishopLaud's Life to Hugh Peters, Hob's Leviathan to Pope Boniface, and pop'dBunyan's Works upon Bellarmine for a piece of unrevealed Divinity; Afterthe sale was over, I took an opportunity of making myself known to him,who caressed me with all the freedom imaginable, asking me, how longI had been in these parts? and what news from the other world? and athousand particular questions about his old friends; to all which Iresponded as well as I could: and having given me a caution to avoidsome people, by whom I was threatened, for exposing them in my letters,we went to take a bottle together.Now I presume, gentlemen, you will conclude it high time for me to takemy leave; nor shall I tire your patience much longer, only permit meto give ye the trouble of some particular services to those honestgentlemen whose generosity gave me the reputation of a funeral abovewhat I e'er expected, especially to Dr. S----t for bestowing the groundI never frequented, to Dr. Garth and the rest for the charge of a hearseand mourning coaches, which I could not have desired, and to Dr. D----kefor designing me a monument I know the world will reflect I neverdeserved; but for that, let my works testify for me. And though ye aresatisfied my genius was never over-fruitful in the product of verse,yet knowing these favours require something a little uncommon to make asuitable return, I shall take my leave in metre, and, if contrary to myopinion, it meets with a kind acceptance from the town, honest Sam. mayclap it in the next edition of the State Poems, with Buckingham's nameto it.  When a scurvy disease had lain hold of my carcase,  And death to my chamber was mounting the stair-case.  I call'd to remembrance the sins I'd committed,  Repented, and thought I'd for Heaven been fitted;  But alas! there is still an old proverb to cross us,  I found there no room for the sons of Parnassus;  And therefore contented like others to fare,  To the shades of Elizium I strait did repair;  Where Dryden and other great wits o' the town,  To reward all their labours, are damn'd to write on.  Here Johnson may boast of his judgment and plot,  And Otway of all the applause that he got;  Loose Eth'ridge presume on his stile and his wit,  And Shadwell of all the dull plays he e'r writ;  Nat. Lee here may boast of his bombast and rapture,  And Buckingham rail to the end of the chapter;  Lewd Rochester lampoon the King and the court,  And Sidley and others may cry him up for't;  Soft Waller and Suckling, chaste Cowley and others,  With Beaumont and Fletcher, poetical brothers,  May here scribble on with pretence to the bays,  E'en Shakespear himself may produce all his plays,  And not get for whole pages one mouth full of praise.  To avoid this disaster, while Congreve reforms,  His muse and his morals fly to Bracegirdle's arms;  Let Vanbrugh no more plotless plays e'er impose,  Stuft with satire and smut to ruin the house;  Let Rowe, if he means to maintain his applause,  Write no more such lewd plays as his Penitent was.  O Satire! from errors instruct the wild bard,  Bestow thy advice to reclaim each lewd bard;  Bid the Laureat sincerely reflect on the matter;  Bid Dennis drink less, but bid him write better;  Bid Durfey cease scribbling, that libelling song-ster;  Bid Gildon and C----n be Deists no longer;  Bid B----t and C----r, those wits of the age,  Ne'er expose a dull coxcomb, but just on the stage;  Bid Farquhar (tho' bit) to his consort be just,  And Motteux in his office be true to his trust;  Bid Duffet and Cowper no longer be mad,  But Parsons and Lawyers mind each their own trade.  To Grubster and others, bold satire advance;  Bid Ayliffe talk little, and P----s talk sense;  Bid K----n leave stealing as well as the rest;  When this can be done, they may hope to be blest.       *       *       *       *       *The Revd. Mr. JOHN POMFRET.This Gentleman's works are held in very great esteem by the commonreaders of poetry; it is thought as unfashionable amongst people ofinferior life, not to be possessed of the poems of Pomfret, as amongstpersons of taste not to have the works of Pope in their libraries. Thesubjects upon which Pomfret wrote were popular, his versification is farfrom being unmusical, and as there is little force of thinking in hiswritings, they are level to the capacities of those who admire them.Our author was son of the rev. Mr. Pomfret, rector of Luton inBedfordshire, and he himself was preferred to the living of Malden inthe same county. He was liberally educated at an eminent grammar schoolin the country, from whence he was sent to the university of Cambridge,but to what college is not certain. There he wrote most of his poeticalpieces, took the degree of master of arts, and very early accomplishedhimself in most kinds of polite literature. A gentleman who writes underthe name of Philalethes, and who was an intimate friend of Pomfret's,has cleared his reputation from the charge of fanaticism, which someof his malicious enemies brought against him. It was shortly after hisleaving the university, that he was preferred to the living of Maldenabovementioned, and was, says that gentleman, so far from beingtinctured with fanaticism, that I have often heard him express hisabhorrence of the destructive tenets maintained by that people, bothagainst our religious and civil rights. This imputation it seems wascast on him by there having been one of his sur-name, though not any wayrelated to him, a dissenting teacher, and who published some rhimes uponspiritual subjects, as he called them, and which sufficiently proved himan enthusiast.About the year 1703 Mr. Pomfret came up to London, for institution andinduction, into a very considerable living, but was retarded for sometime by a disgust taken by dr. Henry Compton, then bishop of London, atthese four lines, in the close of his poem entitled The Choice.  And as I near approach'd the verge of life,  Some kind relation (for I'd have no wife)  Should take upon him all my worldly care,  While I did for a better state prepare.The parenthesis in these verses was so maliciously represented to thebishop, that his lordship was given to understand, it could bear noother construction than that Mr. Pomfret preferred a mistress before awife; though the words may as well admit of another meaning, and importno more, than the preference of a single life to marriage; unless thegentlemen in orders will assert, that an unmarried Clergyman cannotlive without a mistress. But the bishop was soon convinced that thisaspersion against him, was no more than an effort of malice, as Mr.Pomfret at that time was really married. The opposition which hisenemies made to him, had, in some measure, its effect; for by theobstructions he met with, he was obliged to stay longer in London thanhe intended, and as the Small-pox then raged in the metropolis, hesickened them, and died in London in the 36th year of his age.The above-mentioned friend of Mr. Pomfret, has likewise shewn theungenerous treatment he met with in regard to his poetical compositions,in a book entitled Poems by the Earl of Roscommon, and Mr. Duke, printed1717, in the preface to which, the publisher has peremptorily insertedthe following paragraph. 'In this collection says he, of my lordRoscommon's poems, care has been taken to insert all I possibly couldprocure, that are truly genuine, there having been several thingspublished under his name, which were written by others, the authors ofwhich I could set down if it were material. Now, says the gentleman,this arrogant editor would have been more just, both to the public, andto the earl of Roscommon's memory, in telling us what things had beenpublished under his lordship's name by others, than by concealing theauthors of any such gross impositions. Instead of which, he is so much astranger to impartiality, that he has been guilty of the very crime heexclaims against; for he has not only attributed the prospect of deathto the earl of Roscommon, which was wrote by Mr. Pomfret, after thedecease of that lord; but likewise another piece entitled the Prayer ofJeremy Paraphrased, prophetically representing the passionate grief ofthe Jewish people, for the loss of their town, and sanctuary, written byMr. Southcot, a gentleman who published it in the year 1717, so that itis to be hoped, in a future edition of the earl of Roscommon's, and Mr.Duke's poems, the same care will be taken to do these gentlemen justice,as to prevent any other person from hereafter injuring the memory of hislordship.'Mr. Pomfret published his poems in the year 1690, to which he hasprefixed a very modest and sensible preface, 'I am not so fond of fame,says he, as to desire it from the injudicious many; nor as so mortifieda temper as not to wish it from the discerning few. 'Tis not themultitude of applauders, but the good fame of the applauders, whichestablishes a valuable reputation.'His poetical compositions consist chiefly of1. The Choice, which we shall insert as a specimen.2. Cruelty and Lust, an Epistolary Essay, founded upon the famousStory which happened in the reign of King James II. Kirk, who was thatPrince's general against the duke of Monmouth. was sollicited by abeautiful lady in behalf of her husband, who then lay under sentence ofdeath. The inhuman general consented to grant his fair petitioner herrequest; but at no less a price than that of her innocence. The ladydoated on her husband, and maintained a hard struggle between virtue,and affection, the latter of which at last prevailed, and she yielded tohis guilty embraces. The next morning Kirk, with unparalleled brutality,desired the lady to look out at the window of his bedchamber, when shewas struck with the horrid sight of her husband upon a scaffold, readyto receive the blow of the executioner; and before she could reach theplace where he was, in order to take a last embrace, her husband was nomore.How far the lady may be justified in this conduct, is not our businessto discuss: if it is called by the name of guilt, none ever had morepressing motives; and if such a crime could admit of an excuse, it mustbe upon such an occasion.3. Several Epistles to his Friends under affliction.4. Upon the Divine Attributes.5. A Prospect of Death.5. Upon the General Conflagration, and the ensuing Judgment. There weretwo pieces of our author's, published after his death by his friendPhilalethes; the first of these entitled Reason, was wrote by him in theyear 1700, when the debates concerning the doctrine of the Trinity werecarried on with so much heat by the Clergy one against another, that theroyal authority was interposed in order to put an end to a controversy,which could never be settled, and which was pernicious in itsconsequences. This is a severe satire, upon one of the parties engagedin that dispute, but his not inserting it amongst his other poems whenhe collected them into a volume, was, on account of his having receivedvery particular favours, from some of the persons therein mentioned. Theother is entitled Dies Novissima, or the Last Epiphany, a Pindaric Odeon Christ's second Appearance to judge the World. In this piece the poetexpresses much heart-felt piety: It is animated, if not with a poetical,at least with so devout a warmth, that as the Guardian has observed ofDivine Poetry, 'We shall find a kind of refuge in our pleasure, and ourdiversion will become our safety.'This is all the account we are favoured with of the life and writingsof Mr. Pomfret: A man not destitute either of erudition or genius, ofunexceptionable morals, though exposed to the malice of antagonists. Ashe was a prudent man, and educated to a profession, he was not subjectto the usual necessities of the poets, but his sphere being somewhatobscure, and his life unactive, there are few incidents recordedconcerning him. If he had not fortune sufficient to render himconspicuous, he had enough to keep his life innocent, which he seems tohave spent in ease and tranquillity, a situation much more to be enviedthan the highest blaze of fame, attended with racking cares, andinnumerable sollicitudes.The CHOICE.  If Heav'n the grateful liberty would give,  That I might chuse my method how to live.  And all those hours propitious fate should lend,  In blissful ease and satisfaction spend,    Near some fair town I'd have a private seat,  Built uniform; not little, nor too great:  Better if on a rising ground it flood  On this side fields, on that a neighb'ring wood.  It should within no other things contain,  But what were useful, necessary, plain:  Methinks 'tis nauseous, and I'd ne'r endure  The needless pomp of gawdy furniture.  A little garden, grateful to the eye,  And a cool rivulet run murm'ring by:  On whose delicious banks a slately row  Of shady Lymes or Sycamores should grow.  At th' end of which a silent study plac'd,  Should be with all the noblest authors grac'd.  Horace and Virgil, in whose mighty lines  Immortal wit and solid learning shines.  Sharp Juvenal, and am'rous Ovid too,  Who all the turns of love's soft passion knew:  He that with judgment reads his charming lines,  In which strong art with stronger nature joins,  Must grant his fancy, does the best excel;  His thoughts so tender, and express'd so well.  With all those moderns, men of steady sense,  Esteem'd for learning, and for eloquence.  In some of these, as fancy should advise.  I'd always take my morning exercise:  For sure no minutes bring us more content,  Than those in pleasing, useful studies spent.    I'd have a clear, and competent estate,  That I might live genteely, but not great:  As much as I could moderately spend,  A little more, sometimes t' oblige a friend.  Nor should the sons of poverty repine  Too much at fortune, they should taste of mine;  And all that objects of true pity were  Should be reliev'd with what my wants could spare:  For that, our Maker has too largely giv'n,  Should be return'd, in gratitude to Heav'n,  A frugal plenty mould my table spread;  With healthy, not luxurious, dimes fed:  Enough to satisfy, and something more  To feed the stranger, and the neighb'ring poor:  Strong meat indulges vice, and pamp'ring food  Creates diseases, and inflames the blood.  But what's sufficient to make nature strong,  And the bright lamp of life continue long,  I'd freely take, and, as I did possess,  The bounteous author of my plenty bless.    I'd have a little vault, but always stor'd  With the best wines each vintage could afford.  Wine whets the wit, improves its native force,  And gives a pleasant flavour to discourse:  By making all our spirits debonair,  Throws off the lees, the sediment of care,  But as the greatest blessing Heav'n lends,  May be debauch'd and serve ignoble ends:  So, but too oft, the Grape's refreshing juice  Does many mischievous effects produce.  My house should no such rude disorders know,  As from high drinking consequently flow:  Nor would I use what was so kindly giv'n  To the dishonour of indulgent Heav'n.  If any neighbour came, he should be free,  Us'd with respect, and not uneasy be,  In my retreat, or to himself or me.  What freedom, prudence, and right reason give,  All men may with impunity receive:  But the least swerving from their rule's too much;  For what's forbidden us, 'tis death to touch.    That life might be more comfortable yet,  And all my joys resin'd, sincere, and great;  I'd chuse two friends, whose company would be  A great advance to my felicity.  Well born, of humour suited to my own;  Discreet, and men, as well as books, have known.  Brave, gen'rous, witty, and exactly free  From loose behaviour, or formality.  Airy, and prudent, merry, but not light;  Quick in discerning, and in judging right.  Secret they should be, faithful to their trust;  In reas'ning cool, strong, temperate, and just.  Obliging, open, without huffing, brave,  Brisk in gay talking, and in sober, grave.  Close in dispute, but not tenacious; try'd  By solid reason, and let that decide.  Not prone to lust, revenge, or envious hate;  Nor busy medlers with intrigues of state.  Strangers to slander, and sworn foes to spight:  Not quarrelsome, but stout enough to fight.  Loyal, and pious, friends to Caesar, true  As dying martyrs, to their Maker too.  In their society I could not miss  A permanent, sincere, substantial bliss.    Would bounteous Heav'n once more indulge; I'd chuse  (For who would so much satisfaction, lose,  As witty nymphs in conversation, give)  Near some obliging, modest fair to live;  For there's that sweetness in a female mind,  Which in a man's we cannot hope to find:  That by a secret, but a pow'rful art,  Winds up the springs of life, and does impart  Fresh vital heat, to the transported heart.    I'd have her reason all her passions sway;  Easy in company, in private gay:  Coy to a fop, to the deserving free,  Still constant to herself, and just to me.  A soul she should have, for great actions fit;  Prudence and wisdom to direct her wit:  Courage to look bold danger in the face,  No fear, but only to be proud, or base:  Quick to advise, by an emergence prest,  To give good counsel, or to take the best.  I'd have th' expression of her thoughts be such  She might not seem reserv'd, nor talk too much.  That shew a want of judgment and of sense:  More than enough is but impertinence.  Her conduct regular, her mirth resin'd,  Civil to strangers to her neighbours kind,  Averte to vanity, revenge, and pride,  In all the methods of deceit untry'd.  So faithful to her friend, and good to all,  No censure might upon her actions fall:  Then would e'en envy be compell'd to say,  She goes the least of woman kind astray.    To this fair creature I'd sometimes retire,  Her conversation would new joys inspire;  Give life an edge so keen, no surly care  Would venture to assault my soul, or dare  Near my retreat to hide one secret snare.  But so divine, so noble a repast  I'd seldom, and with moderation taste,  For highest cordials all their virtue lose  By a too frequent, and too bold an use:  And what would cheer the spirit in distress;  Ruins our health, when taken to excess.    I'd be concern'd in no litigious jar,  Belov'd by all, not vainly popular.  Whate'er assistance I had pow'r to bring  T' oblige my country, or to serve my King,  Whene'er they call'd, I'd readily afford  My tongue, my pen, my counsel, or my sword.  Law suits I'd shun, with as much studious care,  As I would dens where hungry lions are:  And rather put up injuries, than be  A plague to him, who'd be a plague to me.  I value quiet at a price too great,  To give for my revenge so dear a rate:  For what do we by all our bustle gain,  But counterfeit delight, for real pain;    If Heav'n a date of many years would give,  Thus I'd in pleasure, ease, and plenty live.  And as I near approach'd the verge of life,  Some kind relation (for I'd have no wife)  Should take upon him all my worldly care,  While I did for a better state prepare.  Then I'd not be with any trouble vex'd;  Nor have the evening of my days perplex'd.  But by a silent, and a peaceful death,  Without a sigh, resign my aged breath:  And when committed to the dust, I'd have  Few tears, but friendly, dropt into my grave.  Then would my exit so propitious be,  All men would wish to live and die, like me.       *       *       *       *       *The LIFE ofDr. WILLIAM KING.This ingenious gentleman, was son of Ezekiel King, of London. Hereceived the rudiments of his education in Westminster-school, underDr. Busby, and was removed from thence to Christ's-Church in Oxford, inMichaelmas term, 1681, when at the age of eighteen. He studied the civillaw, and practiced it at Doctor's Commons, with very great reputation;but the natural gaiety of his temper, and the love of company, betrayedhim into those pleasures, which were incompatible with his profession.Our author, by the reputation of his abilities obtained a patron inthe earl of Pembroke, who upon his being appointed lord Lieutenant ofIreland, press'd him to go over to that kingdom.Upon Dr. King's arrival in Ireland, his excellency appointed him judgeadvocate, sole commissioner of the prizes, and record keeper. There, hewas well received, and countenanced by persons of the most distinguishedrank, and could he have changed his disposition with the climate, hadthen an opportunity of making his fortune; but so far was he fromimproving this occasion to the purposes of his interest, that hereturned back to England, with no other treasure, than a few merryPoems, and humorous Essays. He was naturally of a courteous behaviour,and very obliging: His conversation was chearful, and his wit pleasantand entertaining. But at length he chiefly subsisted on his fellowshipin Christ-Church College: Before this time, he had published his mostingenious Poem, called the Art of Cookery, in imitation of Horace'sArt of Poetry, with some Letters to Dr. Lister and others; occasionedprincipally by the title of a book, published by the Dr. being the worksof Apicius Coelius, concerning the soups and sauces of the ancients,with an extract of the greatest curiosities contained in that book.Amongst his Letters, is one upon the Denti Scalps, or Tooth-picks of theAntients: Another contains an imitation of Horace: Epist. 5. Book I.being his invitation of Torquatus to supper. And a third, containsremarks on lord Grimston's play, called the Lawyer's Fortune; or Love ina Hollow-Tree.At his leisure hours he wrote likewise, The Art of Love, an imitation ofOvid, De Arte Amandi. To which he prefixed an account of Ovid. Inthe latter part of his life, about the year 1711, he published anHistorical Account of the Heathen Gods, and Heroes, for the useof Westminster, and other schools; for the better and more easyunderstanding of the Classics. Besides these performances, we likewisefind three numbers of a project, entitled, the Transactioner, or, UsefulTransactions: Containing a great number of small pieces, which it wouldbe tedious here to enumerate.[1]We have already observed, that our author while in Ireland, neglectedthe best opportunity of encreasing his fortune; and the circumstancewhich occasioned it we find to be this: He had contracted an intimacywhich soon grew into friendship, with judge Upton, a man of the sametemper with himself, who delighted in retirement and poetical amusement.He had a country villa called Mountown, near Dublin, where he and Dr.King used to retire, and spend most of their time without any regard totheir public offices; and by these means neglecting to pay court to thelord lieutenant, they fell under his displeasure. These two poeticalcompanions, indulged no other thoughts but those of living and dying intheir rural retreat. Upon this occasion, Dr. King wrote a Pastoral Poem,called Mully of Mountown: Mully was the name of a Red-Cow which gave himmilk, whom he made the chief subject of his Poem; which at that time thecritics would have imposed upon the word as a political allegory,tho' this was a manner of writing, with which the Dr. was totallyunacquainted.When Dr. King, after his return from Ireland, had retired to live uponhis fellowship at Oxford, he was sollicited by the earl of Anglesey tocome to town, and undertake a cause of his, then before the House ofLords, (in relation to some cruelties he was accused of using to hislady) back'd by the violent prosecution of his mother-in-law, thecountess of Dorchester. Upon this occasion the Doctor shook off theindolence of his nature, and so strenuously engaged in the cause of hispatron, that he gained the reputation of an able lawyer as well as apoet. He naturally hated business, especially that of an advocate; butwhen appointed as a delegate, made a very discerning and able judge, yetnever could bear the fatigue of wrangling. His chief pleasure consistedin trifles, and he was never happier, than when hid from the world. Fewpeople pleased him in conversation, and it was a proof of his likingthem, if his behaviour was tolerably agreeable. He was a greatdissembler of his natural temper, which was fallen, morose, and peevish,where he durst shew it; but he was of a timorous disposition andthe least slight or neglect offered to him, would throw him into amelancholy despondency. He was apt to say a great many ill-natur'dthings, but was never known to do one: He was made up of tenderness,pity, and compassion; and of so feminine a disposition, that tears wouldfall from his eyes upon the smallest occasion.As his education had been strict, so he was always of a religiousdisposition, and would not enter upon the business of the day, till hehad performed his devotion, and read several portions of scripture outof the Psalms, the Prophets, and the New-Testament.It appears from his loose papers, which he calls Adversaria, that hehad been such an arduous student, that before he was eight-years in theuniversity, he had read over and made reflections on twenty-two thousandbooks and manuscripts; a few of which, we shall give as specimen, inorder to let the reader into the humour and taste of our author.'Diogenes Laertius, Book I.----Thales, being asked how a man might mosteasily brook misfortunes? answered, if he saw his enemies in a worsecondition. It is not agreed, concerning the wisemen; or whether indeedthey were seven.''There is a very good letter of Pisistratus to Solon, and of the samestile and character with those of Phalaris.''Solon ordained, that the guardians of orphans should not cohabit withtheir mothers: And that no person should be a guardian to those, whoseestate descended to them at the orphan's decease. That no seal-gravershould keep the seal of a ring that was sold: That, if any man put outthe eye of him who had but one, he should lose both, his own: That,where a man never planted, it should be death to take away: That, itshould be death for a magistrate to be taken in drink. Solon's lettersat the end of his life, in Laertius, give us a truer Idea of the man,than all he has written before, and are indeed very fine: Solon's toCraesus are very genteel; and Pitaccus's on the other side, are rude andphilosophical; However, both shew Craesus to have been a very good man.These epistles give a further reason to believe, that the others werewritten by Phalaris. There is a letter from Cleobulus to Solon, toinvite him to Lindus.''Bion used to say, it was more easy to determine differences, betweenenemies than friends; for that of two friends, one would become anenemy; but of two enemies, one would become a friend.''Anacharsis has an epistle to Craesus, to thank him for his invitation;and Periander one to all the wise men, to invite them to Corinth to him,after their return from Lydia. Epimenides has an epistle to Solon, toinvite him to Crete, under the tyranny of Pisistratus.''Epimenides often pretended that he rose from death to life.'The above notes are sufficient to shew that he read the ancients withattention, and knew how to select the most curious passages, and mostdeserving the reader's observation.About the year 1711 the Dr. published a piece called the BritishPalladium, or a welcome of lord, Bolingbroke from France. Soon afterthis, Dr. Swift, Dr. Friend, Mr. Prior, with some others of lordBolingbroke's adherents, paid a visit to Dr. King, and brought alongwith them, the key of the Gazetteer's office, together with another keyfor the use of the paper office. The day following this friendly visit,the Dr. entered upon his new post; and two or three days after waited onhis benefactor lord Bolingbroke, then secretary of state.The author of the Doctor's life, published by Curl, has related aninstance of inhumanity in alderman Barber, towards Dr. King. Thismagistrate was then printer of the Gazette, and was so cruel as tooblige the Dr. to sit up till three or four o'clock in the morning,upon those days the Gazette was published, to correct the errors of thepress; which was not the business of the author, but a corrector, who iskept for that purpose in every printing-office of any consequence. Thisslavery the Dr. was not able to bear, and therefore quitted the office.The alderman's severity was the more unwarrantable, as the Dr. had beenvery kind in obliging him, by writing Examiners, and some other papers,gratis, which were of advantage to him as a printer. Those writings atthat juncture made him known to the ministry, who afterwards employedhim in a state paper called the Gazettee.About Midsummer 1712 the Dr. quitted his employ, and retired to agentleman's house on Lambeth side the water; where he had divertedhimself a summer or two before: Here he enjoyed his lov'd tranquility,with a friend, a bottle, and his books; he frequently visited lordClarendon, at Somerset-house, as long as he was able. It was the autumnseason, and the Dr. began insensibly to droop: He shut himself upentirely from his nearest friends, and would not so much as see lordClarendon; who hearing of his weak condition, ordered his sister to goto Lambeth, and fetch him from thence to a lodging he had provided forhim, in the Strand, over against Somerset-house where next dayabout noon he expired, with all the patience, and resignation of aphilosopher, and the true devotion of a christian; but would not bepersuaded to go to rest the night before, till he made such a will, ashe thought would be agreeable to lord Clarendon's inclinations; whoafter his death took care of his funeral. He was decently interred inthe cloisters of Westminster-Abbey, next to his master Dr. Knipe, towhom a little before, he dedicated his Heathen Gods.----The gentlemanalready mentioned, who has transmitted some account of our author toposterity, delineates his character in the following manner. 'He wasa civilian, exquisitely well read; a skillful judge, and among thelearned, an universal scholar, a critic, and an adept; in all sciencesand languages expert; and our English. Ovid, among the poets: Inconversation, he was grave and entertaining, without levity or spleen:As an author, his character may be also summ'd up in the followinglines.'  Read here, in softest sounds the sweetest satire,  A pen dipt deep in gall, a heart good-nature;  An English Ovid, from his birth he seems,  Inspired alike with strong poetic dreams;  The Roman, rants of heroes, gods, and Jove,  The Briton, purely paints the art of love.As a specimen of our author's versification, we shall select a Poem ofhis called, the Art of making Puddings; published in his Miscellanies.  I sing of food, by British nurse design'd,  To make the stripling brave, and maiden kind.  Delay not muse in numbers to rehearse  The pleasures of our life, and sinews of our verse.  Let pudding's dish, most wholsome, be thy theme,  And dip thy swelling plumes in fragrant cream.  Sing then that dim so fitting to improve  A tender modesty, and trembling love;  Swimming in butter of a golden hue,  Garnish'd with drops of Rose's spicy dew.  Sometimes the frugal matron seems in haste,  Nor cares to beat her pudding into paste:  Yet milk in proper skillet she will place,  And gently spice it with a blade of mace;  Then set some careful damsel to look to't;  And still to stir away the bishop's-foot;  For if burnt milk shou'd to the bottom stick,  Like over-heated-zeal, 'twould make folks sick.  Into the Milk her flow'r she gently throws,  As valets now wou'd powder tender beaus:  The liquid forms in hasty mass unite,  Both equally delicious as they're white.  In mining dish the hasty mass is thrown,  And seems to want no graces but its own.  Yet still the housewife brings in fresh supplies,  To gratify the taste, and please the eyes.  She on the surface lumps of butter lays,  Which, melting with the heat, its beams displays;  From whence it causes wonder to behold  A silver soil bedeck'd with streams of gold![Footnote 1: The design of this work, was to ridicule Sir Hans Sloan'swritings, in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal-Society; ofwhich Dr. Sloan was secretary. This work, of Dr. King's, which is nowbecome very scarce, is one of the severest and merriest Satires thatever was written in Prose.]       *       *       *       *       *THOMAS SPRAT (Bishop of ROCHESTER)Was descended from a very worthy, though obscure family, being the sonof a private country minister; but his great merit raised him to thateminent station in the church, wherein he long presided, and wasdeservedly accounted one of the most considerable prelates of his time.The Oxford antiquary informs us, that on the 16th of January 1654, hewas entered in Wadham-College, where he pursued his studies with theclosest application, and distinguished himself by his prudent andcourteous behaviour.On the 3d of July 1669, Mr. Sprat took his master of arts degree, andthe same day, commenced doctor in divinity. He had not long been inholy orders, till he was introduced at court, and by a happy power inconversation, so attracted the regard of Charles the IId. that he wasconsidered as a man standing fair for preferment. In 1683, broke out theRye-house Plot, a relation of the particulars of which, Charles the IId.commanded Dr. Sprat to draw up. This the Dr. in a letter to lord Dorset,informs us, he did with great unwillingness, and would have beenimpelled by no other consideration, than that of a royal command. Thereason he executed these orders with so much reluctance, was, becausemany of the most popular men in the nation were either concernedthemselves, or had some relations engaged, so that an account of a plotthus supported, must expose he writer to partial or popular resentments.He requested the king, that he might be permitted to spare some names,and to represent the behaviour of others in as candid a light aspossible, in which request his majesty indulged him; but notwithstandingall the candour he observed, and the most dispassionate representationof facts, yet his composing this relation, was brought against him as acrime, for which an opposite party endeavoured, and had almost effectedhis ruin. This work, tho' finished in the year 1683 was not publishedtill 1685, when it came into the world, under the immediate directionof king James the IId. It was no doubt in consequence of this courtservice, that he was made dean of Westminster, Anno 1683; and bishop ofRochester the year following. Another step he took in the short reign ofking James, likewise exposed him to the resentment of that powerwhich took place at the revolution, which was his sitting in theecclesiastical commission. By this he drew upon himself almost anuniversal censure, which he acknowledges to be just; as appears by aletter he wrote upon that occasion to the earl of Dorset, in the year1689; which thus begins.'My Lord,I think I should be wanting to myself at this time, in my own necessaryvindication, should I forbear any longer to give my friends a trueaccount of my behaviour in the late ecclesiastical commission. Though Iprofess what I now say, I only intend as a reasonable mitigation of theoffence I have given, not entirely to justify my sitting in that court;for which I acknowledge I have deservedly incurred the censure of manygood men; and I wish I may ever be able to make a sufficient amends tomy country for it.'His crime in this particular was somewhat alleviated, by his renouncingthe commission, when he perceived the illegal practices they were goingto put in execution. His offences were strenuously urged against him,and had not the earl of Dorset warmly espoused his interest, he hadprobably been stript of his ecclesiastical preferments. His lordshipcharged the ill-conduct of both these affairs upon king James and hisministry; and thereby brought the bishop's opponents to a perfectreconciliation with him.Notwithstanding this accommodation, such was the inquietude of thetimes, that his lordship had not long enjoyed this tranquility, beforethere was hatched a most villainous contrivance; not only to take awayhis life, but, the lives of archbishop Sancroft, lord Marlborough,and several other persons of honour and distinction; by forging aninstrument under their hands, setting forth, that they had an intentto restore king James, and to seize upon the person of the princess ofOrange, dead or alive; to surprize the tower, to raise a mighty army;and to bring the city of London into subjection. This black conspiracyto murther so many innocent persons, was by the providence of God soondetested; and his lordship drew up, and published an account of it,under this title, A Relation of the Wicked Contrivance of StephenBlackhead, and Robert Young, against the Lives of several Persons, byforging an Association under their Hands. In two parts. The first beinga Relation of what passed at the three Examinations of his Lordship, bya Committee of Lords of the Privy-Council. The second, being an Accountof the two Authors of the Forgery; printed in quarto, in the year 1692.His lordship was honourably acquitted; and he ever after looked uponthis escape, as one of the most remarkable blessings of his life. 'Insuch 'critical times (says he) how little evidence would have sufficedto ruin any man, that had been accused with the least probability oftruth? I do therefore, most solemnly oblige myself, and all mine, tokeep the grateful remembrance of my deliverance, perpetual and sacred.'Hitherto, we have considered Dr. Sprat in his episcopal, and publiccharacter; in which if he fell into some errors, he has a right to ourcandour, as they seem rather to have proceeded from misinformation, andexcess of good-nature, than any malevolent, or selfish principle: Weshall now take a view of him as an author.His first appearance in that sphere, was in the year 1659, when inconcert with Mr. Waller, and Mr. Dryden, he printed a Pindarique Ode,to the Memory of the most renowned Prince, Oliver, Lord Protector, &c.printed in quarto, which he dedicated to the reverend Mr. Wilkin's, thenwarden of Wadham-College; by whose approbation and request, it was madepublic, as the author designed it only for a private amusement. This wasan unfavourable circumstance for our author, as it more particularlyshews the fickleness of his disposition in state-matters, and gave himless credit with those parties he afterwards espoused.His next production in poetry, was an Ode on the Plague of Athens; whichhappened in the second year of the Pelopponesian war, first describedby Thucydides, afterwards by Lucretius: This Mr. Sprat dedicated to hisworthy and learned friend, Dr. Walter Pope. The performance stood thetest of the severest critics; and in the opinion of the best judges, themanner of his great original was judiciously imitated. Soon after this,he proceeded to give the public a specimen of his abilities inanother kind, and succeeded with the greatest applause; which was hisObservations on Monsieur de Serbiere's Voyage into England, written toDr. Wren, professor of astronomy in Oxford; printed in octavo, in theyear 1665.Mr. Sprat in the beginning of his letter acquaints the Dr. with themotives of his engaging with Monsieur Serbiere, 'Having now (says he)under my hands, the history of the Royal-Society, it will be in vain forme to try to represent its design to be advantageous to the glory ofEngland, if my countrymen shall know, that one who calls himself amember of that society, has escaped unanswered in the public disgraces,which he has cast on our whole nation.'--In this performance Mr. Sprathas given an undeniable proof, that the strength and solidity of anEnglish pen, is infinitely superior to the gallant air of a Frenchauthor, who is sprightly without propriety, and positive without truth.About two years after, 1667, our author published his incomparableHistory of the Royal Society of London, for the improvement of naturalknowledge; a work which has acquired him very great reputation, and hasranked him with the most elegant and polite writers of that age. Soonafter this, Mr. Sprat lost his amiable and much esteemed friend Mr.Abraham Cowley, who by his will recommended to the care of his reverendfriend, the revising of all his works that were printed, and thecollecting of those papers which he had designed for the press. Thistruth Mr. Sprat faithfully discharged, and to the new edition of Mr.Cowley's Works, he prefixed an account of his life and writings,addressed to Mr. Martin Clifford. Happy is it for a good man, when hehas such a friend to close his eyes: This is a desire peculiar to all,and the portion of few to enjoy.  For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey,  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd;  Left the warm precincts of the chearful day,  Nor cast one longing lingring look behind.  On some warm breast the parting soul relies,  Some pious drops the closing eye requires;  E'en from the tomb, the voice of nature cries,  Awake! and faithful to her wonted fires[1].This life of Cowley, by Dr. Sprat has been esteemed one of the mostelegant compositions in our language; there are several extracts from itin our account of the life of that amiable Poet.These are the most material performances of Dr. Sprat: a man, who wasearly introduced into an elevated station in life, which he held notwithout enemies to his dying moments. Villiers duke of Buckingham washis first patron, who notwithstanding his fickleness, and inconsistentlevity, never forsook him; a circumstance which has induced many tobelieve, that that nobleman owed much to the refinement of our author;and that his Rehearsal had never been so excellent, nor so pungent asatire, had it not first passed under Dr. Sprat's perusal.This learned prelate died of an apoplexy, May the 20th, 1713, at hisepiscopal feat in Bromly in Kent, in the 79th year of his age; and wasinterred in the Abbey-Church of Westminster.As he lived esteemed by all his acquaintance, as well as the clergy ofhis diocese, so he died regretted by them, and indeed by all men oftaste; for it is the opinion of many, that he raised the English tongueto that purity and beauty, which former writers were wholly strangersto, and which those who have succeeded him, can but imitate[2].The benevolence of our author is very conspicuous in his last will, infavour of his widow and son; in which he commands them to extend thatbeneficence to his poor relations, which they always found from him; andnot to suffer any of those to want, whose necessitous merit, had sharedin all the external advantages he possessed. As he may be proposed(considered meerly as a writer) for an example worthy of imitation; soin the character of a dignified clergyman, he has likewise a claim tobe copied in those retired and private virtues, in those acts ofbeneficence and humility, and that unaffected and primitive piety, forwhich he was justly distinguished.[Footnote 1: Elegy in a Country Church-Yard, by Mr. Grey.][Footnote 2: Mr. Cooper, in his ingenious work entitled the Life ofSocrates, speaks in a very different strain of the bishop's History ofthe Royal Society, which he calls a 'Fustian History!' and adds, that'it was esteemed an excellent competition by the metaphor-hunting mob ofsilly writings in Charles II's reign.']       *       *       *       *       *CHARLES MONTAGUE (Earl of HALLIFAX)Was born the 16th of April 1661, and received the rudiments of hiseducation at Westminster-school: From thence he was removed toTrinity-College in Cambridge, where by the brightness of his parts hewas early distinguished; and coming to town soon after the death of kingCharles the IId. he contracted an intimacy with the earl of Dorset, SirCharles Sedley, and other wits of the age. After the accession of kingWilliam and queen Mary, having attached himself to the revolutioninterest, he was sworn one of the council: He served in parliamentfor the cities of Durham, and Westminster, at different times, anddistinguished himself by his speeches in the House of Commons, onseveral important affairs. He was constituted one of the lordscommissioners of the treasury, on the 21st of March 1691, and soon aftersworn of the privy-council. In 1694 he was made chancellor and undertreasurer of the exchequer.[1] In the year 1695, when the nation wasdistress'd, by the ill-state of the current coin of this kingdom,he projected the new coining of the silver money; and by his greatprudence, and indefatigable industry brought it to bear. He likewiseproposed the issuing exchequer bills, to supply the great scarcity ofmoney, which has since been made use of to the great benefit of thenation. On the 16th of February, 1697.8, the House of Commons, came to aresolution, 'That it is the opinion of this house, that the honourableCharles Montague, Esq; chancellor of the exchequer, for his goodservices to this government, does deserve his majesty's favour.' Hisnext concern, was the trade to the East-Indies; the settlement of whichhad been long depending, and was looked on as so nice, and difficult,that it had been referred to the king and council, and from them to theparliament; who on May the 26th, 1698, ordered a bill for settling thetrade to that place: Mr. Montague transacted this whole affair; and byhis industry and skill, in touching the affections of the people, raisedtwo-millions, by only doubling the duties on paper, parchment, and salt;which to have done by any other means, was at that time matter of theutmost difficulty. These proofs of affection and zeal to his majesty'sperson and government, induced the king to declare him first: lordcommissioner of the treasury; and on the 16th of July, 1698, appointedhim one of the persons to whose fidelity, and honour, he reposed thetrust of lords justices of England, for the administration of governmentduring his absence. In the year 1700 his lordship resigned the place offirst lord commissioner of the treasury, having obtained a grant of theoffice of auditor of the receipts of the exchequer, vacant by the deathof Sir Robert Howard; and on the 4th of December, the same year, wasadvanced to the dignity of baron Hallifax, in the county of York.On the accession of queen Anne, he was concerned in vindicating thememory of king William, and on all occasions shewed a disinterested zealin the service of his country. He first projected the equivalent, whichwas given to the Scots, in order to promote the Union between thenations; and without which it had never been effected. And as hislordship first moved for appointing commissioners to treat of an Unionbetween the two kingdoms; so he had not only a great share in thattreaty, as one of the commissioners, but causing it to be ratified inparliament, and answered, with all the force of which he was master,the various objections made against it. And further, to strengthen theinterest of the Whigs, which he thought was essentially connectedwith the protestant religion, his lordship proposed the bill for thenaturalization of the illustrious house of Hanover, and for the bettersecurity of the succession of the crown in the protestant line; whichbeing pass'd into an act, her majesty made choice of him to carry thenews to our late sovereign; and to invest his son with the ensigns ofthe most noble order of the Garter. On his arrival at Hanover, he wasreceived with extraordinary marks of distinction, and honour. During hisresidence there, the prince-royal of Prussia was married to his presentmajesty's sister; and soon aster that prince set out with his lordshipfor the confederate army. Hallifax then went to the Hague, where he laidthe foundation of a stricter alliance between Great-Britain, and theUnited Provinces: On his return to England he was graciously received bythe-queen, and continued in her favour till the change of the ministry,in the year 1710.On her majesty's death, our author was one of the regency nominated byking George the Ist. till his arrival; who was no sooner possessed ofthe crown, but he shewed him distinguishing marks of his favour, havingso strenuously promoted his succession to the British throne. He had hismajesty's leave to resign his poll of auditor of the exchequer, to hisnephew the honourable George Montague; and after being made first lordcommissioner of the Treasury, and sworn of the privy-council, he wasadvanced to the dignity of earl of Hallifax, and viscount Sunbury, byletters patent, bearing date the 26th of October, 1714; and before theend of that year, was installed one of the knights companions of themost noble order of the garter, and made lord lieutenant of the countyof Surry.Lord Hallifax died in the 54th year of his age, on the 19th of May 1715,and on the 26th of the same month, was interred in general Monk's vaultin Westminster-Abbey: leaving no issue, his titles devolved on hisnephew, George late earl of Hallifax.--Considered as a poet, hislordship makes a less considerable figure than the earl of Dorset; thereis a languor in his verses, which seems to indicate that he was not bornwith a poetical genius. That he was a lover of the muses, there is notthe lead doubt, as we find him patronizing the poets so warmly; butthere is some difference between a propensity to poetry, and a power ofexcelling in it. His lordship has writ but few things, and those not ofthe utmost consequence.Among others are the following, printed in Tonsen's Minor Poets.1. Verses On the death of Charles the IId.2. An Ode on the Marriage of the Princess Anne, and Prince George ofDenmark.3. The Man of Honour, occasioned by a Postscript to Penn's Letter.4. An Epistle to Charles earl of Dorset; occasioned by King William'sVictory in Ireland.5. Verses written for the toasting Glasses of the Kit-Cat-Club, 1703;which consisted of persons of the first fashion, who were in theinterest of the house of Hanover. These Verses are by far thecompleatest of lord Hallifax's, and, indeed, genteel compliments to theradiant beauties, who were the chief toasts amongst the Whigs. I shallhere present the reader with them.DUCHESS of BEAUFORT.  Offspring of a tuneful fire,  Blest with more than mortal sire:  Likeness of a mother's face,  Blest with more than mortal grace:  You with double charms surprize,  With his wit, and with her eyes.  LADY MARY CHURCHILL.  Fairest, latest of the beauteous race,  Blest with your parents wit, and her first blooming  face;  Born with our liberties in William's reign,  Your eyes alone that liberty restrain.  DUCHESS of RICHMOND.  Of two fair Richmonds diff'rent ages boast,  Their's was the first, and our's the brighter  toast;  Th' adorers offspring prove who's most divine,  They sacrific'd in water, we in wine.  LADY SUNDERLAND.  All nature's charms in Sunderland appear,  Bright as her eyes, and as her reason clear;  Yet still their force, to men not safely known,  Seems undiscover'd to herself alone.  MADAMOISELLE SPANHEIME.  Admir'd in Germany, ador'd in France,  Your charms to brighter glory, here advance;  The stubborn Britons own your beauty's claim,  And with their native toasts enroll your name.[Footnote 1: Collins's Peerage. See Article Hallifax.]       *       *       *       *       *WILLIAM WYCHERLEY, Esq;This Gentleman was son of Daniel Wycherley, of Cleve in Shropshire, Esq;and was born (says Wood) in the year 1640.When he was about fifteen years of age, he was sent to France, in thewestern parts of which he resided upon the banks of the Charante; wherehe was often admitted to the conversation of the most accomplishedladies of the court of France, particularly madam de Montaufieur,celebrated by mons. Voiture in his letters[1].A little before the restoration of Charles the IId, he became agentleman commoner of queen's college in Oxford, and lived in theprovost's lodgings; and was entered in the public library, under thetitle of philosophiae studiosus, in July 1660. He quitted the universitywithout being matriculated, having, according to the Oxford antiquary,been reconciled to the protestant religion, which he had renouncedduring his travels, probably by the person of those gay ladies, withwhom he conversed in France. This circumstance shews how dangerous itis to engage in a debate with a female antagonist, especially, if thatantagonist joins beauty with understanding.Mr. Wycherley afterwards entered himself in the Middle-Temple; butmaking his first appearance in town, in a reign when wit and gaiety werethe favourite distinctions, he relinguished the study of the law, andengaged in pursuits more agreeable to his own genius, and the gallantspirit of the times.Upon writing his first Play, entitled Love in a Wood, or St. James'sPark; and acted at the Theatre-royal, in 1672, he became acquainted withseveral of the most celebrated wits, both of the court and town; andlikewise with the duchess of Cleveland. Mr. Dennis, in his Lettersquoted above, has given a particular relation of the beginning of hisacquaintance with this celebrated beauty of the times, which is singularenough.--One day Mr. Wycherley riding in his chariot through St. James'sPark, he was met by the duchess, whose chariot jostled with his, uponwhich she looked out of her chariot, and spoke very audibly, "YouWycherley, you are a son of a whore," and then burst into a fit oflaughter. Mr. Wycherley at first was very much surprized at this, buthe soon recovered himself enough to recollect, that it was spoke inallusion to the latter end of a Song in his Love in a Wood;  When parents are slaves,  Their brats cannot be any other;  Great wits, and great braves,  Have always a punk for their mother.During Mr. Wycherley's surprize, the chariots drove different ways, theywere soon at a considerable distance from each other; when Mr. Wycherleyrecollecting, ordered his coachman to drive back, and overtake the lady.As soon as he got over against her, he said to her, "Madam, you waspleased to bestow a title upon me, which generally belongs to thefortunate. Will your ladyship be at the play to night? Well, shereplied, what if I should be there? Why then, answered he, I will bethere to wait on your ladyship, though I disappoint a fine woman, whohas made me an assignation. So, said she, you are sure to disappoint awoman who has favoured you, for one who has not. Yes, he replied, if shewho has not favoured me is the finer woman of the two: But he who willbe constant to your ladyship, till he can find a finer woman, is sure todie your captive."The duchess of Cleveland, in consequence of Mr. Wycherley's compliment,was that night, in the first row of the king's box in Drury-Lane, andMr. Wycherley in the pit under her, where he entertained her during thewhole play; and this was the beginning of a correspondence between thesetwo persons, which afterwards made a great noise in the town.This accident, was the occasion of bringing Mr. Wycherley into favourwith George duke of Buckingham, who was passionately in love with thatlady, but was ill-treated by her, and who believed that Mr. Wycherleywas his happy rival. The duke had long sollicited her, without obtainingany favour: Whether the relation between them shocked her, for she washis cousin-german; or, whether she apprehended that an intrigue with aperson of his rank and character, must necessarily in a short time cometo the king's ears; whatever was the cause, she refused so long to admithis visits, that at last indignation, rage, and disdain took place oflove; and he resolved to ruin her. When he took this resolution, he hadher so narrowly watched by his spies, that he soon discovered those whomhe had reason to believe were his rivals; and after he knew them, henever failed to name them aloud, in order to expose the lady to allthose who visited her; and among others, he never failed to mention Mr.Wycherley. As soon as it came to the knowledge of the latter, who hadall his expectations from court, he apprehended the consequences of sucha report, if it should reach the King; and applied himself therefore toWilmot earl of Rochester, and Sir Charles Sedley, entreating them toremonstrate to the duke of Buckingham, the mischief he was about to doto one who had not the honour to know him, and who had not offended him.Upon opening the matter to the duke, he cried out immediately, thathe did not blame Wycherley, he only accused his cousin. 'Ay, but theyreplied, by rendering him suspected of such an intrigue, you areabout to ruin him; that is, your grace is about to ruin a man, whoseconversation you would be pleased with above all things.'Upon this occasion, they said so much of the shining qualities of Mr.Wycherley, and the charms of his conversation, that the duke, who was asmuch in love with wit, as he was with his cousin, was impatient, tillhe was brought to sup with him, which was in two or three nights. Aftersupper, Mr. Wycherley, who was then in the height of his vigour, bothin body and mind, thought himself obliged to exert his talents, and theduke was charmed to that degree, that he cried out with transport, andwith an oath, 'My cousin's in the right of it.' and from that verymoment made a friend of a man he before thought his rival.In the year 1673 a comedy of his called the Gentleman Dancing-Master,was acted at the duke's Theatre, and in 1678 his Plain Dealer was actedwith general applause. In 1683 his Country Wife was performed at thesame Theatre. These Plays raised him so high in the esteem of the world,and so recommended him to the favour of the duke of Buckingham, that ashe was master of the horse, and colonel of a regiment, he bestowed twoplaces on Wycherley: As master of the horse, he made him one of hisequeries; and as colonel of a regiment, a captain lieutenant of his owncompany. King Charles likewise gave our author the most distinguishingmarks of favour, perhaps beyond what any sovereign prince had shewnbefore to an author, who was only a private gentleman: Mr. Wycherleyhappened to be ill of a fever, at his lodgings in Bow-Street,Covent-Garden; during his sickness, the king did him the honour of avisit; when finding his fever indeed abated, but his body extremelyweakened, and his spirits miserably shattered, he commanded him totake a journey to the south of France, believing that nothing couldcontribute more to the restoring his former state of health, than thegentle air of Montpelier, during the winter season: at the same time,the king assured him, that as soon as he was able to undertake thatjourney, he would order five-hundred pounds to be paid him, to defraythe expences of it.Mr. Wycherley accordingly went to France, and returned to England thelatter end of the spring following, with his health entirely restored.The king received him with the utmost marks of esteem, and shortly aftertold him, he had a son, whom he resolved should be educated like the sonof a king, and that he could make choice of no man so proper to be hisgovernor as Mr. Wycherley; and, that for this service, he should havefifteen-hundred pounds a year allotted him; the King also added, thatwhen the time came, that his office should cease, he would take care tomake such a provision for him, as should set him above the malice of theworld and fortune. These were golden prospects for Mr. Wycherley, butthey were soon by a cross accident dashed to pieces.Soon after this promise of his majesty's, Mr. Dennis tells us, that Mr.Wycherley went down to Tunbridge, to take either the benefit of thewaters, or the diversions of the place; when walking one day upon thewells-walk, with his friend Mr. Fairbeard of Grey's-Inn, just as he cameup to the bookseller's, the countess of Drogheda, a young widow, rich,noble and beautiful, came to the bookseller, and enquired for the PlainDealer. 'Madam, says Mr. Fairbeard, since you are for the Plain Dealer,there he is for you,' pushing Mr. Wycherley towards her. 'Yes, says Mr.Wycherley, this lady can bear plain dealing, for she appears to be soaccomplished, that what would be a compliment to others, when said toher, would be plain dealing.--No truly Sir, said the lady, I am notwithout my faults more than the rest of my sex; and yet, notwithstandingall my faults, I love plain dealing, and never am more fond of it, thenwhen it tells me of a fault:' Then madam, says Mr. Fairbeard, you andthe plain dealer seem designed by heaven for each other. In short, Mr.Wycherley accompanied her upon the walks, waited upon her home, visitedher daily at her lodgings whilst she stayed at Tunbridge; and after shewent to London, at her lodgings in Hatton-Garden: where in a littletime he obtained her consent to marry her. This he did by his father'scommand, without acquainting the king; for it was reasonably supposedthat the lady having a great independent estate, and noble and powerfulrelations, the acquainting the king with the intended match, would bethe likeliest way to prevent it. As soon as the news was known at court,it was looked upon as an affront to the king, and a contempt of hismajesty's orders; and Mr. Wycherley's conduct after marriage, made theresentment fall heavier upon him: For being conscious he had givenoffence, and seldom going near the court, his absence was construed intoingratitude.The countess, though a splendid wife, was not formed to make a husbandhappy; she was in her nature extremely jealous, and indulged it to sucha degree, that she could not endure her husband should be one moment outof her sight. Their lodgings were in Bow-street, Covent Garden, overagainst the Cock Tavern; whither if Mr. Wycherley at any time went, hewas obliged to leave the windows open, that his lady might see there wasno woman in the company.This was the cause of Mr. Wycherley's disgrace with the King, whosefavour and affection he had before possessed in so distinguished adegree. The countess settled all her estate upon him, but his titlebeing disputed after her death, the expence of the law, and otherincumbrances, so far reduced him, that he was not able to satisfy theimpatience of his creditors, who threw him at last into prison; so thathe, who but a few years before was flourishing in all the gaiety oflife, flushed with prospects of court preferment, and happy in the mostextensive reputation for wit and parts, was condemned to suffer all therigours of want: for his father did not think proper to support him. Inthis severe extremity, he fell upon an expedient, which, no doubt, wasdictated by his distress, of applying to his Bookseller, who had gotconsiderably by his Plain Dealer, in order to borrow 20 l. but heapplied in vain; the Bookseller refused to lend him a shilling; and inthat distress he languished for seven years: nor was he released 'tillone day King James going to see his Plain-Dealer performed, was socharmed with it, that he gave immediate orders for the payment of theauthor's debts, adding to that bounty a pension of 200 1. per annum,while he continued in England. But the generous intention of that Princeto him, had not the designed effect, purely through his modesty; hebeing ashamed to tell the earl of Mulgrave, whom the King had sent todemand it, a full state of his debts. He laboured under the weight ofthese difficulties 'till his father died, and then the estate thatdescended to him, was left under very uneasy limitations, he being onlya tenant for life, and not being allowed to raise money for the paymentof his debts: yet, as he had a power to make a jointure, he married,almost at the eve of his days, a young gentlewoman of 1500 l. fortune,part of which being applied to the uses he wanted it for, he died elevendays after the celebration of his nuptials in December 1715, and wasinterred in the vault of Covent Garden church.Besides the plays already mentioned, he published a volume of poems1704, which met with no great success; for, like Congreve, his strengthlay only in the drama, and, unless on the stage, he was but a secondrate poet. In 1728 his posthumous works in prose and verse werepublished by Mr. Lewis Theobald at London in 8vo.Mr. Dennis, in a few words, has summed up this gentleman's character;'he was admired by the men for his parts, in wit and learning; andhe was admired by the women for those parts of which they were morecompetent judges.' Mr. Wycherley was a man of great sprightliness,and vivacity of genius, he was said to have been handsome, formed forgallantry, and was certainly an idol with the ladies, a felicity whicheven his wit might not have procured, without exterior advantages.As a poet and a dramatist, I cannot better exhibit his character thanin the words of George lord Lansdowne; he observes, 'that the earl ofRochester, in imitation of one of Horace's epistles, thus mentions ourauthor;  Of all our modern wits none seem to me,  Once to have touch'd upon true comedy  But hasty Shadwel, and slow Wycherley.  Shadwel's unfinish'd works do yet impart  Great proofs of nature's force; tho' none of art.  'But Wycherley earns hard whate'er he gains,  He wants no judgment, and he spares no pains.''Lord Lansdowne is persuaded, that the earl fell into this part of thecharacter (of a laborious writer) merely for the sake of the verse; ifhasty, says he, would have stood as an epithet for Wycherley, and slow,for Shadwel, they would in all probability have been so applied, but theverse would have been spoiled, and to that it was necessary to submit.Those, who would form their judgments only upon Mr. Wycherley'swritings, without any personal acquaintance with him, might indeed beapt to conclude, that such a diversity of images and characters, suchstrict enquiries into nature, such close observations on the severalhumours, manners, and affections of all ranks and degrees of men, and,as it were, so true and perfect a dissection of humankind, deliveredwith so much pointed wit, and force of expression, could be no otherthan the work of extraordinary diligence, labour, and application; butin truth, we owe the pleasure and advantage of having been so wellentertained, and instructed by him, to his facility of doing it; if ithad been a trouble to him to write, I am much mistaken if he wouldnot have spared that trouble. What he has performed, would have beendifficult for another; but a club, which a man of an ordinary size couldnot lift, was a walking staff for Hercules. To judge by the sharpness,and spirit of his satires, you might be led into another mistake, andimagine him an ill-natur'd man, but what my lord Rochester said of lordDorset, is applicable to him, the best good man with the worst naturedmuse. As pointed, and severe as he is in his writings, in his temperhe had all the softness of the tenderest disposition; gentle andinoffensive to every man in his particular character; he only attacksvice as a public enemy, compassionating the wound he is under anecessity to probe, or grieving, like a good natured conqueror, at theoccasions which provoke him to make such havock. King Charles II. anice discerner of men, and himself a man of wit, often chose him for acompanion at his leisure hours, as Augustus did Horace, and had veryadvantageous views for him, but unluckily an amorous inclinationinterfered; the lover got the better of the courtier, and ambition fella sacrifice to love, the predominant passion of the noblest mind. Manyobject to his versification; it is certain he is no master of numbers,but a Diamond is not less a Diamond for not being polished.'Mr. Pope, when very young, made his court to Mr. Wycherley, when veryold; and the latter was so well pleased with the former, and had suchan opinion of his rising genius, that he entered into an intimatecorrespondence with him, and submitted his works to Mr. Pope'scorrection. See the letters between Pope and Wycherley, printed inPope's works.[Footnote 1: Dennis's Letters, vol. i. p. 213.]       *       *       *       *       *NAHUM TATEWas born about the middle of the reign of Charles II. in the kingdom ofIreland, and there received his education. He was a man of learning,courteous, and candid, but was thought to possess no great genius, asbeing deficient in what is its first characteristic, namely, invention.He was made poet laureat to King William, upon the death of Shadwell,and held that place 'till the accession of King George I, on whom helived to write the first Birth-Day Ode, which is executed with unusualspirit. Mr. Tate being a man of extreme modesty, was never able to makehis fortune, or to raise himself above necessity; he was obliged to haverecourse to the patronage of the earl of Dorset, to screen him fromthe persecution of his creditors. Besides several other poeticalperformances, which will be afterwards enumerated and a Version of thePsalms, in conjunction with Dr. Brady, Mr. Tate has been the author ofnine plays, of which the following is the list;1. Brutus of Alba, a Tragedy; acted at the Duke's Theatre 1678,dedicated to the Earl of Dorset. This play is founded on Virgil's AEneid,b. iv, and was finished under the name of Dido and AEneas, but by theadvice of some friends, was transformed to the dress it now wears.2. The Loyal General, a Tragedy; acted at the Duke's Theatre 1680.3. Richard II. revived, and altered from Shakespear, under the titleof the Sicilian Usurper; a Tragedy, with a Prefatory Epistle, inVindication of the Author, occasioned by the Prohibition of this Play onthe Stage. The scene is in England.4. The Ingratitude of a Commonwealth, or the Fall of Caius MariusCoriolanus; this was printed in 4to. 1682, and dedicated to the Marquisof Worcester; it is founded on Shakespear's Coriolanus.5. Cuckold's Haven, or an Alderman no Conjuror; a Farce; acted at theQueen's Theatre in the Dorset-Garden 1685. Part of the plot of thispiece seems to be taken from Ben. Johnson's Eastward Hoe or the Devil isan Ass.6. A Duke, and No Duke, a Farce, acted 1684. The plot from Trappolinsupposed a Prince.7. The Island Princess, a Tragi-Comedy; acted at the Theatre Royal 1687,dedicated to Henry Lord Waldegrave. This is the Island Princess ofFletcher revived, with alterations.8. Lear King of England, and his Three Daughters, an Historical Play,acted at the Duke s Theatre 1687. It is one of Shakespear's most movingtragedies revived, with alterations.9. Injured Love, or the Cruel Husband, a Tragedy, acted at theTheatre-Royal 1707.His other works are chiefly these,The Second Part of Absalom and Achitophel. Mr. Dryden, author of thefirst, assisted in this, he being himself pressed to write it, butdeclined the task, and encouraged Mr. Tate in the performance.The Rise and Progress of Priestcraft.Syphilis, or a Poetical History of the French Disease.Jephtha's Vow.In Memory of his Grace the Illustrious Duke of Ormond, 1688.On the Death of the Countess of Dorset.The Characters of Virtue and Vice described, in the Person of the WiseMan and the Hypocrite; attempted in Verse, from a Treatise of Jos.

He also gave the public a great many translations from Ovid,Horace, Juvenal, Virgil.His song on his Majesty's birth-day has the following stanza,  When Kings that make the public good their care  Advance in dignity and state,  Their rise no envy can create;  Their subjects in the princely grandeur share:  For, like the sun, the higher they ascend,  The farther their indulgent beams extend.  Yet long before our royal sun  His destin'd course has run,  We're bless'd to see a glorious heir,  That shall the mighty loss repair;  When he that blazes now shall this low sphere resign  In a sublimer orb eternally to shine.  A Cynthia too, adorn'd with every grace  Of person and of mind;  And happy in a starry race,  Of that auspicious kind,  As joyfully presage,  No want of royal heirs in any future age.  CHORUS.  Honour'd with the best of Kings,  And a set of lovely springs,  From the royal fountain flowing,  Lovely streams, and ever growing,  Happy Britain past expressing,  Only learn to prize thy blessing.We shall give some further account of the translation of the Psalms inthe life of Dr. Brady. This author died in the Mint 1716, was interredin St. George's church, Southwark, and was succeeded in the laurel byMr. Eusden.       *       *       *       *       *Sir SAMUEL GARTH.This gentleman was descended from a good family in Yorkshire; after hehad passed through his school education, he was removed to Peter-housein Cambridge, where he is said to have continued till he was created Dr.of Physic July 7, 1691[1].In 1696 Dr. Garth zealously promoted the erecting the Dispensary, beingan apartment, in the college for the relief of the sick poor, by givingthem advice gratis, and dispensing medicines to them at low rates. Thiswork of charity having exposed him, and many other of the most eminentPhysicians to the envy and resentment of several persons of the samefaculty, as well as Apothecaries, he ridiculed them with peculiarspirit, and vivacity, in his poem called the Dispensary in 6 Cantos;which, though it first stole into the world a little hastily, andincorrect, in the year 1669, yet bore in a few months three impressions,and was afterwards printed several times, with a dedication to AnthonyHenley, esquire. This poem, gained our author great reputation; it isof the burlesque species, and executed with a degree of humour, hardlyequal'd, unless in the Rape of the Lock.Our author's poetical character, joined with his skill in hisprofession, his agreeable conversation, and unaffected good nature,procured him vast practice, introduced him to the acquaintance, andestablished him in the esteem of most of the nobility and gentry. Muchabout the same time he gave a distinguishing instance of his profoundknowledge in his profession, his perfect acquaintance with antiquity,and correct taste in Roman eloquence by a Latin oration, pronouncedbefore the Faculty in Warwick-Lane, September 17, 1697, to the greatsatisfaction of the audience, and the raising his own reputation, as thecollege register testifies. Pieces of this kind are often composed withpeculiar attention to the phrase, the sound of the periods in speaking,and their effect upon the ear; these advantages were by no meansneglected in Dr. Garth's performance, but the sentiments, the spirit,and stile appeared to still greater advantage in the reading; and theapplause with which it was received by its hearers, was echoed by thosewho perused it; this instance is the more singular, as few have beendistinguished both as orators and poets.Cicero, who was not heard by his cotemporaries with greater applause,than his works are now read with admiration, attempted poetry withoutsuccess; reputation in that kind of writing the Roman orator muchdesired, but never could compose a line to please himself, or any of hisfriends.Upon the death of Dryden in May 1701, by a very strange accident hisburial[2] came to depend on the piety of Dr. Garth, who caused the bodyto be brought to the College of Physicians, proposed and encouraged byhis generous example a subscription for defraying the expence of thefuneral, and after pronouncing over the corpse a suitable oration, heattended the solemnity to Westminster-Abbey, where at last the remainsof that great man were interred in Chaucer's grave. For this memorableact of tenderness and generosity, those who loved the person, or whohonoured the parts of that excellent poet, expressed much gratitude toDr. Garth. He was one of the most eminent members of a famous societycalled the Kit-Kat Club, which consisted of above thirty noblemen andgentlemen, distinguished by their zealous affection to the Protestantsuccession in the House of Hanover[3]. October 3, 1702 he was electedone of the Censors of the College of Physicians. In respect to hispolitical principles, he was open and warm, and which was still more tobe valued, he was steady and sincere. In the time of lord Godolphin'sadministration, nobody was better received of his rank than Dr. Garth;and nobody seemed to have a higher opinion of that minister's integrity,and abilities in which he had, however, the satisfaction of thinkingwith the public.In 1710, when the Whig ministry was discarded, and his lordship had anopportunity of distinguishing his own friends, from those which wereonly the friends of his power, it could not fail of giving him sensiblepleasure to find Dr. Garth early declaring for him, and amongst thefirst who bestowed upon him the tribute of his muse, at a time whenthat nobleman's interest sunk: A situation which would have struck aflatterer dumb. There were some to whom this testimony of gratitudewas by no means pleasing, and therefore the Dr's. lines were severelycriticised by the examiner, a paper engaged in the defence of the newministry; but instead of sinking the credit either of the author, or theverses, they added to the honour of both, by exciting Mr. Addison todraw his pen in their defence. In order to form a judgment both of theCriticism, and the Defence, it will be necessary first of all to readthe poem to which they refer, more especially as it is very short, andmay be supposed to have been written suddenly, and, at least, as muchfrom the author's gratitude to his noble patron, as a desire of addingto his reputation.  To the EARL of GODOLPHIN.  While weeping Europe bends beneath her ills,  And where the sword destroys not, famine kills;  Our isle enjoys by your successful care,  The pomp of peace amidst the woes of war.  So much the public to your prudence owes,  You think no labours long, for our repose.  Such conduct, such integrity are shewn,  There are no coffers empty, but your own.  From mean dependence, merit you retrieve;  Unask'd you offer, and unseen you give.  Your favour, like the Nile, increase bestows;  And yet conceals the source from whence it flows.  So poiz'd your passions are, we find no frown,  If funds oppress not, and if commerce run,  Taxes diminish'd, liberty entire,  These are the grants your services require.  Thus far the State Machine wants no repair,  But moves in matchless order by your care.  Free from confusion, settled, and serene;  And like the universe by springs unseen.  But now some star, sinister to our pray'rs;  Contrives new schemes, and calls you from affairs.  No anguish in your looks, nor cares appear,  But how to teach th' unpractic'd crew to steer.  Thus like some victim no constraint; you need,  To expiate their offence, by whom you bleed.  Ingratitude's a weed in every clime;  It thrives too fast at first, but fades in time.  The god of day, and your own lot's the same;  The vapours you have rais'd obscure your flame  But tho' you suffer, and awhile retreat,  Your globe of light looks larger as you set.These verses, however they may express the gratitude, and candour of theauthor, and may contain no more than truth of the personage to whom theyare addressed, yet, every reader of taste will perceive, that the versesare by no means equal to the rest of Dr. Garth's poetical writings.Remarks upon these verses were published in a Letter to the Examiner,September 7, 1710. The author observes, 'That there does not appeareither poetry, grammar, or design in the composition of this poem; thewhole (says he) seems to be, as the sixth edition of the Dispensary,happily expresses it, a strong, unlaboured, impotence of thought. Ifreely examine it by the new test of good poetry, which the Dr. himselfhas established. Pleasing at first sight: Has this piece the least titleeven to that? or if we compare it to the only pattern, as he thinks, ofjust writing in this kind, Ovid; is there any thing in De Tristibus sowild, so childish, so flat? what can the ingenious Dr. mean, or at whattime could he write these verses? half of the poem is a panegyric on aLord Treasurer in being, and the rest a compliment of condolance to anEarl that has lost the Staff. In thirty lines his patron is a river, theprimum mobile, a pilot, a victim, the sun, any thing and nothing. Hebestows increase, conceals his source, makes the machine move, teachesto steer, expiates our offences, raises vapours, and looks larger as hesets; nor is the choice of his expression less exquisite, than that ofhis similies. For commerce to run[4], passions to be poized, merit to bereceived from dependence, and a machine to be serene, is perfectlynew. The Dr. has a happy talent at invention, and has had the gloryof enriching our language by his phrases, as much as he has improvedmedicine by his bills.' The critic then proceeds to consider the poemmore minutely, and to expose it by enumerating particulars. Mr. Addisonin a Whig Examiner published September 14, 1710, takes occasion to rallythe fierce over-bearing spirit of the Tory Examiner, which, he says, hasa better title to the name of the executioner. He then enters into thedefence of the Dr's. poem, and observes, 'that the phrase of passionsbeing poized, and retrieving merit from dependence, cavilled at by thecritics, are beautiful and poetical; it is the same cavilling spirit,says he, that finds fault with that expression of the Pomp of Peace,among Woes of War, as well as of Offering unasked.' This general pieceof raillery which he passes on the Dr's. considering the treasurer inseveral different views, is that which might fall upon any poem inWaller, or any other writer who has diversity of thoughts and allusions,and though it may appear a pleasant ridicule to an ignorant reader, iswholly groundless and unjust.Mr. Addison's Answer is, however, upon the whole, rather a palliation,than a defence. All the skill of that writer could never make thatpoetical, or a fine panegyric, which is in its own nature removedfrom the very appearance of poetry; but friendship, good nature, or acoincidence of party, will sometimes engage the greatest men to combatin defence of trifles, and even against their own judgment, as Drydenfinely expresses it in his Address to Congreve, "Vindicate a friend."In 1711 Dr. Garth wrote a dedication for an intended edition ofLucretius, addressed to his late Majesty, then Elector of Brunswick,which has been admired as one of the purest compositions in the Latintongue that our times have produced.On the accession of that King to the throne, he had the honour ofknighthood conferred upon him by his Majesty, with the duke ofMarlborough's sword[5]. He was likewise made Physician in ordinary tothe King, and Physician General to the army. As his known servicesprocured him a great interest with those in power, so his humanity andgood nature inclined him to make use of that interest, rather for thesupport, and encouragement of men of letters who had merit, than for theadvancement of his private fortune; his views in that respect havingbeen always very moderate. He lived with the great in that degree ofesteem and independency, and with all that freedom which became a manpossessed of superior genius, and the most shining and valuable talents.His poem entitled Claremont, addressed to the duke of Newcastle, printedin the 6th volume of Dryden's Miscellanies, met with great approbation.A warm admirer of the Doctor's, speaking of Claremont, thus expresseshimself; 'It will survive, says he, the noble structure it celebrates,'and will remain a perpetual monument of its author's learning, taste,and great capacity as a poet; since, in that short work, there areinnumerable beauties, and a vast variety of sentiments easily andhappily interwoven; the most lively strokes of satire being intermixedwith the most courtly panegyric, at the same time that there appears thetrue spirit of enthusiasm, which distinguishes the works of one borna poet, from those of a witty, or learned man, that has arrived at nohigher art, than that of making verse[6].' His knowledge in philosophy,his correct taste in criticism, and his thorough acquaintance inclassical literature, with all the advantages that can be derived froman exact, but concealed method, an accurate, though flowing stile, anda language pure, natural, and full of vivacity, appear, says the samepanegyrist in the preface he prefixed to a translation of Ovid'sMetamorphoses, which would have been sufficient to have raised him animmortal reputation, if it had been the only product of his pen.Dr. Garth is said to have been a man of the most extensive benevolence;that his hand and heart went always together: A circumstance morevaluable than all the lustre which genius can confer. We cannot however,speak of his works with so much warmth, as the author just quoted seemsto indulge. His works will scarce make a moderate volume, and thoughthey contain many things excellent, judicious, and humorous, yet theywill not justify the writer, who dwells upon them in the same rapturousstrain of admiration, with which we speak of a Horace, a Milton, or aPope. He had the happiness of an early acquaintance with some of themost powerful, wisest, and wittiest men of the age in which he lived; heattached himself to a party, which at last obtained the ascendant, andhe was equally successful in his fortune as his friends: Persons inthese circumstances are seldom praised, or censured with moderation.We have already seen how warmly Addison espoused the Dr's. writings,when they were attacked upon a principle of party, and there are many ofthe greatest wits of his time who pay him compliments; amongst the restis lord Lansdowne, who wrote some verses upon his illness; but as thelines do no great honour either to his lordship, or the Dr. we forbearto insert them.The following passage is taken from one of Pope's Letters, written uponthe death of Dr. Garth, which, we dare say, will be more acceptable.'The best natured of men (says he) Sir Samuel Garth has left me inthe truest concern for his loss. His death was very heroical, and yetunaffected enough to have made a saint, or a philosopher famous. But illtongues, and worse hearts have branded his last moments, as wrongfullyas they did his life, with irreligion: you must have heard many talesupon this subject; but if ever there was a good christian, withoutknowing himself to be so, it was Dr. Garth.'Our author was censured for his love of pleasure, in which perhaps itwould be easier to excuse than defend him; but upon the whole, hischaracter appears to have been very amiable, particularly, that of hisbearing a tide of prosperity with so much, evenness of temper; and hisuniversal benevolence, which seems not to have been cramped with partyprinciples; as appears from his piety towards the remains of Dryden.He died after a short illness, January 18, 1718-19, and was buried the22d of the same month in the church of Harrow on the Hill, in the countyof Middlesex, in a vault he caused to be built for himself and hisfamily[7], leaving behind him an only daughter married to the honourablecolonel William Boyle, a younger son of colonel Henry Boyle, who wasbrother to the late, and uncle to the present, earl of Burlington[8].His estates in Warwickshire, Oxfordshire, and Buckinghamshire, are nowpossessed by his grandson, Henry Boyle, Esq; whose amiable qualitiesendear him to all who have the happiness of his acquaintance. His worksare collected, and printed in one volume, published by Tonson.[Footnote 1: Biog.

Mr. Rowe could trace hisancestors in a direct line up to the times of the holy war, in which oneof them so distinguished himself, that at his return he had the armsgiven him, which the family has born ever since, that being in thosedays all the reward of military virtue, or of blood spilt in thoseexpeditions.From that time downward to Mr. Rowe's father, the family betookthemselves to the frugal management of a private fortune, and theinnocent pleasures of a country life. Having a handsome estate, theylived beyond the fear of want, or reach of envy. In all the changes ofgovernment, they are said to have ever leaned towards the side of publicliberty, and in that retired situation of life, nave beheld with griefand concern the many encroachments that have been made in it from timeto time.Our author was born at Little Berkford in Bedfordshire, at the house ofJasper Edwards, Esq; his mother's father, in the year 1673[1]. He beganhis education at a private grammar-school in Highgate; but the taste hethere acquired of the classic authors, was improved, and finished underthe care of the famous Dr. Busby of Westminster school; where, about theage of 12 years, he was chosen one of the King's scholars. Besideshis skill in the Latin and Greek languages, he had made a tolerableproficiency in the Hebrew; but poetry was his early bent, and darlingstudy. He composed, at different times, several copies of verses uponvarious subjects both in Greek and Latin, and some in English, whichwere much admired, and the more so, because they were produced with somuch facility, and seemed to flow from his imagination, as fast as fromhis pen.His father, who was a Serjeant at Law, designing him for his ownprofession, took him from that school when he was about sixteen years ofage, and entered him a student in the Middle Temple, whereof himselfwas a member, that he might have him under his immediate care andinstruction. Being capable of any part knowledge, to which he thoughtproper to apply, he made very remarkable advances in the study of theLaw, and was not content to know it, as a collection of statutes, orcustoms only, but as a system founded upon right reason, and calculatedfor the good of mankind. Being afterwards called to the bar, hepromised as fair to make a figure in that profession, as any of hiscotemporaries, if the love of the Belles Lettres, and that of poetry inparticular, had not stopped him in his career. To him there appearedmore charms in Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschilus, than in all therecords of antiquity, and when he came to discern the beauties ofShakespear and Milton, his soul was captivated beyond recovery, and hebegan to think with contempt of all other excellences, when put in thebalance with the enchantments of poetry and genius. Mr. Rowe had thebest opportunities of rising to eminence in the Law, by means of thepatronage of Sir George Treby, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas,who was fond of him to a very great degree, and had it in his power topromote him; but being overcome by his propension to poetry, and hisfirst tragedy, called the Ambitious Step-mother, meeting with universalapplause, he laid aside all thoughts of the Law. The AmbitiousStep-mother was our author's first attempt in the drama, written by himin the 25th year of his age, and dedicated to the earl of Jersey.'The purity of the language (says Mr. Welwood) the justness of hischaracters, the noble elevation of the sentiments, were all of themadmirably adapted to the plan of the play.'The Ambitious Step-mother, being the first, is conducted with lessjudgment than any other of Rowe's tragedies; it has an infinite deal offire in it, the business is precipitate, and the characters active, andwhat is somewhat remarkable, the author never after wrote a play with somuch elevation. Critics have complained of the sameness of his poetry;that he makes all his characters speak equally elegant, and has notattended sufficiently to the manners. This uniformity of versification,in the opinion of some, has spoiled our modern tragedies, as poetryis made to supply nature, and declamation characters. Whether thisobservation is well founded, we shall not at present examine, onlyremark, that if any poet has a right to be forgiven for this error, Mr.Rowe certainly has, as his cadence is the sweetest in the world, hissentiments chaste, and his language elegant. Our author wrote severalother Tragedies, but that which he valued himself most upon,says Welwood, was his Tamerlane; acted at the Theatre inLincoln's-Inn-Fields, and dedicated to the marquis of Hartington.  In this play, continues Welwood, 'He aimed at  a parallel between the late king William and  Tamerlane, and also Bajazet, and a monarch who  is since dead. That glorious ambition in Tamerlane,  to break the chains of enslaved nations, and  set mankind free from the encroachments of lawless  power, are painted in the most lively, as well  as the most amiable colours. On the other side,  his manner of introducing on the stage a prince,  whose chief aim is to perpetuate his name to posterity,  by that havock and ruin he scatters through  the world, are all drawn with that pomp of horror,  and detestation, which such monstrous actions  deserve. And, since nothing could be more  calculated for raising in the minds of the audience  a true passion for liberty, and a just abhorrence of  slavery, how this play came to be discouraged,  next to a prohibition, in the latter end of queen  Anne's reign, I leave it to others to give a reason.'Thus far Dr. Welwood, who has endeavoured to point out the similiarityof the character of Tamerlane, to that of king William. Though it iscertainly true, that the Tamerlane of Rowe contains grander sentimentsthan any of his other plays; yet, it may be a matter of dispute whetherTamerlane ought to give name to the play; for Tamerlane is victorious,and Bajazet the sufferer. Besides the fate of these two monarchs, thereis likewise contained in it, the Episode of Moneses, and Arpasia, whichis of itself sufficiently distressful to make the subject of a tragedy.The attention is diverted from the fall of Bajazet, which ought to havebeen the main design, and bewildered in the fortunes of Moneses, andArpasia, Axalla and Selima: There are in short, in this play, eventsenough for four; and in the variety and importance of them, Tamerlaneand Bajazet must be too much neglected. All the characters of a playshould be subordinate to the leading one, and their business in thedrama subservient to promote his fate; but this performance is not thetragedy of Bajazet, or Tamerlane only; but likewise the tragedies ofMoneses and Arpasia, Axala and Selima. It is now performed annually, onthe 4th and 5th of November, in commemoration of the Gun-powder Treason,and the landing of king William in this realm, when an occasionalprologue is spoken.Another tragedy of Mr. Rowe's is the Fair Penitent, acted at the Theatrein Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; and dedicated to the duchess of Ormond: This isone of the most finished performances of our author. The character ofSciolto the father is strongly marked; Horatio's the most amiable of allcharacters, and is so sustained as to strike an audience very forcibly.In this, as in the former play, Mr. Rowe is guilty of a mis-nomer; forhis Calista has not the least claim to be called the Fair Penitent,which would be better changed to the Fair Wanton; for she discovers notone pang of remorse till the last act, and that seems to arise morefrom the external distress to which she is then exposed, than to anycompunctions of conscience. She still loves and doats on her basebetrayer, though a most insignificant creature. In this character, Rowehas been true to the sex, in drawing a woman, as she generally is, fondof her seducer; but he has not drawn drawn a Penitent. The characterof Altamont is one of those which the present players observe, is thehardest to represent of any in the drama; there is a kind of meanness inhim, joined with an unsuspecting honest heart, and a doating fondnessfor the false fair one, that is very difficult to illustrate: This parthas of late been generally given to performers of but very moderateabilities; by which the play suffers prodigiously, and Altamont, who isreally one of the most important persons in the drama, is beheld withneglect, or perhaps with contempt; but seldom with pity. Altamont,in the hands of a good actor, would draw the eyes of the audience,notwithstanding the blustering Lothario, and the superior dignity ofHoratio; for there is something in Altamont, to create our pity, andwork upon our compassion.So many players failing of late, in the this character, leaves it amatter of doubt, whether the actor is more mistaken in his performance;or the manager in the distribution of parts.The next tragedy Mr. Rowe wrote was his Ulysses, acted at the queen'sTheatre, in the Hay Market, and dedicated to the earl of Godolphin. Thisplay is not at present in possession of the stage, though it deserveshighly to be so, as the character of Penelope, is an excellent exampleof conjugal fidelity: Who, though her lord had been ten years absentfrom her, and various accounts had been given of his death, yet,notwithstanding this, and the addresses of many royal suitors, shepreserved her heart for her Ulysses, who at last triumphed over hisenemies, and rescued his faithful queen from the persecution of herwooers.--This play has business, passion, and tragic propriety torecommend it.--.The next play Mr. Rowe brought upon the stage, was his Royal Convert,acted at the queen's Theatre, in the Haymarket, and dedicated to theearl of Hallifax.His next was the Tragedy of Jane Shore, written in imitation ofShakespear's stile; acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, anddedicated to the duke of Queensberry and Dover. How Mr. Rowe couldimagine that this play is written at all in imitation of Shakespear'sstile, we cannot conceive; for so far as we are able to judge, it bearsnot the least resemblance to that of Shakespear. The conduct of thedesign is regular, and in that sense it partakes not of Shakespear'swildness; the poetry is uniform, which marks it to be Rowe's, but inthat it is very different from Shakespear, whose excellency doesnot consist merely in the beauty of soft language, or nightingaledescriptions; but in the general power of his drama, the boldness of theimages, and the force of his characters.Our author afterwards brought upon the stage his Lady Jane Grey,dedicated to the earl of Warwick; this play is justly in posession ofthe stage likewise. Mr. Edmund Smith, of Christ's-Church, author ofPhaedra and Hyppolitus, designed writing a Tragedy on this subject; andat his death left some loose hints of sentiments, and short sketches ofscenes. From the last of these, Mr. Rowe acknowledges he borrowedpart of one, and inserted it in his third act, viz. that between lordGuilford, and lady Jane. It is not much to be regretted, that Mr. Smithdid not live to finish this, since it fell into the hands of one so muchabove him, as a dramatist; for if we may judge of Mr. Smith's abilitiesof writing for the stage, by his Phaedra and Hyppolitus, it would nothave been so well executed as by Rowe. Phaedra and Hyppolitus, is a playwithout passion, though of inimitable versification; and in the wordsof a living poet, we may say of it, that not the character, but poetspeaks.It may be justly said of all Rowe's Tragedies, that never poet paintedvirtue, religion, and all the relative and social duties of life, in amore alluring dress, on the stage; nor were ever vice or impiety, betterexposed to contempt and abhorrence.The same principles of liberty he had early imbibed himself, seemed apart of his constitution, and appeared in every thing he wrote; and hetook all occasions that fell in his way, to make his talents subservientto them: His Muse was so religiously chaste, that I do not remember,says Dr. Welwood, one word in any of his plays or writings, that mightadmit of a double meaning in any point of decency, or morals. There isnothing to be found in them, to flatter a depraved populace, or humour afashionable folly.Mr. Rowe's Plays were written from the heart. He practised the virtue headmired, and he never, in his gayest moments, suffered himself to talkloosely or lightly upon religious or moral subjects; or to turn anything sacred, or which good men reverenced as such, into ridicule.Our author wrote a comedy of three acts, called the Biter. It wasperformed at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; but without success,for Rowe's genius did not lie towards Comedy.--In a conversation he hadwith Mr. Pope, that great poet advised him to rescue the queen of Scots,from the hands of Banks; and to make that lady to shine on the stage,with a lustre equal to her character. Mr. Rowe observed in answer tothis, that he was a great admirer of queen Elizabeth; and as hecould not well plan a play upon the queen of Scots's story, withoutintroducing his favourite princess, who in that particular makes but anindifferent figure, he chose to decline it: Besides, he knew that if hefavoured the northern lady, there was a strong party concerned to crushit; and if he should make her appear less great than she was, and throwa shade over her real endowments, he should violate truth, and incurthe displeasure of a faction, which though by far the minority, he knewwould be yet too powerful for a poet to combat with.The late duke of Queensberry, when secretary of state, made Mr. Rowesecretary for public affairs; and when that nobleman came to know himwell, he was never more delighted than when in his company: After theduke's death, all avenues were stopt to his preferment; and during therest of queen Anne's reign, he passed his time with the Muses and hisbooks, and sometimes with the conversation of his friends.While Mr. Rowe was thus without a patron, he went one day to pay hiscourt to the earl of Oxford, lord high treasurer of England, then at thehead of the Tory faction, who asked him if he understood Spanish well?He answered no: but imagining that his lordship might intend to send himinto Spain on some honourable commission, he presently added, that ina short time he did not doubt but he should presently be able, both tounderstand it, and speak it. The earl approving of what he said, Mr.Rowe took his leave, and immediately retired out of town to a privatecountry farm; where, within a few months, he learned the Spanishtongue, and then waited again on the earl to give him an account of hisdiligence. His lordship asking him, if he was sure he understood itthoroughly, and Mr. Rowe answering in the affirmative, the earl burstinto an exclamation; 'How happy are you Mr. Rowe, that you can enjoy thepleasure of reading, and understanding Don Quixote in the original!'This wanton cruelty inflicted by his lordship, of raising expectationsin the mind, that he never intended to gratify, needs only be told toexcite indignation. Upon the accession of king George the 1st. to thethrone, Mr. Rowe was made Poet-Laureat, and one of the surveyors of thecustoms, in the port of London. The prince of Wales conferred on him,the place of clerk of his council, and the lord chancellor Parker, madehim his secretary for the presentations, the very day he received theseals, and without his asking it.He was twice married, first to a daughter of Mr. auditor Parsons;and afterwards to a daughter of Mr. Devenish of a good family inDorsetshire. By his first wife, he had a son, and by his second adaughter.Mr. Rowe died the 6th of December 1718, in the 45th year of his age,like a christian and a philosopher, and with an unfeigned resignationto the will of God: He preferred an evenness of temper to the last, andtook leave of his wife, and friends, immediately before his last agony,with the same tranquility of mind, as if he had been taking but a shortjourney.He was interred in Westminster-Abbey, over against Chaucer; his bodybeing attended with a vast number of friends, and the dean and chapterofficiating at the funeral. A tomb was afterwards erected to his memory,by his wife, for which Mr. Pope wrote an epitaph, which we shall hereinsert; not one word of which is hyperbolical, or more than he deserves.Epitaph on ROWE, by Mr. POPE.  Thy reliques, Rowe! to this sad shrine we trust,  And near thy Shakespear place thy honour'd bust,  Oh next him skill'd, to draw the tender tear,  For never heart felt passion more sincere:  To nobler sentiment to fire the brave.  For never Briton more disdain'd a slave!  Peace to thy gentle shade, and endless rest,  Blest in thy genius, in thy love too blest!  And blest, that timely from our scene remov'd  Thy soul enjoys the liberty it lov'd.  To these, so mourn'd in death, so lov'd in life!  The childless parent and the widow'd wife  With tears inscribes this monumental stone,  That holds their ashes and expects her ownMr. Rowe, as to his person, was graceful and well made, his face regularand of a manly beauty; he had a quick, and fruitful invention, a deeppenetration, and a large compass of thought, with a singular dexterity,and easiness in communicating his opinions. He was master of most partsof polite learning, especially the Classic Authors, both Greek andLatin; he understood the French, Italian and Spanish languages. He hadlikewise read most of the Greek and Roman histories in their originallanguages; and most that are written in English, French, Italian andSpanish: He had a good taste in philosophy, and having a firmimpression of religion upon his mind, he took delight in divinity, andecclesiastical history, in both which he made great advances in thetimes he retired to the country, which were frequent. He expressed uponall occasions, his full perswasion of the truth of revealed religion;and being a sincere member of the established church himself, hepitied, but condemned not, those who departed from him; he abhorred theprinciple of persecuting men on account of religious opinions, and beingstrict in his own, he took it not upon him to censure those of anotherpersuasion. His conversation was pleasant, witty, and learned, withoutthe least tincture of affectation or pedantry; and his inimitable mannerof diverting, or enlivening the company, made it impossible for any oneto be out of humour when he was in it: Envy and detraction, seemed to beentirely foreign to his constitution; and whatever provocation he metwith at any time, he passed them over, without the least thought ofresentment or revenge. There were not wanting some malevolent people,and some pretenders to poetry too, that would sometimes bark at his bestperformances; but he was too much conscious of his own genius, and hadso much good-nature as to forgive them, nor could however be tempted toreturn them an answer.'This is the amiable character of Mr. Rowe, drawn by Mr. Welwood, towhich we shall add the words of Mr. Pope, in a letter to Edward Blount,Esq; dated February the 10th, 1715.'There was a vivacity and gaiety of disposition almost peculiar toMr. Rowe, which made it impossible to part with him, without thatuneasiness, which generally succeeds all our pleasures.'It would perhaps be injurious to the memory of Rowe, to dismiss hislife, without taking notice of his translations of Lucan, and Quillet'sCallipaedia; the versification in both is musical, and well adapted tothe subject; nor is there any reason to doubt but that the true meaningof the original, is faithfully preserved throughout the whole. Thesetranslations, however, with Mr. Rowe's Occasional Poems, and Birth-DayOdes, are but little read, and he is only distinguished as a dramatist;for which we shall not pretend to assign a reason; but we may observe,that a Muse capable of producing so many excellent dramatic pieces,cannot be supposed to have executed any plan indifferently; however, itmay charm a reader less than that kind of composition, which is set offon the Theatre, with so many advantages.He published likewise an edition of the works of Shakespear, andprefixed the life of that great man, from materials which he had beenindustrious to collect, in the county where Shakespear was born, and towhich, after he had filled the world with admiration of his genius, heretired.We deem it unnecessary to give any specimen of Mr. Rowe's poetry; themost celebrated speeches in his plays, which are beautifully harmonious;are repeated by every body who reads poetry, or attends plays; and tosuppose the reader ignorant of them, would be to degrade him from thatrank of intelligence, without which he can be little illuminated byperusing the _Lives of the Poets_.[Footnote 1: Welwood's preface to Rowe's Lucan]       *       *       *       *       *JOHN SHEFFIELD, Duke of BUCKINGHAM.This nobleman, who made a very great figure in the last age, as anauthor, a statesman, and a soldier; was born about the year 1650. Helost his father when he was about nine years of age, and his mothersoon after marrying lord Ossulton; the care of his education was leftentirely to a governor, who though a man of letters, did not muchimprove him in his studies [1]. Having parted with his governor, withwhom he travelled into France; he soon found by conversing with men ofgenius, that he was much deficient in many parts of literature, and thatwhile he acquired the graces of a gentleman, he was yet wanting in thosehigher excellencies; without which politeness makes but an indifferentfigure, and can never raise a man to eminence.He possessed an ample fortune, but for a while laid a restraint upon hisappetites, and passions, and dedicated for some time a certain number ofhours every day to his studies, by which means he acquired a degree oflearning, that entitled him to the character of a fine scholar. But notcontent with that acquisition, our noble author extended his views yetfarther, and restless in the pursuit of distinction, we find him at avery early age entering himself a volunteer in the second Dutch war; andaccordingly was in that famous naval engagement, where the duke of Yorkcommanded as admiral, on which occasion his lordship behaved himself sogallantly, that he was appointed commander of the royal Katherine, asecond rate man of war.His lordship in his own Memoirs, tells us, that when he entered himselfa volunteer under his royal highness the duke of York, he was thendeeply engaged, and under the soft influence of love: He says, he nevershall forget the tenderness of parting from his mistress. On thisaccount double honour is due to him:--To enter the bustle of war,without any other call, but that of honour, at an age when most youngnoblemen are under the tuition of a dancing master, argued a generousintrepid nature; but to leave the arms of his mistress, to tear himselffrom her he doated on, in order to serve his country, carries in it yeta higher degree of merit, and ought to put all young men of fortune tothe blush, who would rather meanly riot in luxurious ease at home, thando honour to themselves and their country, by endeavouring to serve it.His lordship acknowledges in the above-mentioned Memoirs, that the dukeof York did wonders in the engagement; and that he was as intrepid inhis nature, as some of his enemies supposed him to be of an oppositecharacter; though, says he, alluding to what afterwards happened,misfortunes, age, and other accidents, will make a great man differ fromhimself. We find our young nobleman while he was aboard a ship, amidstthe noise of the crew, could yet indulge his genius for poetry. Onewould imagine that the ocean is too boisterous an element for the Muses,whose darling wish is for ease and retirement; yet, we find him amidstthe roaring of winds and waves, open his Poem with these soothing lines.  Within the silent shades of soft repose,  Where fancy's boundless stream for ever flows;  Where the enfranchis'd soul, at ease can play,  Tir'd with the toilsome bus'ness of the day,  Where princes gladly rest their weary heads,  And change uneasy thrones for downy beds:  Where seeming joys delude despairing minds,  And where even jealousy some quiet finds;  There I, and sorrow, for a while could part,  Sleep clos'd my eyes, and eas'd a sighing heart.Our author afterwards made a campaign in the French service.As Tangier was in danger of being taken by the Moors, he offered to headthe forces which were to defend it; and accordingly he was appointedcommander of them. He was then earl of Mulgrave, and one of the lordsof the bed-chamber to king Charles the IId. In May 28, 1674, he wasinstalled knight of the Garter.As he now began to be eminent at court, it was impossible but he musthave enemies, and these enemies being mean enough to hint stories tohis prejudice, in regard to some ladies, with whom the king was notunconcerned; his lordship's command was not made so agreeable as itotherwise would have been. The particulars of this affair have beendisputed by historians, some have imagined it to refer to somecelebrated courtezan, whose affections his lordship weaned from theking, and drew them to himself; but Mrs. Manly, in her new Atalantis,and Boyer, in his History of queen Anne, assign a very different cause.They say, that before the lady Anne was married to prince George ofDenmark, she encouraged the addresses which the earl of Mulgrave wasbold enough to make her; and that he was sent to Tangier to break offthe correspondence.Mrs. Manly in her Atalantis, says many unhandsome things of hislordship, under the title of count Orgueil. Orgueil. Boyer says, someyears before the queen was married to prince George of Denmark, the earlof Mulgrave, a nobleman of Singular accomplishments, both of mind andperson, aspired so high as to attempt to marry the lady Anne; but thoughhis addresses to her were checked, as soon as discovered, yet theprincess had ever an esteem for him.This account is more probably true, than the former; when it isconsidered, that by sending the earl to Tangier[2], a scheme was laidfor destroying him, and all the crew aboard the same vessel. For theship which was appointed to carry the general of the forces, was in sucha condition, that the captain of her declared, he was afraid to make thevoyage. Upon this representation, lord Mulgrave applied both to the lordadmiral, and the king himself: The first said, the ship was safe enough,and no other could be then procured. The king answered him coldly, thathe hoped it would do, and that he should give himself no trouble aboutit. His lordship was reduced to the extremity either of going in a leakyship, or absolutely refusing; which he knew his enemies would impute tocowardice, and as he abhorred the imputation, he resolved, in oppositionto the advice of his friends, to hazard all; but at the same timeadvised several volunteers of quality, not to accompany him in theexpedition, as their honour was not so much engaged as his; some of whomwisely took his advice, but the earl of Plymouth, natural son of theking, piqued himself in running the same danger with a man who went toserve his father, and yet was used so strangely by the ill-offices ofhis ministers.Providence, however defeated the ministerial scheme of assassination,by giving them the finest weather during the voyage, which held threeweeks, and by pumping all the time, they landed safe at last at Tangier,where they met with admiral Herbert, afterwards earl of Torrington, whocould not but express his admiration, at their having performed such avoyage in a ship he had sent home as unfit for service; but such was theundisturbed tranquility and native firmness of the earl of Mulgrave'smind, that in this hazardous voyage, he composed the Poem, part of whichwe have quoted.Had the earl of Mulgrave been guilty of any offence, capital, orotherwise, the ministry might have called him to account for it; buttheir contriving, and the king's consenting to so bloody a purpose, ismethinks such a stain upon them, as can never be wiped off; and had thatnobleman and the ship's crew perished, they would have added actualmurther, to concerted baseness.Upon the approach of his lordship's forces, the Moors retired, and theresult of this expedition was, the blowing up of Tangier. Some timeafter the king was appeased, the earl forgot the ill offices, thathad been done him; and enjoyed his majesty's favour to the last. Hecontinued in several great ports during the short reign of king Jamesthe IId, till that prince abdicated the throne. As the earl constantlyand zealously advised him against several imprudent measures, which weretaken by the court, the king, some months before the revolution, beganto grow cooler towards him; but yet was so equitable as not to removehim from his preferments: And after the king lost his crown, he hadthe inward satisfaction, to be conscious, that his councils had notcontributed to that prince's misfortunes; and that himself, in anymanner, had not forfeited his honour and integrity.That his lordship was no violent friend to, or promoter of, therevolution, seems to appear from his conduct during that remarkable aera:and particularly from the unfinished relation he left concerning it,which was suppressed some years ago, by order of the government.In a passage in his lordship's writings, it appears he was unwillingthat king James should leave England[3]. Just as the king was steppinginto bed the night before his going away, the earl of Mulgrave came intothe bed-chamber, which, being at so late an hour, might possibly givethe king some apprehensions of that lord's suspecting his design, withwhich he was resolved not to trust him, nor any protestant: He thereforestopped short, and turned about to whisper him in the ear, that hiscommissioners had newly sent him a very hopeful account of someaccommodation with the Prince of Orange; to which that lord only repliedwith a question, asking him if the Prince's army halted, or approachednearer to London? the King owned they still marched on; at which theearl shook his head, and said no more, only made him a low bow, witha dejected countenance, humbly to make him understand that he gave nocredit to what the King's hard circumstances at that time obliged him todissemble. It also appears that the earl of Mulgrave was one of thoselords, who, immediately after the King's departure, sent letters to thefleet, to the abandoned army of King James, and to all the considerablegarrisons in England, which kept them in order and subjection, not onlyto the present authority, but that which should be settled afterwards.To his lordship's humanity was owing the protection King James obtainedfrom the Lords in London, upon his being seized, and insulted by thepopulace at Feversham in Kent; before which time, says he, 'the Peerssat daily in the council chamber in Whitehall, where the lord Mulgraveone morning happened to be advertised privately that the King had beenseized by the angry rabble at Feversham, and had sent a poor countrymanwith the news, in order to procure his rescue, which was like to cometoo late, since the messenger had waited long at the council door,without any body's being willing to take notice of him. This sad accountmoved him with great compassion at so extraordinary an instance ofworldly uncertainty; and no cautions of offending the prevailing partywere able to restrain him from shewing a little indignation at so mean aproceeding in the council; upon which, their new president, the marquisof Hallifax, would have adjourned it hastily, in order to prevent him.But the lord Mulgrave earnestly conjured them all to sit down again,that he might acquaint them with a matter that admitted no delay, andwas of the highest importance imaginable.Accordingly the Lords, who knew nothing of the business, could not buthearken to it; and those few that guessed it, and saw the consequence,yet wanted time enough for concerting together about so nice, and veryimportant a matter, as saving, or losing a King's life. The Lords thensat down again, and he represented to them what barbarity it would be,for such an assembly's conniving at the rabble's tearing to pieces,even any private gentleman, much more a great Prince, who, with all hispopery, was still their Sovereign; so that mere shame obliged them tosuspend their politics awhile, and call in the messenger, who told themwith tears, how the King had engaged him to deliver a letter from him toany persons he could find willing to save him from so imminent a danger.The letter had no superscription, and was to this effect;'To acquaint the reader of it, that he had been discovered in hisretreat by some fishermen of Kent, and secured at first there by thegentry, who were afterwards forced to resign him into the hands of aninsolent rabble.Upon so pressing an occasion, and now so very publickly made known,the council was surprized, and under some difficulty, for as there wasdanger of displeasing by doing their duty, so there was no lessby omitting it, since the Law makes it highly criminal in such anextremity; besides that most of them as yet unacquainted with the Princeof Orange, imagined him prudent, and consequently capable of punishingso base a desertion, either out of generosity, or policy. These foundafterwards their caution needless, but at present it influenced thecouncil to send 200 of the life guards under their captain the earlof Feversham; first to rescue the King from all danger of the commonpeople, and afterwards to attend him toward the sea side; if hecontinued his resolution of retiring, which they thought it more decentto connive at, than to detain him here by force.'Whoever has the least spark of generosity in his nature, cannot buthighly applaud this tender conduct of his lordship's, towards hisSovereign in distress; and look with contempt upon the slowness of thecouncil in dispatching a force to his relief, especially when we find itwas only out of dread, lest they should displease the Prince of Orange,that they sent any: this shewed a meanness of spirit, a want of truehonour, to such a degree, that the Prince of Orange himself could not,consistently with good policy, trust those worshippers of power, whocould hear, unconcerned, that their late Sovereign was in the hands of avile rabble, and intreating them in vain for rescue.The earl of Mulgrave made no mean compliances to King William,immediately after the revolution, but when he went to pay his addressesto him, he was well received; yet did he not accept of a post in thegovernment till some years after.May 10, in the 6th year of William and Mary, he was created marquis ofNormanby, in the county of Lincoln. When it was debated in Parliament,whether the Prince of Orange should be proclaimed King, or the Princesshis wife reign solely in her own right, he voted and spoke for theformer, and gave these reasons for it. That he thought the title ofeither person was equal; and since the Parliament was to decide thematter, he judged it would much better please that Prince, who was nowbecome their Protector, and was also in itself a thing more becoming sogood a Princess, as Queen Mary, to partake with her husband a crown soobtained, than to possess it entirely as her own. After long debates inParliament, the crown at last was settled upon William and Mary. Burnetlord bishop of Salisbury, whose affection for the revolution none Ibelieve can doubt, freely acknowledges that the King was resolved not tohold the government by right of his wife; 'he would not think of holdingany thing by apron strings:' he was jealous of the friends of his wife,and never, forgave them; and, last of all, he threatened to leave themin the lurch, that is, to retire to Holland, with his Dutch army; sorestless, says Mulgrave in another place, is ambition, in its highestscenes of success.During the reign of King William however, he enjoyed some considerableposts, and was generally pretty well in his favour, and confidence.April 21, 1702, he was sworn Lord Privy Seal, and the same yearappointed one of the commissioners to treat of an union between Englandand Scotland, and was made Lord Lieutenant, and Custos Rotulorum for theNorth Riding of Yorkshire, and one of the governors of the Charterhouse.March 9, 1703, he was created duke of Normanby, having been made marquisof Normanby by King William, and on the 19th of the same month duke ofBuckingham. In 1711 he was made Steward of her Majesty's Houshold, andPresident of the Council; and on her decease, was one of the LordsJustices in Great Britain, 'till King George arrived from Hanover.In 1710 the Whig ministry began to lose ground, and Mr. Harley, sinceearl of Oxford, and the Lord Treasurer made the proper use of thosecircumstances, yet wanting some assistance, applied to the duke ofBuckingham. The duke, who was not then on good terms with Mr. Harley, atfirst slighted his proposal, but afterwards joined with him and others,which produced a revolution in the ministry, and shook the power ofthe duke and duchess of Marlborough, while Mr. Harley, the earl ofShrewsbury, lord Bolingbroke, &c. came into the administration. Theduke was attached to Tory principles. Her Majesty offered to make himchancellor, which he thought proper to refuse. He was out of employmentfor some time, during which, he did not so much as pay his complimentsat court, 'till he married his third wife, and then went to kiss herMajesty's hand.The duke of Buckingham, though reckoned haughty, and ill natured, wasyet of a tender, compassionate disposition; but as the best charactershave generally some allay, he is allowed to have been very passionate;but after his warmth subsided, he endeavoured to atone for it by actsof kindness and beneficence to those upon whom his passion had venteditself. Several years before his grace died, he was well known to haveexpressed some concern for the libertinism of his youth, especiallyregarding the fair sex, in which he had indulged himself himself veryfreely. He was survived only by one legitimate son, but left severalnatural children;Our noble author has been charged by some of his enemies, with thesordid vice of covetousness, but without foundation; for, as a strongindication that he was not avaritious, he lost a considerable part ofhis fortune, merely by not taking the pains to visit, during the spaceof 40 years, his estates at some distance from London; and whoever isacquainted with human nature knows, that indolence and covetousness areincompatible.His grace died the 24th of February 1720, in the 75th year of his age,and after lying in state for some days at Buckingham-House, wascarried from thence with great funeral solemnity, and interred inWestminster-Abbey, where a monument is erected to his memory, upon whichthe following epitaph is engraved, by his own direction, as appears froma passage in his will.'Since something is usually written on monuments, I direct that thefollowing lines shall be put on mine, viz.'In one place.Pro Rege saepe, pro Republica semper.'In another.  Dubius, sed non improbus vixi.  Incertus morior, sed inturbatus.  Humanum est nescire & errare.  Christum adveneror, Deo confido  Omnipotenti, benevolentissimo.  Ens Entium miserere mihi.'The words Christum adveneror are omitted at the desire of the latebishop Atterbury, who thought them not strong enough in regard toChrist; under the whole are the following words,  Catharina Buckinghamicae: Ducissa  Maerens extrui curavit Anno MDCCXXI.Edmund, the duke's eldest son, already mentioned, was snatched awayin his bloom; a youth from whom the greatest things might have beenexpected, as he was untainted with the vices of the age: he was veryremarkable for his modesty, which vulgar minds imputed to want ofpowers, but those who knew him best, have given a different testimonyconcerning him, and have represented him as possessed of all the geniusof his father, with more strict and inviolable morals. With this youngnobleman the titles of the Sheffield family expired.The duke, his father, informs us of a duel he was to have fought withthe witty earl of Rochester, which he thus relates; after telling usthat the cause of the quarrel happened between the first and secondDutch war.'I was inform'd (says his grace) that the earl of Rochester had saidsomething very malicious of me; I therefore sent colonel Aston, a verymettled friend of mine, to call him to account for it; he denied thewords, and indeed I was soon convinced he had never said them. Buta mere report, though I found it to be false, obliged me (as I thenfoolishly thought) to go on with the quarrel; and the next day wasappointed for us to fight on horseback: a way in England a littleunusual, but it was his part to chuse. Accordingly I and my second laythe night before at Knightsbridge privately, to avoid being secured atLondon on any suspicion, which we found ourselves more in danger ofthere, because we had all the appearance of highwaymen, that had a mindto lye skulking in an odd inn for one night. In the morning we met thelord Rochester at the place appointed, who, instead of James Porter,whom he assured Aston he would make his second, brought an errantlife-guard-man, whom nobody knew. To this Mr. 'Aston took exception, asbeing no suitable adversary, especially considering how extremely wellhe was mounted, whereas we had only a couple of pads; upon which we allagreed to fight on foot. But as my lord Rochester and I were riding intothe next field in order to it, he told me that he had at first chosento fight on horseback, because he was so weak with a certain distemper,that he found himself unfit to fight at all any way, much less a foot.I was extremely surprized, because no man at that time had a betterreputation for courage; and my anger against him being quite subsided,I took the liberty to represent to him what a ridiculous story it wouldmake, should we return without fighting; and told him, that I must in myown defence be obliged to lay the fault on him, by telling the truth ofthe matter. His answer was, that he submitted to it, and hoped I wouldnot take the advantage in having to do with any man in so weak acondition: I replied, that by such an argument he had sufficiently tiedmy hands, upon condition, I might call our seconds to be witnesses ofthe whole business, which he consented to, and so we parted. Upon ourreturn to London, we found it full of this quarrel, upon our beingabsent so long; and therefore Mr. Aston thought fit to write down everyword and circumstance of this whole matter, in order to spread everywhere the true reason of our returning without having fought; whichbeing not in the least contradicted, or resented by the lord Rochester,entirely ruined his reputation for courage, though nobody had stilla greater as to wit, which supported him pretty well in the world,notwithstanding some more accidents of the same kind, that never fail tosucceed one another, when once people know a man's weakness.' The dukeof Buckingham's works speak him a beautiful prose writer, and a veryconsiderable poet, which is proved by the testimony of some of the bestwriters, his cotemporaries.His prose works consist chiefly ofHistorical Memoirs, Speeches in Parliament, Characters, Dialogues,Critical Observations, Speeches and Essays, which, with his poeticalcompositions, were printed by Alderman Barber in 1723. in two splendid4to volumes. The first volume containing pieces in most species ofpoetry, the epic excepted, and also imitations from other authors. HisGrace wrote some Epigrams, a great number of lyric pieces, some in theelegiac strain, and others in the dramatic. Amongst his poems, an Essayon Poetry, which contains excellent instructions to form the poet, isby far the most distinguished. He wrote a play called Julius Caesar andanother called Brutus: or rather altered them from Shakespear.His grace was a great lover of the polite arts in general, as appearsfrom the fondness he expresses for them in several parts of his works;particularly Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture; of the two formerhe made several curious collections, and his house, built under hisdirection in St. James's Park, speaks him not unacquainted with thelatter. It would be superfluous to enumerate all the writers who havegiven testimony in his grace's favour as an author. Dryden in several ofhis Dedications, while he expresses the warmth of his gratitude, failsnot to convey the most amiable idea of his lordship, and represents himas a noble writer. He lived in friendship with that great poet, who hasraised indelible monuments to his memory. I shall add but one othertestimony of his merit, which if some should think unnecessary, yetit is pleasing; the lines are delightfully sweet and flowing. In hisMiscellanies thus speaks Mr. Pope;  'Muse 'tis enough, at length thy labour ends,  And thou shalt live; for Buckingham commends.  Let crowds of critics now my verse assail,  Let Dennis write, and nameless numbers rail.  This more than pays whole years of thankless pain,  Time, health, and fortune, are not lost in vain.  Sheffield approves: conferring Phoebus bends;  And I, and malice, from this hour are friends.'The two plays of Julius Caesar, which he altered from Shakespear, areboth with Chorusses, after the manner of the Ancients: These plays wereto have been performed in the year 1729, and all the Chorusses were setto music by that great master in composition, Signor Bononcini; butEnglish voices being few, the Italians were applied to, who demandedmore for their nightly performance, than the receipts of the house couldamount to at the usual raised prices, and on that account the design wasdropt.It appears that our noble author had conceived a great regard for Mr.Pope, on his earliest appearance in the literary world; and was amongthe first to acknowledge the young bard's merit, in commendatory versesupon his excellence in poetry. The following compliment from the duke isprefixed to the first volume of Mr. Pope's works.On Mr. POPE, and his POEMs, by his Grace JOHN SHEFFIELD, Duke ofBUCKINGHAM.  With age decay'd, with courts and bus'ness tir'd,  Caring for nothing, but what ease requir'd;  Too dully serious for the muses sport,  And from the critics safe arriv'd in port;  I little thought of launching forth agen,  Amidst advent'rous rovers of the pen;  And after so much undeserv'd success,  Thus hazarding at last to make it less.  Encomiums suit not this censorious time,  Itself a subject for satyric rhime;  Ignorance honour'd, wit and mirth defam'd,  Folly triumphant, and ev'n Homer blam'd!  But to this genius, join'd with so much art,  Such various learning mix'd in ev'ry part,  Poets are bound a loud applause to pay;  Apollo bids it, and they must obey.  And yet so wonderful, sublime a thing,  As the great ILIAD, scarce cou'd make me sing;  Except I justly cou'd at once commend  A good companion, and as firm a friend.  One moral, or a mere well-natur'd deed  Can all desert in sciences exceed.  'Tis great delight to laugh at some men's ways,  But a much greater to give merit praise.[Footnote 1: Character of the Duke of Buckingham, p. 2. London, 1739.][Footnote 2: General Dictionary. See Article Sheffield.][Footnote 3: Vol, ii, p. 106.]       *       *       *       *       *CHARLES COTTON, Esq;This ingenious gentleman lived in the reigns of Charles and James II.He resided for a great part of his life at Beresford in the county ofStafford. He had some reputation for lyric poetry, but was particularlyfamous for burlesque verse. He translated from the French MonsieurCorneille's Horace, printed in 4to. London 1671, and dedicated to hisdear sister Mrs. Stanhope Hutchinson. This play was first finished in1665, but in his prefatory epistle he tells us,  'that neither at that time, nor for several years after, was it  intended for the public view, it being written for the private  divertisement of a fair young lady, and, ever since it had the  honour first to kiss her hands, was so entirely hers, that the  author did not reserve so much as the Brouillon to himself;  however, she being prevailed upon, though with some difficulty,  it was printed in 8vo. 1670.'As to the merit of this play in the original, it is sufficient toobserve, that the critics have allowed it to be the best tragedy ofCorneille, and the author himself is of the same opinion, provided thethree last acts had been equal to the two first. As to the translationby Mr. Cotton, we have very considerable authority to pronounce itbetter than that of Mrs. Katherine Philips, who could not numberversification among her qualities. The plot of this play, so faras history is concerned, may be read in Livy, Florus, DionysiusHalicarnasseus, &c. Our stage has lately had a play founded upon thisstory, added to the many it has received, called the Roman Father, byMr. W. Whitehead.Besides this translation, Mr. Cotton is author of many other works, suchas his poem called the Wonders of the Peak, printed in 8vo. London 168;[1] His burlesque Poem, called Scarronides, or Virgil Travestie, a mockPoem, on the first and fourth Books of Virgil's AEneid, printed in 8vo.London 1678. Though the title seems to imply as if his poem was inimitation of Scarron, who has translated eight books of Virgil in thesame manner, yet they who will compare both these pieces, will possiblyfind, that he has not only exceeded the French, but all those who havemade any attempts on that kind of poetry, the incomparable author ofHudibras excepted. Mr. Cotton likewise translated several of Lucian'sDialogues into burlesque verse, printed in 8vo. London 1675, underthe title of the Scoffer Scoff'd. In 1689 a volume of poems, with Mr.Cotton's name prefixed, was published in London: on these poems colonelLovelace, Sir Alton Cockaine, Robert Harrick, esq; and Mr. AlexanderBrome, complimented the author by copies of verses prefixed; but Mr.Langbain observes, that the truest picture of Mr. Cotton's mind is tobe seen in a little piece published at the end of these poems calledRetirement; but the chief of Mr. Cotton's production, seems to be histranslation of Montaigne's Essays, dedicated to George Lord Saville,Marquis of Hallifax; his lordship in a letter to him, thus express hisesteem for the translator, and admiration of his performance. Thisletter is printed amongst the other pieces of the marquis's in a thin12mo. 'Sir, I have too long delayed my thanks to you for giving me such an  obliging evidence of your remembrance: that alone would have been a  welcome present, but when joined with the book in the world I am the  best entertained with, it raiseth a strong desire in me to be better  known, where I am sure to be much pleased. I have, 'till now, thought  wit could not be translated, and do still retain so much of that  opinion, that I believe it impossible, except by one, whose genius  cometh up to the author. You have so kept the original strength of his  thought, that it almost tempts a man to believe the transmigration of  souls. He hath by your means mended his first edition. To transplant  and make him ours, is not only a valuable acquisition to us, but a just  censure of the critical impertinence of those French scriblers, who  have taken pains to make little cavils and exceptions, to lessen the  reputation of this great man, whom nature hath made too big to confine  himself to the exactness of a studied stile. He let his mind have its  full flight, and shewed by a generous kind of negligence, that he  did not write for praise, but to give to the world a true picture of  himself, and of mankind. He scorned affected periods to please the  mistaken reader with an empty chime of words; he hath no affectation to  set himself out, and dependeth wholly upon the natural force of what is  his own, and the excellent application of what he borroweth.  'You see, sir, I have kindness enough for Monsieur de Montaigne to be  your rival, but nobody can pretend to be in equal competition with you.  I do willingly yield, which is no small matter for a man to do to a  more prosperous lover, and if you will repay this piece of justice with  another, pray believe, that he who can translate such an author without  doing him wrong, must not only make me glad, but proud of being his  most humble servant,'  *  *  *.Thus far the testimony of the marquis of Hallifax in favour of ourauthor's performance, and we have good reason to conclude, that thetranslation, is not without great merit, when so accomplished a judgehas praised it.We cannot be certain in what year our author died, but it was probablysome time about the revolution. He appears to have been a man of veryconsiderable genius, to have had an extraordinary natural vein ofhumour, and an uncommon flow of pleasantry: he was certainly born apoet, and wrote his verses easily, but rather too loosely; his numbersbeing frequently harsh, and his stile negligent, and unpolished. Thecause of his Life being inserted out of chronological order, was anaccident, the particulars of which are not of importance enough to bementioned.[Footnote 1: M. Cotton's works are printed together in one volume, 12mo.The thirteenth edition is dated 1751.]       *       *       *       *       *The Right Honourable Joseph Addison, Esq;This elegant writer, to whom the world owes so many obligations, wasborn at Milton near Ambrosbury in the county of Wilts (of which placehis father, Mr. Lancelot Addison, was then rector) on the 6th of May1672; and being not thought likely to live, was baptized on the sameday, as appears from the church register. When he grew up to an age fitfor going to school, he was put under the care of the rev. Mr. Naish atAmbrosbury. He afterwards removed to a school at Salisbury, taught bythe rev. Mr. Taylor, thence to the Charter-house, where he was under thetuition of the learned Dr. Ellis, and where he contracted an intimacywith Mr. Steel, afterwards Sir Richard, which continued as long as Mr.Addison lived. He was not above fifteen years old when he was entered ofQueen's College, Oxford, in which his father had been placed: where heapplied himself so closely to the study of classical learning, that ina very short time he became master of a very elegant Latin stile, evenbefore he arrived at that age when ordinary scholars begin to write goodEnglish.In the year 1687 a copy of his verses in that tongue fell into the handsof Dr. Lancaster dean of Magdalen College, who was so pleased with them,that he immediately procured their author's election into that house[1]; where he took the degrees of bachelor, and matter of arts. In thecourse of a few years his Latin poetry was justly admired at both theuniversities, and procured him great reputation there, before his namewas so much as known in London. When he was in the 22d year of hisage, he published a copy of verses addressed to Mr. Dryden, which soonprocured him the notice of some of the poetical judges in that age. Theverses are not without their elegance, but if they are much removedabove common rhimes, they fall infinitely short of the character Mr.Addison's friends bestowed upon them. Some little space intervening, hesent into the world a translation of the 4th Georgic of Virgil, of whichwe need not say any more, than that it was commended by Mr. Dryden. Hewrote also that discourse on the Georgics, prefixed to them by way ofpreface in Mr. Dryden's translation, and chose to withhold his name fromthat judicious composition, because it contained an untried strain ofcriticism, which bore hard upon the old professors of that art, andtherefore was not so fit for a young man to take upon himself; and Mr.Dryden, who was above the meanness of fathering any one's work, ownsthe Essay on the Georgics to have come from a friend, whose name is notmentioned, because he desired to have it concealed.The next year Mr. Addison wrote several poems of different kinds;amongst the rest, one addressed to Henry Sacheverel, who becameafterwards so exceedingly famous. The following year he wrote a poem toKing William on one of his Campaigns, addressed to the Lord Keeper (SirJohn Somers.) That excellent statesman received this mark of a youngauthor's attachment with great humanity, admitted Mr. Addison into thenumber of his friends, and gave him on all occasions distinguishingproofs of a sincere esteem [2]. While he was at the university, he hadbeen pressingly sollicited to enter into holy orders, which he seemedonce resolved on, probably in obedience to his father's authority; butbeing conscious of the importance of the undertaking, and deterred byhis extreme modesty, he relinquished, says Mr. Tickell, all views thatway; but Sir Richard Steel in his letter to Mr. Congreve prefixed tothe Drummer, who had a quarrel with Tickell, on account of an injurioustreatment of him, says, that those were not the reasons which made Mr.Addison turn his thoughts to the civil world, 'and as you were theinducement (says he) of his becoming acquainted with my lord Hallifax,I doubt not but you remember the warm instances that noble lord madeto the head of the college, not to insist on Mr. Addison's going intoorders; his arguments were founded on the general pravity andcorruption of men of business, who wanted liberal education; and Iremember, as if I had read the letter yesterday, that my lord ended witha compliment, that however he might be represented as no friend to thechurch, he would never do it any other injury than by keepingMr. Addison out of it.'Mr. Addison having discovered an inclination to travel, theabovementioned patron, out of zeal, as well to his country, as ourauthor, procured him from the crown an annual pension of 300 l. whichenabled him to make a tour to Italy the latter end of 1699. His Latinpoems dedicated to Mr. Montague, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, wereprinted before his departure, in the Musaae Anglicanae, and were as muchesteemed in foreign countries, as at home, particularly by thatnoble wit of France, Boileau. It is from Mr. Tickell we learn thiscircumstance in relation to Boileau, and we shall present it to thereader in his own words; 'his country owes it to Mr. Addison, that thefamous Monsieur Boileau first conceived an opinion of the Englishgenius for poetry, by perusing the present he made him of the MusaeAnglicanae. It has been currently reported, that this famous Frenchpoet, among the civilities he shewed Mr. Addison on that occasion,affirmed, that he would not have written against Perrault, had hebefore seen such excellent pieces by a modern hand. The complimenthe meant, was, that these books had given him a very new idea of theEnglish politeness, and that he did not question, but there wereexcellent compositions in the native language of a country, whichpossessed the Roman genius in so eminent a degree.'In 1701 Mr. Addison wrote an epistolary poem from Italy to lordHallifax, which is much admired as a finished piece in its kind, andindeed some have pronounced it the best of Mr. Addison's performances.It was translated by the Abbot Antonio Mario Salvini, Greek Professorat Florence into Italian verse, which translation is printed with theoriginal in Mr. Tickell's 4to. edition of Mr. Addison's works. This poemis in the highest esteem in Italy, because there are in it the bestturned compliments on that country, that, perhaps, are to be foundany where: and the Italians, on account of their familiarity withthe objects it describes, must have a higher relish of it. This poemlikewise shews his gratitude to lord Hallifax, who had been that yearimpeached by the Commons in Parliament, for procuring exorbitant grantsfrom the crown to his own use; and further charged with cutting down,and wasting the timber in his Majesty's forests, and with holdingseveral offices in his Majesty's Exchequer, that were inconsistent, anddesigned as checks upon each other: The Commons had likewise addressedthe King to remove him from his councils, and presence for ever. Thesewere the causes of his retiring, and Mr. Addison's address at this time,was a noble instance of his fidelity, and stedfastness to his friends.On his return to England, he published an account of his travels,dedicated to lord Somers; he would have returned earlier than he did,had not he been thought of as a proper person to attend prince Eugene,who then commanded for the emperor in Italy, which employment would muchhave pleased him; but the death of king William intervening caused acessation of his pension and his hopes.For a considerable space of time he remained at home, and as hisfriends were out of the ministry, he had no opportunity to display hisabilities, or to meet a competent regard for the honour his works hadalready done his country. He owed both to an accident: In the year 1704lord treasurer Godolphin happened to complain to the lord Hallifax, thatthe duke of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim, had not been celebratedin verse, in the manner it deserved, and told him, that he would takeit kind, if his lordship, who was the patron of the poets, would name agentleman capable of writing upon so elevated a subject. Lord Hallifaxreplied with some quickness, that he was well acquainted with such aperson, but that he would not name him; and observed, that he had longseen with indignation, men of little or no merit, maintained in pomp andluxury, at the expence of the public, while persons of too much modesty,with great abilities, languished in obscurity. The treasurer answered,very coolly, that he was sorry his lordship had occasion to make such anobservation; but that in the mean time, he would engage his honour, thatwhoever his lordship should name, might venture upon this theme, withoutfear of losing his time. Lord Hallifax thereupon named Mr. Addison, butinsisted the treasurer should send to him himself, which he promised.Accordingly he prevailed upon Mr. Boyle, then chancellor of theexchequer, to go in his name to Mr. Addison, and communicate to him thebusiness, which he did in so obliging a manner, that he readily enteredupon the task [3]. The lord treasurer saw the Poem before it wasfinished, when the author had written no farther than the celebratedsimile of the Angel, and was so much pleased with it, that heimmediately made him commissioner of appeals, in the room of Mr. Locke,who was promoted to be one of the lords commissioners for trade, &c.His Poem, entitled the Campaign, was received with loud and generalapplause: It is addressed to the duke of Marlborough, and contains ashort view of the military transactions in the year 1704, and a veryparticular description of the two great actions at Schellemberg andBlenheim.In 1705 Mr. Addison attended the lord Hallifax to Hanover; and in thesucceeding year he was made choice of for under-secretary to Sir CharlesHedges, then appointed secretary of state. In the month of December, inthe same year, the earl of Sunderland, who succeeded Sir Charles in thatoffice, continued Mr. Addison in the post of under secretary.Operas being now much in fashion, many people of distinction and truetaste, importuned him to make a trial, whether sense and sound werereally so incompatible, as some admirers of the Italian pieces wouldrepresent them. He was at last prevailed upon to comply with theirrequest, and composed his Rosamond: This piece was inscribed to theduchess of Marlborough, and met with but indifferent success on thestage. Many looked upon it as not properly an Opera; for consideringwhat numbers of miserable productions had born that title, they werescarce satisfied that so superior a piece should appear under the samedenomination About this time our author assisted Sir Richard Steel, in aplay called the Tender Husband; to which he wrote a humorous Prologue.Sir Richard, whose gratitude was as warm and ready as his wit, surprizedhim with a dedication, which may be considered as one of the fewmonuments of praise, not unworthy the great person to whose honour itwas raised.In 1709 he went over to Ireland, as secretary to the marquis of Wharton,appointed lord lieutenant of that kingdom. Her majesty also, waspleased, as a mark of her peculiar favour, to augment the salary annexedto the keeper of the records in that nation, and bestow it upon him.While he was in Ireland, his friend Sir Richard Steel published theTatler, which appeared for the first time, on the 12th of April 1709:Mr. Addison (says Tickell) discovered the author by an observation onVirgil he had communicated to him. This discovery led him to affordfarther assistance, insomuch, that as the author of the Tatler wellexprest it, he fared by this means, like a distrest prince, who callsin a powerful neighbour to his aid: that is, he was undone by hisauxiliary.The superiority of Mr. Addison's papers in that work is universallyadmitted; and being more at leisure upon the change of the ministry, hecontinued assisting in the Tatler till 1711, when it was dropt.No sooner was the Tatler laid down, but Sir Richard Steel, in concertwith Mr. Addison, formed the plan of the Spectator. The first paperappeared on the first of March 1711, and in the course of that greatwork, Mr. Addison furnished all the papers marked with any Letters ofthe Muse CLIO; and which were generally most admired. Tickell, who hadno kindness for Sir Richard Steel, meanly supposes that he marked hispaper out of precaution against Sir Richard; which was an ill-natur'dinsinuation; for in the conclusion of the Spectators, he acknowledges toMr. Addison, all he had a right to; and in his letter to Congreve, hedeclares that Addison's papers were marked by him, out of tenderness tohis friend, and a warm zeal for his fame. Steel was a generous gratefulfriend; it therefore ill became Mr. Tickell in the defence of Mr.Addison's honour, which needed no such stratagem, to depreciate one ofhis dearest friends; and at the expence of truth, and his reputation,raise the character of his Hero. Sir Richard had opposed Mr. Addison,in the choice of Mr. Tickell as his secretary; which it seems he couldnever forget nor forgive.In the Spectators, Sir Roger de Coverly was Mr. Addison's favouritecharacter; and so tender was he of it, that he went to Sir Richard, uponhis publishing a Spectator, in which he made Sir Roger pick up a womanin the temple cloisters, and would not part with his friend, until hepromised to meddle with the old knight's character no more. However, Mr.Addison to make sure, and to prevent any absurdities the writers of thesubsequent Spectators might fall into, resolved to remove that characterout of the way; or, as he pleasantly expressed it to an intimate friend,killed Sir Roger, that no body else might murther him. When the oldSpectator was finished, a new one appeared; but, though written by menof wit and genius, it did not succeed, and they were wise enough not topush the attempt too far. Posterity must have a high idea of the tasteand good sense of the British nation, when they are informed, thattwenty-thousand of these papers were sometimes sold in a day. [4]The Guardian, a paper of the same tendency, entertained the town in theyears 1713 and 1714, in which Mr. Addison had likewise a very largeshare; he also wrote two papers in the Lover.In the year 1713 appeared his famous Cato. He entered into a design ofwriting a Tragedy on that subject, when he was very young; and whenhe was on his travels he actually wrote four acts of it: However, heretouched it on his return, without any design of bringing it on thestage; but some friends of his imagining it might be of service to thecause of liberty, he was prevailed upon to finish it for the theatre,which he accordingly did. When this play appeared, it was received withboundless admiration; and during the representation on the first night,on which its fate depended, it is said that Mr. Addison discovereduncommon timidity; he was agitated between hope and fear, and while heremained retired in the green-room, he kept a person continually goingbackwards and forwards, from the stage to the place where he was, toinform him how it succeeded, and till the whole was over, and thesuccess confirmed, he never ventured to move.When it was published, it was recommended by many Copies of Versesprefixed to it, amongst which the sincerity of Mr. Steele, and thegenius of Eusden, deserve to be distinguished: But, as I would not omitany particulars relative to this renowned play, and its great author, Ishall insert a letter of Mr. Pope's to Sir William Turnbull, datedthe 30th of April 1713, in which are some circumstances that meritcommemoration.SIR,'As to poetical affairs, I am content at present to be a bare looker on,and from a practitioner turn an admirer; which as the world goes, is notvery usual. Cato was not so much the wonder of Rome in his Days, as heis of Britain in ours; and though all the foolish industry possible hadbeen used to make it thought a party play, yet what the author once saidof another, may the most properly in the world be applied to him on thisoccasion.  Envy itself is dumb, in wonder lost,  And factions strive who shall applaud him most.The numerous and violent claps of the Whig party, on the one side of thetheatre, were ecchoed back by the Tories on the other; while theauthor sweated behind the scenes, with concern to find their applauseproceeding more from the hand than the head. This was the case too withthe Prologue writer, who was clapp'd into a staunch Whig at the end ofevery two lines. I believe you have heard, that after all the applausesof the opposite faction, my lord Bolingbroke sent for Booth, who playedCato, into the box, between one of the acts, and presented him withfifty guineas, in acknowledgment as he expressed it, for defending thecause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator. The Whigs areunwilling to be distanced this way, and therefore design a present tothe same Cato very speedily; in the mean time, they are getting readyas good a sentence as the former on their side, so betwixt them it isprobable, that Cato (as Dr. Garth exprest it) may have something to liveupon after he dies.'Immediately after the publication of this Tragedy, there came abroad apamphlet, entitled, Observations on Cato; written by the ingenious Dr.Sewel: The design of this piece was to show that the applause thisTragedy met with was founded on merit. It is a very accurate andentertaining criticism, and tends to secure the poet the hearts of hisreaders, as well as of his audience.Our author was not however without enemies, amongst whom was Mr. Dennis,who attacked it, first in a pamphlet, and then in a subsequent work, inwhich he employed seven letters in pulling it to pieces: In some of hisremarks he is candid, and judicious enough, in others he is trifling andill natur'd, and I think it is pretty plain he was agitated by envy; foras the intent of that play was to promote the Whig interest, of whichMr. Dennis was a zealous abettor, he could not therefore disesteem itfrom party principles.Another gentleman, who called himself a scholar at Oxford, consideredthe play in a very different light; and endeavoured to serve his partyby turning the cannon upon the enemy. The title of this pamphlet is, Mr.Addison turned Tory: It is written with great spirit and vivacity. Catowas speedily translated into French by Mr. Boyer, but with no spirit: Itwas translated likewise into Italian.Voltaire has commended, and condemned Mr. Addison by turns, and inrespect to Cato, he admires, and censures it extravagantly. Theprincipal character he allows superior to any before brought upon thestage, but says, that all the love-scenes are absolutely insipid: Hemight have added unnecessary, as to the plot; and the only reason thatcan be assigned for the poet's introducing them was, the prevalenceof custom; but it must be acknowledged, that his lovers are the mostsensible, and address each other in the best language, that is to befound in any love dialogues of the British stage: It will be difficultto find a more striking line, or more picturesque of a lover's passion.than this pathetic exclamation;A lover does not live by vulgar time.Queen Anne was not the last in doing justice to our author and hisperformance; she was pleased to signify an inclination of having itdedicated to her, but as he intended that compliment to another, it cameinto the world without any dedication.If in the subsequent part of his life, his leisure had been greater, weare told, he would probably have written another tragedy on the death ofSocrates; but the honours accruing from what he had already performeddeprived posterity of that production.This subject was still drier, and less susceptible of poetical ornamentthan the former, but in the hands of so great a writer, there is nodoubt but genius would have supplied what was wanting in the realstory, and have covered by shining sentiments, and noble language, thesimplicity of the plot, and deficiency in business.Upon the death of the Queen, the Lords Justices appointed Mr. Addisontheir secretary. This diverted him from the design he had formed ofcomposing an English Dictionary upon the plan of a famous Italianone: that the world has much suffered by this promotion I am readyto believe, and cannot but regret that our language yet wants theassistance of so great a master, in fixing its standard, settling itspurity, and illustrating its copiousness, or elegance.In 1716 our author married the countess of Warwick; and about that timepublished the Freeholder, which is a kind of political Spectator. Thiswork Mr. Addison conducted without any assistance, upon a plan of hisown forming; he did it in consequence of his principles, out of a desireto remove prejudices, and contribute all he could to make his countryhappy; however it produced his own promotion, in 1717, to be one ofthe principal secretaries of state. His health, which had beenbefore impaired by an asthmatic disorder, suffered exceedingly by anadvancement so much to his honour, but attended with such great fatigue:Finding, that he was not able to manage so much business as his stationled him to, he resigned, and in his leisure hours began a work of areligious nature, upon the Evidence of the Christian religion; which helived not to finish. He likewise intended a Paraphrase on some of thePsalms of David: but a long and painful relapse broke all his designs,and deprived the world of one of its brightest ornaments, June 17, 1719,when he was entering the 54th year of his age. He died at Holland-housenear Kensington, and left behind him an only daughter by the countess ofWarwick.After his decease, Mr. Tickell, by the authority and direction of theauthor, collected and published his works, in four volumes 4to. In thisedition there are several pieces, as yet unmentioned, which I shallhere give account of in order; the first is a Dissertation upon Medals,which, though not published 'till after his death; was begun in 1702,when he was at Vienna.In 1707 there came abroad a pamphlet, under the title of The PresentState of the War, and the Necessity of an Augmentation Considered. TheWhig Examiner came out September 14 1710, for the first time: there werefive papers in all attributed to Mr. Addison; these are by much thetartest things he ever wrote; Dr. Sacheverel, Mr. Prior, and many otherpersons are severely treated. The Examiner had done the same thing onthe part of the Tories, and the avowed design of this paper was to makereprisals.In the year 1713 was published a little pamphlet, called The Late Trial,and Conviction of Count Tariff; it was intended to expose the Toryministry on the head of the French Commerce Bill: This is also a severepiece.The following have likewise been ascribed to our author;Dissertatio de insignioribus Romanorum Poetis, i. e. A Dissertation uponthe most Eminent Roman Poets: This is supposed to have been writtenabout 1692.A Discourse on Ancient and Modern Learning; the time when it was writtenis uncertain, but probably as early as the former. It was preservedamongst the manuscripts of lord Somers, which, after the death of SirJoseph Jekyl, being publickly sold, this little piece came to be printed1739, and was well received. To these we must add the Old Whig, No. 1and 2. Pamphlets written in Defence of the Peerage Bill: The scope ofthe Bill was this, that in place of 16 Peers sitting in Parliament, asRepresentatives of the Peerage of Scotland, there were for the future tobe twenty five hereditary Peers, by the junction of nine out of the bodyof the Scotch nobility, to the then 16 sitting Peers; that six EnglishPeers should be added, and the peerage then remain fixed; the crownbeing restrained from making any new lords, but upon the extinction offamilies. This gave a great alarm to the nation, and many papers werewrote with spirit against it; amongst the rest, one called the Plebeian,now known to have been Sir Richard Steele's. In answer to this came outthe Old Whig N deg.. 1. on the State of the Peerage, with some Remarks onthe Plebeian. This controversy was carried on between the two friends,Addison and Steele, at first without any knowledge of one another, butbefore it was ended, it appears, from several expressions, that theauthor of the Old Whig was acquainted with his antagonist.Thus we have gone through the most remarkable passages of the lifeof this great man, in admiration of whom, it is but natural to bean Enthusiast, and whose very enemies expressed their dislike withdiffidence; nor indeed were his enemies, Mr. Pope excepted, (if it beproper to reckon Mr. Pope Mr. Addison's enemy) in one particular case,of any consequence. It is a true, and an old observation, that thegreatest men have sometimes failings, that, of all other humanweaknesses, one would not suspect them to be subject to. It is said ofMr. Addison, that he was a slave to flattery, that he was jealous, andsuspicious in his temper, and, as Pope keenly expresses it,  Bore, like the Turk, no rival near the                     throne.That he was jealous of the fame of Pope, many have believed, and perhapsnot altogether without ground. He preferred Tickel's translation of thefirst Book of Homer, to Pope's. His words are,  'the other has more of Homer',when, at the same time, in a letter to Pope, he strenuously advises himto undertake it, and tells him, there is none but he equal to it; whichcircumstance has made some people conjecture, that Addison was himselfthe author of the translation, imputed to Mr. Tickell: Be this as itmay, it is unpleasing to dwell upon the failings, and quarrels of greatmen; let us rather draw a veil over all their errors, and only admiretheir virtues, and their genius; of both which the author, the incidentsof whose life we have now been tracing, had a large possession. He addedmuch to the purity of the English stile in prose; his rhime is not soflowing, nervous, or manly as some of his cotemporaries, but his prosehas an original excellence, a smoothness and dignity peculiar to it. Hispoetry, as well as sentiments, in Cato, cannot be praised enough.Mr. Addison was stedfast to his principles, faithful to his friends, azealous patriot, honourable in public stations, amiable in private life,and as he lived, he died, a good man, and a pious Christian.[Footnote 1: Tickell's Preface to Addison's works.][Footnote 2: Tickell. Ubi supra.][Footnote 3: Budgel's Memoirs of the Boyles.][Footnote 4: Tickell's Preface.]       *       *       *       *       *ANNE, Countess of WINCHELSEA.This lady, deservedly celebrated for her poetic genius, was daughter ofSir William Kingsmill of Sidmonton, in the county of Southampton. Shewas Maid of Honour to the Duchess of York, second wife to King James II.and was afterwards married to Heneage earl of Winchelsea, who was in hisfather's life-time Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to the Duke of York.One of the most considerable of this lady's poems, is that upon theSpleen, published by Mr. Charles Gildon, 1701, in 8vo. That poemoccasioned another of Mr. Nicholas Rowe's, entitled an Epistle toFlavia, on the sight of two Pindaric Odes on the Spleen and Vanity,written by a Lady to her Friend. This poem of the Spleen is writtenin stanzas, after the manner of Cowley, and contains many thoughtsnaturally expressed, and poetically conceived; there is seldom to befound any thing more excellently picturesque than this poem, and itjustly entitles the amiable countess to hold a very high station amongstthe inspired tribe. Nothing can be more happily imagined than thefollowing description of the pretended influence of Spleen upon surlyHusbands, and gay Coquetes.  Patron thou art of every gross abuse;  The sullen husband's feign'd excuse,  When the ill humours with his wife he spends,  And bears recruited wit, and spirits to his friends  The son of Bacchus pleads thy pow'r    As to the glass he still repairs    Pretends but to remove thy cares,  Snatch from thy shades, one gay, and smiling hour,  And drown thy kingdom in a purple show'r.  When the coquette (whom ev'ry fool admires)    Would in variety be fair;    And changing hastily the scene,    From light, impertinent, and vain,    Assumes a soft, a melancholy air  And of her eyes rebates the wand'ring fires,  The careless posture, and the head reclin'd  (Proclaiming the withdrawn, the absent mind)    Allows the fop more liberty to gaze;    Who gently for the tender cause enquires;  The cause indeed is a defect of sense,  Yet is the Spleen alledged, and still the dull pretence.The influence which Spleen has over religious minds, is admirablypainted in the next stanza.    By spleen, religion, all we know;    That should enlighten here below,  Is veiled in darkness, and perplext  With anxious doubts, with endless scruples vext  And some restraint imply'd from each perverted text;  Whilst touch not, taste not what is freely given,  Is but thy niggard voice disgracing bounteous Heaven.  From speech restrain'd, by the deceits abus'd,  To desarts banish'd; or in cells reclus'd,  Mistaken vot'ries, to the powers divine,  Whilst they a purer sacrifice design,  Do but the spleen obey, and worship at thy shrine.A collection of this lady's poems was published at London 1713 in 8vo.containing likewise a Tragedy never acted, entitled Aristomenes, or theRoyal Shepherd. The general scenes are in Aristomenes's camp, near thewalls of Phaerea, sometimes the plains among the Shepherds. A greatnumber of our authoress's poems still continue unpublished, in the handsof the rev. Mr. Creake, and some were in possession of the right hon.the countess of Hertford.The countess of Winchelsea died August 9, 1720, without issue. She washappy in the friendship of Mr. Pope, who addresses a copy of verses toher, occasioned by eight lines in the Rape of the Lock: they contain avery elegant compliment.  In vain you boast poetic names of yore,  And cite those Saphoes we admire no more:  Fate doom'd the fall of ev'ry female wit,  But doom'd it then, when first Ardelia writ.  Of all examples by the world confest,  I knew Ardelia could not quote the best,  Who like her mistress on Britannia's throne  Fights and subdues in quarrels not her own.  To write their praise, you but in vain essay;  E'en while you write, you take that praise away:  Light to the stars, the sun does thus restore,  And shines himself 'till they are seen no more.The answer which the countess makes to the above, is rather moreexquisite than the lines of Mr. Pope; he is foil'd at his own weapons,and outdone in the elegance of compliment.  Disarm'd with so genteel an air,    The contest I give o'er;  Yet Alexander have a care,    And shock the sex no more.  We rule the world our life's whole race,    Men but assume that right;  First slaves to ev'ry tempting face,    Then martyrs to our spite.  You of one Orpheus sure have read,    Who would like you have writ  Had he in London-town been bred,    And polish'd too his wit;  But he poor soul, thought all was well    And great should be his fame,  When he had left his wife in hell    And birds, and beasts could tame.  Yet venturing then with scoffing rhimes    The women to incense,  Resenting heroines of those times    Soon punished his offence.  And as the Hebrus roll'd his skull,    And Harp besmeared with blood,  They clashing as the waves grew full    Still harmoniz'd the flood.  But you our follies gently treat,    And spin so fine the thread,  You need not fear his awkward fate,    The lock won't cost the head.  Our admiration you command    For all that's gone before;  What next we look for at your hand    Can only raise it more.  Yet sooth the ladies, I advise    (As me too pride has wrought)  We're born to wit, but to be wise    By admonitions taught.The other pieces of this lady are,An Epilogue to Jane Shore, to be spoken by Mrs. Oldfield the nightbefore the Poet's day.To the Countess of Hertford with her Volume of Poems.The Prodigy, a Poem, written at Tunbridge-Wells 1706, on the Admirationthat many expressed on a Gentleman's being in love, and their Endeavoursto dissuade him from it, with some Advice to the young Ladies howto maintain their natural Prerogative. If all her other poeticalcompositions are executed with as much spirit and elegance as these, thelovers of poetry have some reason to be sorry that her station was such,as to exempt her from the necessity of more frequently exercising agenius so furnished by nature, to have made a great figure in thatdivine art.       *       *       *       *       *CHARLES GILDON.This gentleman was born at Gillingham near Shaftsbury, in the county ofDorset. His parents, and family were all of the Romish persuasion, butthey could not instil their principles into our author, who, as soon ashe began to reason, was able to discover the errors, and foppery ofthat church. His father was a member of the society of Grays-Inn, andsuffered much for the Royal cause. The first rudiments of learning Mr.Gildon had at the place of his nativity; thence his relations sent himto the English college of secular priests at Doway in Hainault, witha design of making him a priest; but after five years study there, hefound his inclination direct him to a quite different course of life.When he was nineteen years old he returned to England, and as soon as hewas of age, and capable of enjoying the pleasures of gaiety, he cameto London, where he spent the greatest part of his paternal estate.At about the age of twenty-three, to crown his other imprudences, hemarried, without improving his reduced circumstances thereby.During the reign of King James II. he dedicated his time to the studyof the prevailing controversies, and he somewhere declares, it cost himabove seven years close application to books, before he could entirelyovercome the prejudices of his education. He never believed the absurdtenets of the church of Rome; nor could he embrace the ridiculousdoctrine of her infallibility: But as he had been taught an earlyreverence to the priesthood, and a submissive obedience to theirauthority, it was a long while before he assumed courage to think freelyfor himself, or declare what he thought.His first attempt in the drama, was not till he had arrived at his 32dyear; and he himself in his essays tells us, that necessity (the generalinducement) was his first motive of venturing to be an author.He is the author of three plays, viz.1. The Roman Bride's Revenge, a Tragedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal1697. This play was written in a month, and had the usual success ofhasty productions, though the first and second acts are well written,and the catastrophe beautiful; the moral being to give us an example, inthe punishment of Martian, that no consideration ought to make us delaythe service of our country.2. Phaeton, or the Fatal Divorce; a Tragedy, acted at the Theatre-Royal1698, dedicated to Charles Montague, Esq; This play is written inimitation of the ancients, with some reflexions on a book called a ShortView of the Immorality of the English Stage, written by Mr. Collier, aNon-juring Clergyman, who combated in the cause of virtue, with success,against Dryden, Congreve, Dennis, and our author. The plot of this play,and a great many of the beauties, Mr. Gildon owns in his preface, he hastaken from the Medea of Euripides.3. Love's. Victim, or the Queen of Wales; a Tragedy, acted at theTheatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.He introduced the Play called the Younger Brother, or the Amorous Jilt;written by Mrs. Behn, but not brought upon the stage 'till after herdecease. He made very little alteration in it. Our author's plays havenot his name to them; and his fault lies generally in the stile, whichis too near an imitation of Lee's.He wrote a piece called the New Rehearsal, or Bays the Younger;containing an Examen of the Ambitious Step-mother, Tamerlane, The Biter,Fair Penitent, The Royal Convert, Ulysses, and Jane Shore, all writtenby Mr. Rowe; also a Word or Two on Mr. Pope's Rape of the Lock, to whichis prefixed a Preface concerning Criticism in general, by the Earl ofShaftsbury, Author of the Characteristics, 8vo. 1714. Scene the RoseTavern. The freedom he used with Mr. Pope in remarking upon the Rape ofthe Lock, it seems was sufficient to raise that gentleman's resentment,who was never celebrated for forgiving. Many years after, Mr. Pope tookhis revenge, by stigmatizing him as a dunce, in his usual keen spirit ofsatire: There had arisen some quarrel between Gildon and Dennis, uponwhich, Mr. Pope in his Dunciad, B. iii. has the following lines,  Ah Dennis! Gildon ah! what ill-starr'd rage  Divides a friendship long confirm'd by age?  Blockheads with reason wicked wits abhor,  But fool with fool is barb'rous civil war.  Embrace; embrace my sons! be foes no more,  Nor glad vile poets with true critics gore.This author's other works are chiefly these,The Post-Boy Robb'd of his Mail, or the Packet Broke Open; consisting ofFive Hundred Letters to several Persons of Quality, &c. 1692.He published the Miscellaneous Works of Charles Blount, Esq; to which heprefixed the Life of the Author, and an Account, and Vindication of hisDeath, in 12mo. 1695. In this volume are several of the publisher's ownletters.Likewise Letters, and Essays, on several Subjects, philosophical,historical, critical, amorous, &c. in Prose and Verse, to John Dryden,Esq; George Granville, Esq; Walter Moyle, Esq; Mr. Congreve, Mr. Dennis,and other ingenious gentlemen of the age.Miscellaneous Poems, on several Occasions, and Translations from Horace,Persius, Petronius Arbiter, &c. with an Essay upon Satire, by the famousM. Dacier, 8vo. 1692.A Review of Her Royal Highness Princess Sophia's Letters to the LordArchbishop of Canterbury, and that of Sir Rowland Gwynn's, to the RightHon. the Earl of Stamford, 8vo. 1706.Canons, or the Vision; a Poem, addressed to the Right Hon. James Earl ofCarnarvon, &c. 1717.The Laws of Poetry, as laid down by the Duke of Buckingham in his Essayon Poetry, by the Earl of Roscommon in his Essay upon Translated Verse;and by Lord Lansdown on Unnatural Flights in Poetry, explained andillustrated, &c. 8vo. 1721.A Continuation of Langbain's Lives of the Poets.Mr. Coxeter has imputed to him a piece called Measure for Measure, orBeauty the best Advocate; altered from Shakespear, and performed atthe Theatre in Lincoln's Inn-Fields 1700, with the addition of severalEntertainments of Music. Prologue and Epilogue by Mr. Oldmixon.The Deist's Manual, or Rational Enquiry into the Christian Religion,with some Animadversions on Hobbs, Spinosa, the Oracles of Reason,Second Thoughts, &c. to which is prefixed a Letter from the Author ofthe Method with the Deists, 1705.Complete Art of Poetry.Mr. Gildon died on the 12th of January 1723, and in the words of Boyer'sPolitical State, vol. xxvii. p. 102. we shall sum up his character.'On Sunday, January 12, died Mr. Charles Gildon, a person of greatliterature, but a mean genius; who having attempted several kinds ofwriting, never gained much reputation in any. Among other treatises, hewrote the English Art of Poetry, which he had practised himself veryunsuccessfully in his dramatic performances. He also wrote an EnglishGrammar, but what he seemed to build his chief hopes of fame upon,was, his late Critical Commentary on the Duke of Buckingham's Essayon Poetry, which last piece was perused, and highly approved, by hisgrace.'       *       *       *       *       *THOMAS D'URFEY,Was born in the county of Devon, and was first bred to the law; but wehave not heard from what family he was descended, nor in what year hewas born. He has written upwards of thirty plays, with various success,but had a genius better turned to a ballad, and little irregular odes,than for dramatic poetry. He soon forsook the profession of the law, andthrew himself upon the public, by writing for the stage.----That D'Urfeywas a man of some abilities, and, enjoyed the esteem and friendshipof men of the greatest parts in his time, appears from the favourabletestimony of the author of the Guardian: And as the design of this workis to collect, and throw into one view, whatever may be found concerningany poet of eminence in various books, and literary records, weshall make no scruple of transcribing what that ingenious writer hashumorously said concerning our author.In Numb. 29. Vol. I. speaking of the advantages of laughing, he thusmentions D'Urfey. 'A judicious author, some years since published acollection of Sonnets, which he very successfully called Laugh and beFat; or Pills to purge Melancholy: I cannot sufficiently admire thefacetious title of these volumes, and must censure the world ofingratitude, while they are so negligent in rewarding the jocose laboursof my friend Mr. D'Urfey, who was so large a contributor to thisTreatise, and to whose humorous productions, so many rural squires inthe remotest parts of this island are obliged, for the dignity and statewhich corpulency gives them. It is my opinion, that the above pillswould be extremely proper to be taken with Asses milk, and mightcontribute towards the renewing and restoring decayed lungs.'Numb. 67. He thus speaks of his old friend.--'It has been remarked, bycurious observers, that poets are generally long lived, and run beyondthe usual age of man, if not cut off by some accident, or excess, asAnacreon, in the midst of a very merry old age, was choaked with a grapestone. The same redundancy of spirits that produces the poetical flame,keeps up the vital warmth, and administers uncommon fuel to life. Iquestion not but several instances will occur to my reader's memory,from Homer down to Mr. Dryden; I shall only take notice of two who haveexcelled in Lyrics, the one an antient, the other a modern. The firstgained an immortal reputation by celebrating several jockeys in theOlympic Games; the last has signalized himself on the same occasion,by the Ode that begins with----To horse brave boys, to New-market, tohorse. The reader will by this time know, that the two poets I havementioned are Pindar, and Mr. D'Urfey. The former of these is long sincelaid in his urn, after having many years together endeared himself toall Greece, by his tuneful compositions. Our countryman is still living,and in a blooming old age, that still promises many musical productions;for if I am not mistaken our British Swan will sing to the last. Thebest judges, who have perused his last Song on the moderate Man, do notdiscover any decay in his parts; but think it deserves a place among thefinest of those works, with which he obliged the world in his more earlyyears.'I am led into this subject, by a visit which I lately received from mygood old friend and cotemporary. As we both flourished together in kingCharles the IId's reign, we diverted ourselves with the remembrance ofseveral particulars that pass'd in the world, before the greatest partof my readers were born; and could not but smile to think how insensiblywe were grown into a couple of venerable old gentlemen. Tom observedto me, that after having written more Odes than Horace, and about fourtimes as many Comedies as Terence; he was reduced to great difficulties,by the importunities of a set of men, who of late years had furnishedhim with the accommodations of life, and would not, as we say, be paidwith a song. In order to extricate my old friend, I immediately sent forthe three directors of the Play-house, and desired they would in theirturn, do a good office for a man, who in Shakespear's phrase, oftenfilled their mouths; I mean with pleasantry and popular conceits. Theyvery generously listened to my proposal, and agreed to act the PlottingSisters (a very taking play of my old friends composing) on the 15th ofnext month, for the benefit of the author.'My kindness to the agreeable Mr. D'Urfey, will be imperfect, if, afterhaving engaged the players in his favour, I do not get the town to comeinto it. I must therefore heartily recommend to all the young ladiesmy disciples, the case of my old friend, who has often made theirgrand-mothers merry; and whose Sonnets have perhaps lulled asleep many apresent toast, when she lay in her cradle. The gentleman I am speakingof, has laid obligations on so many of his countrymen, that I hope theywill think this but a just return to the good service of a veteran Poet.'I myself, remember king Charles the IId. leaning on Tom D'Urfey'sshoulder more than once, and humming over a song with him. It iscertain, that monarch was not a little supported, by joy to great Caesar;which gave the Whigs such a blow, as they were not able to recoverthat whole reign. My friend afterwards attacked Popery, with the samesuccess, having exposed Beliarmine, and Portocarero, more than once, inshort satirical compositions, which have been in every body's mouth. Hemade use of Italian Tunes and Sonato's, for promoting the Protestantinterest; and turned a considerable part of the Pope's music againsthimself. In short, he has obliged the court with political Sonnets; thecountry with Dialogues, and Pastorals; the city with Descriptions of alord Mayor's Feast; not to mention his little Ode upon Stool-Ball; withmany others of the like nature.'Should the very individuals he has celebrated, make their appearancetogether, they would be sufficient to fill the play-house. Pretty Peg ofWindsor, Gilian of Croydon; with Dolly and Molly; and Tommy and Johny;with many others to be met with in the musical Miscellanies, would makea great benefit.'As my friend, after the manner of the old Lyrics, accompanies his workswith his own voice; he has been the delight of the most polite companiesand conversions, from the beginning of king Charles the IId's reign,to our own times: Many an honest gentleman has got a reputation in hiscountry, by pretending to have been in company with Tom D'Urfey.'I might here mention several other merits in my friend, as hisenriching our language with a multitude of rhimes, and bringingwords together, that without his good offices, would never have beenacquainted with one another, so long as it had been a tongue; but I mustnot omit that my old friend angled for a trout, the best of any man inEngland.'After what I have said, and much more that I might say, on thissubject, I question not but the world will think that my old friendought not to pass the remainder of his life in a cage, like a singingbird; but enjoy all that Pindaric liberty, which is suitable to a man ofhis genius. He has made the world merry, and I hope they will make himeasy, as long as he stays amongst us. This I will take upon me to say,they cannot do a kindness, to a more diverting companion, or a morechearful, honest, good-natur'd man.'----The same author, Numb. 82. puts his readers in mind when D'Urfey'sbenefit came on, of some other circumstances favourable to him. 'ThePlotting Sisters, says he, is this day to be acted for the benefit ofthe author, my old friend Mr. D'Urfey. This comedy was honoured with thepresence of King Charles II. three of the first five nights. Myfriend has in this work shewn himself a master, and made not only thecharacters of the play, but also the furniture of the house contributeto the main design. He has made excellent use of a table with a carpet,and the key of a closet; with these two implements, which would perhapshave been over-looked by an ordinary writer, he contrives the mostnatural perplexities (allowing only the use of these houshold goodsin poetry) that ever were represented on a stage. He also made goodadvantage of the knowledge of the stage itself; for in the nick of beingsurprized, the lovers are let down, and escape at a trap door. In aword, any who have the curiosity to observe what pleased in the lastgeneration, and does not go to a comedy with a resolution to be grave,will find this evening ample food for mirth. Johnson, who understandswhat he does as well as any man, exposes the impertinence of an oldfellow who has lost his senses, still pursuing pleasures with greatmastery. The ingenious Mr. Pinkethman is a bashful rake, and issheepish, without having modesty with great success. Mr. Bullocksucceeds Nokes in the part of Bubble, and, in my opinion, is not muchbelow him, for he does excellently that kind of folly we call absurdity,which is the very contrary of wit; but next to that is, of all things,properest to excite mirth. What is foolish is the object of pity,but absurdity often proceeds from an opinion of sufficiency, andconsequently is an honest occasion for laughter. These characters inthis play, cannot but make it a very pleasant entertainment, and thedecorations of singing and dancing, will more than repay the good-natureof those, who make an honest man a visit of two merry hours, to make hisfollowing year unpainful.'These are the testimonies of friendship and esteem, which this greatauthor has given in favour of D'Urfey, and however his genius may beturned for the Sing-song, or Ballad, which is certainly the lowestspecies of poetry, yet that man cannot be termed contemptible, who wasthus loved, and, though in jocular terms, praised by Mr. Addison.There are few, or no particulars relating to the life of this poetpreserved. He was attached to the Tory interest, and in the latter partof Queen Anne's reign frequently had the honour of diverting her withwitty catches, and songs of humour suited to the spirit of the times. Hedied, according to Mr. Coxeter, February 26, 1723, in a good old age,and was buried in the Church-yard of St. James's, Westminster. Hisdramatic works are,1. The Siege of Memphis, or the Ambitious Queen; a Tragedy acted at theTheatre-royal, printed in quarto 1676. Mr. Langbain says that this playis full of bombast and fustian, and observes, 'That there goes moreto the making a poet, than copying verses, or tagging rhimes, andrecommends to the modern poetasters, the following lines from a Prologueto a Play called the Atheist.'  'Rhimsters get wit, e're ye pretend to shew it,  Nor think a game at Crambo makes a poet.'2. Madam Fickle, or the Witty False One; acted at the duke of York'sTheatre, printed in quarto, 1677, dedicated to the duke of Ormond. Thisplay is compiled from several other Comedies; the scene is laid inCovent-Garden.3. Trick for Trick, or the Debauched Hypocrite; a Comedy acted at theTheatre-Royal 1678: This is the only one of Fletcher's plays, calledMonsieur Thomas revived.4. The Fool turn'd Critic; acted at the Theatre-Royal, 1678. Several ofthe characters of this play are borrowed; as Old-wine-love, Trim andSmall-wit, seem to be taken from Senio Asotus, and Ballio, in Randolph'sJealous Lovers.5. Fond Husband, or the Plotting Sisters, a Comedy. Of this we havealready given some account, in the words of Mr. Addison.6. Squire Old-Sap, or the Night-Adventures; a Comedy; acted at theduke's Theatre, printed in quarto, 1679. Several incidents in this playare taken from Francion's Comic. Hist. Boccace's Novels, les Contes deM. de la Fontaine.7. The Virtuous Wife, or Good-Luck at last; a Comedy acted at the duke'sTheatre 1680. Several hints are taken from the Town, Marriage A-la-mode,&c. the Scene Chelsea.8. Sir Barnaby Whig, or no Wit like a Woman's; a Comedy acted at theTheatre-Royal 1681. Dedicated to the right honourable George Earl ofBerkley. The plot of this play is taken from a Play of Marmion's, calledthe Fine Companion; and part from the Double Cuckold, a Novel, writtenby M. St. Evremond. Scene London.9. The Royalist, a Comedy; acted at the Duke's Theatre 1682. This play,which is collected chiefly from novels, succeeded on the stage; printedin 4to. 1644.10. The Injured Princess, or the Fatal Wager; a Tragi-Comedy; actedat the Theatre-Royal 1682. The foundation of this play is taken fromShakespear's Cymbeline.11. A Common-wealth of Women, a Tragi-Comedy; acted at the Theatre Royal1686, dedicated to Christopher Duke of Albemarle. This play is chieflyborrowed from Fletcher's Sea Voyage. The scene is in Covent Garden.12. The Banditti, or a Lady's Distress; a Comedy; acted at theTheatre-Royal 1688. This play met with great opposition during theperformance, which was disturbed by the Catcalls. This occasioned theauthor to take his revenge upon the town, by dedicating it to a certainKnight, under the title of Sir Critic Cat-call. The chief plot of thisplay is founded on a Romance written by Don Francisco de las Coveras,called Don Fenise, translated into English in 8vo. See the History ofDon Antonio, b. iv. p. 250. The design of Don Diego's turning Banditti,and joining with them to rob his supposed father, resembles that ofPipperollo in Shirley's play called the Sisters. Scene Madrid.13. A Fool's Preferment, or the Three Dukes of Dunstable; a Comedy;acted at the Queen's Theatre in Dorset-Garden 1688, dedicated to CharlesLord Morpeth, in as familiar a way as if the Author was a man ofQuality. The whole play is little more than a transcript of Fletcher'sNoble Gentlemen, except one scene, which is taken from a Novel calledThe Humours of Basset. Scene the Court, in the time of Henry IV. Thesongs in this play were all composed by the celebrated Musician Mr.Henry Purcell.14. Bussy D'Amboise, or the Husband's Revenge; a Tragedy; acted at theTheatre-Royal, 4to. 1691, addressed to Edward Earl of Carlisle. Thisis a play of Mr. Chapman's revis'd, and the character of Tamyra, Mr.D'Urfey tells us, he has altered for the better. The scene Paris.15. Love for Money, or the Boarding School; a Comedy; acted at theTheatre-Royal 1691, dedicated to Charles Lord Viscount Lansdown, Countof the Sacred Roman Empire, &c. This play met with opposition in thefirst day's representation, but afterwards succeeded pretty well. Thescene Chelsea.16. The Richmond Heiress, or a Woman once in the Right; a Comedy, actedat the Theatre-Royal 1693.17. The Marriage-Hater Matched, a Comedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal1693, addressed to James Duke of Ormond. Mr. Charles Gildon, in anepistle prefixed to the play, tells us, that this is much the best ofour author's performances. Mr. Dogget was first taken notice of as anexcellent actor, from the admirable performance of his part in thisplay. Scene the Park, near Kensington.18. The Comical History of Don Quixot, Part the First; acted at theQueen's Theatre in Dorset-Garden 1694, dedicated to the Duchess ofOrmond. This play was acted with great applause; it is wholly taken fromthe Spanish Romance of that name. Scene Mancha in Spain.19. The Comical History of Don Quixot, Part the Second; acted at theQueen's Theatre 1694, dedicated by an Epistle, in heroic Verse, toCharles Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, &c. This play was likewise actedwith applause.20. Don Quixot, Part the Third, with the Marriage of Mary the Buxom,1669; this met with no success.21. The Intrigues at Versailles, or A Jilt in all Humours; a Comedy;acted at the Theatre-Royal in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields 1697, dedicated toSir Charles Sedley the Elder, Bart. and to his much honoured Friend SirCharles Sedley, his Son. Scene Versailles. The author complains of thewant of success in this play, when he asserts, the town had applaudedsome pieces of his of less merit. He has borrowed very liberally from aplay of Mrs. Behn's called The Amorous Jilt.22. Cynthia and Endymion, or The Lover of the Deities, a Dramatic Opera;acted at the Theatre-Royal 1697, dedicated to Henry Earl of Romney; thiswas acted with applause; and the author tells us, that King William'sQueen Mary intended to have it represented at Court. 'There are manylines (says Jacob) in this play, above the genius which generallyappears in the other works of this author; but he has perverted thecharacters of Ovid, in making Daphne, the chaste favourite of Diana,a whore, and a jilt; and fair Syrene to lose her reputation, in theunknown ignominy of an envious, mercenary, infamous woman.' Scene Ionia.23. The Campaigners, or The Pleasant Adventures at Brussels; a Comedy;with a familiar Preface upon a late Reformer of the Stage, ending with aSatirical Fable of the Dog, and the Otter, 1698. This play is dedicatedto Thomas Lord Wharton, and part of it is borrowed from a Novel calledFemale Falsehood. Scene Brussels. 24. Massanello, or a Fisherman Prince,in two Parts; acted at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields 1700.25. The Modern Prophets, or New Wit for a Husband; a Comedy.26.

Wonders in the Sun, or The Kingdom of Birds; a Comic Opera;performed at the Queen's Theatre in the Hay-Market.28. Bath, or The Western Lass; a Comedy; dedicated to John Duke ofArgyle.29. The Two Queens of Brentford, or Bays no Poetaster; a Musical Farce,or Comical Opera; being the Sequel of the Rehearsal, written by the Dukeof Buckingham; it has five Acts. Scene Inside of the Playhouse.30. The Grecian Heroine, or The Fate of Tyranny; a Tragedy; written1718. Scene Corinth.31. Ariadne, or The Triumph of Bacchus; the Scene Naxos, an Island inthe Archipelago. These last were published with a Collection of Poems1721.These are the dramatic performances of D'Urfey, by which his incessantlabours for the stage are to be seen; though not one of his numerousissue is now in possession of it. He was author of many poems, andsongs, which we need not here enumerate. Mr. Coxeter takes particularnotice of a piece of his called Gloriana, a Funeral Pindarique Poem tothe memory of Queen Mary, 4to. 1695.The Trophies, or Augusta's Glory; a triumphant Ode, made in honour ofthe City, and upon the Trophies taken from the French at the Battleof Ramillies, May 25, 1706, by the Duke of Marlborough, and fixed inGuildhall, London, dedicated to the Lord Mayor, and Court of Aldermenand Sheriffs, and also to the President. and Court of Managers for theunited Trade to the East Indies.Honor & Opes, or The British Merchant's Glory; a Poem Congratulatory, onthe happy Decision, and Conclusion of all Difficulties between the Oldand New Company in the Trade to the East Indies. As a specimen of hispoetry take the following lines.VERSES Congratulatory, to the Honourable WILLIAM BROMLEY, Esq; on hisbeing chosen SPEAKER of this present Parliament.  As when Hyperion with victorious light  Expels invading Pow'rs of gloomy night,  And vernal nature youthful dress'd and gay,  Salutes the radiant power that forms the day;  The mounting Lark exalts her joyful note,  And strains with harmony her warbling throat:  So now my muse that hopes to see the day,  When cloudy faction, that do's Britain sway,  Shall be o'ercome by reason's dazling ray;  Applauding senates for their prudent choice,  The will of Heaven by the Peoples voice,  First greets you Sir, then gladly do's prepare,  In tuneful verse, your welcome to the chair.    Awful th' assembly is, august the Queen,  In whose each day of life are wonders seen:  The nation too, this greatest of all years,  Who watch to see blest turns in their affairs,  Slighting the tempest on the Gallic shore,  Hope from the senate much, but from you more:  Whose happy temper judgment cultivates,  And forms so fit to aid our three estates.    The change of ministry late ordered here,  Was fated sure for this auspicious year;  That you predestin'd at a glorious hour,  To be chief judge of legislative power,  Might by your skill that Royal right asserts,  Like Heaven, reconcile the jarring parts.    Nor shines your influence, Sir, here alone,  The Church must your unequall'd prudence own,  Firm to support the cause, but rough to none.  Eusebia's sons, in laws divine possest,  Can learn from you how truth should be exprest;  Whether in modest terms, like balm, to heal;  Or raving notions, falsly counted zeal.  Our holy writ no rule like that allows,  No people an enrag'd apostle chose,  Nor taught Our Saviour, or St. Paul, like those.  Reason was mild, and calmly did proceed,  Which harsh might fail to make transgressors heed;  This saint your rhet'ric best knows how to prove,  Whose gracious method can inform, and move;  Direct the elders that such errors make,  And shew both how to preach, and how to speak.    Oh! sacred gift! in public matters great,  But in religious tracts divinely sweet;  Since to this grace they only have pretence  Whose happy learning join with a caelestial sense.    That Sir, you share both these, the muse forgive,  If I presume to write what all believe,  Your candour too, and charming courtesy,  Rever'd by them is justly so by me,  Let me not then offend your modesty,  If now my genius to a height I raise,  Such parts, and such humanity to praise.    This ancient [1]Baginton can witness well,  And the rich [2]library before it fell;  The precious hours amongst wise authors past,  Your Soul with their unvalued wealth possest;  And well may he to heights of knowledge come,  Who that Panthaeon always kept at home.    Thus once, Sir, you were blest, and sure the fiend  That first entail'd a curse on human-kind,  And afterwards contriv'd this fatal cross,  Design'd the public, by your private loss.    Oh! who had seen that love to learning bore,  The matchless authors of the days of yore;  The fathers, prelates, poets, books where arts  Renown'd explain'd the men of rarest parts,  Shrink up their shrivell'd bindings, lose their names,  And yield immortal worth to temporary flames,  That would not sigh to see the ruins there,  Or wish to quench 'em with a flowing tear.    But as in story, where we wonders view,  As there were flames, there was a Phoenix too;  An excellence from the burnt pile did rise,  That still aton'd for past calamities;  So my prophetic genius in its height,  Viewing your merit, Sir, foretels your fate.  Your valiant [3]ancestors, that bravely fought,  And from the foe the Royal standard got;  Which nobly now adorn your houshold coat,  Denotes the former grandeur of your race;  Your present worth fits you for present grace.    The Sovereign must esteem what all admire,  Bromley and Baginton shall both raise higher,  Fate oft contrives magnificence by fire.[Footnote 1: The ancient seat of the Bromleys in Warwickshire.][Footnote 2: A famous Library burnt there.][Footnote 3: Vide History of Warwickshire.]       *       *       *       *       *ELKANAH SETTLE, Son of Joseph Settle of Dunstable in Bedfordshire, wasborn there; and in the 18th year of his age, 1666, was entered commonerof Trinity College, Oxon, and put under the tuition of Mr. AbrahamChampion, fellow of that house; but he quitted the university withouttaking any degree, and came to London[1], where he addicted himself tothe study of poetry, in which he lived to make no inconsiderable figure.Finding the nation divided between the opinions of Whig and Tory, andbeing sensible that a man of parts could not make any considerablefigure, unless he attached himself to one of these parties; Settlethought proper, on his first setting out in life, to join the Whigs, whowere then, though the minor, yet a powerful party, and to support whoseinterest he employed his talents.About the year 1680, when the debates ran high concerning the exclusionof the Duke of York from the succession, on account of his religiousprinciples, our author wrote a piece called the Character of a PopishSuccessor, and what may be expected from such an one, humbly offered tothe consideration of both the Houses of Parliament appointed to meet atOxon, on March 21, 1681. This essay it seems was thought of consequenceenough to merit an answer, as at that time the Exclusion Bill employedthe general conversation. The answer to it was entitled The Characterof a Rebellion, and what England may expect from One; printed 1682. Theauthor of this last piece, is very severe on the character of Settle; herepresents him as an errant knave, a despicable coward, and a prophaneAtheist, and seems amazed that any party should make choice of achampion, whose morals were so tainted; but as this is only the languageof party violence, no great credit is to be given to it.The author of this pamphlet carries his zeal, and ill manners stillfarther, and informs the world of the meanness of our author's birth,and education, 'most of his relations (says he) are Barbers, and of thebaseness, falseness, and mutability of his nature, too many evidencesmay be brought. He closed with the Whigs, contrary to the principleshe formerly professed, at a time when they took occasion to push theircause, upon the breaking out of Oates's plot, and was ready to fall offfrom, and return to them, for his own advantage.'To the abovementioned pamphlet, written by Settle, various other answerswere published, some by writers of distinction, of which Sir RogerL'Estrange was one; and to this performance of Sir Roger's, which wasentitled The Character of a Papist in Masquerade, supported by Authorityand Experience, Mr. Settle made a Reply, entitled The Character of aPopish Successor Compleat; this, in the opinion of the critics, is thesmartest piece ever written upon the subject of the Exclusion Bill, andyet Sir Roger, his antagonist, 'calls it a pompous, wordy thing, madeup of shifts, and suppositions, without so much as an argument, eitheroffered, or answered in stress of the question, &c.' Mr. Settle's causewas so much better than that of his antagonist's, that if he had notpossessed half the powers he really did, he must have come off theconqueror, for, who does not see the immediate danger, the fatalchances, to which a Protestant people are exposed, who have themisfortune to be governed by a Popish Prince. As the King is naturallypowerful, he can easily dispose of the places of importance, and trust,so as to have them filled with creatures of his own, who will engagein any enterprise, or pervert any law, to serve the purposes of thereigning Monarch. Had not the nation an instance of this, during theshort reign of the very Popish Prince, against whom Settle contended?Did not judge Jeffries, a name justly devoted to everlasting infamy,corrupt the streams of justice, and by the most audacious cruelty,pervert the forms of law, that the blood of innocent persons might beshed, to gratify the appetite of a suspicious master? Besides, thereis always a danger that the religion which the King professes, willimperceptibly diffuse itself over a nation, though no violence is usedto promote it. The King, as he is the fountain of honour, so is he thefountain of fashion, and as many people, who surround a throne, are ofno religion in consequence of conviction; it is but natural to suppose,that fashion would influence them to embrace the religion of the Prince,and in James II's reign, this observation was verified; for the peopleof fashion embraced the Popish religion so very fast, in order to pleasethe King, that a witty knight, who then lived, and who was by hiseducation, and principles, a Papist, being asked by a nobleman whatnews? he made answer, I hear no news my lord, only, God's Papists canget no preferment, because the King's Papists swarm so thick. This was asententious, and witty observation, and it will always hold true, thatthe religion of the King will become the religion of people of fashion,and the lower stations ape their superiors.Upon the coronation of King James II. the two Parts of the Character ofa Popish Successor, were, with the Exclusion Bill, on the 23d of April,1685, burnt by the sub-wardens, and fellows of Merton College, Oxon, ina public bonfire, made in the middle of their great quadrangle. Duringthese contentions, Mr. Settle also published a piece called The MedalRevers'd, published 1681; this was an answer to a poem of Dryden'scalled The Medal, occasioned by the bill against the earl of Shaftsburybeing found ignoramus at the Old Baily, upon which the Whig party madebonfires, and ordered a medal to be struck in commemoration of thatevent. Shaftsbury, who was by his principles a Whig, and who couldnot but foresee the miseries which afterwards happened under a PopishPrince, opposed the succession with all his power; he was a man of verygreat endowments, and being of a bustling tumultuous disposition, wasadmirably fitted to be the head of a party. He was the leading managainst the succession of the Duke of York, and argued in the Houseof Lords with great force against him, and what was more remarkable,sometimes in the Duke's presence. It is related, that at theCouncil-table, when his Majesty, and his Royal Brother were bothpresent, something concerning the succession was canvassed, whenShaftsbury, not in the least intimidated, spoke his opinion with greatvehemence against the Duke, and was answered with equal heat, but withless force, by the then lord chamberlain. During this debate, the Duketook occasion to whisper the King, that his Majesty had a villain of achancellor, to which the King merrily replied, oddsfish, York, what afool you have of a chamberlain: by which it appears, his Majesty wasconvinced that Shaftsbury's arguments were the strongest.In consequence of Shaftsbury's violent opposition to the Duke, and thecourt party, there was a Bill of Indictment of High Treason, read beforehis Majesty's Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer in the Sessions-Houseat the Old Bailey, but the Jury found it Ignoramus; upon which, all theparty rejoiced at the deliverance of their head. These disturbances gaveMr. Settle an opportunity to display his abilities, which he didnot neglect to improve, by which means he procured so formidable anantagonist as Mr. Dryden, who was obliged by his place of laureat, tospeak, and write for the court. Dryden had formerly joined Mr. Settle,in order to reduce the growing reputation of Shadwell, but theirinterest being now so opposite, they became poetical enemies, in whichSettle was, no doubt, over-matched. He wrote a poem, however, calledAzaria and Hushai, in five sheets, 4to. designed as an answer to Mr.Dryden's poem called Absalom and Achitophel.Soon after this, if we may credit the Oxford Antiquary, Settle changedsides, and turned Tory, with as much violence as he had formerlyespoused the interest of the Whigs. He published in 1683, in eight meetsin folio, a Narrative; the first part of which is concerning himself,as being of the Tory side; the second to shew the inconsistency, andcontradiction of Titus Oates's Narrative of the Plot of the PopishParty, against the Life of King Charles II. at the time when thatMonarch intended to alter his ministry, to have consented to theexclusion of his brother, and taken measures to support the Protestantinterest. This Oates was in the reign of James II. tried, and convidledof perjury, upon the evidence chiefly of Papists, and had a severesentence pronounced, and inflicted upon him, viz. Imprisonmehd for life,twice every year to stand on the pillory, and twice to be severelywhipt; but he received a pardon from King William, after suffering hiswhippings, and two years imprisonment, with amazing fortitude, but wasnever allowed again to be an evidence. While Settle was engaged in theTory party, he is said, by Wood, to have been author of Animadversionson the Last Speech and Confession of William Lord Russel, who fell asacrifice to the Duke of York, and whose story, as related by Burnet,never fails to move the reader to tears. Also Remarks on AlgernonSidney's Paper, delivered to the Sheriffs at his Execution, London,1683, in one sheet, published the latter end of December the same year.Algernon Sidney was likewise murdered by the same kind of violence,which popish bigotry had lifted up against the lives of some otherBritish worthies.He also wrote a heroic poem on the Coronation of the High and MightyMonarch James II. London 1685, and then commenced a journalist for theCourt, and published weekly an Essay in behalf of the Administration. IfSettle was capable of these mean compliances of writing for, or againsta party, as he was hired, he must have possessed a very sordid mind,and been totally devoid of all principles of honour; but as there is noother authority for it than Wood, who is enthusiastic in his temper, andoften writes of things, not as they were, but as he would wish them tobe, the reader may give what credit he pleases to the report.Our author's dramatic works are1. The Empress of Morocco, a Tragedy; acted at the Duke of York'sTheatre. This play was likewise acted at court, as appears by the twoPrologues prefixed, which were both spoken by the Lady Elizabeth Howard;the first Prologue was written by the Earl of Mulgrave, the other byLord Rochester; when it was performed at court, the Lords and Ladies ofthe Bed-chamber played in it. Mr. Dryden, Mr. Shadwell, and Mr. Crowne,wrote against it, which began a famous controversy betwixt the witsof the town, wherein, says Jacob, Mr. Dryden was roughly handled,particularly by the lord Rochester, and the duke of Buckingham, andSettle got the laugh upon his side.2. Love and Revenge, a Tragedy; acted at the Duke of York's Theatre,4to. 1675, dedicated to William Duke of Newcastle.3. Cambyses King of Persia, a Tragedy; acted at the Duke's Theatre,dedicated to Anne Duchess of Monmouth. This tragedy is written in heroicverse; the plot from Justin, lib. i. c. 9. Herodotus, &c. The Scene isin Suza, and Cambyses's camp near the walls of Suza.4. The Conquest of China by the Tartars, a Tragedy; acted at the Duke'sTheatre, 4to. 1676, dedicated to the Right Hon. the Lord Howard ofCastle-rising. This play is likewise written in heroic verse, andfounded on history.5. Ibrahim, the Illustrious Bassa, a Tragedy in heroic verse; acted atthe Duke's Theatre 1677, dedicated to the Duchess of Albemarle. Plotfrom the Illustrious Bassa, a Romance, by Scuddery. The Scene Solyman'sSeraglio.6. Pastor Fido, or The Faithful Shepherd; a Pastoral; acted at the Dukeof York's Theatre. This is Sir Richard Fanshaw's translation from theItalian of Guarini Improved. Scene Arcadia.7. Fatal Love, or The Forced Inconstancy; a Tragedy; acted at theTheatre-Royal, 1680, dedicated to Sir Robert Owen.8. The Female Prelate, being the History of the Life and Death of PopeJoan; a Tragedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal, 4to. 1680, dedicated toAnthony Earl of Shaftsbury.9. The Heir of Morocco, with the Death of Gyland, a Tragedy; acted atthe Theatre-Royal 1682.10. Distressed Innocence, or the Princess of Persia; a Tragedy; actedat the Theatre-Royal, dedicated to John Lord Cutts. This play was actedwith applause; the author acknowledges his obligations to Betterton, forsome valuable hints in this play, and that Mr. Mountford wrote the lastscene of it.11. The Ambitious Slave, or a Generous Revenge; a Tragedy; acted at theTheatre Royal, 4to. 1694. This play met with ill success.12. The World in the Moon, a Dramatic, Comic Opera; performed at theTheatre in Dorset-Garden, by his Majesty's Servants, 1698.13. City Rambler, or The Playhouse Wedding; a Comedy; acted at theTheatre-Royal.14. The Virgin Prophetess, or The Fate of Troy; an Opera; performed1701.15. The Ladies Triumph, a Comic Opera; presented at the Theatre inLincoln's-Inn-Fields, by Subscription, 1710.Our poet possessed a pension from the City Magistrates, for anannual Panegyric to celebrate the Festival of the Lord Mayor, andin consequence wrote various poems, which he calls Triumphs for theInauguration of the Lord Mayors, which are preserved in his works, andwhich it would be needless to enumerate. Besides his dramatic pieces,he published many occasional poems, addressed to his patrons, and somefuneral elegies on the deaths of his friends. It is certain Settle didnot want learning, and, in the opinion of some critics, in the earlypart of his life, sometimes excelled Dryden; but that was certainlyowing more to a power he had of keeping his temper unruffled, than anyeffort of genius; for between Dryden and Settle, there is as greatdifference, as between our modern versifiers, and Pope.Whatever was the success of his poetry, he was the best contriver ofmachinery in England, and for many years of the latter part of his lifereceived an annual salary from Mrs. Minns, and her daughter Mrs. Leigh,for writing Drolls for Bartholomew, and Southwark Fairs, with properdecorations, which were generally so well contrived, that they exceededthose of their opponents in the same profession.Our author died in the Charterhouse 1724; some months before hisdecease, he offered a play to the managers of the Theatre-Royal inDrury-Lane, but he lived not to introduce it on the stage; it was calledThe Expulsion of the Danes from Britain.End of the Third Volume.[Footnote 1: Wood's Athen.

HETZEL  LIBRAIRIE MARESCO ET Cie  5, RUE DU PONT DE LODIKOURROGLOUEPOPEE PERSANENOTICEKourroglou est toujours, a mes yeux, une oeuvre tres-belle ettres-curieuse. Elle n'eut pourtant pas de succes dans la _Revueindependante_, ou j'en publiai la traduction abregee. Des raisonsd'amitie me firent suspendre ce petit travail que l'on me disaitprejudiciable aux interets de la Revue. Mais je protestai et protesteencore contre l'intelligence des abonnes qui prefererent les romansnouveaux a ces chants originaux d'une litterature etrangere. C'etait uneinitiation a la maniere des rapsodes et des improvisateurs de l'Orient,et l'on sait qu'en fait d'art, connue en toutes choses, le public veutetre pousse par les epaules vers les decouvertes, si faciles qu'ellessoient.La suite du poeme, dont j'ai ete forcee de resumer en deux pages lesderniers chants et le denouement superbe, a ete publiee en abrege surle texte anglais de M. Chodzko, par M. C.-G. Simon, a Nantes. Cela faitpartie d'une suite de travaux interessants et agreablement presentes,qui ont paru dans les _Annales de la Societe academique de laLoire-Inferieure_, sous le titre de _Recherches sur la litteratureorientale_, Nantes, 1847.Il est a regretter que M. C.-G. Simon, par des raisons analogues acelles que j'ai subies, n'ait pas continue son exploration dans cettelitterature persane, une des plus riches et une des plus belles dumonde, assurement, puisqu'on y trouve la maniere d'Homere et celle deCervantes se coudoyant avec franchise, grandeur et naivete dans lesmemes recits. On me dira que tout cela est explore deja. J'objecteraique peu de gens lisent ces poemes dans le texte, et qu'on ne les litguere plus dans les traductions, puisque la mienne et celles de M.Simon, allegees autant que possible des redites et longueurs inevitablesde la maniere orientale, n'ont ete goutees et comprises que deslitterateurs.Et malgre ceci, j'insiste, et je dis: Lisez _Kourroglou_; c'est amusant,_quoique_ ce soit beau.GEORGE SANDNohant, 24 juin 1833.PREFACE.Avez-vous lu Baruch? Peut-etre! Mais vous n'avez pas lu Kourroglou.Lecteur, que lisez-vous donc! Quoi, vous n'avez pas lu Kourroglou!Kourroglou a ete traduit du persan (car vous n'etes pas oblige, ni moinon plus, de savoir le persan), et vous ne vous en doutez pas plus queje ne m'en doutais la semaine derniere? Ah! si j'etais lecteur de monetat, je ne voudrais pas avouer que je ne connais pas Kourroglou! Envain vous m'alleguerez que Kourroglou a ete traduit du perso-turcen anglais, et que peut-etre vous ne savez pas l'anglais: c'est unemauvaise defaite. Vous devriez le savoir, et moi aussi; mais je ne lesais pas, ni vous non plus, je suppose. Pourtant je le comprends,assez pour essayer de vous faire connaitre Kourroglou, et je commence,renvoyant ceux de vous qui lisent l'anglais couramment a la traductionpremiere, qui est toujours la meilleure, ayant ete faite par un hommeverse dans les langues orientales et dans les dialectes tuka-turkman,perso-turc, zendo-persan et autres, que nous connaissons aussi... dereputation.Mais avant d'entendre cette merveilleuse et curieuse histoire, il estbon que vous sachiez que le fond en est veritable, et que le celebreKourroglou, dont vous n'aviez jamais entendu parler, eut un personnagehistorique. Le nord de la Perse et les rives de la mer Caspienne sontpleins de sa gloire, et la recit de ses exploits est aussi populaire quecelui de la guerre de Troie au temps d'Homere. Il est vrai qu'un Homerea manque a notre heros jusqu'a ce jour, et qu'il a fallu la patience,la curiosite et le genie investigateur d'un Europeen pour rassembler,resumer et coordonner les interminables fragments que les rapsodesorientaux debitent aux oreilles ravies et enflammees de leurs auditeurs.Honneur et graces soient donc rendus a M. Alexandre Chodzko, l'Homere deKourroglou. L'epopee de sa vie n'avait jamais ete ecrite, et il n'estpas bien prouve que Kourroglou lui-meme ait su ecrire; il avait tantd'autres choses a faire, le vaillant diable a quatre! boire, battre,etre un vert galant; mais ce n'est pas tout. Il avait encore le talentde chanter en improvisant; sa poesie et sa voix resonnaient de la Persea la Turquie, de Khoi a Erzeroum, et sa guitare faisait presque autantde miracles que son cimeterre.Mais qu'etait-ce donc que Kourroglou? C'etait bien plus qu'un poete,bien plus qu'un barde, bien plus qu'un lettre, bien plus qu'un pontife,bien plus qu'un roi, bien plus qu'un philosophe. Il etait ce qu'il ya de plus grand... en Perse: il etait bandit. Quand vous aurez faitconnaissance avec lui, vous verrez que ce n'est pas peu de chose; maisvous conviendrez qu'a moins d'etre Kourroglou, il ne faut pas s'enmeler.Kourroglou etait (c'est M. Alexandre Chodzko qui parle) "unTurkman-Tuka, natif du Khorassan septentrional. Il a vecu dans laseconde moitie du XVIIe siecle; il a rendu son nom illustre en pillantles caravanes sur la grande route; mais ses improvisations poetiquesl'ont fait plus grand encore. Les Turcs Iliotes, tribus errantestransplantees a differentes epoques du centre de l'Asie aux vastespaturages qui s'etendent de l'Euphrate a la Meroe, ont religieusementconserve ses chants et la memoire de ses actions. Il est leur guerriermodele et leur barde national dans toute l'etendue du terme. On montreencore aujourd'hui les ruines de la forteresse de Chamly-Bill, batiepar Kourroglou dans la delicieuse vallee de Salmas, un district de laprovince d'Aderbaidjan. Encore aujourd'hui on manque rarement de reciterdans une fete les chants d'amour de Kourroglou. Durant les querellesintestines et les combats que livrent les Iliotes, pour leurindependance, aux Persans, leurs maitres, quand les deux armees ennemiessont au moment d'engager la bataille, ils s'animent les uns les autres,et defient l'ennemi: les Perses en chantant des passages du schah-namade leur Ferdausy, les Iliotes en hurlant les chants de guerre de leurKourroglou. Sous les fenetres du palais du schah, lorsque les trompetteset les tambours du nekhara-khana (la garde d'honneur) saluent le soleillevant, les musiciens ont coutume du jouer l'air guerrier de Kourroglou,celui qui a servi de theme a ses poesies lyriques, et sur lequel ilimprovisait ordinairement."M, Chodzko etablit un parallele entre Ferdausy et Kourroglou. Il ne metpoint en balance la valeur litteraire de ces deux poetes; l'un ecrivantune magnifique epopee en langue arabe, achevant son oeuvre avec soinau milieu des delices d'une cour; l'autre improvisant au milieu desdeserts, et dans un dialecte sauvage, des strophes energiques, maisdecousues et farouches comme sa vie, son caractere et ses compagnonsd'armes. Cependant M. Chodzko s'etonne avec raison que le plus renommeet le plus populaire des deux (dans une plus vaste etendue de pays, oudu moins chez des admirateurs plus passionnes et plus nombreux), lebandit-menestrel Kourroglou, soit reste jusqu'a ce jour inconnu auxEuropeens. C'est apres un sejour de onze ans dans ces contrees, apresavoir interroge et ecoute attentivement les rapsodes et les bardes quipassent leur vie a raconter et a chanter au peuple les exploits et lespoesies de Kourroglou, qu'il est parvenu a ecrire la vie epique, et atranscrire fidelement les hymnes de ce heros barbare. Les versions lesplus exactes, les recits les plus poetiques et les plus complets, il lesa trouves, dit-il, dans la derniere classe du peuple; la ou le souvenirfanatique et l'amour enthousiaste de cette nature de faits et dece genre de poesie avaient du necessairement penetrer et se graverdavantage. La nouveaute d'un tel personnage, l'interet de ses aventures,et surtout la peinture energique dos moeurs et du caractere des tribusnomades dont Kourroglou est le type, et aux yeux desquelles il est untype ideal, ont paru assez importants aux orientalistes de Londres pourque le comite de _l'Oriental translation fund_ de la Grande-Bretagne etde l'Irlande ait fait imprimer et publier, a ses frais, les aventures deKourroglou. Cette epopee, jointe aux chants des peuples qui habitent lesrives de la mer Caspienne (chants populaires des Kalmouks, desTatars d'Astrakan, des Perso-Turks, des Turckmans, des Ghilanis, des_Highlanders_ Rudbars, des Taulishs et des Mazenderams), forment un beauvolume sous ce titre: _Specimens of the popular poetry of Persia_. "Asfound in the adventures and improvisations of Kourroglou the banditmenestrel of northern Persia: and in the songs of the people inhabitingthe shores of the Caspian sea. Orally collected and translated withphilological and historical notes, by Alexander Chodzko, esq."Cette publication n'est pas, en effet, importante au seul point de vuede l'amusement et de l'interet epique; ce n'est pas seulement un herosde l'Arioste que la Perse nous revele, c'est toute une histoire demoeurs, c'est tout un genie national que Kourroglou. C'est le nomadedans toute sa poesie plaisante et terrible, c'est le guerrier asiatiquedans toute son exageration fanfaronne, c'est le brigand de la Persedans toute sa ruse, dans toute sa ferocite et dans toute son audace.Kourroglou est cruel, ivrogne, glouton, libertin; c'est le plus grandpillard et le plus grand vantard que nous ayons jamais rencontre, memechez nous, ou ces qualites sont si fort repandues par le temps quicourt. Il est entreprenant, vindicatif, insatiable de richesses et deplaisirs, fourbe, brutal et impitoyable dans la colere. Il n'en est pasmoins l'idole de ses compagnons et de leur nombreuse posterite. Cespeccadilles ne le rendent que plus aimable. Les femmes en sont folles,et les enfants revent de lui, non comme d'un croquemitaine, mais commed'un Tancrede ou d'un Roland. Tandis que le Rustem de Ferdausy estun vrai chevalier, fidele a son prince ou prosterne devant son Dieu,Kourroglou ne connait guere d'autre dieu que lui-meme et n'est fidelequ'a son propre serment. A cet egard, il affiche une loyaute et unegenerosite qui ne sont point sans grandeur et sans danger, vu lamauvaise foi des ennemis qui le poursuivent. Une seule trahisondeshonore sa vie; mais il la pleure amerement, et le remords lui inspirele plus beau de ses chants de douleur. Un seul amour penetre jusqu'aufond de son ame, et fait de lui un etre sympathique par quelque endroit,c'est sa tendresse exaltee pour son fils adoptif, Ayvaz, le Benjamin,le Renaud du poeme. Mais le veritable heros de la vie de Kourroglou, cen'est point Kourroglou, ce n'est pas le bel Ayvaz, ce n'est pas meme lespirituel marmiton Hamza-Beg; ce n'est pas un homme, ce n'est pas unefemme: c'est un cheval, c'est la divin Kyrat, pres duquel les coursiersd'Achille et tous les palefrois renommes de la chevalerie ne sont quede pauvres poneys. Le poeme s'ouvre par la formation celeste de Kyrat,comme vous allez le voir, lecteur; car j'entreprends de vous racontertout le poeme. Mais comme M. Chodzko l'a _oralement_ transcrit, je mepermettrai d'abreger et de resumer la traduction de M. Chodzko. Quand jela citerai textuellement, j'aurai soin de l'indiquer.Le poeme est divise par chants, que M. Chodzko intitule: _Entrevues;meetings_ en anglais, _mejjliss_ en perso-turk que nous traduirons par_rencontres_. Ce sont les rapsodies que l'haleine d'un _Kourroglou-Khan_peut fournir en une seance a l'attention d'un auditoire. LesKourroglou-Khans sont comme les Schah-Namah-Khans de Ferdausy, comme lesKoran-Khans du Prophete, des bardes de profession qui, en s'accompagnantde la guitare, recitent au peuple et aux amateurs les faits, gestes,maximes et improvisations de leur heros. La memoire de ces chanteurs,dit M. Chodzko, est vraiment incroyable; a toute sommation, ils recitentd'une seule haleine, et durant des heures entieres, sans la moindrehesitation, a partir du vers qui leur est designe par les auditeurs.PREMIERE RENCONTRE[1].[Footnote 1: Ce premier chant est textuellement traduit de l'anglais.]Kourroglou etait un Turkoman de la tribu de Tuka; son veritable nometait Roushan, et celui de son pere Mirza-Serraf. Ce dernier etait auservice du sultan Murad, gouverneur d'une des provinces du Turkestan, enqualite de chef des haras de ce prince.Un jour que les cavales paissaient dans les prairies qui s'etendent lelong du Jaihoun (l'Oxus), un etalon sortit de la surface des eaux, gagnala rive, courut vers la troupe des cavales, et apres s'etre accouple adeux d'entre elles, il se replongea dans le fleuve, ou il disparutpour jamais. Cette etrange nouvelle ne fut pas plus tot rapportee aMirza-Serraf, qu'il se rendit a la prairie, et ayant fait des marquesdistinctes aux deux juments designees, il recommanda aux gardiens d'enavoir un soin particulier; puis, de retour chez lui, il consigna sur seslivres les details de l'apparition de l'etalon, et enregistra la dateprecise de cet evenement.On sait qu'une jument donne toujours naissance a son poulain etantdebout; quand le terme fut arrive, Mirza-Serraf, qui etait present aleur naissance, recut les jeunes poulains dans le pan de sa robe, afinqu'ils ne fussent point blesses par leur contact avec la terre.Il dirigea lui-meme avec le plus grand soin leur premiere educationpendant les deux annees suivantes, et surveilla les progres de leurcroissance. Malheureusement leur mauvaise mine n'etait pas propre ainspirer beaucoup d'espoir pour l'avenir. Ils paraissaient laids a lapremiere vue, et leur robe epaisse semblait etre de crin plus que depoil.Un des devoirs de la charge de Mirza-Serraf etait de visiter, a tourde role, tous les haras confies a ses soins, afin de mettre a part lesmeilleurs poulains pour les ecuries du prince. Dans cette occasion, lesdeux poulains merveilleux furent au nombre de ceux qu'il choisit. Quandle prince vint en personne visiter ses ecuries, il examina attentivementles chevaux amenes par Mirza-Serraf, et approuva tous ses choix, al'exception des deux poulains en question.Plus il les regardait, plus ils lui semblaient hideux. Il fit ameneren sa presence le chef de ses haras, et s'adressant a lui d'une voixcourroucee: "Vassal, lui dit-il qu'est-ce que cela signifie? me crois-tudonc depourvu d'instruction ou d'intelligence, ou bien es-tu devenu sivieux que tu ne puisses plus distinguer un bon cheval d'un mauvais? Quepretends-tu en m'amenant ces deux miserables haquenees?"Alors, transporte de rage, le prince ordonna que Mirza-Serraf eut lesyeux creves. Cette sentence fut immediatement executee. Un fer rouge futapplique sur le globe des yeux de l'infortune Mirza, qui fut ainsi privepour jamais de la lumiere. Aveugle et desole, il fut reconduit dans samaison. Son fils unique Roushan, jeune homme de dix-neuf ans, etudiaitalors a l'une des ecoles de la ville. Aussitot qu'il eut appris lechatiment inflige a son pere, baigne de larmes, il accourut vers lui."Ne pleure pas, mon fils, lui dit le vieillard, qui etait un des plushabiles astrologues de son siecle; j'ai examine ton horoscope, et mascience infaillible ma decouvert que tu deviendrais un heros celebre. Tuvengeras mes souffrances sur la personne de l'injuste tyran qui me les ainfligees. Va a l'instant voir le prince, et parle-lui ainsi: "Seigneur,tu as fait crever les yeux de mon pere a cause d'un poulain. Soismisericordieux, et fais-lui present de l'animal; sans cela mon pauvrepere, qui est vieux et aveugle, n'aura pas de cheval a monter pour serendre a la distribution des aumones qui se font dans ton palais."Roushan fit ainsi qu'il lui avait ete dit.Le prince, dont la colere avait eu le temps de se calmer, accorda aujeune homme la permission d'entrer dans ses ecuries et de prendre celuides deux poulains condamnes qui lui plairait le mieux.Roushan choisit celui qui etait gris, parce que son pere lui avait ditque la jument qui l'avait porte etait d'une plus noble race que l'autre.De retour a la maison avec le don du prince, Roushan recut de son perel'ordre de creuser un souterrain. "Il nous servira d'ecurie, lui ditcelui-ci. Fais-y quarante stalles, et entre chaque stalle tu ferasun reservoir pour l'eau. Par la combinaison d'un certain nombre deressorts, dont je t'enseignerai l'usage, l'orge et la paille serontdistribuees en temps convenable a notre poulain, qui mangera sa rationsans l'assistance d'un palefrenier. L'eau lui arrivera de la mememaniere en temps convenable. Tu maconneras soigneusement la porte etjusqu'aux moindres fentes de l'ecurie; car il est indispensable quenotre cheval demeure seul durant quarante jours, et que ni l'oeilde l'homme ni les rayons du soleil ne viennent le troubler dans sasolitude."Les instructions du pere furent executees par le fils avec la plusscrupuleuse fidelite. Le poulain fut introduit et enferme dans sanouvelle demeure. Il y avait deja trente-huit jours qu'il y demeurait,cache a tous les regards, lorsqu'au trente-neuvieme la patience deRoushan fut epuisee. Il s'approcha de l'ecurie, et ayant fait un trou dela grandeur de l'oeil, il commenca a regarder dans l'interieur.Le corps entier du poulain lui apparut brillant et resplendissantcomme une lampe; mais la lumiere qui en jaillissait s'affaiblitinstantanement, et puis s'eteignit comme par l'effet du simple regard deRoushan. Il eut peur, et, refermant precipitamment la petite ouverture,il retourna vers son pere, auquel il ne dit rien de ce qui etait arrive.Le lendemain, juste a l'heure ou venait d'expirer le quarantieme jourde la claustration du poulain, Mirza dit a son fils: "Le temps estaccompli, allons chercher notre cheval et commencons a le dresser."Ils furent ensemble a l'ecurie. L'aveugle commenca a tater. la robe del'animal: il promena sa main sur la tete et sur le cou, sur les jambesde devant et sur celles de derriere, comme s'il eut cherche quelquechose, et tout a coup il s'ecria: "Qu'as-tu fait, malheureux enfant? Ileut mieux valu pour moi que tu fusses mort dans ton berceau! Pas plustard qu'hier tu as laisse la lumiere tomber sur le poulain.---Tuas devine juste, mon pere; mais comment as-tu fait pour decouvrircela?--Comment j'ai fait? Ce cheval avait des plumes et des ailes quiont ete brisees par suite de ton imprudence." A ces mois le coeur deRoushan fut rempli d'amertume, et il tomba dans une profonde tristesse.Mirza lui dit alors: "Ne perds pas courage; nul cheval vivant ne pourrajamais approcher de la poussiere que souleveront les pieds de cecoursier."Ayant dit ainsi, l'aveugle enseigna a son fils a seller le poulain avecune selle de feutre, et lui prescrivit de le dresser de la manieresuivante: "Tu le feras trotter pendant les quarante premieres nuits surles rochers et dans les plaines pierreuses, et pendant les quarantenuits suivantes dans l'eau et les marecages." Quand ceci fut accompli,Mirza-Serraf mit son cheval au galop, qu'il soutint admirablement, soiten avant, soit a reculons. L'education du noble animal ayant ete ainsicompletee, il commenca a s'occuper de celle de son fils. "Monte toncheval, lui dit-il, fais-moi place derriere toi, et traversons l'Oxus."Pendant qu'ils s'amusaient ainsi, le vieillard experimente initiait sonfils a tous les stratagemes de l'art de l'equitation et du metier desarmes."C'est bien, dit-il un jour a Roushan, je suis content de toi. Mais ilnous reste encore une chose a faire. Notre prince vient quelquefoischasser sur les bords de l'Oxus; c'est la que tu l'attendras. Lapremiere fois que tu le verras venir de ton cote, revets toutes lespieces de ton armure, et, monte sur ton cheval, va hardiment a larencontre du tyran. Alors tu lui diras ces mots: "Prince injuste etcruel, contemple le cheval a cause duquel tu as fait crever les yeux demon pere, regarde bien ce qu'il est devenu, et meurs d'envie."Roushan obeit fidelement a l'ordre de son pere; la premiere fois qu'ilapercut le prince prenant le plaisir de la chasse sur les bords del'Oxus, il revetit son armure et courut droit a lui. Le prince,emerveille de la beaute peu commune du cheval, aussi bien que de lanoble apparence du cavalier, dit a son vizir: "Quel est ce jeune homme?"Roushan, invite a s'approcher du prince, ne manqua pas de lui repeterd'une voix ferme et menacante le discours que son pere lui avaitenseigne, et il ajouta: "Prince stupide, tu le crois un bon connaisseurde chevaux. Ecoute, ignorant, et apprends de moi quels sont les signesauxquels on reconnait un cheval de noble race." Cela dit, il improvisale chant suivant:_Improvisation_.--"Je viens, et je te dis: Ecoute, o prince! et apprendsa quoi se fait reconnaitre un noble cheval. Actif et alerte, vois sises naseaux s'enflent et se distendent alternativement; si ses jambes,seches et deliees, sont comme les jambes de la gazelle prete a commencersa course. Ses hanches doivent ressembler a celles du chamois; sa bouchedelicate cede a la plus legere pression de la bride, comme la bouched'un jeune chameau. Quand il mange, ses dents broient le grain comme lameule d'un moulin en mouvement, et il l'avale comme un loup affame. Sondos rappelle celui du lievre; sa criniere est douce et soyeuse; son couest eleve et majestueux comme celui du paon. Le meilleur temps pour lemonter est entre sa quatrieme et sa cinquieme annee. Sa tete est fine etpetite comme celle du grand serpent chahmaur; ses yeux sont saillantscomme deux pommes; ses dents semblent autant de diamants. La forme desa bouche doit approcher de celle du chameau male; ses membres sontfinement dessines, et plutot arrondis qu'allonges. Quand on le sort del'ecurie, il est joyeux et il se cabre. Ses yeux ressemblent a ceux del'aigle, et il marche avec l'inquiete impatience d'un loup affame. Sonventre et ses cotes remplissent exactement la sangle. Un jeune homme debonne famille prete une oreille obeissante aux lecons de ses parents;il aime son cheval et en prend le plus grand soin Il sait par coeur lagenealogie et la purete de son sang. Il essaie souvent la vigueurdes articulations de son genou; en un mot, il doit etre ce qu'etaitMirza-Serraf dans sa jeunesse."Des que le prince eut entendu cette improvisation, il dit aux gens de sasuite: "C'est la le fils de Mirza-Serraf? Hola! qu'il soit arrete!"Roushan fut immediatement entoure de tous cotes; mais, sans paraitres'en apercevoir, il parla ainsi au sultan Murad:_Improvisation_.--"Ecoutez, mon prince; il me revient en memoirequelques stances de vers agreables; permettez-moi de vous les reciter."Le prince y consentit, et ordonna a ses gardes, de ne pas touchera Roushan qu'il n'eut dit ses vers. Alors ce dernier commencal'improvisation suivante: "Mon prince a donne l'ordre de me punir; mais,par Allah! je sais comment me defendre; je m'echapperai de ses mains.En vain m'offrirais-tu tes richesses et tes faveurs comme on jette lapature a l'aigle vorace et affame, je les rejetterais toutes."Le prince l'interrompit et lui dit: "Cesse tes vaines bravades; viens,et sers-moi fidelement, autrement je te ferai mourir."Roushan chanta alors ainsi:_Improvisation_.--"Je suis appele Dieu dans ma maison: oui, je suis undieu. Je ne courberai point mon cou devant un lache comme toi. La cruchea porte l'eau assez longtemps pour toi; mais, a la fin, la cruche s'estbrisee."Le prince lui dit: "Ton pere a ete mon serviteur pendant cinquante ans.Dans un moment de colere, j'ai ordonne qu'on lui crevat les yeux. Maisqui deniera au maitre le droit de punir son esclave, afin de pouvoirensuite le combler de ses faveurs? Viens avec moi, tu apprendras am'etre agreable, et je te recompenserai." Roushan repliqua: "Tu aseteint les yeux de mon pere, et, a ce prix, tu veux me faire riche. SiDieu me donne assez de vie, je te ferai subir la peine du talion. Maisecoute!"_Improvisation_.--"C'est toi-meme qui as construit l'edifice de la ruinequand tu as prete l'oreille a des calomniateurs. Je prendrai ta vie etje renverserai ton trone."Ces paroles firent sourire le prince, et il lui demanda ironiquement:"Comment, Roushan, te sens-tu assez fort pour detruire mes villes etpour renverser mon trone?" Roushan improvisa le chant suivant:"Assez de forfanteries. Que sont a mes yeux trente, soixante, ou memecent de tes guerriers? Que sont vos rochers, vos precipices et vosdeserts sous le sabot de mon coursier? Je suis le leopard des montagneset des vallees[2]."[Footnote 2: Cette strophe est habituellement chantee par les Turcsavant qu'ils s'elancent sur l'ennemi.]Le prince reprit: "Viens plus pres de moi, ne fuis pas. Je jure parla tete des quatre premiers califes que je te ferai _sirdar_ (generalcommandant en chef) de mes troupes." Et pendant qu''il parlait ainsi,il admirait le courage du jeune homme. Roushan repliqua et dit:"Maintenant, mes chants, aussi bien que mes exploits, seront connus aumonde sous le nom de Kourroglou, le fils de l'aveugle dont tu as creveles yeux [3].[Footnote 3: _Kurr_ signifie aveugle, et _oglou_ fils.]_Improvisation_.--"Ecoute les paroles de Kourroglou. La vie m'est unfardeau. De ce jour j'abandonne ma tete aux hasards de la fortune,comme la feuille d'automne s'abandonne a l'apre souille des vents. Avecl'assistance de Dieu, j'irai en Perse pour y retablir la religion d'Ali,qui est venere dans ce pays."Il finissait a peine ces mots, que, se precipitant au milieu de la suitedu prince, il fit un horrible carnage, et le prince, a la fin convaincuque toutes les armees de la terre ne pourraient venir a bout de levaincre, ordonna a son vizir d'abandonner une poursuite dangereuse etinutile.Roushan traversa l'Oxus a la nage et se hata de rejoindre son pere surla rive opposee. "Tu m'as venge, mon fils, lui dit ce dernier, que Dieut'en recompense! Quittons maintenant cette contree: non loin d'Herat, jeconnais une oasis ou tu vas me conduire.Roushan obeit, et quand ils eurent atteint l'oasis, Mirza-Serraf tira dedessous son bras un vieux livre d'astrologie qui ne le quittait jamais,et dit: "O mon fils, cherche dans ce livre un passage qui traitede l'apparition de deux etoiles, l'une a l'orient et l'autre al'occident.--Pere, je l'ai trouve!--Bien! L'oasis ou nous sommes contient une source d'eau; quand la nuitqui precede le vendredi sera arrivee, tu veilleras avec ce livre dans lamain, en repetant continuellement la priere qui se trouve a ce passagedu livre; tes jeux devront suivre avec la plus grande vigilance les deuxetoiles jusqu'au moment ou elles se rencontreront. Alors tu verras lasurface de l'eau se couvrir d'une ecume blanche. Prends ce vase quej'ai apporte tout expres, tu y recueilleras soigneusement l'ecume et mel'apporteras sans delai."Quand la nuit designee fut venue, Roushan remplit toutes lesinstructions de Mirza-Serraf, et deja il revenait avec le vase pleinde l'ecume mysterieuse; mais elle etait si blanche, si legere etsi fraiche, que le jeune homme inexperimente ne put resister a latentation: il avala l'ecume. "J'ai accompli toutes tes prescriptions,dit-il a son pere; l'ecume cependant ne s'est pas montree sur l'eaude la source." Mirza-Serraf repondit: "L'ecume a paru sur l'eau de lasource; j'en suis certain. Confesse la verite, qu'en as-tu fait?"Roushan etait sincere; il avoua sa faute. Alors le vieillard, frappantson genou avec ses deux mains: "Qu'as-tu fait, malheureux? s'ecria-t-il.Sois maudit, et puisse ta maison tomber sur ta tete! Tu m'as ravi lebonheur de te revoir. Cette ecume etait un remede precieux et unique, uncollyre qui avait la puissance de guerir ma cecite. J'en aurais employeune portion pour moi, et je t'eusse laisse boire le reste. Mais lesdecrets du sort sont irrevocables; tu deviendras un guerrier invincibleet moi je mourrai aveugle. Tout est consomme, maintenant." Le pauvrevieillard commenca alors a dicter ses dernieres volontes. "Mes jourssont comptes, dit-il, desormais tu prendras le nom de Kourroglou, lefils de l'aveugle. Tes vers et tes actions seront attaches pour toujoursa ce surnom. Maintenant conduis-moi a Mushad, sur le dos de Kyrat[4],car c'est ainsi que tu devras nommer ton cheval."[Footnote 4: Un cheval bai brun.]Kourroglou placa son vieux pere derriere lui, et marcha vers la villesacree de Mushad, ou ils arriverent en peu de temps, grace a la vigueursurnaturelle de leur cheval. Ce fut dans cette ville qu'ils embrasserentla foi d'Ali, et, d'impies sunnites qu'ils etaient, devinrent _sheahs_et vrais croyants. Ce fut la aussi que Mirza-Serraf mourut, et voiciquelles furent ses dernieres paroles: "Aussitot que je serai mort,rends-toi dans la province d'Aderbaidjan, dont le schah de Perse estsouverain. Il voudra t'attirer a sa cour, n'y va pas, mon fils; mais nete revolte pas non plus contre lui."Il dit et il expira.DEUXIEME RENCONTRE.Nous avons traduit textuellement la premiere rencontre pour donner aulecteur une idee juste de la forme de ce recit. M. Chodzko declare danssa preface, en qualite d'etranger, qu'il n'a point pretendu faire de sa_transcription_ une oeuvre de style pour la langue anglaise. Nous nepossedons pas assez cette langue pour adresser des critiques a M.Chodzko; mais nous la lisons assez pour esperer n'avoir point faitde contre-sens, et pour nous etre assure que les rapsodies desKourroglou-Khans ne pouvaient pas nous etre transmises avec plus deconcision, de franchise et de simplicite. Nous ne savons pas non plus sile style de M. Chodzko a la veritable couleur orientale; mais on a puvoir par ce qui precede (rendu mot a mot autant que possible) que c'estune couleur nette, hardie, sans recherche, sans affectation, sans aucunecoquetterie deplacee pour chercher a flatter le gout europeen. C'etait,je crois, la vraie maniere et la seule bonne.La seconde _rencontre_ est consacree a faire rencontrer en effet,Kourroglou et le terrible bandit Daly-Hassan. Ce dernier pretend avoirle monopole du pillage et du meurtre. Il rit de pitie en voyant unennemi si jeune venir tout seul pour le defier, au milieu de quarantede ses meilleurs garnements. "Le monde entier retentit de ma gloire,s'ecrie Daly-Hassan, qui ne se pique pas de Modestie."Et le pauvre diable ose me barrer le chemin?--Miserable! lui repondKourroglou; tu ne t'es jamais battu qu'avec des agneaux: tu ne sais pasencore ce que c'est qu'un belier."Le belier est apparemment chez cette race de pasteurs le type du courageet de la force; car Kourroglou, qui n'est pas modeste non plus, secompare de preference a cet animal dans ses frequentes vanteries, etquand il a dit: "Je suis Kourroglou le belier," il a tout dit.Daly-Hassan ne se presse pas d'entamer le combat. Les bravades de sonennemi l'amusent, et il lui permet d'improviser et de chanter lesstances qui lui _viennent a l'esprit_, comme dit Kourroglou en semblableoccasion. Ces stances sont toujours belles d'energie sauvage, et lerefrain de celles-ci est un cri d'impatience, _"Ne combattrons-nous doncpas aujourd'hui?"_ En voici une qui ne manque pas de caractere:"Montre-moi un homme qui puisse tendre mon arc! Montre-moi un homme qui,_comme un belier_, vienne frapper sa tete contre mon bouclier! Je puisbroyer l'acier entre mes dents et le cracher contre le ciel. Oh! necombattrons-nous donc pas aujourd'hui?"Pendant que Kourroglou chante ses trophees, Daly-Hassan examine Kyrat,l'incomparable Kyrat, le fils de l'etalon-spectre, le coursier fidele,l'ami, le porte-bonheur de Kourroglou, et _il en devient epris_."Fais-moi present de ton cheval, dit-il, et je m'abstiendrai de verserton sang." Kourroglou repond par de nouvelles provocations, et le combats'engage. En un clin d'oeil vingt des compagnons de Daly-Hassan sont_expedies aux enfers_, les vingt autres prennent la fuite a travers ledesert. Daly-Hassan reste seul; devore de rage, il se precipite sur sonennemi; mais Kourroglou lui fait mordre la poussiere, pousse un cri_comme celui d'un aigle_, descend de cheval, et s'asseyant sur sapoitrine, tire tranquillement son khandjar pour lui couper la tete.Daly-Hassan se prend a pleurer. "Miserable batard! lui dit Kourroglou,es-tu donc celui qui depuis sept ans faisait l'effroi de ces contrees?Tu n'es qu'une femme pusillanime. _Lache! tu verses des larmes pour unecuilleree de sang!"_"Guerrier invincible, lui repond Daly-Hassan, _j'ai jure a Dieu et amoi-meme de servir fidelement l'homme qui pourrait me renverser sur ledos_. Prends-moi pour ton esclave, et dis-moi le nom de mon maitre."Kourroglou est emu de pitie. Il se leve, rengaine son poignard, et suitDaly-Hassan dans une caverne ou celui-ci le rend maitre des richessesimmenses qu'il a amassees durant les sept annees de son brigandage.A partir de ce jour, il est le serviteur et l'ami de Kourroglou. Ilsdemeurent ensemble plusieurs mois dans la caverne, et n'en sortent quepour augmenter leur tresor en detroussant les voyageurs, et pour enrolerdes bandits sous leurs ordres.Quand ils ont reussi a se composer une bande de 77 hommes, ils chargentleur butin sur des chameaux et sur des mules, et, poursuivant leurvoyage vers la province d'Aberdaidjan, ils atteignent bientot lesmontagnes de Kaflankhou, y laissent leurs hommes et s'en vont tous deuxa la decouverte pour s'assurer d'une retraite sure. Ils trouvent dansle district de Karadag une magnifique prairie ou ils s'installent avecleurs richesses et leurs compagnons. Leurs exploits repandent bientotla terreur dans le pays, et tout homme _courageux_ vient s'enroler sousleur banniere."Il traitait ses gens comme un pere, et la paie qu'il leur faisait etaitsi liberale, qu'elle pouvait remplir le creux du bouclier de chacund'eux."En peu de temps, Kourroglou se voit a la tete de 777 hommes, nombresacre qu'il n'eut depasse vraisemblablement que pour celui de 7777, s'illui eut ete possible des lors d'y atteindre.Cependant le gouverneur de la province commence a s'alarmer du voisinagede Kourroglou. Il lui depeche un envoye qui, sans fleur de rhetorique,lui parle ainsi:"Qui es-tu? Pourquoi es-tu venu ici? Si tu desires parler au souveraind'Iran, va le trouver; mais ne demeure pas ici plus longtemps. Si tu asquelque chose a me dire, je t'ecouterai afin de savoir ce que c'est."Kourroglou trouve le discours de l'ambassadeur un peu familier; mais ilse ressouvient de la defense que son pere lui a faite, en mourant, dese revolter contre le schah de Perse. Il traite donc l'envoye forthonnetement, et lui promet d'evacuer le pays sous peu de jours.Il rassemble ses hommes et leur chante ceci:"L'heure du depart est arrivee. Que quiconque veut me suivre dans leKurdistan se tienne pret! Qu'il me suive, celui dont les levres veulentboire dans la coupe de la valeur!--Qu'il me suive, celui qui veut mettreen pieces le linceul de la mort!"Les 777 brigands repondirent: "O Kourroglou, nous ne craignons pas lamort; la ou tu iras, nous irons." Ils partent; ils arrivent dans lavallee de Gazly-Gull, situee dans le voisinage de Khoi, et debutent parl'extermination et le pillage d'une caravane. Le gouverneur d'Erivan,Hussein-Ali-Khan, se met en route a la tete de quinze cents cavalierspour aller reprimer ces brigandages. "Ne craignez rien, o mes ames! omes _fous_ (_Dalcelar_)!" C'est le nom d'amitie que Kourroglou donne ases compagnons, c'est le titre glorieux que le posterite leur conserve:"Ne craignez rien, je les disperserai en moins d'une heure." Kourrogloudit, et revetu de sa cotte de mailles, arme de toutes pieces, ilattend, appuye tranquillement sur sa lance, l'envoye d'Hussein. Auxinterrogations et aux menaces de l'envoye, Kourroglou repond comme decoutume par une chanson: "Serdar, lui dit-il, j'ai l'habitude de chanterquelques vers avant de combattre.--Chante, si tu y es dispose, repond leserdar, amateur de poesie comme tous les Orientaux." Kourroglou chanteici une fort belle strophe:"Voici la verite des verites! Ecoute-la bien, mon serdar. Je suis l'angede la mort. Regarde; je suis Azrail. Mes yeux aiment la couleur du sang.Oui, je suis venu pour arracher les ames des corps; je suis le veritableAzrail. Nous verrons bientot quelles entrailles, quels cranes serontfouillee les premiers par la pointe de mon poignard. Ce jour meme,tu quitteras ce monde; me voici. Comme un veritable Azrail, je viensarracher les ames.".........................................................."Maintenant, j'enseignerai a rire a tes ennemis, et a tes amis a selamenter. Contemple en moi Azrail, l'exterminateur des ames"."Kourroglou s'elance au plus epais de la melee. Il tue tout ce qui estdigne d'etre tue, il pille tout ce qui vaut la peine d'etre pris."Kourroglou cependant ne resta pas davantage a Gazly-Gull, il vint sefixer definitivement a Chamly-Bill; sa gloire se repandit bientot dansles contrees environnantes, et de toutes parts on lui envoyait de l'oret des presents."TROISIEME RENCONTRE.Kourroglou se prit de gout pour Chamly-Bill, et y batit uneforteresse[5]. Tous ceux qui entendirent parler de lui, de sa valeur etde sa liberalite, s'empresserent de se joindre a sa bande. En peu detemps la forteresse devint une ville contenant huit mille familles. Cefut la que Kourroglou fit connaissance avec le marchand Khoya-Yakub,qu'il adopta, plus tard, pour son frere. Cet homme avait voyage danstous les pays du monde, el il amusait souvent Kourroglou par ladescription de ce qu'il avait vu.[Footnote 5: Un fort, _Kalka_ en Perse, village entoure de murs, avecdes tours et des meurtrieres dans les angles. On voit encore aujourd'huiles ruines du fort de Kourroglou a Chamly-Bill.]Le marchand Khoya-Yakub, allant un jour a la ville d'Orfah, vit unegrande foule rassemblee sur la place du marche. Il s'avanca et vit unjeune garcon, tel que le depeint le poete:"Mon coeur aime un jeune homme dont les sourcils sont bien arques. Saceinture est etroite; ses levres ressemblent a un bouton, a une rosesouriantes. Jeune homme, sacrifie ton ame a la beaute! contemple en moison esclave. Parcourez le monde entier: vous ne trouverez pas un enfantde plus belle esperance. Son nom est Ayvaz-Bally. C'est la prairie duhuitieme ciel! Son pere est boucher de son etat; le fils est une mine depierres precieuses."Khoya-Yakub demanda: "De quel jardin est cette rose? de quelle prairieest cette plante?" Quelqu'un repondit: "Son pere est boucher du pachade cette ville; Ayvaz-Bally est son nom." Le marchand pensa lors enlui-meme: "Kourroglou n'a pas d'enfants; pourquoi n'adopterait-il pas unsi beau garcon pour son fils? Mais que dois-je faire? Si, a mon retour aChamly-Bill, j'essaie de lui depeindre ce que j'ai vu, il ne me croirapas." Il trouva alors un peintre dans Orfah, et lui paya un bon prixpour faire le portrait d'Ayvaz.Apres un voyage de quelques jours, il revint a la forteresse deChamly-Bill. Il fut dit a Kourroglou que son frere Khoya-Yakub etaitrevenu. Il ordonna aussitot a ses hommes d'aller a sa rencontre, et del'amener dans la ville avec les honneurs qui lui etaient dus. Des qu'ilfut descendu de cheval, Kourroglou le baisa sur la joue, et le fitasseoir a ses cotes, tandis que Khoya-Yakub lui baisait les deux mains,comme a son superieur. "Hourra! mes enfants, du vin! cria Kourroglou;buvons en l'honneur de l'arrivee de notre frere." Et ils s'assirent, etils burent au point que Khoya-Yakub commenca a devenir gris, et sentitsa tete s'allumer. Kourroglou lui demanda d'ou il venait. Il repondit:"D'Orfah!--Tu n'as pas vu, par hasard, a Orfah, un plus beau cheval quemon Kyrat?--Je n'en ai pas vu.--Dis, as-tu vu la, des hommes plus beauxet plus braves que mes compagnons?--Je n'en ai pas vu.--As-tu vu, dismoi, une fete plus joyeuse que la mienne?--Je n'en ai pas vu.--As-tu vudes echansons plus beaux et plus richement vetus que les miens?--Frereguerrier, j'ai vu la un jeune garcon que les mains de tous vos jeunesgens ne sont pas dignes de laver. Voila que tu deviens vieux, et que tun'as pas d'enfants: pourquoi ne le prendrais-tu pas pour ton fils, afinde faire de lui, quand le temps en sera venu, un guerrier digne de teservir et de te succeder lorsque tu seras mort, aussi bien qu'un appuiet un fils tant que tu vivras?" Il commenca alors a vanter la beauted'Ayvaz et sa male physionomie. Kourroglou dit: "Eh quoi! marchand quin'es bon a rien! ne pouvais-tu depenser quelques tumans pour payer unpeintre et m'apporter sa ressemblance?" Le marchand sortit une miniaturede son habit et la tendit a Kourroglou. Kourroglou la prit; et quand ill'eut examinee, _les renes de sa volonte echapperent des mains de sapatience_, et il s'ecria: "Daly-Hassan, qu'on apprete une chaine etdes fers." Le marchand, etonne, demanda ce que signifiait un ordresemblable. "Je vais te faire enchainer, miserable!" Pour quelle raison,et quel est mon crime? Est-ce donc la recompense que tu me donnes pourt'avoir trouve un fils?--C'est pour le mensonge que tu as dit. Homme,ecoute-moi; je vais partir pour Orfah a l'instant meme; et tu attendrasmon retour, enchaine dans un cachot. Si le jeune garcon justifiereellement tes louanges, que mon nom ne soit pas Kourroglou si je necouvre pas ta tete d'une pluie d'or et ne t'exalte pas au-dessus de lavoute des cieux. Mais malheur a toi, si Ayvaz est indigne de tes eloges;car j'arracherai la racine de ton existence du sol de la vie; et tonchatiment servira d'exemple aux menteurs impudents comme toi. Tu ne doispas mentir a tes superieurs."Cela dit, il donna ordre d'enchainer le marchand par le cou et par unejambe, et de le jeter ensuite en prison."Daly-Hassan! que l'on selle Kyrat." Daly-Hassan mit lui-meme la selleet le coussin sur le cheval de son maitre, et les attacha sept fois avecla sangle. "Je pars pour Orfah, dit Kourroglou. Que personne ne de vousne se hasarde de boire de facon a s'enivrer jusqu'a ce que je sois deretour. Malheur a celui dont la demeure retentira des sons de la musiqueou du tambourin. Souvenez-vous de cette defense, ou je vous arracheraide la terre, et vous jetterai au vent, comme un chardon nuisible. Jepars seul pour chercher mon futur enfant, pour chercher Ayvaz. Jemourrai ou je reviendrai avec lui. Ecoutez ma chanson._Improvisation._--"J'adopterai pour mon fils le jeune Ayvaz-Bally.Attendez le jour d'adoption jusqu'a mon retour. Demandez-le en Turquieet en Syrie jusqu'a mon retour. Un homme brave monte l'arabe gris ou lebai, et galope tout le long du chemin, sur le cheval de bataille auxpieds legers. Tuez des veaux, egorgez des moutons, et nourrissez-vous demes troupeaux jusqu'a mon retour. _Kourroglou dit:_ le diable emportel'ennemi; les braves galopent sur des chevaux arabes: allez et buvezjusqu'a mon retour."Ayant dit cela, Kourroglou prit conge de ses freres, monta sur Kyratet marcha seul, jour et nuit, de bourgade en bourgade, vers la villed'Orfah. Il n'en etait plus qu'a un fersakh de distance, quand il sesentit une faim extreme; et, voyant un berger qui gardait son troupeausur la pente d'une colline, il se dit: "Le proverbe est bon: si tu asfaim, va au berger; si tu es las, au chamelier. Maintenant reflechissonsun peu de quelle facon j'attraperai a dejeuner." Alors il s'approcha, ets'ecria: "Que Dieu te benisse, berger! ne peux-tu me donner a dejeuner?"Le berger leva la tete; et, voyant un guerrier dont l'armure, a elleseule, aurait pu acheter son troupeau et lui-meme par-dessus le marche,il repondit: "Jeune homme, je n'ai point de mets digne de toi; maissi tu peux t'accommoder de lait de brebis, je vais t'en chercher."Kourroglou dit: "Dans ce desert une goutte de lait vaut le monde entier:vas-en chercher, et me l'apporte." Le berger etait d'une haute statureet taille carrement; il tenait dans sa main une enorme massue, dont latete etait armee de clous, de vieux fers de lance, de fers de chevauxcasses et de tout ce qu'il avait pu se procurer de tranchant; ellepesait un men et demi[6]; une courroie, passee dans un trou, lasuspendait a son poignet. Le berger leva la massue: et, a ce signal,toutes les brebis se reunirent autour de lui. Il avait aussi avec luiune ecuelle de bois que les Kurdes appellent _moudah_ et qui pouvaitcontenir trois mena de lait[7]. L'ayant rempli jusqu'aux bords, il lamit devant Kourroglou, et lui donna une grande cuiller de bois pourqu'il put manger, Kourroglou en eut a peine bu quelques cuillereesqu'il se sentit tres-faible, et dit: "Berger, n'as-tu pas une croute depain?--J'en ai, dit le berger; mais il n'est pas un fils d'homme quipuisse le manger." Kourroglou reprit: "Il porte un nom mangeable; etpour peu qu'il soit moins dur que la pierre, donne-le-moi." Le bergerdit: "C'est du pain fait d'orge et de millet; je l'ai petri pour meschiens." Kourroglou dit: "N'importe, apporte-le tel qu'il est." Leberger repliqua: "Le soleil l'a seche; il est devenu tout a fait dur etmoisi: tu te rompras les dents." Kourroglou dit: "Ne, crains rien, mongarcon, et donne-le-moi promptement." Un sac de peau etait suspendu audos du berger; il l'en ota, et le mit devant Kourroglou. Ce dernieretait si prodigieusement affame, qu'il plongea ses deux mains dans lesac, et, arrachant tout ce qui se trouvait sous sa main, le rompit enmorceaux, et le jeta dans le lait. Le berger le regardait faire; etvoyant que son hote, qui avait deja prepare de la nourriture pour quinzepersonnes n'interrompait pas sa besogne, il se dit a lui-meme: "La faiml'a rendu fou; car assurement nul fils d'Adam ne pourrait avaler toutcela; quand il aura mange cinq ou six cuillerees, il jettera le reste;avec ce qu'il a apprete pour lui, je pourrais nourrir une semaineentiere, toute la meute de chiens qui gardent mon troupeau." Pendant cetemps, Kourroglou emiettait le pain, et en remplissait l'ecuelle. A lafin, enfoncant la cuiller, qui resta, sans remuer, dans la positionverticale, il leva les yeux, et vit le berger qui etait debout, encontemplation devant lui. Il lui dit: "Assieds-toi, berger, et mangeonsensemble." Le berger repliqua: "Beg, tu as prepare toi-meme le repas,mange-le tout seul, car je ne puis t'aider."[Footnote 6: Environ vingt-deux livres anglaises.][Footnote 7: Men, en turc _balma_, poids employe commumnement en Perse.]Alors, Kourroglou prit la cuiller et ce mit a l'oeuvre; ses enormeset rudes moustaches genaient le passage; et le pain lui sortait de labouche tandis que le lait coulait dans sa poitrine. Kourroglou, encolere, jeta la cuiller, et relevant ses moustaches qui allaientpar-dela ses oreilles, il ouvrit une bouche semblable a l'entree d'unecaverne, et, prenant l'ecuelle de ses deux mains, il avala le contenujusqu'a la derniere goutte. Le berger le regardait avec stupeur, sidisait en lui-meme: Par le saint nom d'Allah! ce ne peut etre la unhomme, car aucun etre humain ne pourrait avaler une telle quantite denourriture. Encore une fois, je le repete, voyons, au nom d'Allah!ce qui va arriver. S'il s'enfuit maintenant, ce sera la vampire dudesert[8], ou Satan lui-meme; s'il reste, c'est un fils des hommes. Ondit que la famine incarnee est arrivee sur la terre; c'est la surementla famine, il vient de manger tout le lait de mes brebis; mais au boutd'une heure, il aura faim de nouveau, et alors il me devorera moi-meme."Kourroglou pensait en lui-meme: "Comment vais-je faire pour me rendre aOrfah et voir Ayvaz? Si je me montre sous ce costume, et monte sur cecheval, mon nom et ma gloire sont trop bien connus en tous pays pourque je ne sois pas decouvert. Prenons plutot les habits du berger, etentrons ainsi dans la ville." Il dit donc au berger: "Viens la, etfaisons l'echange de nos habits" Le berger se mit a rire et lui dit:"Pourquoi me railler ainsi sur ma pauvrete? Le chale seul qui est sur tatete, ou celui qui entoure tes reins, ou bien encore le poignard qui estpasse dedans, seraient chacun suffisant pour racheter mon sang[9] et montroupeau avec. Pourquoi te moquer ainsi de moi?" Cela dit, il crachadans la paume de ses mains, saisit sa massue, et, la brandissant d'unefacon menacante, il dit a Kourroglou: "Toi, si confiant dans la largeurde tes epaules, regarde aussi la largeur de mon cou." Kourroglou souritet lui dit "Berger, je te jure devant Dieu que je ne me ris pas de toi;il y a dans cette ville un marchand qui me doit quinze cents tumans[10].Si je parais devant lui sur ce cheval et dans ce costume, ilm'echappera. Je suis venu pour une raison importante; faisons vite notreechange. Si je reviens, je te rendrai tes habits et reprendrai lesmiens; si je ne reviens pas, tu pourras conduire ce cheval au bazaret le vendre. Son prix est de deux mille tumans; profites-en, et nem'oublie pas dans tes prieres. Tu garderas aussi les autres choses quim'appartiennent." Le berger dit: "A coup sur cet homme est fou; jene puis expliquer autrement tout ce que j'entends. Allons, Beg,deshabille-toi." Kourroglou detacha sa ceinture et ota tous ses habits.Le berger en lit autant de son cote, et mit les vetements de Kourroglou,auquel il donna son manteau de feutre grossier. Kourroglou le jeta surses epaules, et ayant mis aussi le bonnet de feutre du berger, il luidit: "Maintenant donne-moi ta massue;" car il voyait qu'en cas de besoinelle pourrait lui etre aussi utile qu'un sabre. La prenant a sa main, ildit: "Berger! ton ame et l'ame de mon cheval.[11]"[Footnote 8: _Le fantome du desert_, "Guli-Beiaban," le vampire bienconnu des contes orientaux.][Footnote 9: _Racheter mon sang_. Allusion au "jus tallionis" du Coran.Le meurtrier doit payer les parents de la victime avec sa vie ou avec del'argent.][Footnote 10: Le tuman est une monnaie perse qui vaut environ douzefrancs.][Footnote 11: Phrase proverbiale tres usitee chez les Persans, ellesignifie: Prends soin de mon cheval comme tu voudrais qu'ont prit soinde toi-meme.]Le berger repondit: "Je jure par la foi de Dieu! Que ton coeur soit enpaix; tu peux te fier a moi." Et il disait en lui-meme: "Dieu veuilleque cet homme ne revienne jamais; alors adieu la pauvrete; le cheval etles vetements me suffiront aussi longtemps que je vivrai."Kourroglou prit conge du berger, et continua son voyage a pied; lemanteau du berger etait sur ses epaules, la massue dans sa main, Ilapercut bientot la ville d'Orfah, et marcha jusqu'aux portes. Ayantprononce le mot Bismillah (au nom de Dieu), il entra, et il passait dansune rue, quand il vit un Turc portant un okha de viande. Il la regardaitavec amour, priant et soupirant en meme temps. Kourroglou lui demanda enlangue turque: "Quelle viande portes-tu la, que tu la convoites ainsi,et sembles soupirer apres?" Le Turc repondit: "Es-tu donc etranger,seigneur, ou viens-tu de quelque contree eloignee?" Kourroglou dit:"Oui, je viens de loin." Le Turc lui dit alors: "Ne sais-tu pas que dansles autres pays le pain est cher, tandis que dans celui-ci, c'est laviande qui est chere? J'ai une personne malade chez moi, a laquelle lemedecin a prescrit la viande; je vais chaque jour au bazar, mais jeregarde en vain, je ne puis en trouver; aujourd'hui, enfin, j'ai trouvede la viande dans la boutique d'Ayvaz, fils d'Ibrahim le boucher; j'aiete oblige de payer un okha deux piastres, et c'est la ce qui me faitsoupirer." Kourroglou demanda: "Se peut-il que la viande soit aussichere?--Oui, en verite, dit le Turc, deux piastres pour un okha, c'estenormement cher." Kourroglou dit en lui-meme: "Bonnes nouvelles pour monberger! Attends seulement un peu, maudit; aujourd'hui meme je vendraites moutons." De la Kourroglou s'en fut vers la boutique d'Ayvaz, devantlaquelle il apercut une foule de gens, meles ensemble _comme les plisd'un manteau froisse_: les hommes venaient la pour acheter de la viande,les femmes pour admirer la beaute d'Ayvaz. Kourroglou desireux de levoir aussi, regardait par-dessus les epaules de ceux qui etaient devantlui. Les Turcs, le jugeant d'apres son costume, le prirent pour unberger et commencerent a le frapper sur la tete. Alors Kourroglou sebaissa dans l'intention de regarder a travers leurs jambes, mais ils'exposa ainsi a de plus graves insultes. "Je ne puis dompter ces Turcsgrossiers, dit-il; comment puis-je esperer d'enlever Ayvaz?" Il se mit acoudoyer de droite et de gauche, et, crachant dans ses mains, il leva samassue en l'air, dans l'intention de se frayer un passage, en poussantet frappant coup sur coup. Celui qui eut la tete frappee eut le cranebrise; celui qui recut le coup sur la jambe eut la jambe cassee; celuiqui le recut sur les epaules resta sur la place.[Illustration: Il commenca a regarder dans l'interieur. (Page 3.)]De cette maniere il chassa tout le monde de la boutique d'Ayvaz, quandil l'apercut assis et tenant tristement sa tete dans sa main. Kourrogloudit dans son coeur: "Un vrai looty [l2] possede six tours; cinqd'adresse et un de force. Je ne crois pas pouvoir effrayer cet enfant."Il s'approcha alors d'Ayvaz, mit la main dans sa poche, et, prenant unepiastre, il la jeta devant Ayvaz en lui disant: "Frere, pese-moi un okhade viande, et rends-moi le reste en monnaie de cuivre. Seulementsois prompt, mes compagnons sont partis, et il faut que je coure lesrejoindre." Ayvaz se dit: "Voila une bonne pratique pour moi; je vendsun okha de viande deux francs, il ne m'en donne qu'un, et me demande sonreste en monnaie, et cela promptement, parce que, dit-il, ses amis sontpartis." Ayvaz etait orgueilleux a cause de sa beaute, et il dit avecaigreur: "Viens ici, approche-toi plus pres, maitre niais? Que veux-tudire?" Kourroglou s'approcha d'Ayvaz, et celui-ci ayant plie un deses doigts, lui donna un bon coup sur la joue avec les quatre autres.Kourroglou dit: "Jeune espiegle, pourquoi me frappes-tu?" Mais il etaitjoyeux dans son coeur, et il ne ressentait aucune colere de cette preuvede courage. Ayvaz repartit: "Drole, tu veux deprecier ma marchandise; enpresence de tant de pratiques, tu veux acheter un okha de viande pourun sou, et avoir encore du retour, tandis que je vends un okha deuxlivres." Kourroglou dit: "Tu es un enfant; ce n'est pas pour acheter dela viande mais pour en vendre, que je suis venu ici.--Que veux-tu dire,demanda Ayvaz?--Sot que tu es, repliqua Kourroglou, j'ai neuf centsmoutons a vendre, et je venais ici pour connaitre le prix reel de laviande, savoir si elle est chere ou bon marche." On dit, avec verite,que la raison abandonne la tete d'un boucher quand il entend le belementd'un troupeau. Ayvaz n'eut pas plus tot entendu parler de neuf centsmoutons, qu'il dit: "_Mon oncle_, je ne savais pas que tu etais unmaitre berger; j'ai ete grossier dans mon langage; tu es en droit de mecouper la langue. Je t'ai frappe, coupe-moi la main, pardonne seulementma faute."[Footnote 12: _Looty_, nom fameux en Perse. Il tient le milieu entre lebrave venitien et l'aventurier francais.][Illustration: A la fin enfoncant la cuiller... (Page 7.)]Kourroglou fit l'improvisation suivante:_Improvisation_.--"Tu frapperas l'ennemi arme, fut-il enveloppe dans unfeuillet du Coran! Mon futur enfant! lumiere de mes yeux! je ne me fachepas de semblables bagatelles." Ayvaz dit alors:--"Pour l'amour de Dieu!mon cher seigneur, que personne ne sache que tu as amene neuf centsmoutons. Notre ville a cinquante bouchers; ils vont tous te persecuter,et tu seras oblige de diviser ton troupeau entre eux tous; de sortequ'il n'y en aura pas plus de vingt pour ma part. Tu feras bien mieuxd'attendre ici et de t'asseoir, tandis que je vais aller chercher monpere. Nous acheterons a nous seuls tout ton troupeau, et nous seulste donnerons l'argent." Kourroglou repondit: "Va donc, je t'attendraiici.--Reste, dit Ayvaz. Tu vois ici douze quartiers de viande; s'ilvient quelques pratiques, tu leur vendras un okha deux piastres si ellesne veulent pas attendre que je sois revenu pour fixer le prix moi-meme."Kourroglou repliqua: "Va, et repose-toi sur moi; j'ai ete boucherdix-sept ans, et je connais mon etat; je vendrai bien a ta place." Ayvazlaissa la boutique a la garde de Kourroglou, et courut chercher sonpere. Bientot apres, un Turc, qui venait pour acheter de la viande, vitKourroglou, et pensa en lui-meme: "Comment acheter d'un pareil monstre!Je suis vraiment effraye de lui." Ainsi ruminant, il allait de long enlarge.Kourroglou le vit et lui dit: "Tu vas et viens comme si tu etais malade;de quoi as-tu besoin?" Le Turc prit une piastre dans sa poche, etdemanda un demi-okha de viande. Kourroglou lui dit de mettre l'argentsur l'etal et d'entrer dans la boutique. Ayant choisi une tranche de lameilleure viande: "Prends-la toute!" lui dit-il. Le Turc, pensant qu'ily avait quelque tricherie la-dessous, ou bien qu'on voulait se moquerde lui, repondit: "Tout ce que j'ai a recevoir, c'est un demi-okha demouton, et je n'en prendrai pas davantage." Kourroglou leva sa massuesur lui, et s'ecria: "Es-tu sourd ou stupide? Je te dis de prendretout." Le Turc dit dans son ame: "Il faut toujours profiter del'occasion; je vais essayer de prendre tout. S'il ne me dit rien, ilaura evidemment perdu le sens; si c'est le contraire, je jetteraila viande par terre, et je me sauverai." Il entra dans la boutiquelentement, et avec timidite prit la viande, la mit sur son epaule,ayant, pendant tout ce temps les yeux fixes sur Kourroglou; ensuiteil quitta la boutique et commenca a courir, et, tout en fuyant, ilregardait souvent derriere lui; mais personne ne le suivait. Il avaittoujours quelque apprehension, et il courait aussi fort que la vitessede ses jambes le lui permettait. Il n'etait pas loin de sa maison quandil rencontra quelques amis, qui lui demanderent la raison de cette hate."Oh! puisse votre maison ne tomber jamais en ruine! Un fou est assisdans la boutique d'Ayvaz; pour une piastre, il m'a donne toute uneepaule de mouton; quel beau trafic! Il y a encore onze quartiers dansla boutique; allez vite, et il vous les donnera surement." Pendant queKourroglou vendait ainsi toute la viande d'Ayvaz pour douze piastres, cedernier arrivait a la maison de son pere transporte de joie, et il dit:"Il est venu a notre boutique un berger qui a neuf cents moutons; jel'ai retenu, et nous acheterons son troupeau." Son pere, Mir-Ibrahim,le boucher, se rendit promptement a la boutique, et des qu'il vitKourroglou, il lui jeta ses bras autour du cou, et l'accueillit avec degrands embrassements, l'appelant beg, et ami, et frere en memetemps. Kourroglou pensa en son coeur: "Je t'entends, coquin, tu veuxm'attraper." Mir-Ibrahim dit: "Beg, votre nom a echappe de ma memoire;tout ce que je sais, c'est que vous aviez coutume de m'honorer de votrepresence quand vous nous ameniez des moutons. Il y a longtemps que nousne nous sommes vus; mes yeux vous cherchaient et vous desiraient."Kourroglou pensait dans son coeur: "Fripon! tu achetes le pain duboulanger, et puis tu le lui revends ensuite[13]." Et alors il dit: "Monnom est Roushan." Il ne disait pas un mensonge, car tel etait vraimentson nom. Le boucher sur cela commenca a se plaindre: "Comment! nousaviez-vous oublie? et pourquoi etre reste si longtemps sans voir votreami et votre frere?" Kourroglou repondit: "Les moutons que j'avaiscoutume d'amener ici venaient tous de la Perse; maintenant Kourrogloudemeure sur les frontieres, a Chamly-Bill. La crainte de ce voleur m'aretenu; mais, grace a Dieu! Kourroglou etant mort, je te fourniraidesormais autant de moutons que tu peux desirer." Mir-Ibrahim, leboucher, demanda: "Est-il donc vrai que Kourroglou soit mort?--Mort etenterre! J'ai moi-meme assiste a ses funerailles." Le boucher dit: "Dieusoit loue! car vous saurez que notre pacha, ayant entendu parler dece bandit, a defendu a mon Ayvaz de sortir de la ville, de peur queKourroglou ne l'enleve et ne le couvre d'infamie. Depuis sept ans, Ayvazn'est jamais sorti de la forteresse." Kourroglou disait en lui-meme:"Voyez cette sale tete; il m'a enterre vivant, mais je l'aurai bientotmoi-meme mis au tombeau; de sorte que chacun se moquera de lui jusqu'ala fin du monde."[Footnote 13: expression proverbiale pour dire: tu mens, tu m'astrompe.]Ayvaz, voyant qu'il ne restait plus de viande dans la boutique, crutd'abord qu'elle avait ete vendue; mais quand il regarda dans la bourse,il n'y trouva que douze piastres, et dit: "Berger, puisse ta maisons'ecrouler!" et alors il se mit a pleurer. Mir-Ibrahim lui demanda lacause de ses larmes; et lui dit: "Pere, j'ai confie a Roushan douzequartiers de viande, et il les a vendus une piastre la piece."Kourroglou repondit: "J'avais entendu dire que la corporation desbouchers etait renommee pour son avarice sordide, je vois que cela estexact. A chacun des douze amis que j'ai dans la ville, j'ai envoye unmorceau de viande. Quoi qu'il en soit, vous ne perdrez rien. Douzequartiers font six moutons; quand tu viendras acheter mon petittroupeau, tu pourras en prendre douze gratis." Quand Mir-Ibrahimentendit ces paroles, il frappa Ayvaz au visage. "Retiens ta langue,imbecile, dit-il, et _ne mange plus de bouc_. Ton oncle Roushan[14] saitce que c'est que d'etre un homme; il nous donnera quatorze moutons."Kourroglou vit qu'il avait perdu deux moutons de plus, et dit enlui-meme: "Ta bouche est prete, ton gosier est ouvert, il ne manque quela poire pour jeter dedans; mais la poire?" Mir-Ibrahim dit: "Allons,Roushan Beg, levons-nous, et allons a la maison; nous appreteronsl'argent, et reglerons nos comptes." Ayvaz ferma la boutique, et ilss'en allerent tous trois a la maison.[Footnote 14: Cher oncle, est une expression affectueuse que l'onemploie avec les personnes agees.]Mir-Ibrahim pria Kourroglou de rester avec Ayvaz pendant qu'il iraitchercher l'argent. Quand ils se trouverent seuls, Ayvaz s'assit sur unsiege plus eleve que Kourroglou; Ayvaz se leva et prit dans une nicheune bouteille et un verre qu'il placa devant lui, et alors, relevantses manches jusqu'au coude, il remplit son gobelet de vin et le vida.Kourroglou n'avait pas bu de vin depuis quelque temps; son coeur battaitavec violence; il contemplait tendrement l'heureux buveur, et se lechaitles levres. Ayvaz dit: "Roushan, mon oncle, pourquoi leches-tu ainsi teslevres?" Kourroglou repliqua: "Que je devienne ton esclave! O phenix duparadis! quelle est cette liqueur rouge que tu bois?" Ayvaz dit: "N'enas-tu encore jamais vu, mon oncle? Cela s'appelle du vin." Kourrogloureprit: "Mon fils, mon petit-fils, remplis-en un verre pour moi, etlaisse-moi le boire." Ayvaz dit alors: "Ce breuvage a cette mauvaisequalite, qu'il rend fous ceux qui en boivent.--Comment cela?" Ayvazrepliqua: "Donnez-en seulement une once a un bouc, et aussitot ilaiguisera ses cornes et se battra contre un loup; donnez-en a unpoisson, et il chargera un vaisseau de marchandises, et naviguera leportant sur son dos, pour trafiquer sur la mer Caspienne. Si tu en bois,tu deviendras fou et courras au bazar, proclamant tout haut que tu asamene neuf cents moutons. Les bouchers tomberont alors sur toi, et teles prendront de force." Kourroglou dit: "Ayvaz, puisse-je devenirla victime de tes yeux! J'avais coutume d'en boire beaucoup; nous enrecoltons en grande abondance." Ayvaz lui dit: "Comment le fait-on dansvotre pays?--Dans notre pays, on cueille les grappes et on les pressejusqu'a ce que le jus en soit bien exprime; alors on en remplit un vaseque l'on met sur le feu. Il bout et rebout jusqu'a ce qu'il soit reduitd'un tiers, et que la quatrieme partie demeure; alors nous jetons dedansdu pain coupe en morceaux, et nous le mangeons avec nos doigts." Ayvazdit: "Puisses-tu mourir, oncle, tu m'as compris merveilleusement! lachose dont tu parles s'appelle _Dushab_[15].--Comment? qu'est-ce donc,alors, que tu bois ainsi, mon enfant?--C'est du vin.--Bien, bien, je levois a present; nous en avons en abondance dans notre pays.--Comment lefaites-vous dans votre pays, mon oncle?--Nous prenons de la creme, quenous mettons dans un sac de cuir, et puis nous le secouons jusqu'a ceque le beurre paraisse a la surface. On met le beurre dans le pilon, etl'on boit ce qui reste.--Puisses-tu mourir, oncle! ceci est le abdough(lait de beurre).--S'il en est ainsi, pour l'amour de Dieu! laisse-moi ygouter.--J'ai peur, mon oncle, que tu ne deviennes fou quand tu en aurasbu."[Footnote 15: _Dushab_, pate sucree preparee de la maniere ici decrite,dont on fait communement usage dans l'Orient au lieu de confitures ou desucre.]Kourroglou reitera sa demande, jusqu'a ce qu'enfin Ayvaz, touche depitie, consentit a lui en donner un verre. "O Dieu! s'ecria-t-il,maintenant je mourrai heureux, car Ayvaz m'a offert a boire de sespropres mains!" Il vida le verre, et, comme il n'avait mouille qu'unede ses moustaches, il dit: "Donne-m'en un autre verre, pour l'autremoustache." Il continua ainsi de boire et eut bientot vide la bouteillejusqu'a la derniere goutte. Ayvaz dit alors d'une voix irritee:"N'oublie pas que ce n'est pas du lait de beurre: tu sentiras bientot tatete s'appesantir." Kourroglou dit: "Mon petit oiseau de paradis! tu nepenses a personne qu'a toi! regarde-moi aussi." Cela dit, il se leva,et, s'apercevant qu'il y avait encore six bouteilles d'eau-de-vie dansla niche, il les prit l'une apres l'autre, et les vida jusqu'a laderniere goutte. Ayvaz s'ecriait: "Ceci n'est pas du vin, mais del'eau-de-vie, rustre; pourquoi en as-tu bu plus d'une!" Kourroglou dit:"O perroquet du paradis! elles se meleront dans mon ventre." Ayvaz etaitfache et se disait: "Il est ivre, il va bientot tomber endormi; alors,comment acheterons-nous ses moutons?" Kourroglou prit un siege, et,regardant Ayvaz que le vin incommodait un peu, il prit une guitare etcommencant a jouer, dit: "Ayvaz, que je sois ton esclave! laisse-moitirer quelques sons de la guitare!--Quoi! sais-tu donc en jouer, oncle?"Kourroglou dit: "Quand j'etais un enfant, un simple petit berger, monpere fit une petite guitare pour moi, avec un morceau de cedre; il y mitdes cordes faites avec les crins d'une queue de cheval, et j'aiappris dessus a jouer un peu." Ayvaz lui donna la guitare: Kourrogloul'accorda, et elle resonnait sous ses doigts comme un rossignol.L'enfant emerveille ecoutait avec ravissement. A la fin, reprenantson sang-froid, il demanda: "Oncle, peux-tu chanter aussi bien quetu joues?--Je vais l'essayer et chanter, si tu me le permets. Quepouvons-nous faire de mieux?... Nous sommes tous deux gris; si jene chante pas ici, ou chanterais-je donc?" Cela dit, il chantal'improvisation suivante:_Improvisation_.--"Remplissons nos verres, et buvons, buvons, fils duboucher! Mais il ne faut pas repeter mes paroles. La rosee est descenduesur les joues de la rose[16]. Tu as vide la coupe, tu es gris, memeivre-mort, tu es ivre, ivre-mort, toi, aujourd'hui fils du boucher, maisqui seras bientot le mien."[Footnote 16: La sueur a couvert ta figure.]Quand Ayvaz eut entendu ces vers, il demanda:"Oncle, as-tu jamais vu Kourroglou!"Kourroglou fit l'improvisation suivante:_Improvisation_.--Les roses du jardin sont en pleine floraison; lesrossignols amoureux chantent, les vallees de Chamly-Bill sont obscurciespar de nombreuses tentes[17]. C'est la qu'est ma demeure. O fils duboucher!..."[Footnote 17: Dans le texte _churdug_, sorte de tente avec quatrepiquets et une couverture d'etoffe de laine noire.]Ici Kourroglou s'arreta et se dit: "Si je terminais cette chanson par lenom de Kourroglou, le pauvre enfant mourrait de frayeur, restons encoreberger un peu de temps." Il chanta l'improvisation suivante:_Improvisation_.--"Dois-je le confesser? Non, je suis berger. La viedes etres crees doit avoir une fin. Quand je tire de l'arc, ma flechetraverse le roc, o fils du boucher!"Comme il disait ces mots, le pere d'Ayvaz, Mir-Ibrahim, entra dans lachambre avec l'argent destine a l'achat des moutons et dit: "Leve-toi,Roushan-Beg, et allons ou est le troupeau, afin de terminer notremarche."Kourroglou, voyant qu'Ayvaz ne bougeait pas, dit: "Mir-Ibrahim, l'enfantne viendra-t-il pas avec nous?--Il faut qu'il reste a la maison;le pacha lui a defendu de quitter la ville ainsi que je te l'aidit.--N'as-tu pas honte d'avoir peur du cadavre de Kourroglou? Vouscroyez le premier diseur de bonne aventure, pourquoi ne me croiriez-vouspas? Je te repete que Kourroglou est mort depuis plus d'un mois.Maintenant, sois franc! ce n'est pas Kourroglou que tu crains; mais tuas peur que je te force a etre reconnaissant, quand j'aurai fait don aAyvaz de trente moutons."Lorsque le boucher eut entendu qu'il s'agissait encore d'un presentde trente moutons, il perdit la tete. Il donna a Ayvaz un vigoureuxsoufflet sur la face, et s'ecria: "Leve-toi, niais, et fais un grandsalut a Roushan-Beg! c'est un homme liberal, c'est un grand homme, et saparole est une parole." Ayvaz, qui etait excite par le vin qu'il avaitbu, non moins que tout ce qu'il venait de voir et d'entendre, sentit unfrisson de terreur dans tout son corps, et il pensa dans son coeur: "Cethomme doit etre Kourroglou lui-meme ou quelqu'un de sa bande." Il pritsa guitare et dit: "Pere, laisse-moi chanter une chanson et je vousaccompagnerai ensuite."_Improvisation_.--"Pere, ne confonds pas mon entendement! un homme commelui ne peut etre un berger. Tu n'as qu'un fils, songes-y! Ne l'emmenepas. Un berger ne doit pas avoir cet air-la. J'ai compare ses parolesavec ses actions; c'est un fou etrange. Son amitie et sa haine ne durentqu'un moment. Ce doit etre Kourroglou lui-meme ou Daly-Hassen: _cethomme ne ressemble certainement pas a ton berger_."Kourroglou, entendant cela, sortit et pensa: "Cet enfant est penetrant;c'est le fils qu'il me fallait." Ayvaz continuait ainsi:_Improvisation_--Pere, ses marchands trafiquent dans les quatre partiesdu monde. Mille serviteurs des deux sexes vivent a ses depens. Il n'aimeaucun compte, mais distribue liberalement ses dons par cinq et parquinze. Crois-moi, un berger n'a pas cet air-la."Mir-Ibrahim dit: "Que faut-il faire, mon fils? Comment aurons-nous lesneuf cents moutons?" Ayvaz continua et chanta:_Improvisation_.--"Renvoyez-le; envoyez-le ou nul oeil ne pourra levoir. Que pas un hote, pas un voisin ne s'apercoive de sa venue. Qu'onne le voie pas meme dans le sommeil! un homme de cette apparence ne peutetre, croyez-moi, ne peut etre un berger. Le nom d'Ayvaz est attachea cette chanson. Un signe, en forme de croix, a deja ete brule sur mapoitrine. Je sais, entendez bien, ce qui va tomber sur ma tete."Pere, Ayvaz ne sera pas ton fils plus longtemps!"Kourroglou, voyant qu'Ayvaz avait devine ce qu'il etait, se penchadoucement vers lui, et lui dit a l'oreille:"Mechant enfant! pourquoi ne veux-tu pas venir avec moi voir letroupeau? Je te montrerai quatre belles cages attachees au dos d'unjeune ane; chacune d'elles contient quantite d'alouettes, de cailles,de perdrix aux jambes rouges, de rossignols, et une foule d'oiseauxchanteurs. Aussitot que nous serons arrives, je t'en ferai present,ainsi que des quatre cages. Tu les pendras dans ta boutique, ou ilschanteront et gazouilleront sans fin, et tandis que tu ecouteras leurramage, tu seras rejoui."Ayvaz alors pleura et dit: "Je ne puis m'en defendre, viens, pere,allons.--Oui, allons, mon enfant, notre ami Roushan-Beg empechera bienque tu sois arrete aux portes de la ville. Nous allons aussi prendre unesclave avec nous."Ainsi, apres avoir pris l'argent pour payer les moutons, Ayvaz,Kourroglou, Mir-Ibrahim et l'esclave se mirent en route. A un fersakh dedistance d'Orfah, ils arriverent a la montagne dont il a ete parle, surlaquelle le berger faisait paitre ses moutons. Quand le boucher apercutde loin le troupeau, il fut rejoui dans son coeur et dit: "Est-ce la tontroupeau, Roushan-Beg?--Ce l'est.--Commencons donc notre marche. Nousconviendrons d'abord de prix et nous examinerons ensuite combien il ya de moutons gras et en bon etat; combien de maigres etd'estropies.--Qu'il en soit ainsi! Fais comme il te plaira.--Combienas-tu de moutons?--Je t'ai dit ce matin que j'en avais neufcents!--Combien de maigres et combien de gras?--Je n'ai jamais de betailmaigre, male ou femelle; tous mes moutons sont gras et en bon etat.Aucun d'eux n'a plus de deux ans, et les brebis n'ont pas encoreagnele.--Bien, as-tu achete ces moutons ou les as-tu eleves?--Un menteurest pire qu'un chien, et je te dirai la verite: j'en ai achete lamoitie, et j'ai eleve moi-meme l'autre moitie.--Combien veux-tu lesvendre la piece?--Je veux les vendre en bloc.--A quel prix?--Maudit soitcelui qui ment. Je te dirai la simple verite. Je les ai achetes cinqpiastres chacun, et tu les auras pour six. Il faut bien que j'aie aumoins une piastre de profit dans le marche. Je ne desire pas en avoirdavantage avec toi."Pendant qu'ils marchandaient ainsi, l'oreille d'Ayvaz suivait chaqueparole qu'ils prononcaient. Il dit tout bas, a son pere: "Je lui ai faitboire du vin, il ne sait pas ce qu'il dit. On ne peut pas acheter unmouton moins de cinq tumans. Comptez l'argent sans delai, pere, etlorsqu'il l'aura recu, il ne pourra plus se retracter, quand meme ilrecouvrerait la raison."Mir-Ibrahim ouvrit le sac ou etait l'argent, qu'il compta et versaensuite dans le pan de la robe de Kourroglou. Ce dernier, voyant queplus de la moitie etait deja payee et que le compte avancait rapidement,dit dans son coeur: "Comment me debarrasserai-je de ce fripon de Turc?"Il possedait une force de poignet si extraordinaire, qu'il pouvaitserrer entre ses doigts une piece de monnaie assez fort pour en effacerl'empreinte. Ayant ainsi efface une piastre, il la jeta avec coleredevant le boucher et s'ecria: "Ceci est de la fausse monnaie." Maisla ruse n'avait pas echappe a l'oeil percant d'Ayvaz, qui dit:"Roushan-Beg, nous ne sommes pas riches; nous avons emprunte la moitiede cet argent; pourquoi l'alteres-tu mechamment?" Kourroglou repliqua:"Ayvaz, mon enfant! je n'ai ni marteau ni enclume avec moi. Les coquinsd'ouvriers de la monnaie ont oublie de frapper les chiffres du sultansur la piastre; et il faudra que je perde dessus." En disant ces mots,il se leva, jeta tout l'argent parterre, et dit d'une voix irritee: "Ily a cent bouchers dans Orfah; je leur vendrai une portion des moutons,et je vous vendrai l'autre." Et il s'eloigna. Les prieres du boucherfurent inutiles, et Kourroglou etait sur le point de partir, lorsqueMir-Ibrahim, au desespoir, dit a son fils: "Puisses-tu mourir jeune[18],Ayvaz; va, cours apres lui, et prie-le de venir terminer le marche;peut-etre t'ecoutera-t-il."[Footnote 18: "Mourir dans ton jeune age", _djeuen merg skeyi_, et aussi_merghi tu_ "tue la mort", sont deux etranges expressions de tendresseemployees par les Perses quand ils veulent obtenir une faveur dequelqu'un ou le flatter.]Ayvaz eut rejoint Kourroglou en un moment, et, le prenant par les mains,il le supplia, en disant: "Je t'en conjure, mon oncle, ne sois pasfache, et reviens." Kourroglou, faisant semblant de s'adoucir, revint,et s'assit a sa premiere place. Quand l'argent fut tout compte,on s'apercut qu'il manquait encore trente tumans. Le boucher dit:"Roushan-Beg, laisse le berger amener ici les moutons, nous lesconduirons a la ville, ou je lui paierai le reste de la somme. Tudormiras dans ma maison, et tu partiras demain matin." Kourroglourepliqua: "Je n'irai pas a Orfah, car j'ai entendu dire que ceux quiy passent la nuit avec de l'argent sont assassines. Il faut que tu mepayes ici meme.--Je ne suis pas un voleur, Roushan-Beg; cependant jeferai comme tu l'ordonnes. Reste ici avec Ayvaz; et toi, mon enfant,sois gai et amuse notre oncle par ta conversation, pendant que jecourrai a la ville chercher le reste de l'argent."Ainsi le boucher sans cervelle laissa son fils entre les mains deKourroglou, et, enfourchant sa maigre rosse il partit pour Orfah.Kourroglou, sous pretexte d'aller chercher les quatre cages qu'ilavait promises a Ayvaz, laissa ce dernier avec l'esclave, tandis qu'ilretournait vers le berger. Il reprit son armure, _ainsi que ses dix-septarmes_. Alors il demanda au berger: "Ou est mon cheval?--Oh! puisse tamaison tomber en ruine! Ton cheval est aussi fou que toi-meme. Je l'aiattache par les quatre jambes dans ce ravin, et ne puis te dire s'ilest mort ou vivant." Kourroglou lui dit: "Miserable! je souillerai letombeau de ton pere! Tu as fait du mal a mon cheval, fils de chien!" Etil courut sans delai vers le ravin, ou il vit son Kyrat attache d'unetelle facon, qu'il ne pouvait bouger. Il detacha les liens de soncheval, le sella, serra la sangle, puis, l'ayant embrasse sur les deuxyeux, il monta dessus et galopa vers Ayvaz. Il prit d'abord le sac depiastres, qu'il attacha derriere la selle avec des courroies."Allons maintenant, mon Ayvaz, monte avec moi sur ce cheval etpartons!--Guerrier, tu te moques de moi; mon oncle Roushan sera bientotici, et tu seras demonte par un seul coup de sa massue.--Frotte lesyeux, Ayvaz, et regarde; ne reconnais tu pas ton oncle?" Ayvaz l'examinaattentivement. "Oui, c'est lui, dit-il, c'est Roushan-Beg lui-meme;seulement son habit n'est pas le meme."Il commenca a pleurer, et s'ecria: O ma mere! o mon pere! ou etes-vous?"Ses larmes et ses prieres lui servirent peu. Kourroglou l'enleva sur saselle, le placa derriere lui, et ayant lie un shawl autour de son corpset de celui d'Ayvaz, il assujettit ce dernier a sa ceinture. Ensuite ildonna un coup d'eperon a son cheval, le fouetta, et emporta sa proie.Le credule esclave du boucher pensait que tout cela n'etait qu'un jeu.Cependant il courut apres lui et cria: "Treve a ce jeu, treve a cetteplaisanterie." A la fin il se facha, sortit un poignard du fourreau, etl'elevant devant Kourroglou, il dit: "Laissez l'enfant, ou je vous passece fer a travers le corps." Kourroglou dit: "Voyez ce reptile! Il fautque je montre quelque merci envers lui." Alors il lanca sa massue apreslui, et le crane de l'esclave fut ecrase comme la tete d'un pavot.Le berger, qui vit ce meurtre, devint soucieux; et, tremblant defrayeur, il commenca a reciter les prieres des mourants. Kourroglou luiordonna d'approcher et d'ouvrir ses oreilles. Alors il delia sa bourse,en fit tomber bon nombre de piastres, et lui demanda: "Berger, as-tu vuun chameau[19]?" Le berger repliqua: "Je n'ai pas meme vu un mouton."Kourroglou dit: "Berger, tu vas conduire a l'instant ce troupeau a laville; pendant ce temps j'enleverai Ayvaz." Ainsi le berger conduisitson troupeau a Orfah, tandis que Kourroglou emmenait Ayvaz aChamly-Bill. L'enfant desole criait douloureusement: "Malheur a moi! jelaisse ma tante derriere moi; j'abandonne la femme de mon oncle; malheura eux, malheur a moi!" Ses yeux etaient rouges et enfles comme despommes. Kourroglou fit l'improvisation suivante:_Improvisation_.--"Je te dis, Ayvaz, il ne faut pas pleurer. Netourmente pas mon coeur de tes regrets, ne te lamente point, Ayvaz!"[Footnote 19: "Avez-vous vu le chameau?" _Non! sirutur didi? Ne!_ Conteperse bien connu, et devenu maintenant un proverbe.]Ce dernier, en reponse, fit l'improvisation suivante:_Improvisation_--"Tu dis qu'il ne faut pas pleurer! Comment puis-jeretenir mes larmes, o Kourroglou? Tu me dis de ne pas te tourmenter demes chagrins; comment puis-je m'empecher d'etre triste?"Alors Kourroglou chanta:_Improvisation_.--"Je revenais des champs, je revenais des deserts, etje demandais aux bergers s'ils ne t'avaient pas vu. Je t'ai separe deton vieux pere; Ayvaz, ne pleure pas."Ayvaz chanta ainsi:_Improvisation_.--"Tu as rempli les sacs avec l'argent; tu as dechirele fond de mon coeur; tu as courbe sous le chagrin le dos de mon pere.Comment puis-je m'empecher de pleurer, o Kourroglou?Kourroglou chanta:_Improvisation_.--"Ne suis-je pas Beg, ne suis-je pas Khan? Ne serai-jepas pour toi un pere, un tendre parent? Ne crie pas, ne pleure pas,Ayvaz."Ayvaz chanta alors:_Improvisation_.--"Mes fleurs, je vous ai laissees dans le jardin!J'ai laisse derriere moi des beautes dont la ceinture merite d'etreembrassee, j'ai laisse derriere moi mon nom et ma famille! Commentpuis-je retenir mes larmes, o Kourroglou?"Kourroglou chanta:_Improvisation_.--"Plus de larmes, je t'en conjure, ou tu me feraspleurer moi-meme comme un enfant ou une vieille femme. Tu deviendrasun guerrier, tu seras la gloire et l'orgueil de Kourroglou. Ne pleureplus."Ayvaz dit: "J'ai oui dire que tu etais un guerrier; tu dois alors metraiter comme il convient a un guerrier. Je ne puis dire si tu es unhomme brave ou un vilain. Comment puis-je donc m'empecher de pleurer?"Kourroglou lui promit d'en faire son fils, de le faire vivre dansl'abondance et de faire de lui un guerrier, et ils continuerent leurvoyage a Chamly-Bill.Pendant ce temps, Mir-Ibrahim le boucher arrive chez lui pour chercherl'argent, et dit a sa femme: "J'ai rencontre aujourd'hui un berger quiest un grand niais. J'etais a court de quelques tumans pour payer lesmoutons, et je lui ai laisse Ayvaz en otage. Va, et tache de trouverl'argent promptement." Sa femme court chez quelques parents et amis; et,ayant obtenu la somme necessaire, elle l'apporta au boucher. Celui-ciremonta a la hate sur sa chetive rosse, et retourna vite au troupeau.Mais a peine avait-il passe la porte, qu'il vit le berger entrant dansla ville avec ce meme troupeau. "Berger, tu es un fripon, un voleur! Dequel droit amenes-tu mes moutons a la ville? Je les ai achetes, je lesai payes." Le berger dit: "Je ne te comprends pas." Mir-Ibrahim demanda:"Quoi! n'es-tu pas le berger de Roushan-Beg?--Tu reves comme si tu avaisla fievre. Je ne sais pas qui tu es, et ne puis dire non plus quel estcelui que tu nommes Roushan-Beg.--Miserable! ne m'avez-vous pasvendu ces moutons, il n'y a qu'un instant? n'avez-vous pas prisl'argent?--Arriere, avec ton mensonge! Les brebis sont la propriete deReyhan l'Arabe, et je les amene en ville pour les traire. Les brebis quel'on trait dans la place du marche se vendent un meilleur prix."A ces mots, le boucher sentit une sueur froide lui venir a la peau. Ildescendit pour tater les mamelles des brebis, et s'apercut qu'ellesavaient toutes du lait. Il dit: "Ce hableur, Roushan-Beg, me disait,en me vendant son troupeau, qu'il ne s'y trouvait que des males ou desbrebis qui n'avaient jamais porte. Sans aucun doute, c'etait Kourroglou,qui, apres m'avoir trompe, doit avoir emmene Ayvaz avec lui. N'as-tu pasvu deux jeunes garcons sur la montagne?" Le berger dit: "Oui, j'ai vudeux jeunes garcons jouant et luttant ensemble sur la montagne."Mir-Ibrahim remonta sur sa rosse en grande hate, et courut au galop. Ilne trouva sur la montagne que le cadavre de son esclave. Sa langue restaclouee a son palais; il commenca a frapper ses tempes si violemmentqu'il tomba de cheval. Dans son desespoir, il se jeta sur la terre; et,repandant de la poussiere sur sa tete, s'ecria: "Malheur a moi! il m'aenleve mon fils."Mir-Ibrahim fut trouve dans cet etat deplorable par Reyhan l'Arabe. Cedernier etait un riche seigneur, qui se rendait au dela des montagnespour chasser, accompagne de cent soixante cavaliers. Quand il se futapproche, et qu'il eut examine les choses, il reconnut son beau-freredans l'homme ainsi desole: "Quoi! est-ce vous, Mir-Ibrahim? Pourquoi ceslarmes, et que signifie ce desespoir?" Le pauvre pere, que la douleurprivait de la parole, put seulement prononcer ces mots: "Il l'aemmene... il l'a emmene!..." Reyhan l'Arabe demanda en colere: "Filsd'un pere brule, qui, et par qui enleve?" Une demi-heure se passa avantque Mir-Ibrahim eut recouvre ses sens, et il dit: "Je l'ai vendu aKourroglou; il l'a enleve, il s'est enfui.--Parle clairement. Si tu luias vendu quelque chose, il avait droit de prendre sa propriete." Ce nefut qu'apres de nombreuses questions que Reyhan l'Arabe dit, dansson coeur: "Kourroglou, tu es un miserable, tu as passe ta main[20]crasseuse sur ma tete, et enleve le gibier de mes reserves." Il appelases cavaliers, et dit: "Enfants, je vais courir apres lui; suivez-moi."Alors ils galoperent a la poursuite de Kourroglou, guides par les tracesdes pas de son cheval.[Footnote 20: C'est-a-dire: tu m'as trompe et deshonore.]Reyhan l'Arabe etait monte sur une jument. Kourroglou continuait demarcher, sans etre averti de rien, quand il vit Kyrat secouer sesoreilles. C'etait un signe certain de la presence de la jument, aenviron un mille de distance. Kourroglou dit, dans son coeur: "Mon Kyratdoit sentir la jument de Reyhan l'Arabe. Celui-ci a sans doute toutappris, et me poursuit maintenant." Il regarda le ciel, et vit quelquesoies sauvages passer au-dessus de sa tete. Kourroglou pensa: "Je vaisdecocher une fleche au guide de la bande: si l'oiseau tombe, je seraivainqueur; mais si la fleche revient seule, Ayvaz ne sera pas a moi." Ilprit une fleche de son carquois; et, apres l'avoir placee sur son arc,il l'envoya dans l'air. En tres-peu de temps, l'oie descendit, et vinttomber aux pieds de son cheval.Kourroglou se sentit tres-heureux; il arracha une couple des plus bellesplumes de l'oie, et, otant le bonnet d'Ayvaz, les attacha, en guise deplumet, a sa calotte. Ayvaz dit: "Tu as fait des trous, avec ces plumes,dans ma calotte; j'ai une belle niece qui m'en fera une neuve.--O monfils! repliqua Kourroglou, aussi longtemps que tu demeureras dans mamaison, tes habits seront d'or et de soie." En entendant cela, Ayvazpleura amerement. Kourroglou, pour le consoler, improvisa la chansonsuivante:_Improvisation_.--"Que ta tete semble belle avec cette plume! c'estcomme la tete d'une grue male. Je la garderai[21], je veilleraisoigneusement sur elle. Je t'ai cherche dans le ciel, et je t'ai trouvesur la terre. Ne pleure pas, ma jeune grue. La ligne arquee de tessourcils a ete dessinee par la plume du Tout-Puissant. Tu es juste enage, tu as quinze ans, o jeune garcon! A tous ces ornements un seulmanque encore: c'est celui des exploits chevaleresques. Tu seras lemodele d'un guerrier. Je couvrirai ta tete d'une calotte d'or. O majeune grue! ne pleure plus." Apres une pause, Kourroglou chanta:_Improvisation_.--"Je te vis, et mon coeur fut heureux. Tu trouveras enmoi un franc Turcoman-Tuka. Mon nom est Kourroglou _le belier_. Je suisbien connu dans toute la Turquie. Ayvaz, a la tete de grue, ne pleureplus."[Footnote 21: _Terbatics_ "Je tournerai autour de ta tete", expressionprise d'une coutume orientale. Quand un malheur menace quelqu'un, afinde le prevenir, on fait tourner un mouton noir trois fois autour de lui,et on en fait ensuite present aux pauvres, ou bien on le fait pendre.Quand le schah de Perse visite un village, les paysans vont au-devant,baisent le pan de sa robe ou son eperon; ils demandent comme la plusgrande faveur la permission de tourner autour de son cheval; de lal'expression _dourer beguerden_, c'est-a-dire "j'implore, je demande surtout ce qu'il y a de plus sacre".]Retournons maintenant a Reyhan l'Arabe. Il connaissait parfaitementtous les chemins et sentiers des environs d'Orfah; il savait aussique Kourroglou y venait pour la premiere fois, et par consequent neconnaissait pas les localites. Il y avait une passe etroite au-dessusd'un precipice qu'il fallait traverser au moyen de _quelque choseressemblant a un pont jete dessus_. Avant que Kourroglou put avoir passece pont, Reyhan l'Arabe y etait arrive en faisant un detour, et ilse posta a l'entree meme. Kourroglou, voyant que sa route etaitinterceptee, se determina a gravir la montagne rapide qui surplombait lepont. Il aiguillonna Kyrat avec ses eperons et le fouetta; Kyratgrimpa comme une chevre sauvage, et fut bientot debout sur le sommet.Kourroglou, regardant alors de tous cotes, ne vit rien que les mursperpendiculaires des precipices horribles. On ne voyait aucun passage;seulement, au pied d'un des flancs de la montagne, il y avait un ravinlarge de douze metres et de cent metres de long. Kourroglou demeura amediter sur ce qu'il y avait a faire.Reyhan l'Arabe alors dit a ses gens: "Mes enfants, mes ames, pas un pasde plus. Restez ou vous etes: pas un de vous ne pourrait monter aulieu ou est maintenant Kourroglou; il faudra qu'il y meure ou qu'ildescende."A tout evenement, Kourroglou demeura trois jours sur le sommet de lamontagne; mais, ce qu'il eut de pire, c'est que Kyrat y tomba malade,Kourroglou tourna sa face vers la Mecque, et pria: "O Dieu! si le jourde ma mort est arrive, ne me laisse pas mourir parmi les Sunnites." Ilregarda alors Kyrat, et son coeur fut rejoui quand il vit que son chevalpaissait et mangeait l'herbe avec appetit, signe evident que sa santes'ameliorait, grace a l'intercession de la sainte ame d'Ali. Il allaexaminer le ravin, large de douze metres, et pensa: "Quel que puisseetre le resultat, je veux l'essayer. Si Kyrat franchit le ravin,nous sommes sauves; s'il ne le peut, alors nous perirons tous troismiserablement, moi, Kyrat et Ayvaz, brises en mille pieces au fond duprecipice. Je ne puis attendre plus longtemps." Il sauta sur son cheval,lia Ayvaz a sa ceinture avec un chale, et improvisa a son cheval lechant suivant:_Improvisation._--"O mon coursier! ton pere etait bedou, ta mere kholan.Sus! sus! mon digne Kyrat, porte-moi a Chamly-Bill! Ne me laisse pasici, parmi les mecreants et les ennemis, au milieu du noir brouillard.Sus! sus! mon ame, Kyrat, emporte-moi a Chamly-Bill!"Aussitot que Reyhan l'Arabe entendit la voix de Kourroglou, il se mit arire et cria d'en bas: "Bien, maudit! tu as dit tes dernieres paroles;mais que tu chantes ou non, il faut que tu descendes et tombes entre nosmains." Alors Kourroglou improvisa pour Kyrat:_Improvisation._--"Helas! mon cheval, ne me laisse pas voir ta honte. Tuseras couvert de harnais de soie a ta droite et a ta gauche; je feraiferrer tes pieds de devant et tes pieds de derriere avec de l'or pur.Sus! sus! mon Kyrat, porte-moi a Chamly-Bill! Ton corps est aussi rond,aussi mince et aussi uni qu'un roseau. Montre ce que tu peux faire, moncheval; que l'ennemi te voie et devienne aveugle d'envie[22]. N'es-tupas de la race de kholan? n'es-tu pas l'arriere-petit-fils deDuldul[23]? O Kyrat! porte-moi a Chamly-Bill, vers mes braves. Je feraitailler pour toi des housses de satin, et je les ferai broder exprespour toi. Nous nous rejouirons, et le vin rouge coulera eu ruisseaux.O mon Kyrat! toi que j'ai choisi entre cinq cents chevaux, sus! sus!porte-moi a Chamly-Bill."[Footnote 22: Litteralement: "Tu arracheras les yeux du scelerat."][Footnote 23: Duldul: nom du celebre cheval arabe qui appartenait a Ali,gendre de prophete.]Ayant fini ce chant, Kourroglou commenca a promener Kyrat. Reyhanl'Arabe le vit d'en bas, et, devinant que Kourroglou preparait soncheval a franchir le ravin, il dit a ses hommes: "Voulez-vous parier queKourroglou sera assez hardi pour sauter ce precipice? Son grand courageme plait. Je vous prends a temoin que s'il franchit le ravin, je megarderai de persecuter un homme si brave. Je lui pardonnerai et luilaisserai emmener Ayvaz; s'il succombe, je rassemblerai leurs membresdisperses et les ensevelirai avec honneur." Il dit ces mots, et ilregarda la montagne tout le temps a travers un telescope. Kourrogloucontinuait a promener Kyrat jusqu'a ce que l'ecume parut dans sesnaseaux. Enfin, il choisit une place ou il avait assez d'espace poursauter; et alors, fouettant son cheval, il le poussa en avant.Le brave Kyrat s'elanca et s'arreta sur le bord meme du precipice; sesquatre jambes etaient rassemblees entre elles _comme les feuilles d'unbouton de rose_. Il hesita un instant, prit de l'elan, et sauta del'autre cote du ravin; il retomba meme deux metres plus loin qu'iln'etait necessaire.Reyhan l'Arabe s'ecria: "Bravo! benis soient la mere qui a sevre et lepere qui a eleve un tel homme."Pour Kourroglou, son bonnet ne remua pas de dessus sa tete; ilne regarda pas meme en arriere, comme s'il ne fut rien arrived'extraordinaire, et il s'en alla tranquillement avec Ayvaz.Reyhan l'Arabe dit a ses hommes: "Mes amis, mes enfants! un loup a quil'on n'ote pas sa premiere proie s'enhardit et revient plus rapace quejamais. Kourroglou a enleve aujourd'hui le fils de mon beau-frere;demain, il viendra saisir ma femme jusque dans mon lit. Il faut luimontrer que notre orteil est aussi assez fort pour tendre un arc."Sur cela, ils s'elancerent a sa poursuite. Aussitot que Reyhan l'Arabeapercut Kourroglou, il cria: "Roi, parviendrais-tu a t'echapper jusqu'aChamly-Bill, je t'y atteindrais encore." Kourroglou pensa: "Ce brigandne veut pas me laisser en paix." Il fit descendre Ayvaz de cheval,examina la selle, les etriers, resserra la sangle, et retournaau-devant de Reyhan l'Arabe, auquel il demanda: "Que veux-tu de moi,mecreant?--Ecoutez cette belle question, ce que je veux? Tu as passe tamain crasseuse sur ma tete." Kourroglou demanda: "Veux-tu combattre avecmoi comme un homme ou comme une femme?--Qu'entends-tu par combattrecomme un homme ou comme une femme?--Si tu ordonnes a tes cavaliers desauter sur moi, alors tu combattras comme une femme; si, au contraire,tu consens a te battre seul avec moi, ce sera un combat comme ilconvient a des hommes.--Soit, battons-nous donc comme des hommes." Kourroglou, qui voyait queles cavaliers de Reyhan l'Arabe attendaient tranquillement, ranges enligne, dit dans son coeur: "Malgre ses promesses, je ne puis me fier ala parole des Sunnites; commencons donc par eloigner d'ici au moins unepartie de ses cavaliers. Ecoutez-moi, Reyhan l'Arabe, j'ai coutume dechanter avant le combat. Voici mon chant:_Improvisation._--"Guerrier Reyhan! tu es venu avec une armee contremoi seul. Ou est ton honneur, ou est ta valeur si vantee? Pourquoicherches-tu a detruire mon ame? Guerrier Reyhan, tu es fou!"Le son de sa voix, aussi bien que le chant, etaient si terribles, queles cavalieres de Reyhan furent frappes de peur. Kourroglou continua:_Improvisation_.--"Montrez-moi un homme qui puisse tendre mon arc.Trouvez-moi un guerrier qui vienne frapper sa tete comme un beliercontre mon bouclier. Je puis broyer l'acier entre mes dents, et je lecrache alors avec mepris contre le ciel. Oh! pourquoi ne pas combattreaujourd'hui?"Les cavaliers de Reyhan l'Arabe, saisis d'horreur, murmurerent l'un al'autre: "Pour la gloire de la race d'Osman, pas un de nous n'echapperaau tranchant du sabre de Kourroglou." Plusieurs d'eux prirent la fuite.Kourroglou dit dans son coeur: "Est-ce ainsi? Fuyez donc." Et ilimprovisa._Improvisation_.--"Donne ordre a ton armee de se diviser par bataillons.Ah! ont-ils tant de confiance dans leur nombre? Je suis seul, que cinqcent, que six cents de vous s'avancent! Reyhan est venu, il est fou, enverite."Ce chant mit en fuite le reste des cavaliers de Reyhan. Ce dernier seulresta et ne quitta pas la place. Kourroglou improvisa._Improvisation_.--"Un guerrier ne chasse pas ses freres guerriers dansle couvert. Il menace avec son epee egyptienne bien affilee, elevee enl'air. Pense a toi, Reyhan, avant qu'il soit trop tard. Es-tu fou? Tun'as jamais eprouve la force du belier, le front de Kourroglou; tu n'asjamais eu devant toi un bras si puissant. Tu es encore la, Reyhan, es-tufou?"Reyhan l'Arabe etait un seigneur d'un grand courage; on parlait de sagloire et de ses hauts faits dans toute la Turquie. Kourroglou s'ecria:"Retourne dans ta maison, Reyhan; regarde la fuite de tes cavaliers." Sareponse fut: "Ce sont tous des corbeaux, ils ne peuvent resister aun hibou comme toi." Cela dit, Reyhan lanca sa jument arabe sur lerailleur. Kourroglou, de son cote, donna de l'eperon a Kyrat. Le chocfut terrible.Les dix-sept armes qu'il portait avec lui furent employees tour atour, et cependant aucun avantage ne fut remporte de part et d'autre.Kourroglou vit que Reyhan l'Arabe etait un homme d'un courage et d'unehabilete superieurs.Ils s'approcherent plusieurs fois a cheval poitrine contre poitrine etdos contre dos. Ils se prirent l'un l'autre par la ceinture. Reyhantirait Kourroglou afin de le desarconner, et criait: "Tu n'emmeneraspas Ayvaz." Kourroglou le tirait aussi de dessus sa selle et criait:"J'emmenerai Ayvaz."Ils descendirent de cheval en meme temps et commencerent a lutter apied, le cou enlace avec le cou, le bras avec le bras, la jambe avec lajambe. On aurait dit deux chameaux[24] males se battant ensemble. Lesoleil commencait deja a baisser. Kourroglou se sentait fatigue de lapuissante resistance de son ennemi, et s'ecria dans son coeur: "O Dieu!preserve-moi de malheur, o Ali!" Cela dit, il eleva Reyhan l'Arabe enl'air et le rejeta par terre; il s'assit sur sa poitrine, et, tirantson couteau, il se preparait a lui couper la tete; mais il dit dans soncoeur: "S'il demande merci, je le tuerai; s'il ne le demande pas, ceserait pitie de tuer un si brave jeune homme."[Footnote 24: Les combats de chameaux sont beaucoup plus feroces queceux de taureaux, de beliers, de bouledogues ou de coqs. Les richesoisifs en Perse parient souvent a leur sujet. Il est presque impossiblede ne pas eprouver une sorte de plaisir sauvage a etre temoin de cescombats. Ces deux enormes corps, tout en se battant, demeurent presquesans aucun mouvement. Leurs longs cous enlaces l'un l'autre ne donnentsigne de vie que par de convulsives contorsions. Deux tetes avec desyeux presque hors de leur orbites, des bouches ecumantes, d'affreuxrugissements completent le tableau.]Il regarda son visage, mais il etait rouge, tranquille, et ne laissaitvoir aucun changement. Alors il detacha la courroie qui etait derrieresa selle, et s'en servit pour lier les jambes et les mains de Reyhan.Ce dernier dit: "Au moment ou tu lancais ton cheval pour franchir leprecipice, je te faisais present d'Ayvaz. J'ai ete infidele a ma parole,et pour un peche si enorme, le malheur tombe sur ma tete coupable."Kourroglou repliqua: "En verite, nul autre homme que moi n'osera tepoursuivre, J'ai pitie de toi, et n'ai pas envie de te tuer. J'aiseulement lie tes mains et tes jambes. Si une armee me poursuivait,elle ne serait pas assez hardie pour continuer apres t'avoir vu ainsigarrotte."Kourroglou lia donc Reyhan avec une corde sur sa jument, et, ayantremonte sur Kyrat, il conduisit la jument avec une corde. Il placa Ayvazderriere lui, et ils arriverent ainsi a Chamly-Bill. Les sentinellesde Kourroglou le virent venir de loin et informerent les bandits del'arrivee de leur maitre. Sept cent soixante-dix-sept hommes allerent asa rencontre. Kourroglou commanda qu'on fut chercher une robe d'honneurpour Ayvaz. Ayvaz la mit: Kourroglou ordonna que Khoya-Yakub, qui, toutle temps de l'absence de Kourroglou, avait ete enchaine et confine dansune sombre prison, fut amene devant lui. Il le recut tendrement, luiota ses fers, et le fit conduire au bain. Aussitot que Khoya-Yakub futrevenu, il le revetit d'un superbe habillement, et l'invita a s'asseoirpres de lui, a la place d'honneur.Les bandits s'enquirent avec empressement des details de la captured'Ayvaz, et Kourroglou les leur dit du commencement a la fin,n'epargnant pas les louanges a Reyhan sur sa force et son courage. Ildit son conte en vers et en prose, fidele a sa coutume de dire la veritea la face des gens, disant a un poltron qu'il etait un poltron, a unbrave qu'il etait un brave. Voici une des improvisations faites enl'honneur de Reyhan:_Improvisation_.--"Freres, Aghas! un homme doit etre un homme commeReyhan. Il a arrache des larmes d'admiration de mes yeux. Son bouclierest d'argent; il repand le sang de l'ennemi avec abondance. Il a unimon ame a la sienne. Il a grave a la fois dans mon coeur le respect etl'attachement. Un homme juste doit etre comme Reyhan. Puisse chaque pereavoir cinq fils comme lui; puissions-nous avoir des guerriers comme luipour compagnons! Il merite d'etre le frere de Kourroglou. Un homme justedoit etre un homme comme Reyhan[25]."[Footnote 25: Le texte de cette belle piece de poesie sert d'exemplede la force des participes turcs, qui ne peut etre egalee dans aucunelangue europeenne.]Kourroglou ordonna qu'on servit un repas. Ayvaz fut nomme chef desechansons; le vin coula, les mets tomberent comme la pluie, et toute labande festoya ensemble.QUATRIEME RENCONTRE.Le chapitre qui precede nous a paru si colore et si original, que nousn'avons pas eu le courage de l'abreger beaucoup. Au ton heroique se meledans le recit la gaiete rabelaisienne, et l'ensemble est, comme danstoutes les oeuvres naives, un compose de terrible et de bouffon. Ledejeuner de Kourroglou sur la montagne ne rappelle-t-il pas, en effet,une scene de Grangousier? N'y a-t-il pas aussi un peu du frere Jean desEntommeures et de Panurge en meme temps, dans les niaiseries malicieusesqu'emploie Kourroglou pour obtenir d'Ayvaz la permission de boire de sonvin? Mais bientot viennent les touchantes lamentations d'Ayvaz enleve,et la, il y a la simplicite elevee de la forme biblique. Enfin,l'admiration de Reyhan l'Arabe pour Kourroglou franchissant le precipicefinira dans la chevalerie merveilleuse de l'Arioste.La rencontre suivante penetre plus avant dans les moeurs et usages del'Orient. La princesse Nighara est toute une revelation de l'ideal de lafemme dans ces contrees. Ideal bizarre et qui, pour le coup, n'est pasle notre. L'examen en sera d'autant plus curieux; et ce serait peut-etreici le lieu de donner comme preface a ce chapitre un travail que M.Chodzko nous a communique sur les pratiques, usages, superstitions,idees religieuses et sociales qui defraient la vie mysterieuse desharems. Mais nous craignons de nuire a l'interet que peut inspirerKourroglou, par cette longue interruption, et nous remettons a la finde notre analyse la publication des curieux documents qui viennent al'appui.La quatrieme rencontre traite donc de la princesse Nighara; mais commeelle en traite fort longuement, nous abregerons le plus possible, ayantregret, toutefois, a tout ce que nous passerons sous silence.Et d'abord, nous voudrions omettre Demurchi-Oglou comme ne se rattachantpas a l'action de cette aventure; mais nous devons le retrouver dans lasuite de la vie de Kourroglou, et nous ne pouvons nous dispenser dele faire connaitre au lecteur, d'autant plus qu'il y a la un traitd'affinite avec l'aventure de Guillaume Tell, et raffine dans tous sesdetails par l'ingenieuse exageration des Orientaux. On a du remarqueraussi dans le chapitre precedent la superiorite de l'invention persane,a propos de Kourroglou effacant, par la seule pression de ses doigts,l'effigie d'une monnaie d'or. Les heros de chez nous se contentent debriser la piece en deux, et croient avoir fait l'impossible. Mais leveritable impossible ne se trouve que dans l'Orient.Voila donc Demurchi-Oglou, le fils du forgeron, qui, du fond de saville du Nakchevan, entend parler de la gloire et de la magnificence dubandit. _Mon coeur eclate ici faute d'action_, dit Demurchi-Oglou, et levoila parti avec son cheval pour Chamly-Bill. Kourroglou, qui chassaitaux alentours de sa forteresse, le rencontre et dit d'abord: "Voila unbeau garcon!" Demurchi lui presente sa requete. "_Mon ame_, lui repondle maitre, tu dois savoir que je donne du pain aux braves et rien auxlaches.--Amis, dit-il a ses chasseurs, _j'ai trouve ici mon gibier _."Il fait asseoir Demurchi sur les genoux, _a la maniere des chameauxmales_, et lui fait oter son bonnet. Puis il demande une pomme, tireson anneau de son doigt, le fixe sur la pomme qu'il pose sur la tete deDemurchi, se place a distance, tend son arc, et fait passer les soixantefleches de son carquois a travers l'anneau.Content de voir que Demurchi n'a pas sourcille, il dit a ses compagnons:"Mes ames, mes enfants, que celui qui m'aime contribue a equiperDemurchi-Oglou." A l'instant meme, nos bandits, sans aucune crainte depasser pour communistes, se depouillent chacun de son habillement, deson armure ou du harnachement de son cheval, "et il lui fut donne tantde choses, qu'en un instant l'etranger se trouva riche."On l'emmene a Chamly-Bill, on feta sa venue; Kourroglou improvise pourlui au dessert, et, dans une de ses strophes, il lui dit:"Personne sur la terre ne connaitrait mes hauts faits sans mes jolieschansons. Oui, tout ce que j'ai fait, je l'ai fait pour mes amis, et lapassion d'un gain egoiste ne s'est jamais elevee dans mon ame."[Illustration: Kourroglou s'approcha d'Ayvaz. (Page 9.)]"Mais ecoutez maintenant, s'ecrie le rapsode, l'histoire de la princesseNighara, fille du sultan de Constantinople."La belle princesse a entendu parler de Kourroglou, et elle s'est eprisede lui sur sa brillante reputation. Un jour qu'elle etait sortie pour sepromener dans les bazars de la ville, et qu'au son des tambours, tousles promeneurs et tous les marchands s'enfuyaient pour ne pas payerde leur tete le bonheur de l'apercevoir, un certain Belly-Ahmed(c'est-a-dire _le fameux_ Ahmed), qui se trouvait la, se dit enlui-meme: "Ton nom est Belly-Ahmed, et tu ne verrais pas cette belleprincesse?" Il la vit, en effet, et faillit le payer cher; car laprincesse, qui n'entendait pas raillerie, le foula aux pieds, et l'eutfait etrangler par ses eunuques, s'il n'eut eu l'heureuse inspiration delui dire, tout en la suppliant, qu'il etait natif d'Erzeroum. Aussitotla princesse lui demande s'il n'a point vu dans ces contrees un certainKourroglou, et Belly-Ahmed, qui n'est point sot, se hate de se donnerpour un de ses serviteurs. Alors la princesse lui jette de l'or apoignees, et lui remet, pour son maitre, son propre portrait avec unelettre ainsi concue:"O toi qui es appele Kourroglou! la gloire de ton nom a jete un charmesur nos contrees. Je me nomme Nighara, fille du sultan Murad. Je te dis,afin que tu l'apprennes, si tu ne le sais pas encore, que j'eprouveun ardent desir de te voir. Si tu as du courage, viens a Istambul, etenleve-moi."Belly-Ahmed part pour Chamly-Bill, et se presente aux sentinelles quis'emparent de lui et le conduisent a Kourroglou. Celui-ci lui trouvebonne mine, le fait asseoir, et envoie son bel echanson Ayvaz luichercher du vin. Alors recommence avec Ahmed un dialogue dans laforme de celui qu'on a vu au chapitre precedent, entre Kourroglou etKhoya-Yakub. "As-tu vu un plus beau cheval que mon Kyrat?---Je n'en aipas vu.--As-tu vu un plus beau guerrier que mon Ayvaz?--Je n'en ai pasvu.--As-tu vu une plus belle fete, etc.--Mais, o Kourroglou! j'ai vu,a Istambul, la princesse Nighara!" Kourroglou dresse l'oreille, lit lebillet, regarde la miniature, fait seller Kyrat; et part en laissantBelly-Ahmed enchaine dans un cachot, comme il avait fait pourKhoya-Yakub; en pareille circonstance, c'est sa facon d'agir.[Illustration: Ayant entendu la proclamation... (Page 2l.)]Ayant passe les portes de la ville (Constantinople), il descenditde cheval, et Kyrat le suivit par les rues. Ce merveilleux cheval(descendant a coup sur de celui qui portait les quatre fils Aymon),sachant bien qu'il pourrait eveiller, par sa beaute, la convoitise desetrangers, ou _craignant qu'on ne jetat sur lui quelque charme_, "avaitl'esprit de laisser tomber ses oreilles comme un ane, de rebrousserson poil, d'emmeler sa criniere, enfin de se donner l'apparence et lademarche d'une rosse."Kourroglou vit une femme decrepite dont le dos _avait la forme courbeede la nouvelle lune_, et connut a son air que c'etait une sorciere. Illui demande l'hospitalite. Elle s'excuse sur sa pauvrete. Il lui donnede l'or, elle s'attendrit. Mais arrives a la maison de la vieille,Kourroglou, qui veut y faire entrer Kyrat, trouve la porte si basse,qu'il est oblige de partager la muraille en deux d'un coup de sabre. Ladame pleure, le bandit l'apaise en lui promettant de lui faire rebatirune _belle grande porte_. L'ecurie etait confortable; mais il n'yavait dans les mangeoires qu'un peu de paille et de ronces seches.Heureusement Kyrat n'etait pas degoute, et, comme son maitre, mangeaitce qui se trouvait, _pourvu que ce fut un peu moins dur que la pierre_.Kourroglou trouva la maison propre et bien aeree, mais depourvue detapis. Or, un Persan se passera de tout volontiers plutot que de tapis.Une chambre honorable doit en avoir un en laine etendu au milieu, deuxetroits en drap feutre, places de chaque cote du premier, dans le sensde la longueur, et un quatrieme en pur feutre, appele le serendaz, placeen travers sur le tout. C'est la qu'un gentleman persan boit, mange,cause, et digere convenablement. "Mere, dit Kourroglou a la vieille, vam'acheter au bazar un assortiment de tapis; que le feutre soit dela manufacture de Jam, et que celui du milieu soit des fabriques duKhorassan. Voici encore une poignee d'argent."Il s'installe bientot sur ses beaux tapis, ote son armure, dont lavieille suspend une a une les diverses pieces a la muraille, et luidonne encore une poignee d'argent pour qu'elle aille acheter une robeneuve; car la sienne est si vieille et si malpropre, que le sybariteKourroglou _ne peut la regarder_. "Voici un vrai fils pour moi! dit lasorciere. Puisse-je rencontrer une douzaine de tels enfants!" Elle s'enva chercher des habits neufs tout faits dans la boutique d'un tailleur,et enveloppe sa bouche d'un mouchoir blanc pour cacher a son hotedelicat sa bouche edentee. Sous pretexte de l'arrivee prochaine de douzepretendus amis qu'il doit regaler, Kourroglou lui commande un enormesouper, riz, beurre, epices et viandes en abondance, le tout dans ungrand bassin, que la vieille n'eut pas la force d'apporter quand il futrempli et pret a servir. Kourroglou venait de frotter, de brosser et delaver Kyrat; il s'etait lave aussi les pieds et les mains, avait recitedevotement son Namaz, ni plus ni moins qu'un bon pere de famille, etse sentait grand appetit. Il alla chercher lui-meme a la cuisine lamontagne de riz et de viande, et apres que son hotesse eut etendu surlui une grande nappe, et sur la nappe une serviette de peau, il ouvritsa main comme _la patte d'un lion_, et se mit a jeter des poignees deviande dans sa bouche comme dans une caverne.Au milieu de ce repas pantagruelesque, dont le recit detaille et repetedoit, je m'imagine, faire une vive impression quand les rapsodesle declament a un auditoire de pauvres diables maigres et affames,Kourroglou ne laisse pas que de plaisanter agreablement. "Ma vieille, jeveux dire ma jeune beaute (car la sorciere trouve la premiere epithetegrossiere et ne peut la souffrir), mange aussi, au nom de Dieu, de peurque le souffle de la destruction ne vienne a s'elever dans ton estomac,et que je n'aie a rendre compte de toi au jour du jugement." La vieillese flattait que les restes de ce terrible souper lui suffiraient pourvivre une semaine et regaler encore ses voisines. Elle disait s'etrerassasiee a la seule odeur des mets en les faisant cuire; mais quandelle vit la devastation que son hote portait dans l'edifice, ellecraignit d'aller se coucher a jeun, et plongea sa main decharnee dansle bassin. Malheureusement un grain de riz lui causa un acces de touxdurant lequel Kourroglou mit a sec le fond du plat; et quand elle voulutramasser ses nappes, elle s'apercut avec effroi que la nappe de cuiravait disparu, "Qu'en as-tu fait, mon fils?--Etait-ce donc la nappe? ditKourroglou; j'ai trouve le dernier morceau un peu dur et amer. J'ai euquelque peine a l'avaler. Pourquoi ne m'as pas tu averti?--Helas! pensala vieille, mon hote n'est autre que la famine personnifiee. Si sa faimrecommence, il avalera mon pauvre corps."Kourroglou fit faire son lit en travers de la porte, ce qui effrayabeaucoup la vieille. "De quoi t'inquietes-tu? lui dit-il; si tu veuxsortir la nuit, je te permets de passer par-dessus mon lit et de memarcher sur le corps; je ne m'en apercevrai point."Couchee dans la meme chambre, la vieille, pensant que son hote avaitde mauvais desseins, _parce qu'il avait beaucoup mange_, ne put fermerl'oeil. "Veilles-tu, mere?--Helas! oui; je me demande si tu n'es pas Nazar-Djellaly.--Non.--Tu es donc Guriz-Oglou--Erreur.--En ce cas, tu es Reyhan l'Arabe?--Encore moins.--Alors, tu es le chef des sept cent soixante-dix-sept, tu esKourroglou!--Tu l'as dit. Je viens ici pour enlever la princesseNighara."_La langue de la vieille se raidit dont sa bouche_. "Allons, n'aie paspeur, vieille carcasse.--Comment serais-je rassuree? Quand un enfantcrie, sa mere lui dit pour le faire taire: "Tais-toi, ou le loup viendrate manger;" et l'enfant crie encore. La mere dit: "Voici le leopard;"l'enfant crie plus fort. La mere dit alors: "Voici Kourroglou qui vat'emporter;" l'enfant se tait et cache sa figure dans l'oreiller.Kourroglou jure par le plus pur esprit du Createur du ciel et de laterre qu'il la traitera comme sa propre mere si elle ne le trahit pas;mais que, dans le cas contraire, fut-elle assise dans le septieme ciel,il lui jetterait un noeud coulant pour l'en arracher; et quand meme ellese changerait en Djinn pour se cacher aux entrailles de la terre, ill'en retirerait avec des pinces pour la mettre en pieces.Des le matin, Kourroglou va au bazar et y achete un habit blanc pareil acelui que portent les mollahs, puis une cornaline sur laquelle il faitgraver le chiffre du sultan. Enfin, il fait l'emplette d'une excellenteguitare dont le manche se devisse et se retire a volonte. Il met lecachet et l'instrument ainsi demonte dans sa poche, et, muni de sesmoyens de seduction, il aborde un fakir et le prie de venir reciter asa mere mourante quelques versets du Koran. Quand il l'a amene chez lavieille, il lui ordonne d'ecrire sous sa dictee une lettre de passemoyennant laquelle il se presentera comme un _mollah_, un _chavush_,c'est-a-dire un pelerin de la Mecque, un saint homme envoye par lesultan a sa fille, et franchira les portes du palais. Le fakir, quicroit Kourroglou incapable de lire l'ecriture, le trompe, et ecrit ala princesse, au nom du sultan, que ce faux chavush est le plus grandcoquin de la terre, et qu'il lui recommande de lui faire donner lefouet. Kourroglou, qui lit par-dessus l'epaule du secretaire infidele,l'etrangle a demi, le reduit a l'obeissance, scelle la lettre avec lecachet contrefait du sultan, et pour mieux s'assurer de la discretion dufakir, lui donne un tel coup sur la tete, _qu'elle s'aplatit comme unlivre qui se ferme_. Il le pousse ensuite dans un coin de la chambre,donne un coup de pied au mur qui s'ecroule et ensevelit le cadavre sousses ruines. On ne peut pas mieux expedier une affaire; mais le recit enest fort long et fort curieux, a cause des sentences et des formes dudialogue, mele toujours de plaisanteries et de ferocite.La vieille criait et se frappait la poitrine, "Jamais le sang innocentn'avait ete repandu dans ma maison, et tu l'as souillee!--Veux-tu doncque je te tue aussi, infidele sunnite? lui repond Kourroglou, et que jefasse tomber le reste de ce mur sur ton corps fletri?"Kourroglou se revet du costume blanc des mollahs, entoure sa tete deplusieurs aunes de linge blanc, cache sa guitare dans sa poche, sonpoignard dans son sein, et, le rosaire dans une main, le baton devoyage dans l'autre, il franchit, grace a la feinte lettre et au sceauapocryphe du sultan, les portes sacrees du palais. "De cette maniere,dit le rapsode avec un melange de sympathie et d'indignation, il futpermis a ce larron des larrons d'entrer dans le harem... a cet hommecapable de couper le sein d'une mere nourrissant son enfant!"Ayant franchi les portes des sept murailles, il arrive aux jardinsfleuris de la princesse. Il y avait quatre bassins d'eau courante etdes fontaines qui s'elancaient en jets. Kourroglou plia son manteau enquatre, et s'assit dessus au bord d'une des pieces d'eau, le rosaire ala main, les yeux a demi fermes, comme un vrai Raminagrobis, ce qui nel'empechait pas de voir distinctement, dans un kiosque ouvert, la belleNighara _buvant du vin_ avec plusieurs belles filles de sa suite.Une d'elles vint au bord du bassin pour chercher de l'eau, quoiqu'il neparaisse pas que Nighara ait eu l'habitude d'en mettre beaucoup dansson vin. "Homme, qui es-tu? dit la suivante effrayee.--Homme! s'ecrieKourroglou, quel nom est-ce la? ne peux-tu, fille impure, me saluer dunom de Hadji? et la princesse Nighara ne peut-elle se donner la peinede chausser sa pantoufle a demi pour venir au devant du royal chavushRoushan, envoye ici de la Mecque par le sultan Murad?"Toute personne qui apporte une bonne nouvelle a droit a une recompenseimmediate. Un khan, en pareille circonstance, detache ordinairement sariche ceinture, et la presente au messager. La suivante de Nighara courtau kiosque, et commence par s'emparer du chale et des bijoux de laprincesse qui etaient poses sur le tapis. "Es-tu ivre? dit la princesseetonnee d'une semblable audace.--C'est toi-meme qui es ivre, repondl'autre sans se deconcerter. Ce que je prends m'appartient; j'apporte lanouvelle qu'un saint homme est arrive de la Mecque avec un message pourtoi. _Un feu divin brille dans ses yeux, et son visage en renvoie lesrayons vers le soleil_.""Levons-nous, mes filles, dit la princesse. J'ai lu dans les traditionssacrees que ceux qui vont au devant d'un pelerin de la Mecque sontpreserves d'etre brules par la flamme de l'enfer, si la poussiere dessabots de son cheval tombe seulement sur eux."Pendant ce temps, Kourroglou avait ote sa robe et son turban de pelerin;il avait mis son bonnet sur l'oreille, a la facon des dandys kajjares,rajuste les plis de son bel habit vert-olive, et noue gracieusement lecachemire qui lui servait de ceinture, et qui laissait voir le manche deson poignard couvert de gros diamants. Quand la vertueuse princesse vitle saint homme transforme en un superbe brigand a grandes moustaches,elle commenca, non par s'enfuir, mais par faire attacher les pieds de lasuivante qui s'etait ainsi trompee, et sous pretexte qu'elle avait durecevoir quelque baiser de cet imposteur, elle lui fit appliquer unevigoureuse bastonnade sur les talons, puis s'approchant de Kourroglou,qui essayait de justifier la suivante en se declarant un _amoureux sansargent_, incapable de seduire personne par des presents, elle luidonna un grand coup de pied dans la poitrine. "Princesse, dirent lessuivantes, c'est une pitie de te voir ainsi profaner ton joli piedcontre la poitrine non lavee de ce miserable.--Taisez-vous, sottesfilles, dit le bandit sans se deconcerter; vous ne savez pas que monsein est plus precieux que le talon de votre maitresse."Alors il prit sa guitare et improvisa:"Je respire de ton jardin le parfum de la jacinthe et de la violette.Comme elles tu fleuris dans la solitude. Tu es une fleche au fond de moncoeur."Nighara etait indignee. Kourroglou chanta encore:"Tu es le fruit le plus frais dans les jardins du printemps; tu es lecoing embaume et la grenade vermeille, etc."Au lieu de s'adoucir a de tels compliments, la farouche Nighara faitun signe a ses femmes, et aussitot une grele de coups tombe surl'audacieux. "Dieu vous preserve, s'ecrie en cet endroit le rapsode, detomber sous les ongles d'une femme irritee!"En un instant les vetements de Kourroglou volerent en pieces:"Princesse, dit-il, si tu n'as pitie de moi, montre au moins quelquemerci envers ces pauvres filles. Leurs mains deviendront calleuses aforce de me battre." La princesse dit a ses suivantes: "Allons prendreun peu de vin pour nous donner des forces, afin que nous puissionsbattre encore cet imposteur." Mais en retournant vers son kiosque, elleregarda en arriere, remarqua les traits de Kourroglou, et le trouvabeau. Aussitot il oublia la cuisson des coups d'ongles et des coups deverges, reprit sa guitare et chanta:"O Nighara aux yeux de gazelle, verrai-je ton sein se changer en pierre?Tu m'as renverse sur le visage. Puissent tes yeux etre remplis delarmes!"Nighara, qui ne pouvait detacher ses yeux de ce male visage, se faitapporter du vin."Fais remplir ton gobelet de mon sang, et bois-le," lui chante encoreKourroglou.En voyant boire du vin, Kourroglou, qui n'en avait pas goute depuis sondepart de Chamly-Bill, oubliait toutefois son desespoir amoureux "pourse lecher les levres." Nighara, emue de pitie, lui fit apporter unbassin de baume _mumiah_, en disant: "Je ne desire pas ta mort; bois etva-t'en."Kourroglou gouta le baume, fit la grimace, et demanda du vin. "Ah! sainthomme, tu bois la liqueur defendue par le Prophete, dit la princesseirritee de nouveau. Eh bien, nous t'en donnerons; mais tu danseraspour nous divertir; apres quoi nous te battrons encore et te jetteronsdehors." Nighara disparait, et revient avec ses femmes, qui apportentdes tapis, des vins et des mets divers. On etend les tapis sur le gazon,on sert le festin au bord de la fontaine. La demarche de la princesseetait pleine d'agrements et de graces, et, malgre sa fureur, elleavait arrange ou plutot derange sa toilette pour etre plus seduisante.Kourroglou chanta:"O aghas, mes freres! Nighara est venue! Des larmes de joie coulent demes yeux. L'Armenien aime sa croix, bien que son prophete ait souffertsur la croix! Voyez comme elle a orne ses cheveux noirs, auxquels elle apermis de tomber sur son cou delicat! Elle est venue!""Elle est venue pour m'apprendre la beaute. Nighara est venue pour tuerKourroglou; elle est venue!"La princesse le regardait toujours; mais, comme les femmes de chez nous,elle se montrait toujours plus cruelle pour se faire aimer davantage;seulement, ses facons d'agir etaient un peu plus energiques. Elle le fitbattre de nouveau, et cette fois si serieusement, que Kourroglou, vaincupar la souffrance, _se roulait par terre_. Ne faut-il pas s'etonner icide voir ce heros, dont la force fabuleuse detruisait des legions etse frayait un passage au milieu des armees, pousser la douceur et lasoumission envers le beau sexe jusqu'a se laisser mettre en lambeaux, niplus ni moins que n'eut fait Don Quichotte, le modele de la chevalerie?Cet ensemble de force et de tendresse caracterise Kourroglou d'un bout al'autre du poeme. Enfin, n'en pouvant plus supporter davantage, maisne voulant pas lever la main sur des femmes, il se jette dans la pieced'eau, la traverse a la nage, en elevant sa guitare au-dessus de satete, et gagnant le milieu, ou l'eau jaillissait d'un pilier de marbre,il s'assit en cet endroit.Les femmes commencerent a lui jeter des pierres, "O Belli-Ahmed! tu m'astrompe, pensait Kourroglou. Elle ne m'a jamais aime."Alors il se mit a chanter, et la, vraiment, il lui dit de si belleschoses, que son sein commence a palpiter, et qu'elle l'ecoute "avec unplaisir toujours croissant."Le soleil est leve sur la colline de l'Orient. Elle est le jardin desfleurs. Les roses ouvrent leurs boutons sur ses joues. Que nul ennemin'ose regarder dans le jardin de l'amant!... O Nighara! celui quitouchera ta ceinture une fois seulement deviendra immortel."CINQUIEME RENCONTRE.Le soir approchait. La fraicheur de l'eau calmait les souffrancesde Kourroglou. La princesse se dit: "Il repete sans cesse le nom deKourroglou. Ah! si c'etait lui-meme! Parle, avoue la verite, luidit-elle, es-tu Kourroglou?" Et comme il l'assurait, elle reprit:"Kourroglou est, dit-on, de la meme taille que mon pere le sultan. Jevais te faire essayer sa robe royale. Si elle est trop longue pour toi,je ferai enfoncer des clous dans tes talons afin que tu deviennes plusgrand. Si elle est trop courte, je te ferai couper les pieds. Si elleest trop large, je te ferai ouvrir le ventre, et on le remplira depaille pour te grossir."Kourroglou dit: "Tu me punis selon le code d'Abou-Horeyra. N'importe,j'essaierai la robe."Il sortit de l'eau, et Nighara, de ses propres mains, lui passa la robe.Elle semblait avoir ete faite pour lui. Alors ils jeterent leur mainautour du cou l'un de l'autre, et entrerent dans le pavillon, ou,suivant la coutume turque, ils burent dans la meme coupe. Alors laprincesse dit: "As-tu amene ici ton fameux cheval Kyrat?--Oui, je l'aiamene.--Il faut donc que tu trouves pour moi un autre cheval aussi bonque Kyrat."Kourroglou voyant les progres qu'il faisait dans le coeur de laprincesse se mit a chanter:"Humide, humide est la neige que l'on voit au sommet des grandesmontagnes! Tes yeux brillants soufflent la fraicheur sur mon coeurembrase! Mon cher amour est couvert d'habits couleur de rose; elle esttout entiere d'une teinte rose. L'eau qu'elle boit est aussi pure quel'azur du ciel. Ses yeux sont enivres d'amour et de vin."Je suis Kourroglou. Ne suis-je pas libre de me promener dans cesbosquets? Je ne puis marcher en liberte dans le monde, car le monde esttrop etroit pour moi."Kourroglou ayant combine son plan avec la princesse, reprit ses habitsde mollah et sortit du harem comme il y etait entre. Il fut arrete a laporte par les gardes, qui lui dirent: "Saint homme, puisque tu as accesaupres de la princesse, commande-lui, au nom du ciel, de nous fairetoucher notre paie; car, depuis le depart du sultan son pere, nousn'avons pas recu une obole.--Je vous jure que je vous ferai payer, dit Kourroglou, et, enattendant, pour lui marquer votre mecontentement, vous devez abandonnervos postes, et vous refuser a escorter la princesse."Ayant donne cet avis charitable, le fourbe retourne chez sa vieillehotesse, et va ensuite acheter au bazar un beau poulain de trois ans, leramene a l'etable, prepare lui-meme la selle, et, au lever du soleil,en entendant les trompettes sonner pour annoncer une promenade dela princesse hors la ville, il paie magnifiquement sa vieille, luiconseille de se cacher afin de n'etre point persecutee a cause de lui,et monte sur Kyrat, suivi par le poulain attache a son etrier, il s'enva sur la route attendre Nighara, qui bientot arrive dans son chariot.Il l'enleve des bras de ses femmes, la met en croupe et s'enfuit avecelle dans le desert. La, tombant de fatigue, il s'etend sur le gazon etcede au sommeil. La princesse lui demande s'il compte dormir longtemps."Mon sommeil est de deux sortes, lui dit-il. Le plus court est de troisjournees, le plus long est de sept journees. Mais ecoute, ma bien-aimee.Kyrat a le don de pressentir l'approche de mes ennemis. Quand l'ennemise met en route pour me poursuivre, Kyrat hennit; quand l'ennemi est amoitie chemin, Kyrat devient inquiet et souffle avec ses narines; quandl'ennemi est tout pres de se montrer, Kyrat gratte la terre et l'ecumelui vient a la bouche." La princesse se plaint vainement du long sommedont son amant la menace en plein desert et au milieu des dangers. Ilfaut que Kourroglou dorme ou qu'il perisse; a cette robuste organisationil faut un repos semblable a celui de la mort. Elle examine Kyrat avecinquietude, et quand elle a vu signaler le depart et la marche del'ennemi, quand elle a remarque ses sabots grattant la terre et sabouche couverte d'ecume, elle eveille Kourroglou, ainsi qu'elle a eteavertie par lui de le faire. Aussitot il se leve, rattache les sanglesde son coursier, fait monter Nighara sur l'autre, et attend de piedferme le jeune sultan Burji, qui accourt a la delivrance de sa soeurNighara. Kourroglou, par ses terribles chansons, porte l'epouvante dansle coeur des guerriers du prince, et bientot, s'elancant au milieud'eux, il les disperse comme un troupeau de gazelles. Mais Burji-Sultan,resolu a reconquerir sa soeur, s'elance seul contre lui. "Que faire? ditKourroglou dans son coeur; si je tue le frere de ma bien-aimee, elle neme le pardonnera jamais et remplira ma vie d'amertume." Nighara se prenda pleurer. "O Kourroglou! je n'ai qu'un frere, ne le tue pas.--Mon amie,ne crains rien," dit Kourroglou. Et, s'adressant au prince: "Le chef detes ecuries ne gagne pas le pain qu'il mange; il n'a pas seulement serreles sangles de ton cheval. Je t'avertis que tu roules sur ta selle.Descends et raccourcis tes sangles, tu combattras ensuite contre moi."Le Turc credule descend pour arranger sa selle. Pendant ce temps,Kourroglou s'approche avec precaution, le renverse, s'assied sur lui etfeint de vouloir le tuer. Burji pleure et se lamente: "Le sultan monpere n'avait qu'une fille et un fils; tu enleves l'une, tu vas tuerl'autre. Toute la famille va etre eteinte.--Je t'accorde la vie acondition que tu me donnes ta soeur en mariage. Je suis aussi savantqu'un mollah; j'ai lu les sept volumes des commentaires arabes sur leKoran; je sais par coeur toutes les formules usitees dans les mariages."Le prince prononce avec lui la priere nuptiale consacree par le Koran,et lui accorde sa soeur. Kourroglou le releve, l'embrasse au front, etlui dit: "Desormais, au nom et par l'autorite du sultan Murad ton pere,je gouverne et regne a Chamly-Bill. Ou aurait-il trouve un meilleurparti pour sa fille?"En continuant leur route vers Chamly-Bill, Kourroglou et Nigharatraversent encore quelques aventures. Ils penetrent dans le camp d'unjeune Europeen qui tombe amoureux de Nighara, et veut l'enlever a sonepoux. Kourroglou est force de detruire sa suite et de piller sestresors; il est meme au moment de le tuer pour lui apprendre a vivre,lorsque Nighara, touchee de l'amour de ce jeune homme, le fait sauver,et menace Kourroglou d'avaler un poison mortel cache dans l'anneauqu'elle porte au doigt s'il n'abandonne pas sa poursuite. Kourroglou sesoumet, et continue son voyage avec elle. Nighara montait a cheval aussibien que lui-meme, et pouvait fournir une course aussi hardie, aussirapide que la sienne. Ils surprirent une caravane, se firent payer uneriche redevance, et la, encore, Nighara obtint grace de la vie pour lemarchand.Elle blamait beaucoup son epoux de commettre toutes ces violences. Illui repondit avec la franchise d'un honnete Turcoman: _Je ne laboure nine trafique; il faut donc que je vole_. L'argument etait sans replique.Enfin ils atteignent les portes de Chamly-Bill. Les brigands vinrent aleur rencontre avec des acclamations, des chants et des decharges demousqueterie. "Guerrier, dit la princesse a Kourroglou, lequel d'entreeux est Ayvaz? Montre-le-moi.Improvisation de Kourroglou:"Regarde ici, mon cher amour: ce cavalier est Ayvaz. Regarde-le, etpreserve mon ame du lit de feu de la jalousie. Regarde, voila Ayvaz;mais ne tombe point amoureuse de lui. Dans sa main etincelle un bouclierhezzare. Le miel de l'eloquence est sur sa langue; et _la ligne dupinceau de la main du Tout-Puissant_ est sur l'arc de ses sourcils.Regarde; mais n'en tombe pas amoureuse. Ce n'est qu'un garcon dequatorze ans. Une plume de grue est sur sa tete. Ce cavalier est Ayvaz,oui, Ayvaz lui-meme."Il presenta alors son epouse a ses compagnons en leur disant: "Nousdevons tous l'honorer, elle est la fille du sultan de Turquie;" etNighara s'etant assise sur le seuil de la porte de la forteresse, lessept cent soixante-dix-sept cavaliers de la garde sacree de Kourroglouse prosternerent devant elle, "O Dieu! s'ecria Kourroglou, sois beniet ton nom glorifie! Je dois a ta seule bonte d'avoir realise mes pluscheres esperances!" Il frappa les cordes de sa guitare et chanta ainsi:"Les nuages de l'adversite ont ete dissipes par la foi de Kourroglou.Ils se sont evanouis comme la brume du matin. Voici mon Ayvaz."Nighara fit son entree couchee sur les riches coussins d'un palanquind'honneur. Toutes les femmes et toutes les esclaves de Kourroglouvinrent a sa rencontre, et l'introduisirent respectueusement dans leharem. Belly-Ahmed fut tire de sa prison et recompense par un despremiers grades dans la troupe. Ce meme jour, on celebra le mariagede Kourroglou et celui d'Ayvaz, auquel le maitre donna une femme. Lesmusiciens, danseurs et jongleurs vinrent en foule. Le vin coula partorrents, et il coule encore a cette heure, dit ordinairement le _khan_pour clore cette rapsodie.SIXIEME RENCONTRE.Dans un des districts de l'Anatolie vit une grande tribu de nomadesconnus sous le nom de Haniss. Elle est composee de trente mille famillesqui sont toutes riches et qui habitent un pays magnifique. Chacun deces chefs consacre sa vie a quelque objet favori. L'un aime les beauxvelements, un autre prefere les femmes, et un troisieme est passionnepour les chiens de chasse ou les faucons. Leur chef, Hassan-Pacha,aimait les chevaux par-dessus tout. Quand il entendait parler d'un beaucheval, il n'epargnait ni argent ni peine pour se le procurer.Un jour, Hassan-Pacha vint dans ses ecuries, et, apres avoir examineplusieurs de ses chevaux, il dit a son vizir: "Certainement, aucun roi,dans les cinq parties du monde, ne peut se vanter d'avoir une ecuriecomme celle-ci." Le vizir repliqua: "Aucun roi, il est vrai, n'ad'ecurie comme celle-ci; mais Kourroglou a un cheval a Chamly-Bill, dunom de Kyrat, et Keyvan lui-meme, celui qui gouverne les sept cieux, nepossede pas son pareil.--O mon vizir! je suis pret a donner tout ceque j'ai pour acquerir ce joyau.--Pacha, ce n'est pas chose facile.Kourroglou ne manque pas d'argent, et il n'y a aucune possibilite de luiprendre son cheval de force.--Vizir, a l'homme qui m'amenera ce chevalje donnerai la moitie de mon pouvoir; s'il dit: "Ce n'est pas assez," jelui donnerai la moitie de mes richesses; et si cela meme ne le contentepas, j'ai sept filles, il aura la liberte de choisir la plus belle poursa femme. Va, et fais proclamer a son de trompe, dans la direction desquatre vents, a tous les camps de notre tribu, l'ordre suivant: "Qu'ilsoit bey ou mendiant, vieux ou jeune, il sera mon gendre celui quim'amenera Kyrat."Il y avait dans la tribu de Haniss un certain marmiton nomme Hamza, dontla tete et les sourcils etaient chauves, et qui etait marque de petiteverole. Cet homme, ayant entendu la proclamation, accourut aupresdu vizir nu-pieds et a peine vetu. "Que proclame-t-on ainsi,vizir?--Qu'est-ce que cela te fait, a toi, vilaine tete chauve?--Jedemande seulement de quoi il s'agit?" Le vizir le mit au fait, etajouta: "L'homme qui reussira sera riche.--Qu'ai-je besoin d'argent? ditHamza; douze livres d'ecorce de melon d'eau que l'on me donne a mangerchaque jour dans les cuisines suffisent a mon appetit." Le pacha prometde partager son pouvoir et ses richesses, et de donner l'une de ses septfilles pour femme a celui qui lui amenera Kyrat. Aussitot Hamza dressales oreilles. "Vizir, j'ai vu les sept filles du pacha; mais s'ilconsentait a me donner la plus jeune...--Celui qui amenera le chevalaura le droit de choisir." Hamza se frappa la poitrine avec sesdeux mains, et dit: "Regarde-moi, regarde-moi; je suis l'homme quichoisira.--En verite? dis-moi comment, par exemple.--Le pacha auraKyrat; mais il faut que tu me conduises d'abord en sa presence." Levizir pensa: depuis tant de jours que nous faisons publier cetteproclamation, il ne s'est encore trouve personne qui voulut en profiter.Voici le premier et le dernier; il faut le faire voir au pacha.Hamza fut introduit devant le pacha. "Est-ce toi, pauvre tete felee, quias promis de m'amener Kyrat?--Moi-meme; mais que me donneras-tu pourcela, pacha?--Je te donnerai la moitie de mes richesses.--Je n'ai pasbesoin de richesses,--Je te donnerai la moitie de mon pouvoir.--Je n'aipas besoin de ton pouvoir; qu'en ferais-je?--Tu choisiras celle de mesfilles que tu voudras.--Pacha, je ne puis croire a tes paroles.--Quepuis-je faire de plus pour te convaincre?--Jure, en baisant le Koran,que, dans le cas ou tu violerais ta parole, tu divorceras d'avec chacunede tes sept femmes." Le pacha en fit le serment. Hamza lui dit: "Je suisdepuis longtemps amoureux de la plus jeune de tes filles; si je perds lavie dans cette expedition, je n'en aurai nul regret; si, au contraire,je ramene le cheval, j'aurai ta fille." Le pacha dit: "Tu l'auras;" etil baisa le Koran.Hamza partit en hate pour Chamly-Bill, ou l'arrivee d'un pauvre diablecomme lui fut a peine remarquee. Apres un mois de sejour dans ce lieu,il pensa dans son coeur: "Tachons de pecher Daly-Ahmed avec l'hameconde l'amitie. Je trouverai peut-etre ainsi moyen de m'introduire dansl'ecurie." Il entra alors dans la cour de l'ecurie avec circonspectionet a pas lents. Apres avoir dechire sa chemise sur sa poitrine, ilramassa un tas de fumier; et, se jetant dessus, il se mit a pleurer et agemir a haute voix. Les larmes coulaient de ses yeux comme la pluie d'unnuage. Daly-Mehter, ecuyer de Kourroglou, passait justement de ce cote;il vit un malheureux, tout nu et en larmes, assis sur ce tas de fumier.Son coeur fut emu de pitie. Tout le monde sait que les fous[26] sonttres-portes a la pitie: "Pourquoi cries-tu ainsi, tete chauve?" Hamzarepondit: "Puisse-je devenir ton esclave! Je suis orphelin et etranger;grace a la laideur de mon front chauve, personne ne veut me prendre ason service. Je desirerais pourtant trouver un maitre qui put me donnerun morceau de pain." Daly-Mehter pensa: "Tout le monde vit du pain deKourroglou; je prendrai cet homme a l'ecurie, et je le nourrirai." Pourcommencer, il releva ses manches jusqu'au coude; et remplissant un vased'eau chaude, il lava la tete d'Hamza, et, l'ayant nettoye entierement,il lui donna ses vieux habits pour se vetir. Hamza le chauve montra tantde zele et d'habilete dans son service, que la raison de Daly-Mehter luiechappait d'etonnement. Un des deux meilleurs chevaux de cette ecurieetait Kyrat, qui etait attache, par une jambe, a une chaine dontKourroglou portait toujours la clef dans sa poche. L'autre, montehabituellement par Ayvaz, se nommait Durrat. Ce cheval etait aussiattache separement, et la clef de son cadenas etait dans la poche deDaly-Mehter.[Footnote 26: Par allusion a la signification litterale du mot _daly_,fou, tete faible.]Toutes ces circonstances furent bientot connues de Hamza, qui commenca adesesperer de pouvoir jamais s'emparer de Kyrat. Kourroglou vint unjour a l'ecurie, et trouva Daly-Mehter endormi. Il regarda, et vit unmiserable en guenilles et a tete pelee, qui etrillait Kyrat avec unebrosse et un morceau de drap. Kourroglou et Hamza ne s'etaient jamaisvus auparavant. Kyrat etait tendu comme un arc, sous la pression de lapuissante main de Hamza; et sa robe etait toute luisante, par le faitde son excellent pansement. Kourroglou trembla de toutes ses jambes, etpensa dans son coeur: "L'homme sous le bras duquel Kyrat est plie ainsine peut pas etre un homme ordinaire." Il cria: "Chien pele, tu vasemporter la peau du cheval: est-ce la la maniere de l'etriller?"Hamza prit un gros marteau de fer dans une niche, et, le levant surKourroglou, il cria: "Que viens-tu faire dans cette ecurie? Va-t'en,vagabond." Car, il lui avait ete enjoint par Daly-Mehter de ne permettrea personne d'entrer dans l'ecurie. Kourroglou dit: "Fou, comment oses-tulever ta main sur moi?" Daly-Mehter fut tire de son sommeil par cebruit. Il se releva, et salua son maitre: "Quel est cet homme que tu asengage a mon service?--Puisse-je devenir ta victime! Des milliersde gens vivent de ton pain. Cette tete chauve est tres-habile ettres-adroite, et peut, aussi bien que tant d'autres, profiter de teslargesses.--Je ne refuse mon pain a personne; qu'il en mange autantqu'il voudra; mais, a juger de ses jambes et de toute son allure, jen'attends rien de bon de lui; il a l'air d'un voleur de chevaux.--Oh!non, seigneur; s'il etait de fer, on ne pourrait faire plus de cinqaiguilles de ce pauvre diable!"Hamza comprit alors que c'etait la Kourroglou, il jeta son marteau aterre, et, dans sa terreur, il courut se cacher sous le bat d'une mule.Kourroglou, avant de quitter l'ecurie, dit a Daly-Mehter: "Attachetoujours un oeil vigilant sur mon cheval; ne donne ta confiance apersonne." Il ne poussa pas plus loin cette enquete.Plus Hamza restait attache a l'ecurie, plus il reconnaissaitl'impossibilite de voler Kyrat. Il dit donc dans son coeur: "Si ce n'estKyrat, ce sera au moins Durrat. Le premier est pere du second, et samere etait une jument arabe. Hassan-Pacha ne les a jamais vus ni l'un nil'autre: il me croira, il me donnera sa fille; et s'il arrive jamaisa connaitre la verite, il ne me l'otera pas, apres que je l'auraiepousee."Pendant la nuit il appreta la selle de Durrat et tous les harnais quien dependaient. Daly-Mehter etait ivre quand il revint du palais deKourroglou, et voyant que Hamza pleurait amerement, le visage appuyesur ses mains, comme s'il etait devenu veuf, il demanda: "Qu'as-tu,Hamza?--Seigneur, comment puis-je m'empecher de pleurer? Chaque nuittu vas avec Kourroglou boire du vin rouge, et tu ne t'es jamais dit:Apportons en quelques gouttes au pauvre orphelin. Helas! qu'est-ce quecela, du vin? je n'en ai jamais vu. Est-ce doux ou acide?"Daly-Mehter se leva, prit le bidon de l'ecurie, et s'en fut au cellierde Kourroglou. Ayant rempli le bidon, il le rapporta, le mit devantHamza et lui dit: "Bois, tete chauve." Hamza remplit un vase jusqu'aubord, et le tendit a Daly-Mehter. "Seigneur, essaie le premier; que jevoie comment tu bois." Daly-Mehter vida le vase jusqu'a la dernieregoutte, et dit: "Voici la maniere de boire." Hamza remplit le vase ason tour, et l'ayant approche de ses levres, il donna une secousse siadroite, qu'il repandit tout le breuvage par-dessus son epaule, sans queDaly-Mehter s'en apercut. De cette maniere, il grisa si bien l'ecuyer,que ce dernier a la fin tomba comme mort sur le plancher. Hamza dit dansson coeur: "Il n'est pas convenable que je me montre sous ces haillons."Il ota donc ses vieux habits, et ayant depouille Daly-Mehter, il changeade vetements avec lui. Il trouva dans la poche de l'ivrogne la cle de lachaine de Durrat, conduisit le cheval hors de l'ecurie, lui mit laselle sur le dos, et s'en fut comme une etoile Filante sur la route quiconduisait au camp de la tribu de Haniss.Kourroglou vint de bonne heure a l'ecurie; il n'avait point de ceinture,car il sortait du harem. Il regarda et vit Kyrat a sa place ordinaire,mais Durrat avait disparu. Il devina, tout de suite que la tete chauvel'avait vole. Il appela l'ecuyer. Daly-Mehter se releva, se frotta lesyeux, et salua. "Vilain, que signifient ces haillons que je vois surtoi? Quel est ce tour de jongleur?"Le pauvre ecuyer regardait ses habits, et n'en pouvait croire ses yeux."Ou est Durrat?--Seigneur, Hamza doit l'avoir emmene pour le promener oule faire boire.--Ne le disais-je pas, que c'etait un voleur de chevaux?Vite, que l'on selle Kyrat!"Kourroglou, arme, monta au sommet de la plus proche montagne, surlaquelle ses sentinelles avancees etaient postees; il examina le pays, al'aide d'un telescope, jusqu'a ce qu'il decouvrit enfin le fuyard. Il levit volant comme une fleche vers ses tentes.Il fut transporte de rage et rugit sur la montagne: "Miserable voleur,ou fuis-tu, ou fuis-tu? Tu peux aller aussi loin que Istambul; je t'ysuivrai, et je m'emparerai de toi."La voix de Kourroglou, quand il etait en colere, pouvait s'entendre a unmille de distance. Hamza la reconnut de loin, et dit: "O pere celeste,la vie est douce: Malheur, malheur a moi!" Il regarda devant lui, etvit un village a peu de distance. Il dit dans son coeur: "Si je pouvaisgagner ce village, mon ame pourrait encore etre sauvee." On voyait unprofond ravin a l'entree du village. "Qui peut dire, pensa Hamza, si,avant que j'aie atteint ce village, Kourroglou n'aura pas _brule monpere!_"Au fond du ravin se trouvait un moulin; le meunier etait absent, et lesroues restaient oisives. Hamza y courut, attacha la bride de Durrat ala porte, et entra dans le batiment desert. La, il trouva la robe dumeunier qu'il mit sur lui, et il se frotta de farine de la tete auxpieds.On sait que lorsqu'un homme a fait une course rapide, ses yeux sontcomme couverts d'un brouillard, et que sa vue n'est pas tres-clairependant quelque temps. Kourroglou ne reconnut pas Hamza, et demanda:"Meunier, ou est le cavalier qui monte le cheval attache a ta porte?--O mon agha! le cavalier s'est precipite ici, saisi d'une tellecrainte, qu'il a couru sa cacher sous la roue."Kourroglou, tout tremblant de rage, descendit de cheval: "Tiens moncheval." Il tira alors son poignard, et courut a la recherche du voleur.Kyrat avait cette qualite, qu'il obeissait en toute chose a quiconque lerecevait en depot de la main de Kourroglou. Il se laissa guider comme unenfant. Hamza, qui n'etait pas sot, jeta la robe de meunier a bas, etsauta sur Kyrat. Il essaya d'un temps de galop, et revint attendretranquillement Kourroglou, qui, ayant tourne sens dessus dessous tout cequ'il y avait dans le moulin, et n'y trouvant pas une ame, sortit et vitDurrat a la porte. Aux pieds de Durrat, la robe du meunier gisait parterre; un peu plus loin on voyait le victorieux Hamza sous sa propreforme, monte sur Kyrat. Il pensa dans son coeur: "J'ai fait la un marchecapital! plaise a Dieu que je ne le regrette pas quand il sera troptard!" Et il s'ecria: "Hamza-Beg!--Quel est ton plaisir, nobleguerrier?--Nous allons revenir a la maison, mais nous irons au pas, leschevaux sont fatigues.--Ou dis-tu que tu veux aller?--A Chamly-Bill. Tum'as offense sans raison; et je suis venu le chercher en personne.--Neplaisante pas davantage, Kourroglou. J'ai cherche le cheval dans leciel, mais, Dieu soit loue, je l'ai trouve sur la terre. Tu as daigne mefaire present de Kyrat, de ta propre main. Puisses-tu jouir d'une vieet d'un bonheur sans fin! Seulement ne me demande pas de te suivre.--Jet'en conjure, je l'en prie, Hamza, je deviendrai ton esclave! Dis,sont-ce des richesses, un cheval, une femme, que tu convoites? Guerrier,je te jure que tu auras toute chose en abondance. Tu as le choix; toutce que je possede t'appartient.--Je ne serai pas la dupe de ta ruse.Ce que je desire ne t'appartient pas: je te ferai connaitre la verite.J'aime la plus jeune des filles de Hassan-Pacha, qui a promis de me ladonner pour femme, en echange de Kyrat. Depuis six mois et plus, jelanguissais de desespoir a Chamly-Bill. Maintenant regarde, j'emmeneKyrat, et tu es toi-meme la cause de mon bonheur. Puisses-tu vivreheureux et longtemps! Je m'en vais prendre femme.--Hamza-Beg! rends-moiseulement le cheval, et je t'apporterai sur mon sabre la tete deHassan-Pacha.--Ce serait une conduite basse de ma part; quelle preuve decourage montrerais-je aux yeux de ma fiancee?"Les prieres et les promesses de Kourroglou ne servirent a rien. Hamzajura par la plus pure essence de Dieu qu'il ne rendrait pas le cheval.Kourroglou poussa un profond soupir du fond de sa poitrine, et dit:"Hamza-Beg! permets-moi de chanter un air qui me vient a la memoire."_Improvisation_.--"Sans Kyrat, la vie et le monde ne sont qu'un fardeaupour moi. Pauvre Kourroglou! maintenant que Kyrat a quitte tes mains, tudois te frapper la tete de douleur, Kourroglou!"Hamza regardait Kourroglou pendant que celui-ci continuait de chanterainsi:_Improvisation_.--"Tu as du demander Kyrat a Dieu meme. La queue deKyrat etait un bouquet de fleurs. Monter sur lui c'etait monter lebonheur en personne. O Kourroglou! que Dieu le le rende! Je me noie dansune mer profonde; le chagrin de la perle de Kyrat se pose comme unepierre sur mon ame, et m'entraine dans l'abime. Je suis un paysan, unmeunier, loin de moi cette epee, Kourroglou, tu devras maintenant crier"du ble, du ble[27]!"[Footnote 27: C'est un cri par lequel les meuniers sur la plate-forme deleur moulin font connaitre qu'ils n'ont plus rien a moudre.]Kourroglou avait l'air d'un fou, il disait: "Sans Kyrat je ne merite pasd'etre un guerrier."Hamza dit: "O Kourroglou! tes paroles ont brule mon foie. Va aChamly-Bill, et demeure en repos pendant six mois. A la fin de ce temps,tu peux prendre l'habit d'un Aushik[28], et venir au camp de la tribu deHaniss. Je vais y mener Kyrat, et j'epouserai la fille du pacha; mais jete jure que de meme que j'ai recu Kyrat de tes propres mains, de meme jete rendrai de mes propres mains les renes et le cheval.--Comment puis-jesavoir, o Hamza-Beg, si tu es sincere ou non dans tes paroles?--Je jurepar le plus pur etre de Dieu. J'ai l'ame noble, et je te le repeteencore, je conduirai moi-meme Kyrat par la bride, et je te le rendrai."[Footnote 28: Chanteur improvisateur.]Cela dit, il tourna la tete de Kyrat, et s'en fut vers le camp de latribu de Haniss. Kourroglou contempla son bien-aime cheval jusqu'a cequ'il eut disparu dans l'eloignement. Triste, et les yeux baisses, ilretourna sur ses pas et monta sur Durrat. Tous les bandits etaientsortis de Chamly-Bill afin de voir quelle figure ferait Hamza, ramenepar Kourroglou; mais quand ils virent leur chef seul et monte surDurrat, ils se dirent entre eux: "Kourroglou aura ete attrape par cetteadroite tete pelee." Ils eurent peur de la colere de Kourroglou, et sedisperserent dans toutes les directions. Chacun d'eux comme un rat, secacha dans quelque trou. Ayvaz seul fut assez hardi pour parler, etdit: "Agha, tu as fait un bon marche; Durrat pour Kyrat! As-tu pris levoleur?--Va-t'en, sot enfant!" Le jeune homme effraye s'eloigna.Kourroglou s'en fut dans le harem, et, pendant les six mois quisuivirent, il ne bougea pus de la chambre de Nighara. Au bout de cetemps, il dit: "Nighara, Hamza m'a fait une promesse: il faut quej'aille la-bas et que j'y meure ou que je revienne avec Kyrat."Il se leva, revetit l'habit d'un Aushik, et, apres avoir pris conge desa femme, il partit.En s'approchant du camp des Haniss, il se preparait a passer une largeriviere, quand il remarqua sur le sable la trace des pieds d'un chevalqui l'avait franchie en un saut, d'une rive a l'autre. Il dit dans soncoeur: "Nul cheval au monde, excepte mon Kyrat, ne pourrait accomplirune chose semblable. Hamza a du venir ici avec lui."Etant entre dans le camp, il mit un temps considerable a faire le tourdes tentes nombreuses et des cordes tendues qui en marquaient leslimites. Fidele a son role, il chantait tout le temps de sa plus bellevoix, charmant et egayant tous ceux qu'il rencontrait; et toutes seschansons etaient a l'eloge du cheval.Cette nouvelle parvint bientot aux oreilles du pacha; ce seigneur etaitde mauvaise humeur, parce que depuis le jour ou Kyrat lui avait eteamene par Hamza, il n'avait pu encore monter ce cheval, qui etaitattache dans l'ecurie et ne souffrait que personne s'approchat de lui,si ce n'est Hamza-Beg. Le pacha ordonna que Kourroglou fut amene en sapresence. Il lui fit un accueil gracieux, et lui permit de s'asseoirdans sa tente. "On dit que tu es habile dans l'art de louer les chevaux:tu arrives justement dans un lieu ou tu peux voir une ecurie qui n'a passa pareille dans tout l'univers." Kourroglou eut peur que Hamza-Beg nele trahit; il regarda, et, voyant que ce dernier etait absent, il chantal'eloge suivant:_Improvisation_.--"Laissez-moi chanter l'eloge d'un cheval arabe. Sacriniere doit etre comme si elle etait de fils de soie; ses pieds nedoivent pas etre charnus. Ils sont exactement entoures de peau; sessabots ont l'air d'avoir ete tournes; ses fers ne doivent pas peser plusd'un okha d'argent; il doit etre robuste et d'une taille moyenne; soncou doit etre long, mince et uni comme un ruban. Quand on le sort del'ecurie, il bondit et se joue de mille manieres."--Bravo, Aushik! criale pacha, je n'ai jamais entendu louer le cheval avec tant de _methode_.Le celebre Kyrat qu'Hamza-Beg m'a amene possede toutes les qualites quetu as enumerees; mais de quel usage est-il pour moi? Il est si mechantet si fou, que je ne puis pas le monter.Kourroglou dit: "Longue vie au pacha! un cheval fou est le meilleur amonter.--Pour quelle raison?"Kourroglou chanta ainsi:_Improvisation_.--"Un noble cheval marche hardiment, comme s'ilcherchait a renverser son cavalier. Il secoue ses oreilles et tire sifort les renes que le cavalier doit le tenir ferme et ne donner aucunrepos a ses mains. Le cheval d'un guerrier-belier doit etre fou commeson maitre."Le pacha appela ses serviteurs: "Faites venir Hamza-Beg devant moi. Jedesire qu'il ecoute ces belles louanges du cheval."Hamza-Beg avait epouse la plus jeune fille du pacha, et il avait eteeleve au rang de grand vizir.Il vint, vetu d'un riche habit de fourrure; son turban etait du plusbeau cachemire, et il avait une suite de trois cents hommes.Il entra, et, saluant a peine de la tete le pacha, il s'assit sans qu'onle lui dit et s'etendit sur son siege.Kourroglou fut grandement surpris de voir tant de splendeur et degravite dans un homme qui, six mois auparavant, n'etait qu'un marmiton.Il se leva humblement de sa place et fit un profond salut. Un frissonglacial courut sur toute sa peau, et, en saluant, il placa la main surson coeur. Ce geste signifiait: Hamza-Beg! sois misericordieux et ne metrahis pas! Hamza-Beg, en reponse, placa la main sur ses yeux, ce quivoulait dire: "Ne crains rien et prends patience[29]!"[Footnote 29: La conversation par signes est portee a une grandeperfection en Perse. Je me rappelle qu'une fois, pendant ma visite a uncertain beglerberg, on lui amena un coupable qui ne voulait pas avouersa faute. Le beglerberg ordonna d'apporter les fouets et les felakas."Je jure que je suis innocent", s'ecria l'accuse, croisant sur sapoitrine ses deux poings fermes avec un seul doigt leve en avant. Lesexecuteurs etaient prets, regardant le beglerberg, qui, de son cote,fixait les yeux sur la poitrine de l'accuse: "Tu es coupable, drole,s'ecria-t-il.--Sur ta tete bienheureuse, je suis innocent", reponditl'accuse, croisant ses poings comme auparavant, avec cette differencequ'il y avait deux doigts au lieu d'un projetes en avant. Ilscontinuerent ainsi, l'accuse apres chaque menace du beglerberg, croisantses mains sur sa poitrine avec toujours plus de doigts leves. Enfin,quand apres une nouvelle protestation, il eut mis ses mains sur sapoitrine avec tous les doigts etendus, le beglerberg dit: "Allons,laissez-le aller. Peut-etre est-il reellement innocent. Retourne a tamaison, et fais que je n'entende pas de plaintes contre toi." Quandje quittai la maison du beglerberg, je remarquai que mes domestiquesriaient et chuchotaient entre eux, et j'obtins d'eux l'explicationsuivante: l'accuse avait fait d'abord entendre au beglerberg qu'il luidonnerait un tuman, s'il voulait le renvoyer; ensuite il lui en avaitpromis deux, trois et ainsi de suite; mais il n'obtint son pardon quelorsqu'il eut promis de payer dix tumans. (_Note de M. Chodzsko._)]Le pacha dit: "Nul doute que l'Aushik ne soit lui-meme un bon cavalier."Il se tourna vers Kourroglou et dit: "Aushik, serais-tu dans le cas demonter mon cheval?" Kourroglou se mit a pleurer et a se plaindre de cequ'on voulait, sans doute, lui donner quelque cheval fou qui le tueraitet rendrait ses enfants orphelins. Le pacha dit: "N'aie pas peur. Tuauras deux cents tumans de moi. Si le cheval te tuait, l'argent seraitremis a ta veuve et a tes orphelins, comme le prix de ton sang. Si tupeux descendre vivant de dessus son dos, je te donnerai l'argent commerecompense." Kourroglou dit: "Puisse le pacha nager dans le bonheur, etpuisse son regne etre long! Je suis content. Si je meurs, puisses-tuvivre de longs jours, seigneur!" Le pacha donna ordre au vizir d'allerchercher Kyrat.Le ruse Hamza-Beg pourvut a tout: voyant que Kourroglou n'avait pointd'armes avec lui, il reussit, en sellant Kyrat, a cacher une massue sousles housses et suspendit un sabre au pommeau de la selle. Il le bridaensuite et lui noua la queue. Six hommes suffisaient a peine pourconduire Kyrat hors de l'ecurie, tant il etait devenu gras et sauvage,apres six mois de repos. L'ecume jaillissait de ses naseaux. Kourroglouvit tout et chanta:_Improvisation_.--"O toi que j'ai eu pour la premiere fois entre mesmains dans le Turkestan, viens, Kyrat, viens, bonheur de ma vie! Tu estombe entre les mains d'un vilain. Viens, Kyrat, toi la plus chere detoutes les choses de ma vie, viens! J'ai pour toi un mors fait avecquinze livres de fer. Quand tu es courrouce, tu ne touches pas a tanourriture de trois jours; tu ne bronches pas dans une course dequarante milles. O Kyrat, toi, la plus chere des choses de ma vie,viens!"Le pacha dit: "Aushik, ma patience est epuisee; je t'ordonne de monterce cheval a l'instant meme."Kourroglou dit: "Je suis sur que le cheval me tuera. Beni soit le selque tu m'as donne; sois le protecteur de mes pauvres orphelins!...--Tupeux te tranquilliser; il ne te tuera pas. Je te recommande a laprotection des quatre premiers khalifes." En disant ces mots, le pachamit dans le sein de Kourroglou la bourse promise, avec les deux centstumans. Ce dernier dit: "Longue vie au pacha!" et il alla vers Kyrat.Hamza-Beg lui tendit les renes de ses propres mains, et lui dit toutbas: "Guerrier, la parole d'un guerrier est une parole. La promesseque je t'ai faite il y a six mois est remplie." Kourroglou lui dit al'oreille: "Pour cette conduite genereuse, je te jure, aussi longtempsque j'aurai un morceau de pain, je le partagerai avec toi." Hamza-Begdit: "Prends le sabre suspendu a la selle, attache-le a ta ceinture,tu trouveras aussi une massue sous les housses." Kourroglou montasur Kyrat, ceignit le sabre, et, tirant la massue, il la fit tournerau-dessus de sa tete. Hamza-Beg recula, comme s'il etait effraye, et secacha dans la foule. Quand Kourroglou sentit Kyrat sous lui, il devintsi joyeux, qu'il perdit toute sa raison et sa presence d'esprit. Ilfaisait trotter le cheval dans toutes les directions. Le pacha lerappela: "Aushik, donne-moi le cheval; il me parait tres-doux, ce matin:laisse-moi essayer de le monter." Kourroglou dit dans son coeur: "Je telaisserais plutot monter sur mon propre cou;" et il ajouta touthaut: "Pacha, permets-moi de te chanter un air, d'abord; ensuite, jedescendrai."._Improvisation_.--"Ce cheval peut courir, en un jour, d'Ardibil aKashan. Qu'importe le sultan, qu'importent tous les pachas a celui quiest monte sur ce cheval? Ce cheval ne s'arrete que tous les trentefersakh. O toi, bonheur de ma vie, tu es encore a moi."Il a franchi une grande riviere; j'ai reconnu l'empreinte de sespas. Oh! je baiserai chacun de tes sabots, je baiserai tes deux yeuxbrulants. Je remercie Dieu de te revoir, o mon Kyrat, bonheur de ma vie;tu es encore a moi."[Illustration: Chien pele, tu vas emporter la peau du cheval. (Page21.)]Le pacha dit: "Aushik, fais-le galoper encore une fois, je te regardecomme un habile cavalier." Kourroglou passa deux fois au galop pres del'endroit ou etait le pacha. "Bien, maintenant donne-le-moi, je veuxl'essayer moi-meme.--Pacha, tu ne le monteras pas."Le pacha se tourna vers Hamza-Beg, et dit: "Ce fou ne veut pas me rendrele cheval. Si c'etait Kourroglou lui-meme?" Hamza-Beg repondit: "Commentpuis-je le dire?--N'as-tu donc pas vu le bandit durant ton sejour aChamly-Bill?--Je ne l'ai pas vu. Mes yeux aussi bien que mon esprit ontete occupes tout le temps a trouver quelque moyen de derober Kyrat.Ce Kourroglou a plusieurs milliers de braves guerriers comme lui; quipourrait jamais tous les connaitre?" Le pacha, tournant son visagevers Kourroglou, dit: "Allons, amene ici le cheval, je veux le montermaintenant." Kourroglou dit: "Sante au pacha! un air me vient dans latete; ecoute-moi:_Improvisation_.--"Une course sur un cheval bai porte toujours bonheur.Le coeur du cavalier met en lui ses delices. Ses genoux sont noirs, soncou vous rappelle le cou du chameau _bagyar_[30]. Le coeur met en luises delices. Quand il marche, son pas est comme le pas du chameau_kosahk_[31]; quand il est en bon etat, son dos doit etre aussi largeque sa poitrine, et la distance entre ses jambes de derriere est tellequ'un archer peut s'asseoir entre pour tendre son arc. Le coeur met sesdelices en lui."[Footnote 30: Espece de chameau tres-estimee en Perse.][Footnote 31: Autre espece de chameau.]Le pacha dit: "Tu deviens trop familier, Aushik. Je t'ai deja dit quenous en avions assez; descends. Je desire monter Kyrat moi-meme."Kourroglou sourit avec mepris, et dit:"Pacha sans cervelle! je couvrirai ton turban de boue! Comment peux-tupenser a monter ce coursier? il a plus d'esprit que toi." Le pacha dit:"Hamza-Beg, dis-lui de descendre.--Je le lui ai dit, mais il refused'obeir. J'ai peur, en verite, que cet homme ne soit Kourroglou.Pourquoi lui as-tu donne le cheval?" Le pacha dit: "Allons, vite,descends, Aushik, es-tu sourd?" Kourroglou dit: "Pacha, je me rappelleun air; ecoute-moi:_Improvisation_.--"Le cheval est a moi. Je ferai couvrir son precieuxdos de housses de soie. Je le ferai baigner dans toute une riviere devin rouge. C'est l'elu de Kourroglou, l'elu entre cinq cents chevaux.Le coeur met en lui ses delices. Quand le chef des palefreniers,Daly-Mehter, s'approche de lui, il se leve sur ses jambes de derriere,et le palefrenier, pour le panser, est oblige de le frapper sur labouche avec un baton."[Illustration: Voici mon tribut. (Page 28.)]"Alors tu es Kourroglou, s'ecria le pacha; j'en remercie Dieu! Je t'aicherche dans le ciel, et je t'ai trouve sur la terre. Je vais te fairemettre en pieces ici, de telle sorte qu'il ne reste pas de traces de toisur la terre."Hamza-Beg, voyant que la querelle s'echauffait et que les choses, selontoute apparence, deviendraient pires encore, se retira pour voir aquelque distance comment elles finiraient. Le pacha cria: "Hamza-Beg,viens la, voici Kourroglou!" Hamza-Beg repliqua: "Oui, tu l'as dit; maisque puis-je faire contre lui? Ne t'ai-je pas conseille de ne pas luimettre le cheval entre les mains?" Le pacha fut epouvante, mais ilcontinua d'appeler Kourroglou, lui ordonnant de descendre. Kourroglouchanta ainsi:_Improvisation._--"Hassan-Pacha, ne te fie pas trop a ton pouvoir. J'aiplus d'un serviteur qui te vaut. Que te servira de gravir des montagneset des rochers? Crois-moi, le pied de ton cheval ne passera jamais surmes chemins. Aghas, sultans! regardez le vaste desert. J'aurai vos corpsenveloppes de la tete aux pieds dans la pourpre du sang. Je voustuerai tous avant de revoir Ayvaz. Mes serviteurs portent de lourdsdjezzairs[32] sur leurs epaules. Montrez-moi le heros qui puisse tendremon arc. Avancez, heroiques beliers! voyons si vous pouvez frapper unbouclier avec vos tetes. Je puis macher le fer et le cracher ensuitevers le ciel. Je suis le seigneur de Chamly-Bill et de ses montagnescouvertes sur leurs cretes de neiges aux mille couleurs. Je compte millehommes de chaque tribu sous ma banniere. Je puis seul montrer cent milleingenieuses devises."[Footnote 32: Longue arquebuse appelee aussi shamtal; elle porte a unegrande distance.]Le pacha commanda alors a ses hommes de le saisir. Kourroglou, surcela, s'ecria: "O Ali!" Et tirant l'epee du fourreau, il fondit sur lesnomades, comme un loup affame sur un troupeau. Des monceaux de cadavress'eleverent autour de lui, et le pacha prit la fuite. Kourroglou ditdans son coeur: "Hamza-Beg m'a rendu de tels services qu'il faut que jelui montre ma gratitude d'une maniere sensible. Je tuerai son beau-pere,afin qu'il regne desormais sur la tribu de Haniss." Alors, donnant del'eperon a Kyrat, il atteignit le pacha, et d'un coup de son sabre illui aplatit le crane comme la tete d'un pavot. Hamza-Beg vit le sort deson maitre, et, otant son turban, il se jeta sous les pieds de Kyrat,ce qui signifiait: Nous nous rendons; nous sommes tes prisonniers.Kourroglou dit: "Hamza-Beg, si j'ai tue le pacha, c'etait seulementpour faire de toi son successeur. Si dans ton coeur tu as quelque autredesir, dis-le-moi, que je puisse l'accomplir."Kourroglou, ayant etabli solidement l'autorite de son ami sur les tribusde Haniss, le quitta pour retourner a Chamly-Bill. En passant a traversles camps les plus eloignes, il jeta un regard dans l'interieur dequelques tentes. Les eunuques en sortirent aussitot, et lui reprocherentla hardiesse avec laquelle il se permettait d'examiner l'interieur destentes qui formaient le harem de Hassan-Pacha. Kourroglou demanda si lafemme de Hamza-Beg etait la. "Elle y est," fut la reponse. "Combien defilles avait Hassan-Pacha?--Sept; l'une d'elles est mariee a Hamza; lessix autres ne sont pas mariees.--Amenez-les ici, et faites-les placer enrang; je desire les voir." Quand ses ordres eurent ete executes, il dit:"Celle-la seule peut partir; c'est la femme d'Hamza-Beg, et elle estpour moi une fille, une soeur."Il fit choix de la plus jolie des sept soeurs, et la placa derrierelui sur sa selle. Il dit a l'eunuque: "Si Hamza-Beg demande ce qu'estdevenue la fille du pacha, tu lui diras que Kourroglou l'a emmenee aChamly-Bill pour son ancien maitre, Daly-Mehter."Et il s'en alla ainsi de bourgade en bourgade jusqu'a ce qu'il futarrive chez lui. Tous les bandits vinrent a sa rencontre. Kourroglou dita Ayvaz de faire venir Daly-Mehter devant lui, et d'envoyer la fille dupacha dans son propre harem. Aussitot que Daly-Mehter parut, Kourrogloudit: "Ecoute-moi, ecuyer, j'ai ete irrite contre toi a cause de Kyrat.Faisons la paix. J'ai amene la fille de Hassan-Pacha pour toi." Alors,se tournant vers Ayvaz, il dit: "Qu'aucune depense ne soit epargnee. Ilfaut que tu prepares des noces splendides; car c'est la fille d'un hommed'un rang eleve; elle doit etre honoree."Les ceremonies et les illuminations durerent pendant sept jours aChamly-Bill. A la fin du septieme jour, la nouvelle femme de Daly-Mehterfut conduite dans sa demeure.SEPTIEME RENCONTRE.L'histoire d'Hamza-Beg a ete un peu longue; mais il nous semble que sila sultane Scheherazade l'eut racontee au sultan Schaariar, il ne s'enserait pas plaint plus que des autres, et n'eut pas fait couper la tetefeconde de la belle rapsode, avant d'avoir vu au moins ce qui etaitadvenu de la tete chauve d'Hamza. Maintenant Kourroglou arrive a unepisode de sa vie qui se distingue de tous les autres par sa brieveteet sa couleur sinistre. Il y a un crime dans la vie de ce heros, et apartir de ce moment on voit le signe de la colere divine se lever a sonhorizon et envahir peu a peu la splendeur de son ciel. Le rapsode n'enfait pas la remarque, il ne dogmatise pas; on voit meme qu'il racontesans figure et sans complaisantes metaphores, comme a regret et penetred'effroi, le crime de son heros. Mais l'admirable instinct philosophiquequi est dans la conscience des poetes populaires se revele dansl'enchainement des aventures de Kourroglou. Qu'on ne croie donc pas quece sont des episodes pris au hasard dans le roman capricieux de sa vieerrante. Non; la memoire populaire est un artiste ingenieux, un poetequi ne manque pas de profondeur. Au premier coup d'oeil, nous avionspense que la vie de Kourroglou n'etait qu'un conte heroique et comique;mais arrives a la septieme rencontre, et voyant ensuite se deroulerla suite de ses derniers succes, puis de ses imprudences, puis de sesrevers et de ses profondes douleurs, enfin de ses infortunes jusqu'a samort deplorable, nous avons reconnu que c'etait la un veritable poeme,avec son sens philosophique, sa moralite et sa personnification del'etre humain (d'une race peut-etre en particulier), dans un individupoetique. Nul doute que Kourroglou a existe, et que le fond de sonhistoire est authentique: c'est le Napoleon de la race nomade; et s'ilest deja devenu fabuleux, c'est que, pour les esprits illettres, deuxsiecles equivalent peut-etre a deux mille ans. Mais la tradition faitl'histoire d'apres les memes regles morales qu'observent les hommes degenie pour l'ecrire. Elle comprend qu'un heros n'est qu'une incarnationplus riche de l'esprit qui anime ses contemporains. Elle ne lui donneradonc ni vertus, ni vices, ni facultes qui ne soient en rapport avec ceuxde sa race et de son temps. Kourroglou traversant les precipices et lesfleuves a la course de son cheval, massacrant a lui seul une armee,mangeant et buvant comme les heros de Rabelais, est au fond de ce milieufantastique un homme tres-reel, un caractere tres-sainement developpe.C'est ainsi qu'a procede Hoffmann dans ses bons jours; c'est pourcela que, parmi de nombreuses aberrations, il a cree plusieurschefs-d'oeuvre.Kourroglou etait marque en naissant d'un signe de grandeur. Il avaitde grandes choses a faire, pour lui-meme et pour sa race: venger lesupplice de son pere et affranchir les _vaillants hommes_ de son tempsdu joug des _sunnites impies_. Mais comme les vaillants hommes de sontemps, il est ne temeraire et orgueilleux. Une ardente curiosite, unevanite secrete l'ont deja prive d'une partie des avantages que son perele magicien devait lui procurer. On se rappelle que ce pere, ce magicien(qui, entre nous, me parait etre une personnification du Destin, toutpuissant et aveugle comme lui), lui avait prepare, par ses savantesincantations, un cheval qui l'eut porte jusqu'au ciel; car il avait desailes, et c'est un regard d'irresistible curiosite de Kourroglou quiles a fait tomber de ses flancs lumineux. Kyrat sera encore le premiercheval du monde, a dit le pere; mais ce ne sera plus Pegase, et sespieds rapides sont pour jamais enchaines a la terre.Une seconde imprudence de Kourroglou cause l'eternelle douleur et lamort de son pere. On se rappelle qu'il devait lui rapporter dans un vasel'ecume d'une source mysterieuse; mais l'ecume le tente, il la boit, etle pere ne reverra plus la lumiere des cieux. "A partir de ce jour,tu n'es plus Roushan, dit le magicien, tu es Kourroglou, le fils del'aveugle," c'est-a-dire le fils du Destin, et ce nom fera ta gloire etta condamnation. Tu as venge ton pere, mais tu l'as laisse perir; tuseras le plus grand guerrier de ton siecle, mais tu seras maudit; tuporteras la peine de ton orgueil au milieu de tes prosperites, et, commeton pere, tu finiras miserablement.Jusqu'ici nous avons vu reussir, comme par miracle, toutes lesaudacieuses tentatives de Kourroglou. Il a rassemble mille hommes dechaque tribu, il s'est bati une forteresse que nul souverain n'ose plusattaquer. Il a enleve Ayvaz et Nighara, ces deux objets de sa tendresse;mais Ayvaz le trahira, et Nighara, pas plus que ses sept centsoixante-dix-sept femmes, ne lui fera connaitre la joie et l'orgueil dela paternite. Chacune de ses entreprises sera couronnee de succes enapparence, et sera expiee dans l'ensemble mysterieux de sa vie par depoignantes douleurs. On verra bientot (et on l'a vu deja par ce cri del'ame qui lui echappe au milieu de ses plus menacantes improvisations:_la vie est un fardeau pour moi!_), qu'il pressent la fatalite attacheea tous ses pas. L'orgueil est son mauvais ange, l'orgueil doit leperdre, l'orgueil le rend criminel; cet orgueil sera chatie. Ses grandesfacultes, je ne sais pas s'il ne faut pas dire pour entrer dans l'espritde la race qui le chante, _ses grandes vertus_, l'ambition, la cupidite,la ruse, la volupte, l'intemperance, la soif du sang, tout ce qui l'afait grand et heureux parmi les heros de sa race, va l'abandonner peu apeu, parce qu'il a abuse de ces dons du ciel. Je parle comme un rapsodeturcoman, faites-moi le plaisir de m'ecouter en bons Turcomans; oui,c'etaient la des dons du ciel! Il etait le plus grand des fourbes. Hontea lui! il va devenir confiant et sincere, parce qu'une fois il a fait unmauvais usage de sa ruse et de sa prudence. Il dressait des embuches, etl'ennemi ne manquait jamais d'y tomber: gloire a lui! mais une fois il atendu le piege a celui qu'il devait respecter, et desormais il sera prisdans ses propres filets: malheur a lui! Il etait bandit et meurtrier,rien de mieux! Une fois il est devenu assassin: desormais le poignardsera toujours leve sur lui. Malheur au fils de l'aveugle!Voila, je crois, le raisonnement qu'il faut mettre dans la bouche durapsode, pour comprendre la septieme rencontre et la suite des jours deKourroglou. Appelons maintenant l'exemple a notre aide.Kourroglou avait, comme on sait, l'innocente habitude de detrousser lesmarchands qui poussaient la folie ou l'insolence jusqu'a lui refuser unmodeste tribut de cinq cents tumans en passant sur ses terres. Mais iln'avait pas souvent cet embarras, parce que les riches voyageurs, ayantappris a le connaitre, allaient desormais au-devant de ses desirs, et nese faisaient plus tirer l'oreille pour s'executer. Kourroglou etait sisur de son fait, qu'il s'en allait tout seul, deguise, le plus souventen aushik (chanteur improvisateur), au beau milieu de la caravane; etquand il s'etait un peu diverti aux depens de ses hotes, quand il leuravait bien fait peur de l'ogre Kourroglou; quand il leur avait dit:"Seigneurs, prenez garde! Kourroglou est toujours la ou on l'attendle moins; peut-etre est-il deja parmi vous; mais, pour sur, il y serabientot." Alors le sycophante, en les voyant palir, renfoncait saguitare, levait sa massue, et criait de sa voix de stentor: "VoilaKourroglou!" Aussitot les marchands de se prosterner, de se frapperla poitrine, de s'arracher la barbe et de crier merci! "Guerrier,disaient-ils, nous savons que tu as porte le tribut a cinq cents tumans;mais si tu exiges le double, nous te le donnerons a condition quenous ne verrons pas le visage de Daly-Hassan." On se rappelle que ceDaly-Hassan, ancien brigand pour son compte personnel, vaincu parKourroglou, s'est attache a lui par reconnaissance, a grossi son armeepar de nombreux enrolements, et qu'il se distingue dans toutes lesentreprises. Mais il parait que sa cruaute est excessive. LorsqueKourroglou, toujours fidele aux lois qu'il a instituees, a repondu auxmarchands: "Oh non! c'est bien assez!" il revient vers ses compagnons,et Daly-Hassan, qui l'attend au pied de la montagne en lechant sesmoustaches comme un tigre qui a soif, lui demande la permissiond'essayer le tranchant de son sabre sur ces marauds, afin de leurarracher quelques barils de vin par-dessus le marche. Mais Kourrogloului repond: "Vous connaissez le proverbe arabe: la justice constitue lamoitie de la religion!" Et il rentre a Chamly-Bill les poches pleinesd'or et le coeur de bons sentiments.Mais, helas! il est arrive ce jour nefaste ou le heros doit etre mis ala plus rude epreuve, et ou sa vanite doit dechainer les maledictionssuspendues sur sa tete. Il faut suivre ce recit dans l'original."Un jour, Mohammed-Beg, de la tribu des Kajars, vint visiter Kourroglouavec douze mille hommes de cavalerie. Ils demeurerent a Chamly-Bill,buvant et festoyant, jusqu'a ce que les celliers et les cuisines deKourroglou fussent completement vides. Le sommelier et le cuisiniervinrent ensemble l'annoncer a Kourroglou, et dirent: "Tes hotes ontmange et bu tout ce qu'il y avait ici; ils n'ont pas meme laisse lescroutes ou la lie."Kourroglou envoya ses gardes roder dans le voisinage, et bientot apres,on lui signala une caravane. Il fit seller Kyrat; et, arme de pied encap, il se dirigea vers la prairie.Il regarda et vit une immense caravane campee sur ses paturages. Toutannoncait que le marchand etait un homme puissamment riche. Et dans unetente dressee pour la circonstance, on voyait deux Turcs assis et jouantau trictrac. Kourroglou arriva jusqu'a eux, et dit: "Salam!" Un desTurcs l'apercut, et dit: "Homme, descends de cheval!--Non, je ne veuxpas descendre.--D'ou viens-tu?--Eh quoi! n'avez-vous pu deja reconnaitreKourroglou?--Bien, cela est tout a fait different. Kourroglou est ungrand homme; nous lui paierons un tribut pour le sejour que nous avonsfait sur ses terres." Kourroglou crut que le marchand voulait sedebarrasser de lui par une plaisanterie; car il ne s'etait pas leve pourlui temoigner son respect quand le nom de Kourroglou etait sorti deses levres. Il se recula, et visant avec sa lance le Turc qui restaittoujours assis, il fit cabrer son cheval. Le Turc lui dit alorsfroidement: "Retiens ton bras, Kourroglou." La pointe de la lance avaitdeja effleure la poitrine du Turc; mais Kourroglou retint son chevalet s'arreta. Le Turc dit: "Tu devrais jeter un voile de femme sur tonvisage. Il ne convient pas a des hommes d'agir ainsi. J'ai entenduraconter beaucoup de choses de toi; mais je t'ai vu maintenant, et tu nemerites pas ta renommee. Un homme brave donne a son ennemi le temps dese mettre en garde. C'est le role d'une femme de combattre sans avertiret de tuer par surprise. Laisse-moi au moins le temps de finir ma partiede trictrac, de prendre ensuite mes armes et de monter sur mon cheval.Nous nous battrons alors en duel. Si je te tue et si je delivre le_collier du monde de tes etreintes rapaces_, des prieres seront ditespour ton ame. Si, au contraire, tu reussis a me tuer, tu prendras toutesles richesses et les marchandises rassemblees en ce lieu."Kourroglou ecouta patiemment et reconnut la justice de ces paroles. Ilattendit donc qu'il plut au marchand de s'armer et de monter a cheval.Quand cela fut fait, le Turc dit: "Kourroglou, tu dois commencer; tues libre de m'attaquer de telle maniere et avec telle arme qu'il teplaira."Kourroglou avait dix-sept armes sur lui, et il fit autant d'attaquesdifferentes; mais elles furent toutes parees ou repoussees.Le Turc s'ecria: "Viens plus pres, prends-moi par la ceinture, et voissi tu peux me faire descendre de cheval. J'aimerais a eprouver taforce." Kourroglou saisit le marchand a la ceinture et tacha de ledesarconner; mais le Turc se tint ferme sur la selle, comme s'il y eutete cousu.Le Turc dit: "C'est maintenant a mon tour; laisse-moi te faire eprouverma force." Il saisit la ceinture de Kourroglou, et le secoua d'une tellefacon, que ce dernier fut sur le point de tomber; et meme un de sespieds avait deja perdu l'etrier.Le Turc, comme s'il dedaignait de profiter de sa victoire, lacha laceinture de Kourroglou, quitta son armure, et, descendant de cheval, ilinvita Kourroglou a entrer sous sa tente et a devenir son hote.Kourroglou descendit avec soumission de dessus Kyrat, se glissa dansla tente comme un rat, et prit humblement un siege. Il se sentait sihonteux, qu'il osait a peine respirer. Le Turc baissa la tete commeauparavant, et se remit a jouer au trictrac avec son compagnon.Kourroglou vit que le Turc etait un homme plein de courage et denoblesse. Fidele a son habitude de dire en face a l'homme brave qu'iletait brave, et au poltron qu'il etait poltron, il accorda sa guitare,et chanta au marchand l'air suivant:_Improvisation._--"J'ai demande a ses esclaves et a ses serviteurs quiil etait. Ils ont tous repondu: C'est le seigneur des seigneurs, unmarchand guerrier. Il possede plus d'or qu'on n'en peut trouver dansAlep ou dans Damas. C'est le lion du desert. Son coursier est couvert dela depouille du leopard. Il ne daigne pas jeter un regard sur un ennemiou sur un ami. J'ai lance mon cheval contre lui, j'ai leve ma massueau-dessus de sa tete. Le marchand alors a pousse un cri, et s'est elancede sa place."Le Turc sourit, et regarda l'autre joueur d'une maniere significative(car il etait evident que le chanteur mentait par habitude de sevanter). Kourroglou dit dans son coeur: "Le maudit se raille de moi." Ilreprit ainsi:_Improvisation_.--"O mon Dieu, tu l'as cree sans defaut. Il n'est leserviteur que de toi seul; mais envers tout le reste du monde, il estimperieux et superbe. Il a amasse des montagnes de marchandises, et ils'est repose. Il a jete un regard a son compagnon, et il a souri. Il abaisse la tete, et il a joue au trictrac."Le Turc dit: "Guerrier Kourroglou, pour ta poesie, je te paierai untribut de cinq cents tumans." Kourroglou pensait qu'il n'aurait rien decet homme qui l'avait vaincu. Aussitot qu'il entendit parler de cinqcents tumans, son cerveau recouvra la sante; il fut transporte de joie,et improvisa ainsi:_Improvisation_.--"Il a mis sur ses oreilles le bonnet d'un derviche,sur ses epaules est un manteau d'hermine. Je lui ai chante un air. Lemarchand m'a donne cinq cents tumans pour recompense."Le Turc ayant verse l'argent devant le chanteur, il dit: "Voici montribu de cinq cents tumans. Si tu veux accepter mon invitation, Dieumerci, nous ne manquons pas de vin ni de kabab. Il y a toutes sortesd'aliments prepares. Si tu ne veux pas venir, et que tu preferes t'enaller, tu es le maitre." Kourroglou dit: "J'aimerais mieux partir, si tudaignais me le permettre."Kourroglou, ayant mis l'argent dans sa poche, prit conge de son hote,et retourna a Chamly-Bill. Quand les bandits virent l'argent, ils lefeliciterent de sa victoire. Kourroglou dit: "Ne m'insultez pas, chiensque vous etes! Ce ne sont pas des tumans, mais bien autant de gouttes demon propre sang. Cet homme m'a vaincu; mais il n'a pas voulu me tuer,et, de plus, il m'a paye mon sang avec cet argent."Il ordonna a ses gardes de veiller le moment du depart du marchand et dele lui annoncer.A partir de ce moment, Kourroglou sent decroitre la conscience de saforce; il n'ose plus sortir seul. Quand Ayvaz vient lui dire: "Neveux-tu pas faire une sortie, seigneur? Nous sommes a la fin del'automne. Si la neige tombait cette nuit, les routes seraientinterceptees, et nous ne trouverions plus de voyageurs a ranconner.Cependant ta caisse et ta paneterie sont vides. J'apercois une caravane:allons!" Kourroglou repond: "Retire-toi! le premier marchand etait unhomme sage, et il n'a pas voulu me tuer; mais un autre peut etre fou."Kourroglou ne voulait pas confesser devant ses gens qu'il etaitcontinuellement tourmente par l'idee de la superiorite du Turc quil'avait vaincu. Il resolut de voir encore une fois son heureuxadversaire. Apres bien des perquisitions, il sut le jour ou le marchanddevait quitter Erzeroum. Il partit avant lui, et se posta dans une passede montagnes, de l'autre cote du la ville ou passait la route. Le Turcetait seul, a cheval, ayant laisse sa caravane derriere lui, a quelquedistance. Kourroglou se sentit transporte de fureur; il poussa soncheval sur le marchand, le jeta a bas de sa selle, et coupa la tete de_l'homme renverse_. Il sentit bientot sa rage se calmer, et, _fache dece qu'il avait fait_, il chanta ainsi:_Improvisation_.--"Begs, ecoutez-moi! Sur le chemin d'Alep, jerencontrai un marchand, je rencontrai un lion affame. Je soufflais commela brise du matin. Je me suis place en embuscade sur sa route, non loind'Erzeroum; j'ai coupe sa tete a Erzengan. J'ai rencontre un marchand."L'ayant depouille de ses vetements, Kourroglou vit que ce n'etait pas unTurc, mais un Armenien, et il chanta:_Improvisation_.--"Sa mort m'a delivre de mille maux. Je l'ai accepteeavec delices, comme un bouquet de roses. J'ai depouille le corps, etj'ai vu que c'etait un Armenien. Oh! que les montagnes se couvrentde brouillards, que des torrents ruissellent de leurs sommets[33]!Kourroglou, que ton bras soit desseche! J'ai rencontre un marchand."[Footnote 33: Pour laver le deshonneur d'avoir traitreusement attaquel'homme sans defense. Les Persans haissent, a cause de quelquesdifferences de religion, les Turcs sunnites, plus encore que leschretiens, s'il est possible. De sorte que Kourroglou cherche uneconsolation dans la pensee qu'il a trouve que son superieur a tousegards n'etait pas un sunnite, mais un Armenien. (_Note de U.Chodzko_.)Cet Armenien est evidemment le plus grand personnage du roman deKourroglou: et n'est-il pas remarquable que ce heros, si superieur aKourroglou lui-meme par son sang-froid, son courage, sa force et sagenerosite, soit reste chretien dans l'imagination des rapsodes? Est-ceseulement par exces de haine contre les sunnites qu'on lui attribue unsi grand role? Dans un autre endroit, nous avons vu la princesse Nigharas'attendrir tres-particulierement, jusqu'a vouloir se donner la mort,pour un voyageur europeen que Kourroglou menacait de sa fureur. Il fautbien que dans ces tetes poetiques de l'Orient le chretien soit un etresuperieur, en depit de la repulsion fanatique.]Cette derniere strophe, si courte et si bizarre, nous parait la plusbelle et la plus orientale des improvisations de Kourroglou. Elle a laconcision mysterieuse du style biblique. L'ame coupable s'y devoile envoulant cacher sa honte et son effroi sous des metaphores. L'orgueilblesse, la colere, la vengeance toujours vivantes dans le coeur dumeurtrier, entonnent le chant du triomphe; les mechantes passionsacceptent la mort de l'homme juste et genereux _comme un bouquet deroses_. Puis aussitot le desespoir du maudit etouffe l'hymne impie. _Oh!que tes montagnes se couvrent de brouillards!_ la nuit descend surles yeux de Cain. _Kourroglou, que ton bras soit desseche!_ Et le bonrefrain si bete et si sombre: "J'ai rencontre un marchand!" _en dit plusqu'il n'est gros_. Nous connaissons certains refrains romantiques desballades modernes, qui cherchent le terrible et le naif, a l'imitationde ces formes populaires. Aucun ne m'a fait l'impression de ce: _j'airencontre un marchand_, qui vient si a point, qui resume si bien lesouvenir d'une action qu'on ne veut pas s'avouer a soi-meme, et qui, necherchant ni le naif, ni le terrible, rencontre l'un et l'autre a lagrande honte des faiseurs de nos jours. Kourroglou devait etre un grandpoete. Il ne pensait qu'a la rime et trouvait l'effet. M'est avisqu'aujourd'hui nous faisons le contraire.A partir de ce moment, la fatalite s'appesantit sur Kourroglou. Apresquelques exploits ou ses imprudences le mettent a deux doigts de saperte et ou il succomberait sans l'heroique secours d'Ayvaz et de sescompagnons, il est fait prisonnier, traine a la queue d'un cheval,nourri des os qu'on lui jette comme a un chien, enfin attache a unpoteau pour mourir sous le fouet et le baton. Il echappe pourtanta cette epreuve terrible, mais c'est pour retrouver Chamly-Bill enrevolution; Ayvaz le hait et le maudit comme un tyran, ses meilleursamis le trahissent et l'abandonnent. Le combat qu'il est force de leurlivrer est d'une haute poesie epique; sa douleur, son amour pour Ayvaz,son indignation, touchent parfois au sublime. Enfin, Kourroglou, devenuvieux, s'eprend encore d'une princesse etrangere et veut l'enlever.Surpris et jete dans un puits, il y devient _si gras_, ce qui, pour unhomme tel que lui, est le comble de l'abjection et de la honte, qu'ilest retire de l'abime et delivre a grand' peine. Mais l'esprit du grandhomme est affaibli. Pris par ses ennemis, il finit esclave et aveuglecomme Samson, apres avoir vu tuer Kyrat sous ses yeux, et des lors lamort est un bienfait pour lui. Ses derniers chants d'agonie ont encorede la grandeur et le montrent puissant et resigne. Il y a de l'analogieentre la fin de ce poeme et celle de la legende des quatre fils Aymon.Nous n'avons traduit qu'une faible partie de cette curieuse epopee deKourroglou. La fin est surtout frappante; mais nous ne voulons paspriver l'amie qui nous a aide a traduire du plaisir de la donnerelle-meme au lecteur dans une publication complete.FIN DE KOURROGLOU.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Kourroglou, by George Sand*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK KOURROGLOU ******** This file should be named 13303.txt or 13303.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/3/3/0/13303/Produced by Renald Levesque and the Online Distributed ProofreadingTeam.

CONSTABLE, Printers to His MajestyTO MY FRIENDCHARLES WHIBLEYH.C.INTRODUCTION[Sidenote: The Life of a Day.]'I am at my farm; and, since my last misfortunes, have not been inFlorence twenty days. I spent September in snaring thrushes; but at theend of the month, even this rather tiresome sport failed me. I rise withthe sun, and go into a wood of mine that is being cut, where I remaintwo hours inspecting the work of the previous day and conversing withthe woodcutters, who have always some trouble on hand amongst themselvesor with their neighbours. When I leave the wood, I go to a spring, andthence to the place which I use for snaring birds, with a book under myarm--Dante or Petrarch, or one of the minor poets, like Tibullus orOvid. I read the story of their passions, and let their loves remind meof my own, which is a pleasant pastime for a while. Next I take theroad, enter the inn door, talk with the passers-by, inquire the news ofthe neighbourhood, listen to a variety of matters, and make note of thedifferent tastes and humours of men.'This brings me to dinner-time, when I join my family and eat the poorproduce of my farm. After dinner I go back to the inn, where I generallyfind the host and a butcher, a miller, and a pair of bakers. With thesecompanions I play the fool all day at cards or backgammon: a thousandsquabbles, a thousand insults and abusive dialogues take place, while wehaggle over a farthing, and shout loud enough to be heard from SanCasciano.'But when evening falls I go home and enter my writing-room. On thethreshold I put off my country habits, filthy with mud and mire, andarray myself in royal courtly garments. Thus worthily attired, I make myentrance into the ancient courts of the men of old, where they receiveme with love, and where I feed upon that food which only is my own andfor which I was born. I feel no shame in conversing with them and askingthem the reason of their actions.'They, moved by their humanity, make answer. For four hours' space Ifeel no annoyance, forget all care; poverty cannot frighten, nor deathappal me. I am carried away to their society. And since Dante says "thatthere is no science unless we retain what we have learned" I have setdown what I have gained from their discourse, and composed a treatise,_De Principalibus_, in which I enter as deeply as I can into the scienceof the subject, with reasonings on the nature of principality, itsseveral species, and how they are acquired, how maintained, how lost. Ifyou ever liked any of my scribblings, this ought to suit your taste. Toa prince, and especially to a new prince, it ought to prove acceptable.Therefore I am dedicating it to the Magnificence of Giuliano.'[Sidenote: Niccolo Machiavelli.]Such is the account that Niccolo Machiavelli renders of himself whenafter imprisonment, torture, and disgrace, at the age of forty-four, hefirst turned to serious writing. For the first twenty-six or indeedtwenty-nine of those years we have not one line from his pen or one wordof vaguest information about him. Throughout all his works written forpublication, there is little news about himself. Montaigne couldproperly write, 'Ainsi, lecteur, je suis moy-mesme la matiere de monlivre.' But the matter of Machiavelli was far other: 'Io ho espressoquanto io so, e quanto io ho imparato per una lunga pratica e continualezione delle cose del mondo.'[Sidenote: The Man.]Machiavelli was born on the 3rd of May 1469. The period of his lifealmost exactly coincides with that of Cardinal Wolsey. He came of theold and noble Tuscan stock of Montespertoli, who were men of their handsin the eleventh century. He carried their coat, but the property hadbeen wasted and divided. His forefathers had held office of highdistinction, but had fallen away as the new wealth of the bankers andtraders increased in Florence. He himself inherited a small property inSan Casciano and its neighbourhood, which assured him a sufficient, ifsomewhat lean, independence. Of his education we know little enough. Hewas well acquainted with Latin, and knew, perhaps, Greek enough to servehis turn. 'Rather not without letters than lettered,' Varchi describeshim. That he was not loaded down with learned reading proved probably agreat advantage. The coming of the French, and the expulsion of theMedici, the proclamation of the Republic (1494), and later the burningof Savonarola convulsed Florence and threw open many public offices. Ithas been suggested, but without much foundation, that some clerical workwas found for Machiavelli in 1494 or even earlier. It is certain that onJuly 14, 1498, he was appointed Chancellor and Secretary to the Dieci diLiberta e Pace, an office which he held till the close of his politicallife at fall of the Republic in 1512.[Sidenote: Official Life.]The functions of his Council were extremely varied, and in the hands oftheir Secretary became yet more diversified. They represented in somesense the Ministry for Home, Military, and especially for ForeignAffairs. It is impossible to give any full account of Machiavelli'sofficial duties. He wrote many thousands of despatches and officialletters, which are still preserved. He was on constant errands of Statethrough the Florentine dominions. But his diplomatic missions and whathe learned by them make the main interest of his office. His firstadventure of importance was to the Court of Caterina Sforza, the Lady ofForli, in which matter that astute Countess entirely bested the teacherof all diplomatists to be. In 1500 he smelt powder at the siege at Pisa,and was sent to France to allay the irritations of Louis XII. Manysimilar and lesser missions follow. The results are in no case of greatimportance, but the opportunities to the Secretary of learning men andthings, intrigue and policy, the Court and the gutter were invaluable.At the camp of Caesar Borgia, in 1502, he found in his host thatfantastic hero whom he incarnated in _The Prince_, and he waspractically an eye-witness of the amazing masterpiece, the Massacre ofSinigaglia. The next year he is sent to Rome with a watching brief atthe election of Julius II., and in 1506 is again sent to negotiate withthe Pope. An embassy to the Emperor Maximilian, a second mission to theFrench King at Blois, in which he persuades Louis XII. to postpone thethreatened General Council of the Church (1511), and constantexpeditions to report upon and set in order unrestful towns andprovinces did not fulfil his activity. His pen was never idle. Reports,despatches, elaborate monographs on France, Germany, or wherever hemight be, and personal letters innumerable, and even yet unpublished,ceased not night nor day. Detail, wit, character-drawing, satire,sorrow, bitterness, all take their turn. But this was only a fraction ofhis work. By duty and by expediency he was bound to follow closely theinternal politics of Florence where his enemies and rivals abounded. Andin all these years he was pushing forward and carrying through withunceasing and unspeakable vigour the great military dream of his life,the foundation of a National Militia and the extinction of MercenaryCompanies. But the fabric he had fancied and thought to have builtproved unsubstantial. The spoilt half-mutinous levies whom he had spentyears in odious and unwilling training failed him at the crowning momentin strength and spirit: and the fall of the Republic implied the fall ofMachiavelli and the close of his official life. He struggled hard tosave himself, but the wealthy classes were against him, perhaps afraidof him, and on them the Medici relied. For a year he was forbidden toleave Florentine territory, and for a while was excluded from thePalazzo. Later his name was found in a list of Anti-Mediceanconspirators. He was arrested and decorously tortured with six turns ofthe rack, and then liberated for want of evidence.[Sidenote: After his Fall.]For perhaps a year after his release the Secretary engaged in a seriesof tortuous intrigues to gain the favour of the Medici. Many of thestories may be exaggerated, but none make pleasant reading, and nothingproved successful. His position was miserable. Temporarily crippled bytorture, out of favour with the Government, shunned by his friends, indeep poverty, burdened with debt and with a wife and four children, hismaterial circumstances were ill enough. But, worse still, he was idle.He had deserved well of the Republic, and had never despaired of it, andthis was his reward. He seemed to himself a broken man. He had no greatnatural dignity, no great moral strength. He profoundly loved andadmired Dante, but he could not for one moment imitate him. He soughtsatisfaction in sensuality of life and writing, but found no comfort.Great things were stirring in the world and he had neither part nor lotin them. By great good fortune he began a correspondence with his friendFrancesco Vettori, the Medicean Ambassador at Rome, to whom he appealsfor his good offices: 'And if nothing can be done, I must live as I cameinto the world, for I was born poor and learnt to want before learningto enjoy.' Before long these two diplomats had co-opted themselves intoa kind of Secret Cabinet of Europe. It is a strange but profoundlyinteresting correspondence, both politically and personally. Nothing istoo great or too small, too glorious or too mean for their pens. Amidfoolish anecdotes and rather sordid love affairs the politics of Europe,and especially of Italy, are dissected and discussed. Leo X. had nowplunged into political intrigue. Ferdinand of Spain was in difficulty.France had allied herself with Venice. The Swiss are the Ancient Romans,and may conquer Italy. Then back again, or rather constant throughout,the love intrigues and the 'likely wench hard-by who may help to passour time.' But through it all there is an ache at Machiavelli's heart,and on a sudden he will break down, crying,  Pero se aleuna volta io rido e canto  Facciol, perche non ho se non quest' una  Via da sfogare il mio angoscioso pianto.Vettori promised much, but nothing came of it. By 1515 thecorrespondence died away, and the Ex-Secretary found for himself at lastthe true pathway through his vale of years.[Sidenote: The true Life.]The remainder of Machiavelli's life is bounded by his books. He settledat his villa at San Casciano, where he spent his day as he describes inthe letter quoted at the beginning of this essay. In 1518 he began toattend the meetings of the Literary Club in the Orti Oricellarii, andmade new and remarkable friends. 'Era amato grandamente da loro ... edella sua conversazione si dilettavano maravigliosamente, tenendo inprezzo grandissimo tutte l'opere sue,' which shows the personalauthority he exercised. Occasionally he was employed by Florentinemerchants to negotiate for them at Venice, Genoa, Lucca, and otherplaces. In 1519 Cardinal Medici deigned to consult him as to theGovernment, and commissioned him to write the History of Florence. Butin the main he wrote his books and lived the daily life we know. In 1525he went to Rome to present his History to Clement VII., and was sent onto Guicciardini. In 1526 he was busy once more with military matters andthe fortification of Florence. On the 22nd of June 1527 he died atFlorence immediately after the establishment of the second Republic. Hehad lived as a practising Christian, and so died, surrounded by his wifeand family. Wild legends grew about his death, but have no foundation. Apeasant clod in San Casciano could not have made a simpler end. He wasburied in the family Chapel in Santa Croce, and a monument was there atlast erected with the epitaph by Doctor Ferroni--'Tanto nomini nullumpar elogium.' The first edition of his complete works was published in1782, and was dedicated to Lord Cowper.[Sidenote: His Character.]What manner of man was Machiavelli at home and in the market-place? Itis hard to say. There are doubtful busts, the best, perhaps, thatengraved in the 'Testina' edition of 1550, so-called on account of theportrait. 'Of middle height, slender figure, with sparkling eyes, darkhair, rather a small head, a slightly aquiline nose, a tightly closedmouth: all about him bore the impress of a very acute observer andthinker, but not that of one able to wield much influence over others.'Such is a reconstruction of him by one best able to make one. 'In hisconversation,' says Varchi, 'Machiavelli was pleasant, serviceable tohis friends, a friend of virtuous men, and, in a word, worthy to havereceived from Nature either less genius or a better mind.' If not muchabove the moral standard of the day he was certainly not below it. Hishabits were loose and his language lucid and licentious. But there is nobad or even unkind act charged against him. To his honesty and goodfaith he very fairly claims that his poverty bears witness. He was akind, if uncertain, husband and a devoted father. His letters to hischildren are charming. Here is one written soon before his death to hislittle son Guido.--'Guido, my darling son, I received a letter of thineand was delighted with it, particularly because you tell me of your fullrecovery, the best news I could have. If God grants life to us both Iexpect to make a good man of you, only you must do your fair shareyourself.' Guido is to stick to his books and music, and if the familymule is too fractious, 'Unbridle him, take off the halter and turn himloose at Montepulciano. The farm is large, the mule is small, so no harmcan come of it. Tell your mother, with my love, not to be nervous. Ishall surely be home before any trouble comes. Give a kiss to Baccina,Piero, and Totto: I wish I knew his eyes were getting well. Be happy andspend as little as you may. Christ have you in his keeping.'--There isnothing exquisite or divinely delicate in this letter, but there aremany such, and they were not written by a bad man, any more than theanswers they evoke were addressed to one. There is little more save of alike character that is known of Machiavelli the man. But to judge himand his work we must have some knowledge of the world in which he was tomove and have his being.       *       *       *       *       *[Sidenote: State of Italy.]At the beginning of the sixteenth century Italy was rotten to the core.In the close competition of great wickedness the Vicar of Christ easilycarried off the palm, and the Court of Alexander VI. was probably thewickedest meeting-place of men that has ever existed upon earth. Novirtue, Christian or Pagan, was there to be found; little art that wasnot sensuous or sensual. It seemed as if Bacchus and Venus and Priapushad come to their own again, and yet Rome had not ceased to call herselfChristian.[Sidenote: Superstition.]'Owing to the evil ensample of the Papal Court,' writes Machiavelli,'Italy has lost all piety and all religion: whence follow infinitetroubles and disorders; for as religion implies all good, so its absenceimplies the contrary. To the Church and priests of Rome we owe anothereven greater disaster which is the cause of her ruin. I mean that theChurch has maintained, and still maintains Italy divided.' The Papacy istoo weak to unite and rule, but strong enough to prevent others doingso, and is always ready to call in the foreigner to crush all Italiansto the foreigner's profit, and Guicciardini, a high Papal officer,commenting on this, adds, 'It would be impossible to speak so ill of theRoman Court, but that more abuse should not be merited, seeing it is aninfamy, and example of all the shames and scandals of the world.' Thelesser clergy, the monks, the nuns followed, with anxious fidelity, thefootsteps of their shepherds. There was hardly a tonsure in Italy whichcovered more than thoughts and hopes of lust and avarice. Religion andmorals which God had joined together, were set by man a thousand leaguesasunder. Yet religion still sat upon the alabaster throne of Peter, andin the filthy straw of the meanest Calabrian confessional. And stilldeeper remained a blind devoted superstition. Vitellozzo Vitelli, asMachiavelli tells us, while being strangled by Caeesar Borgia's assassin,implored his murderer to procure for him the absolution of thatmurderer's father. Gianpaolo Baglioni, who reigned by parricide andlived in incest, was severely blamed by the Florentines for not killingPope Julius II. when the latter was his guest at Perugia. And whenGabrino Fondato, the tyrant of Cremona, was on the scaffold, his onlyregret was that when he had taken his guests, the Pope and Emperor, tothe top of the Cremona tower, four hundred feet high, his nerve failedhim and he did not push them both over. Upon this anarchy of religion,morals, and conduct breathed suddenly the inspiring breath of Paganantiquity which seemed to the Italian mind to find its finest climax intyrannicide. There is no better instance than in the plot of the Pazziat Florence. Francesco Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini decided to killLorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici in the cathedral at the moment of theelevation of the Host. They naturally took the priest into theirconfidence. They escorted Giuliano to the Duomo, laughing and talking,and playfully embraced him--to discover if he wore armour under hisclothes. Then they killed him at the moment appointed.[Sidenote: Pagan influence.]Nor were there any hills from which salvation might be looked for.Philosophy, poetry, science, expressed themselves in terms ofmaterialism. Faith and hope are ever the last survivors in the life of aman or of a nation. But in Italy these brave comforters were at theirlatest breath. It is perhaps unfair to accept in full the judgment ofNorthern travellers. The conditions, training, needs of England andGermany were different. In these countries courage was a necessity, andgood faith a paying policy. Subtlety could do little against atwo-handed sword in the hands of an angry or partially intoxicatedgiant. Climate played its part as well as culture, and the crudepleasures and vices of the North seemed fully as loathsome to therefined Italian as did the tortuous policy and the elaborate infamies ofthe South to their rough invaders. Alone, perhaps, among the nations ofEurope the Italians had never understood or practised chivalry, save insuch select and exotic schools as the Casa Gioiosa under Vittorino daFeltre at Mantua. The oath of Arthur's knights would have seemed to themmere superfluity of silliness. _Onore_ connoted credit, reputation, andprowess. _Virtu_, which may be roughly translated as mental abilitycombined with personal daring, set the standard and ruled opinion.'Honour in the North was subjective: _Onore_ in Italy objective.'Individual liberty, indeed, was granted in full to all, at theindividual's risk. The love of beauty curbed grossness and addeddistinction. Fraud became an art and force a science. There is libertyfor all, but for the great ones there is licence. And when the day oftrial comes, it is the Churchmen and the Princes who can save neitherthemselves nor man, nor thing that is theirs. To such a world wasMachiavelli born. To whom should he turn? To the People? To the Church?To the Princes and Despots? But hear him:--    'There shall never be found any good mason, which will beleeve    to be able to make a faire image of a peece of marble ill hewed,    but verye well of a rude peece. Our Italian Princes beleeved,    before they tasted the blowes of the outlandish warre, that it    should suffice a Prince to know by writinges, how to make a    subtell aunswere, to write a goodly letter, to shewe in    sayinges, and in woordes, witte and promptenesse, to know how to    canvas a fraude, to decke themselves with precious stones and    gold, to sleepe and to eate with greater glory then other: To    kepe many lascivious persons about them, to governe themselves    with their subjects, covetously and proudely: To roote in    idlenes, to give the degrees of the exercise of warre for good    will, to dispise if any should have shewed them any laudable    waie, minding that their wordes should bee aunswers of oracles:    nor the sely wretches were not aware that they prepared    themselves to be a pray to whome so ever should assaulte them.    Hereby grew then in the thousand fowre hundred and nintie and    fowre yere, the great feares, the sodaine flightes and the    marveilous losses: and so three most mighty states which were in    Italie, have bene dievers times sacked and destroyed. But that    which is worse, is where those that remaine, continue in the    very same errour, and liev in the verie same disorder and    consider not, that those who in olde time would keepe their    states, caused to be done these thinges, which of me hath beene    reasoned, and that their studies were, to prepare the body to    diseases, and the minde not to feare perills. Whereby grewe that    Caesar, Alexander, and all those men and excellent Princes in    olde time, were the formost amongst the fighters, going armed on    foote: and if they lost their state, they would loose their    life, so that they lievd and died vertuously.'Such was the clay that waited the moulding of the potter's hand.'Posterity, that high court of appeal, which is never tired ofeulogising its own justice and discernment,' has recorded harsh sentenceon the Florentine. It is better to-day to let him speak for himself.[Sidenote: _The Prince_.]The slender volume of _The Prince_ has probably produced widerdiscussion, more bitter controversy, more varied interpretations and adeeper influence than any book save Holy Writ. Kings and statesmen,philosophers and theologians, monarchists and republicans have all andalways used or abused it for their purposes. Written in 1513, the firstyear of Machiavelli's disgrace, concurrently with part of the_Discorsi_, which contain the germs of it, the book represents thefulness of its author's thought and experience. It was not till afterMachiavelli's death, that it was published in 1532, by order of ClementVII. Meanwhile, however, in manuscript it had been widely read andfavourably received.[Sidenote: Its purpose.]The mere motive of its creation and dedication has been the theme ofmany volumes. Machiavelli was poor, was idle, was out of favour, andtherefore, though a Republican, wrote a devilish hand-book of tyranny tostrengthen the Medici and recover his position. Machiavelli, a loyalRepublican, wrote a primer of such fiendish principles as might lure theMedici to their ruin. Machiavelli's one idea was to ruin the rich:Machiavelli's one idea was to oppress the poor: he was a Protestant, aJesuit, an Atheist: a Royalist and a Republican. And the book publishedby one Pope's express authority was utterly condemned and forbidden,with all its author's works, by the express command of another (1559).But before facing the whirlwind of savage controversy which raged andrages still about _The Prince_, it may be well to consider shortly thebook itself--consider it as a new book and without prejudice. Thepurpose of its composition is almost certainly to be found in the plainfact that Machiavelli, a politician and a man of letters, wished towrite a book upon the subject which had been his special study and laynearest to his business and bosom. To ensure prominence for such a book,to engage attention and incidentally perhaps to obtain politicalemployment for himself, he dedicated it to Lorenzo de' Medici, theexisting and accepted Chief of the State. But far and above such lightermotives stood the fact that he saw in Lorenzo the only man who mightconceivably bring to being the vast dream of patriotism which the writerhad imagined. The subject he proposed to himself was largely, though notwholly, conditioned by the time and place in which he lived. He wrotefor his countrymen and he wrote for his own generation. He had heardwith his ears and seen with his eyes the alternate rending anarchy andmoaning paralysis of Italy. He had seen what Agricola had long beforebeen spared the sight of. And what he saw, he saw not through a glassdarkly or distorted, but in the whitest, driest light, without flinchingand face to face. 'We are much beholden,' writes Bacon, 'to Machiavelliand others that wrote what men do, and not what they ought to do.' Hedid not despair of Italy, he did not despair even of Italian unity. Buthe despaired of what he saw around him, and he was willing at almost anyprice to end it. He recognised, despite the nominal example of Venice,that a Republican system was impossible, and that the smallPrincipalities and Free Cities were corrupt beyond hope of healing. Astrong central unifying government was imperative, and at that day suchgovernment could only be vested in a single man. For it must ever beclosely remembered, as will be pointed out again, that throughout thebook the Prince is what would now be called the Government. And then hesaw with faithful prophecy, in the splendid peroration of his hope, ahope deferred for near four hundred years, he saw beyond the painfulpaths of blood and tyranny, a vision of deliverance and union. For atleast it is plain that in all things Machiavelli was a passionatepatriot, and _Amo la patria mia piu dell' anima_ is found in one of thelast of many thousand letters that his untiring pen had written.The purpose, then, of _The Prince_ is to lay down rules, within thepossibilities of the time, for the making of a man who shall create,increase, and maintain a strong and stable government. This is done inthe main by a plain presentation of facts, a presentation condensed andcritical but based on men and things as they actually were. The ethicalside is wholly omitted: the social and economical almost entirely. Theaspect is purely political, with the underlying thought, it may besupposed, that under the postulated government, all else will prosper.[Sidenote: The Book; New States.]Machiavelli opens by discussing the various forms of governments, whichhe divides into Republics and Principalities. Of the latter some may behereditary and some acquired. Of hereditary states he says little andquotes but one, the Duchy of Ferrara. He then turns to his true subject,the acquisition and preservation of States wholly new or new in part,States such as he saw himself on every side around him. Having gainedpossession of a new State, he says, you must first extirpate the familyof your predecessor. You should then either reside or plant colonies,but not trust to garrisons. 'Colonies are not costly to the Prince, aremore faithful and cause less offence to the subject States: those whomthey may injure being poor and scattered, are prevented from doingmischief. For it should be observed that men ought either to be caressedor trampled out, seeing that small injuries may be avenged, whereasgreat ones destroy the possibility of retaliation: and so the damagethat has to be inflicted ought to be such that it need involve no fearof reprisals.' There is perhaps in all Machiavelli no better example ofhis lucid scientific method than this passage. There is neither excusenor hypocrisy. It is merely a matter of business calculation. Mankind isthe raw material, the State is the finished work. Further you are toconciliate your neighbours who are weak and abase the strong, and youmust not let the stranger within your gates. Above all look before aswell as after and think not to leave it to time, _godere li benefici deltempo_, but, as did the Romans, strike and strike at once. Forillustration he criticises, in a final and damning analysis, the careerof Louis XII. in Italy. There was no canon of statecraft so absolutethat the King did not ignore it, and in inevitable Nemesis, there was noultimate disaster so crowning as not to be achieved.[Sidenote: Conquests.]After observing that a feudal monarchy is much less easy of conquestthan a despotism, since in the one case you must vanquish many lesserlordships while in the other you merely replace slaves by slaves,Machiavelli considers the best method of subjugating Free Cities. Hereagain is eminent the terrible composure and the exact truth of hispolitics. A conquered Free City you may of course rule in person, or youmay construct an oligarchy to govern for you, but the only safe way isto destroy it utterly, since 'that name of Liberty, those ancient usagesof Freedom,' are things 'which no length of years and no benefits canextinguish in the nation's mind, things which no pains or forethoughtcan uproot unless the citizens be utterly destroyed.'Hitherto the discussion has ranged round the material politics of thematter, the acquisition of material power. Machiavelli now turns to theheart of his matter, the proper character and conduct of a new Prince ina new Principality and the ways by which he shall deal most fortunatelywith friend and foe. For fortune it is, as well as ability, which go tothe making of the man and the maintenance of his power.[Sidenote: Caesar Borgia.]In the manner of the day Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, and Theseus are ledacross the stage in illustration. The common attribute of all suchfortunate masters of men was force of arms, while the mission of anunarmed prophet such as Savonarola was foredoomed to failure. In suchpolitics Machiavelli is positive and ruthless: force is and must be theremedy and the last appeal, a principle which indeed no later generationhas in practice set at naught. But in the hard dry eyes of theFlorentine Secretary stood, above all others, one shining figure, afigure to all other eyes, from then till now, wrapped in mysterious andmiasmatic cloud. In the pages of common history he was a tyrant, he wasvicious beyond compare, he was cruel beyond the Inquisition, he wasfalse beyond the Father of Lies, he was the Antichrist of Rome and hewas a failure: but he was the hero of Niccolo Machiavelli, who, indeed,found in Caesar Borgia the fine flower of Italian politics in the Age ofthe Despots. Son of the Pope, a Prince of the Church, a Duke of France,a master of events, a born soldier, diplomatist, and more than half astatesman, Caesar seemed indeed the darling of gods and men whom originalfortune had crowned with inborn ability. Machiavelli knew him as well asit was possible to know a soul so tortuous and secret, and he had beenpresent at the most critical and terrible moments of Caesar's life. Thatin despite of a life which the world calls infamous, in despite of thehowling execrations of all Christendom, in despite of ultimate andentire failures, Machiavelli could still write years after, 'I know notwhat lessons I could teach a new Prince more useful than the example ofhis actions,' exhibits the ineffaceable impressions that Caesar Borgiahad made upon the most subtle and observant mind of modern history.[Sidenote: Caesar's Career.]Caesar was the acknowledged son of Pope Alexander by his acknowledgedmistress Vannozza dei Cattani. Born in 1472, he was an Archbishop and aCardinal at sixteen, and the murderer of his elder brother at an agewhen modern youths are at college. He played his part to the full in theunspeakable scandals of the Vatican, but already 'he spoke little andpeople feared him.' Ere long the splendours of the Papacy seemed tooremote and uncertain for his fierce ambition, and, indeed, through hisfather, he already wielded both the temporal and the spiritual arms ofPeter. To the subtlety of the Italian his Spanish blood had lent acertain stern resolution, and as with Julius and Sulla the lust forsloth and sensuality were quickened by the lust for sway. He unfrockedhimself with pleasure. He commenced politician, soldier, and despot. Andfor the five years preceding Alexander's death he may almost be lookedupon as a power in Europe. Invested Duke of Romagna, that hot-bed ofpetty tyranny and tumult, he repressed disorder through his governorMesser Ramiro with a relentless hand. When order reigned, Machiavellitells us he walked out one morning into the market-place at Cesena andsaw the body of Ramiro, who had borne the odium of reform, lying in twopieces with his head on a lance, and a bloody axe by his side. Caesarreaped the harvest of Ramiro's severity, and the people recognising hisbenevolence and justice were 'astounded and satisfied.'But the gaze of the Borgia was not bounded by the strait limits of amere Italian Duchy. Whether indeed there mingled with personal ambitionan ideal of a united Italy, swept clean of the barbarians, it is hard tosay, though Machiavelli would have us believe it. What is certain isthat he desired the supreme dominion in Italy for himself, and to win itspared neither force nor fraud nor the help of the very barbariansthemselves. With a decree of divorce and a Cardinal's hat he gained thesupport of France, the French Duchy of Valentinois, and the sister ofthe King of Navarre to wife. By largesse of bribery and hollow promiseshe brought to his side the great families of Rome, his natural enemies,and the great Condottieri with their men-at-arms. When by their aid hehad established and extended his government he mistrusted their goodfaith. With an infinity of fascination and cunning, without haste andwithout rest, he lured these leaders, almost more cunning than himself,to visit him as friends in his fortress of Sinigaglia. 'I doubt if theywill be alive to-morrow morning,' wrote Machiavelli, who was on thespot. He was right. Caesar caused them to be strangled the same night,while his father dealt equal measure to their colleagues and adherentsin Rome. Thenceforth, distrusting mercenaries, he found and disciplinedout of a mere rabble, a devoted army of his own, and havingunobtrusively but completely extirpated the whole families of thosewhose thrones he had usurped, not only the present but the future seemedassured to him.He had fulfilled the first of Machiavelli's four conditions. He rapidlyachieved the remaining three. He bought the Roman nobles so as to beable to put a bridle in the new 'Pope's mouth.' He bought or poisoned orpacked or terrorised the existing College of Cardinals and selected newPrinces of the Church who should accept a Pontiff of his choosing. Hewas effectively strong enough to resist the first onset upon him at hisfather's death. Five years had been enough for so great an undertaking.One thing alone he had not and indeed could not have foreseen. 'He toldme himself on the day on which (Pope) Julius was created, that he hadforeseen and provided for everything else that could happen on hisfather's death, but had never anticipated that, when his father died, hetoo should have been at death's door.' Even so the fame and splendour ofhis name for a while maintained his authority against his unnumberedenemies. But soon the great betrayer was betrayed. 'It is well to cheatthose who have been masters of treachery,' he had said himself in hishours of brief authority. His wheel had turned full cycle. Within threeyears his fate, like that of Charles XII., was destined to a foreignstrand, a petty fortress, and a dubious hand. Given over to Spain hepassed three years obscurely. 'He was struck down in a fight at Viana inNavarre (1507) after a furious resistance: he was stripped of his finearmour by men who did not know his name or quality and his body was leftnaked on the bare ground, bloody and riddled with wounds. He was onlythirty-one.' And so the star of Machiavelli's hopes and dreams wasquenched for a season in the clouds from which it came.[Sidenote: The Lesson.]It seems worth while to sketch the strange tempestuous career of CaesarBorgia because in the remaining chapters of _The Prince_ and elsewherein his writings, it is the thought and memory of Valentinois, transmuteddoubtless and idealised by the lapse of years, that largely inform andinspire the perfect Prince of Machiavelli. But it must not be supposedthat in life or in mind they were intimate or even sympathetic.Machiavelli criticises his hero liberally and even harshly. But for thework he wanted done he had found no better craftsman and no betterexample to follow for those that might come after. Morals and religiondid not touch the purpose of his arguments except as affecting policy.In policy virtues may be admitted as useful agents and in the chapterfollowing that on Caesar, entitled, curiously enough, 'Of those who bytheir crimes come to be Princes,' he lays down that 'to slaughter fellowcitizens, to betray friends, to be devoid of honour, pity and religioncannot be counted as merits, for these are means which may lead to powerbut which confer no glory.' Cruelty he would employ without hesitationbut with the greatest care both in degree and in kind. It should beimmediate and complete and leave no possibility of counter-revenge. Forit is never forgotten by the living, and 'he deceives himself whobelieves that, with the great, recent benefits cause old wrongs to beforgotten.' On the other hand 'Benefits should be conferred little bylittle so that they may be more fully relished.' The cruelty proper to aPrince (Government, for as ever they are identical) aims only atauthority. Now authority must spring from love or fear. It were best tocombine both motives to obedience but you cannot. The Prince mustremember that men are fickle, and love at their own pleasure, and thatmen are fearful and fear at the pleasure of the Prince. Let himtherefore depend on what is of himself, not on that which is of others.'Yet if he win not love he may escape hate, and so it will be if he doesnot meddle with the property or women-folk of his subjects.' When hemust punish let him kill. 'For men will sooner forget the death of theirfather than the loss of their estate.' And moreover you cannot always goon killing, but a Prince who has once set himself to plundering willnever stop. This is the more needful because the only secure foundationof his rule lies in his trust of the people and in their support. Andindeed again and again you shall find no more thorough democrat thanthis teacher of tyrants. 'The people own better broader qualities,fidelities and passions than any Prince and have better cause to showfor them.' 'As for prudence and stability, I say that a people is morestable, more prudent, and of better judgment than a Prince.' If thepeople go wrong it is almost certainly the crime or negligence of thePrince which drives or leads them astray. 'Better far than any number offortresses is not to be hated by your people.' The support of the peopleand a national militia make the essential strength of the Prince and ofthe State.[Sidenote: National Defence.]The chapters on military organisation may be more convenientlyconsidered in conjunction with _The Art of War_. It is enough at presentto point out two or three observations of Machiavelli which touchpolitics from the military side. To his generation they were entirelynovel, though mere commonplace to-day. National strength means nationalstability and national greatness; and this can be achieved, and can onlybe achieved, by a national army. The Condottiere system, born of slothand luxury, has proved its rottenness. Your hired general is either atyrant or a traitor, a bully or a coward. 'In a word the armour ofothers is too wide or too strait for us: it falls off us, or it weighsus down.' And in a fine illustration he compares auxiliary troops to thearmour of Saul which David refused, preferring to fight Goliath with hissling and stone.[Sidenote: Conduct of the Prince.]Having assured the external security of the State, Machiavelli turnsonce more to the qualities and conduct of the Prince. So closely packedare these concluding chapters that it is almost impossible to compressthem further. The author at the outset states his purpose: 'Since it ismy object to write what shall be useful to whosoever understands it, itseems to me better to follow the practical truth of things rather thanan imaginary view of them. For many Republics and Princedoms have beenimagined that were never seen or known to exist in reality. And themanner in which we live and in which we ought to live, are things sowide asunder that he who suits the one to betake himself to the other ismore likely to destroy than to save himself.' Nothing that Machiavelliwrote is more sincere, analytic, positive and ruthless. He operatesunflinchingly on an assured diagnosis. The hand never an instantfalters, the knife is never blunt. He deals with what is, and not withwhat ought to be. Should the Prince be all-virtuous, all-liberal,all-humane? Should his word be his bond for ever? Should true religionbe the master-passion of his life? Machiavelli considers. The first dutyof the Prince (or Government) is to maintain the existence, stability,and prosperity of the State. Now if all the world were perfect so shouldthe Prince be perfect too. But such are not the conditions of humanlife. An idealising Prince must fall before a practising world. A Princemust learn in self-defence how to be bad, but like Caesar Borgia, he mustbe a great judge of occasion. And what evil he does must be deliberate,appropriate, and calculated, and done, not selfishly, but for the goodof the State of which he is trustee. There is the power of Law and thepower of Force. The first is proper to men, the second to beasts. Andthat is why Achilles was brought up by Cheiron the Centaur that he mightlearn to use both natures. A ruler must be half lion and half fox, a foxto discern the toils, a lion to drive off the wolves. Merciful,faithful, humane, religious, just, these he may be and above all shouldseem to be, nor should any word escape his lips to give the lie to hisprofessions: and in fact he should not leave these qualities but when hemust. He should, if possible, practise goodness, but under necessityshould know how to pursue evil. He should keep faith until occasionalter, or reason of state compel him to break his pledge. Above all heshould profess and observe religion, 'because men in general judgerather by the eye than by the hand, and every one can see but few cantouch.' But none the less, must he learn (as did William the Silent,Elizabeth of England, and Henry of Navarre) how to subordinate creed topolicy when urgent need is upon him. In a word, he must realise and facehis own position, and the facts of mankind and of the world. If notveracious to his conscience, he must be veracious to facts. He must notbe bad for badness' sake, but seeing things as they are, must deal as hecan to protect and preserve the trust committed to his care. Fortune isstill a fickle jade, but at least the half our will is free, and if weare bold we may master her yet. For Fortune is a woman who, to be keptunder, must be beaten and roughly handled, and we see that she is moreready to be mastered by those who treat her so, than by those who areshy in their wooing. And always, like a woman, she gives her favours tothe young, because they are less scrupulous and fiercer and moreaudaciously command her to their will.[Sidenote: The Appeal.]And so at the last the sometime Secretary of the Florentine Republicturns to the new Master of the Florentines in splendid exhortation. Hepoints to no easy path. He proposes no mean ambition. He has saidalready that 'double will that Prince's glory be, who has founded a newrealm and fortified it and adorned it with good laws, good arms, goodfriends, and good examples.' But there is more and better to be done.The great misery of men has ever made the great leaders of men. But wasIsrael in Egypt, were the Persians, the Athenians ever more enslaved,down-trodden, disunited, beaten, despoiled, mangled, overrun anddesolate than is our Italy to-day? The barbarians must be hounded out,and Italy be free and one. Now is the accepted time. All Italy iswaiting and only seeks the man. To you the darling of Fortune and theChurch this splendid task is given, to and to the army of Italy and ofItalians only. Arm Italy and lead her. To you, the deliverer, what gateswould be closed, what obedience refused! What jealousies opposed, whathomage denied. Love, courage, and fixed fidelity await you, and underyour standards shall the voice of Petrarch be fulfilled:            Virtu contro al furore  Prendera l'arme e fia il combatter corto:              Che l'antico valore  Negl' Italici cor non e ancor morto.Such is _The Prince_ of Machiavelli. The vision of its breathlessexhortation seemed then as but a landscape to a blind man's eye. But thepassing of three hundred and fifty years of the misery he wept forbrought at the last, almost in perfect exactness, the fulfilment of thatimpossible prophecy.[Sidenote: The Attack.]There is no great book in the world of smaller compass than _The Prince_of Machiavelli. There is no book more lucidly, directly, and plainlywritten. There is no book that has aroused more vehement, venomous, andeven truculent controversy from the moment of its publication untilto-day. And it is asserted with great probability that _The Prince_ hashad a more direct action upon real life than any other book in theworld, and a larger share in breaking the chains and lighting the darkplaces of the Middle Ages. It is a truism to say that Machiavellismexisted before Machiavelli. The politics of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, ofLouis XI. of France, of Ferdinand of Spain, of the Papacy, of Venice,might have been dictated by the author of _The Prince_. But Machiavelliwas the first to observe, to compare, to diagnose, to analyse, and toformulate their principles of government. The first to establish, not adivorce, but rather a judicial separation between the morals of a manand the morals of a government. It is around the purpose and possibleresults of such a separation in politics, ethics, and religion that thestorm has raged most fiercely. To follow the path of that storm throughnear four centuries many volumes would be needed, and it will be moreconvenient to deal with the more general questions in summing up theinfluence of Machiavelli as a whole. But the main lines and varyingfortunes of the long campaign may be indicated. During the period of itsmanuscript circulation and for a few years after its publication _ThePrince_ was treated with favour or at worst with indifference, and thefirst mutterings were merely personal to the author. He was a scurvyknave and turncoat with neither bowels nor conscience, almostnegligible. But still men read him, and a change in conditions brought achange in front. He had in _The Prince_, above all in the _Discorsi_,accused the Church of having ruined Italy and debauched the world. Inview of the writer's growing popularity, of the Reformation and thePagan Renaissance, such charges could no longer be lightly set aside.The Churchmen opened the main attack. Amongst the leaders was CardinalPole, to whom the practical precepts of _The Prince_ had beenrecommended in lieu of the dreams of Plato, by Thomas Cromwell, the_malleus monachorum_ of Henry VIII. The Catholic attack was purelytheological, but before long the Jesuits joined in the cry. Machiavelliwas burnt in effigy at Ingoldstadt. He was _subdolus diabolicarumcogitationum faber_, and _irrisor et atheos_ to boot. The Pope himselfgave commissions to unite against him, and his books were placed on theIndex, together, it must be admitted, with those of Boccaccio, Erasmus,and Savonarola so the company was goodly. But meanwhile, and perhaps inconsequence, editions and translations of _The Prince_ multiplied apace.The great figures of the world were absorbed by it. Charles V., his son,and his courtiers studied the book. Catherine de Medici brought it toFrance. A copy of _The Prince_ was found on the murdered bodies of HenryIII. and Henry IV. Richelieu praised it. Sextus V. analysed it in hisown handwriting. It was read at the English Court; Bacon was steeped init, and quotes or alludes to it constantly. Hobbes and Harringtonstudied it.But now another change. So then, cried Innocent Gentillet, the Huguenot,the book is a primer of despotism and Rome, and a grammar for bigots andtyrants. It doubtless is answerable for the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.The man is a _chien impur_. And in answer to this new huntsman the wholeProtestant pack crashed in pursuit. Within fifty years of his death _ThePrince_ and Machiavelli himself had become a legend and a myth, ahaunting, discomforting ghost that would not be laid. Machiavellism hadgrown to be a case of conscience both to Catholic and Protestant, toTheologian, Moralist, and Philosopher. In Spain the author, damned inFrance for his despotism and popery, was as freshly and freely damnedfor his civil and religious toleration. In England to the Cavaliers hewas an Atheist, to the Roundheads a Jesuit. Christina of Swedenannotated him with enthusiasm. Frederick the Great published his_Anti-Machiavel_ brimming with indignation, though it is impossible notto wonder what would have become of Prussia had not the Prussian king soclosely followed in practice the precepts of the Florentine, above allperhaps, as Voltaire observed, in the publication of the_Anti-Machiavel_ itself. No doubt in the eighteenth century, whenmonarchy was so firmly established as not to need Machiavelli, kings andstatesmen sought to clear kingship of the supposed stain he hadbesmirched them with. But their reading was as little as theirmisunderstanding was great, and the Florentine Secretary remained themysterious necromancer. It was left for Rousseau to describe the book ofthis 'honnete homme et bon citoyen' as 'le livre des Republicains,' andfor Napoleon, the greatest of the author's followers if not disciples,to draw inspiration and suggestion from his Florentine forerunner and tojustify the murder of the Due d'Enghien by a quotation from _ThePrince_. 'Mais apres tout,' he said, 'un homme d'Etat est-il fait pouretre sensible? N'est-ce pas un personnage--completement excentrique,toujours seul d'un cote, avec le monde de l'autre?' and again 'Jugezdone s'il doit s'amuser a menager certaines convenances de sentiments siimportantes pour le commun des hommes? Peut-il considerer les liens dusang, les affections, les puerils menagements de la societe? Et dans lasituation ou il se trouve, que d'actions separees de l'ensemble et qu'onblame, quoiqu'elles doivent contribuer au grand oeuvre que tout le monden'apercoit pas? ... Malheureux que vous etes! vous retiendrez vos elogesparce que vous craindrez que le mouvement de cette grande machine nefasse sur vous l'effet de Gulliver, qui, lorsqu'il deplacait sa jambe,ecrasait les Lilliputiens. Exhortez-vous, devancez le temps, agrandissezvotre imagination, regardez de loin, et vous verrez que ces grandspersonnages que vous croyez violents, cruels, que sais-je? ne sont quedes politiques. Ils se connaissent, se jugent mieux que vous, et, quandils sont reellement habiles, ils savent se rendre maitres de leurspassions car ils vont jusqu'a en calculer les effets.' Even in hiscarriage at Waterloo was found a French translation of _The Prince_profusely annotated.[Sidenote: The Defence.]But from the first the defence was neither idle nor weak. The assaultwas on the morals of the man: the fortress held for the ideas of thethinker. He does not treat of morals, therefore he is immoral, cried theplaintiff. Has he spoken truth or falsehood? Is his word the truth andwill his truth prevail? was the rejoinder. In Germany and Italyespecially and in France and England in less degree, philosophers andcritics have argued and written without stint and without cease. Ashistory has grown wider and more scientific so has the preponderance ofopinion leaned to the Florentine's favour.It would be impossible to recapitulate the arguments or even to indicatethe varying points of view. And indeed the main hindrance in forming ajust idea of _The Prince_ is the constant treatment of a single side ofthe book and the preconceived intent of the critic. Bacon has alreadybeen mentioned. Among later names are Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibnitz. Herdergives qualified approval, while Fichte frankly throws down the glove as_The Prince's_ champion. 'Da man weiss dass politische Machtfragen nie,am wenigsten in einem verderbten Volke, mit den Mitteln der Moral zuloesen sind, so ist es unverstaendig das Buch von Fuersten zu verschreien.Macchiavelli hatte einen Herrscher zu schildern, keinen Klosterbruder.'The last sentence may at least be accepted as a last word by practicalpoliticians. Ranke and Macaulay, and a host of competent Germans andItalians have lent their thought and pens to solve the riddle in theFlorentine's favour. And lastly, the course of political events inEurope have seemed to many the final justification of the teaching of_The Prince_. The leaders of the Risorgimento thought that they found inletters, 'writ with a stiletto,' not only the inspirations of patriotismand the aspirations to unity, but a sure and trusted guide to theachievement. Germany recognised in the author a schoolmaster to leadthem to unification, and a military instructor to teach them of an ArmedPeople. Half Europe snatched at the principle of Nationality. For in_The Prince_, Machiavelli not only begat ideas but fertilised the ideasof others, and whatever the future estimation of the book may be, itstands, read or unread, as a most potent, if not as the dominant, factorin European politics for four hundred years.[Sidenote: The _Discorsi_.]The _Discorsi_, printed in Rome by Blado, 1537, are not included in thepresent edition, as the first English translation did not appear until1680, when almost the entire works of Machiavelli were published by ananonymous translator in London. But some account and consideration oftheir contents is imperative to any review of the Florentine's politicalthoughts. Such Discorsi and Relazioni were not uncommon at the time. Thestronger and younger minds of the Renaissance wearied of discussing inthe lovely gardens of the Rucellai the ideas of Plato or the allegoriesof Plotinus. The politics of Aristotle had just been intelligiblytranslated by Leonardo Bruni (1492). And to-day the young ears and eyesof Florence were alert for an impulse to action. They saw glimpses, inreopened fields of history, of quarries long grown over where the ore ofpositive politics lay hid. The men who came to-day to the OrtiOricellarii were men versed in public affairs, men of letters,historians, poets, living greatly in a great age, with Raphael, MichaelAngelo, Ariosto, Leonardo going up and down amongst them. Machiavelliwas now in fair favour with the Medici, and is described by Strozzi as_una persona per sorgere_ (a rising man). He was welcomed into the groupwith enthusiasm, and there read and discussed the _Discorsi_. Nominallymere considerations upon the First Decade of Livy, they rapidlyencircled all that was known and thought of policy and state-craft, oldand living.[Sidenote: Their Plan.]Written concurrently with _The Prince_, though completed later, the_Discorsi_ contain almost the whole of the thoughts and intents of themore famous book, but with a slightly different application. '_ThePrince_ traces the progress of an ambitious man, the _Discorsi_ theprogress of an ambitious people,' is an apt if inadequate criticism.Machiavelli was not the first Italian who thought and wrote upon theproblems of his time. But he was the first who discussed grave questionsin modern language. He was the first modern political writer who wroteof men and not of man, for the Prince himself is a collectiveindividuality.'This must be regarded as a general rule,' is ever in Machiavelli'smouth, while Guicciardini finds no value in a general rule, but only in'long experience and worthy discretion.' The one treated of policy, theother of politics. Guicciardini considered specifically by what methodsto control and arrange an existing Government. Machiavelli sought tocreate a science, which should show how to establish, maintain, andhinder the decline of states generally conceived. Even Cavour countedthe former as a more practical guide in affairs. But Machiavelli was thetheorist of humanity in politics, not the observer only. Hedistinguished the two orders of research. And, during the ItalianRenaissance such distinction was supremely necessary. With a crumbledtheology, a pagan Pope, amid the wreck of laws and the confusion ofsocial order, _il sue particolare_ and _virtu_, individuality andability (energy, political genius, prowess, vital force: _virtu_ isimpossible to translate, and only does not mean virtue), were thedominating and unrelenting factors of life. Niccolo Machiavelli, unlikeMontesquieu, agreed with Martin Luther that man was bad. It was for boththe Wittenberger and the Florentine, in their very separate ways, tofound the school and wield the scourge. In the naked and unashamedcandour of the time Guicciardini could say that he loathed the Papacyand all its works. 'For all that, he adds, 'the preferments I haveenjoyed, have forced me for my private ends to set my heart upon papalgreatness. Were it not for this consideration, I should love MartinLuther as my second self.' In the _Discorsi_, Machiavelli bitterlyarraigns the Church as having 'deprived Italians of religion andliberty.' He utterly condemns Savonarola, yet he could love and learnfrom Dante, and might almost have said with Pym, 'The greatest libertyof the Kingdom is Religion. Thereby we are freed from spiritual evils,and no impositions are so grievous as those that are laid upon thesoul.'[Sidenote: Religion.]The Florentine postulates religion as an essential element in a strongand stable State. Perhaps, with Gibbon, he deemed it useful to theMagistrate. But his science is impersonal. He will not tolerate a Churchthat poaches on his political preserves. Good dogma makes bad politics.It must not tamper with liberty or security. And most certainly, withDante, in the _Paradiso_, he would either have transformed or omittedthe third Beatitude, that the Meek shall inherit the earth. With such atemperament, Machiavelli must ever keep touch with sanity. It was notfor him as for Aristotle to imagine what an ideal State should be, butrather to inquire what States actually were and what they might actuallybecome. He seeks first and foremost 'the use that may be derived fromhistory in politics'; not from its incidents but from its generalprinciples. His darling model of a State is to be found where Dantefound it, in the Roman Republic. The memory and even the substance ofDante occur again and again. But Dante's inspiration was spiritual:Machiavelli's frankly pagan, and with the latter Fortune takes the placeof God. Dante did not love the Papacy, but Machiavelli, pointing out howeven in ancient Rome religion was politic or utilitarian, leads up tohis famous attack upon the Roman Church, to which he attributes all theshame and losses, political, social, moral, national, that Italy hassuffered at her hands. And now for the first time the necessity forItalian Unity is laid plainly down, and the Church and its temporalpower denounced as the central obstacles. In religion itself theSecretary saw much merit. 'But when it is an absolute question of thewelfare of our country, then justice or injustice, mercy or cruelty,praise or ignominy, must be set aside, and we must seek alone whatevercourse may preserve the existence and liberty of the state.' Throughoutthe _Discorsi_, Machiavelli in a looser and more expansive form,suggests, discusses, or re-affirms the ideas of _The Prince_. There isthe same absence of judgment on the moral value of individual conduct;the same keen decision of its practical effect as a political act. Buthere more than in _The Prince_, he deals with the action and conduct ofthe people. With his passion for personal and contemporary incarnationhe finds in the Swiss of his day the Romans of Republican Rome, andreiterates the comparison in detail. Feudalism, mercenaries, politicalassociations embodied in Arts and Guilds, the Temporal power of theChurch, all these are put away, and in their stead he announces the newand daring gospel that for organic unity subjects must be treated asequals and not as inferiors. 'Trust the people' is a maxim he repeatsand enforces again and again. And he does not shrink from, but ratherurges the corollary, 'Arm the people.' Indeed it were no audaciousparadox to state the ideal of Machiavelli, though he nominally preferreda Republic, as a Limited Monarchy, ruling over a Nation in Arms. Nodoubt he sought, as was natural enough in his day, to construct theState from without rather than to guide and encourage its evolution fromwithin. It seemed to him that, in such an ocean of corruption, Force_was_ a remedy and Fraud no sluttish handmaid. 'Vice n'est-ce pas,'writes Montaigne, of such violent acts of Government, 'car il a quittesa raison a une plus universelle et puissante raison.' Even so thePrince and the people could only be justified by results. But the publiclife is of larger value than the private, and sometimes one man must becrucified for a thousand. Despite all prejudice and make-belief, such arule and practice has obtained from the Assemblies of Athens to theParliaments of the twentieth century. But Machiavelli first candidlyimparted it to the unwilling consciences and brains of men, and it is hewho has been the chosen scape-goat to carry the sins of the people. Hisearnestness makes him belie his own precept to keep the name and takeaway the thing. In this, as in a thousand instances, he was not toodarkly hidden; he was too plain. 'Machiavelli,' says one who studied theFlorentine as hardly another had done, 'Machiavelli hat gesuendigt, abernoch mehr ist gegen ihn gesuendigt worden.' Liberty is good, but Unity isits only sure foundation. It is the way to the Unity of Government andPeople that the thoughts both of _The Prince_ and the _Discorsi_ lead,though the incidents be so nakedly presented as to shock the timorousand vex the prurient, the puritan, and the evil thinker. The people mustobey the State and fight and die for its salvation, and for the Princethe hatred of the subjects is never good, but their love, and the bestway to gain it is by 'not interrupting the subject in the quietenjoyment of his estate.' Even so bland and gentle a spirit as the poetGray cannot but comment, 'I rejoice when I see Machiavelli defended orillustrated, who to me appears one of the wisest men that any nation inany age hath produced.'[Sidenote: The Art of War.]Throughout both _The Prince_ and the _Discorsi_ are constant allusionsto, and often long discussions on, military affairs. The Army profoundlyinterested Machiavelli both as a primary condition of national existenceand stability, and also, as he pondered upon the contrast betweenancient Rome and the Florence that he lived in, as a subject fascinatingin itself. His _Art of War_ was probably published in 1520. Before thatdate the Florentine Secretary had had some personal touch both with thetheory and practice of war. As a responsible official in the camp beforePisa he had seen both siege work and fighting. Having lost faith inmercenary forces he made immense attempts to form a National Militia,and was appointed Chancellor of the Nove della Milizia. In Switzerlandand the Tyrol he had studied army questions. He planned with PietroNavarro the defence of Florence and Prato against Charles V. At Veronaand Mantua in 1509, he closely studied the famous siege of Padua. Frombirth to death war and battles raged all about him, and he had personalknowledge of the great captains of the Age. Moreover, he saw in Italytroops of every country, of every quality, in every stage of discipline,in every manner of formation. His love of ancient Rome led him naturallyto the study of Livy and Vegetius, and from them with regard toformations, to the relative values of infantry and cavalry and otherpoints of tactics, he drew or deduced many conclusions which hold goodto-day. Indeed a German staff officer has written that in reading theFlorentine you think you are listening to a modern theorist of war. Butfor the theorist of those days a lion stood in the path. The art of warwas not excepted from the quick and thorough transformation that allearthly and spiritual things were undergoing. Gunpowder, long invented,was being applied. Armour, that, since the beginning, had saved both manand horse, had now lost the half of its virtue. The walls of fortresses,impregnable for a thousand years, became as matchwood ramparts. Themounted man-at-arms was found with wonder to be no match for thelightly-armoured but nimble foot-man. The Swiss were seen to hold theirown with ease against the knighthood of Austria and Burgundy. The FreeCompanies lost in value and prestige what they added to their corruptionand treachery. All these things grew clear to Machiavelli. But hisalmost fatal misfortune was that he observed and wrote in the mid-momentof the transition. He had no faith in fire-arms, and as regards theportable fire-arms of those days he was right. After the artillery workat Ravenna, Novara, and Marignano it is argued that he should have knownbetter. But he was present at no great battles, and pike, spear, andsword had been the stable weapons of four thousand years. These wereindeed too simple to be largely modified, and the future of mechanismsand explosives no prophet uninspired could foresee. And indeed thearmament and formation of men were not the main intent of Machiavelli'sthought. His care in detail, especially in fortifications, of which hemade a special study, in encampments, in plans, in calculations, isimmense. Nothing is so trivial as to be left inexact.[Sidenote: The New Model.]But he centred his observation and imagination on the origin, character,and discipline of an army in being. He pictures the horror, waste, andfailure of a mercenary system, and lays down the fatal error in Italy ofseparating civil from military life, converting the latter into a trade.In such a way the soldier grows to a beast, and the citizen to a coward.All this must be changed. The basic idea of this astounding Secretary isto form a National Army, furnished by conscription and informed by thespirit of the New Model of Cromwell. All able-bodied men between theages of seventeen and forty should be drilled on stated days and be keptin constant readiness. Once or twice a year each battalion must bemobilised and manoeuvred as in time of war. The discipline must beconstant and severe. The men must be not only robust and well-trained,but, above all, virtuous, modest, and disposed to any sacrifice for thepublic good. So imbued should they be with duty and lofty devotion totheir country that though they may rightly deceive the enemy, reward theenemy's deserters and employ spies, yet 'an apple tree laden with fruitmight stand untouched in the midst of their encampment.' The infantryshould far exceed the cavalry, 'since it is by infantry that battles arewon.' Secrecy, mobility, and familiarity with the country are to beobjects of special care, and positions should be chosen from whichadvance is safer than retreat. In war this army must be led by onesingle leader, and, when peace shines again, they must go back contentedto their grateful fellow-countrymen and their wonted ways of living. Theconception and foundation of such a scheme, at such a time, by such aman is indeed astounding. He broke with the past and with allcontemporary organisations. He forecast the future of military Europe,though his own Italy was the last to win her redemption through hisplans. 'Taken all in all,' says a German military writer, 'we mayrecognise Machiavelli in his inspired knowledge of the principles ofuniversal military discipline as a true prophet and as one of theweightiest thinkers in the field of military construction andconstitution. He penetrated the essence of military technique with aprecision wholly alien to his period, and it is, so to say, a newpsychological proof of the relationship between the art of war and theart of statecraft, that the founder of Modern Politics is also the firstof modern Military Classics.'But woe to the Florentine Secretary with his thoughts born centuriesbefore their time. As in _The Prince_, so in the _Art of War_, he closeswith a passionate appeal of great sorrow and the smallest ray of hope.Where shall I hope to find the things that I have told of? What is Italyto-day? What are the Italians? Enervated, impotent, vile. Wherefore, 'Ilament mee of nature, the which either ought not to have made mee aknower of this, or it ought to have given mee power, to have bene ableto have executed it: For now beeing olde, I cannot hope to have anyoccasion, to be able so to doo: In consideration whereof, I have beneliberall with you who beeing grave young men, may (when the thinges saidof me shall please you) at due times, in favoure of your Princes, helpethem and counsider them. Wherin I would have you not to be afraied, ormistrustfull, because this Province seemes to bee altogether given toraise up againe the things deade, as is seene by the perfection thatPoesie, painting, and writing, is now brought unto: Albeit, as much asis looked for of mee, beeing strooken in yeeres, I do mistrust. Wheresurely, if Fortune had heretofore graunted mee so much state, assuffiseth for a like enterprise, I would not have doubted, but in mostshort time, to have shewed to the world, how much the auncient ordersavaile: and without peradventure, either I would have increased it withglory, or lost it without shame.'[Sidenote: _The History of Florence_.]In 1520 Machiavelli was an ageing and disappointed man. He was notpopular with any party, but the Medici were willing to use him in minormatters if only to secure his adherence. He was commissioned by Giuliode Medici to write a history of Florence with an annual allowance of 100florins. In 1525 he completed his task and dedicated the book to itsbegetter, Pope Clement VII.In the History, as in much of his other work, Machiavelli enriches thescience of humanity with a new department. 'He was the first tocontemplate the life of a nation in its continuity, to trace theoperation of political forces through successive generations, tocontrast the action of individuals with the evolution of causes overwhich they had but little control, and to bring the salient features ofthe national biography into relief by the suppression of comparativelyunimportant details.' He found no examples to follow, for Villani withall his merits was of a different order. Diarists and chroniclers therewere in plenty, and works of the learned men led by Aretino, written inLatin and mainly rhetorical. The great work of Guicciardini was notpublished till years after the Secretary's death. Machiavelli broke awayfrom the Chronicle or any other existing form. He deliberately appliedphilosophy to the sequence of facts. He organised civil and politicalhistory. He originally intended to begin his work at the year 1234, theyear of the return of Cosimo il Vecchio from exile and of theconsolidation of Medicean power on the ground that the earlier periodshad been covered by Aretino and Bracciolini. But he speedily recognisedthat they told of nothing but external wars and business while the heartof the history of Florence was left unbared. The work was to do again invery different manner, and in that manner he did it. Throughout hemaintains and insistently insinuates his unfailing explanation of themiseries of Italy; the necessity of unity and the evils of the Papacywhich prevents it. In this book dedicated to a Pope he scants nothing ofhis hatred of the Holy See. For ever he is still seeking the one strongman in a blatant land with almost absolute power to punish, pull down,and reconstruct on an abiding foundation, for to his clear eyes it isever the events that are born of the man, and not the man of the events.He was the first to observe that the Ghibellines were not only theImperial party but the party of the aristocrats and influential men,whereas the Guelphs were the party not only of the Church but of thepeople, and he traces the slow but increasing struggle to the triumph ofdemocracy in the Ordinamenti di Giustizia (1293). But the triumph wasnot final. The Florentines were 'unable to preserve liberty and couldnot tolerate slavery.' So the fighting, banishments, bloodshed, cruelty,injustice, began once more. The nobles were in origin Germanic, hepoints out, the people Latin; so that a racial bitterness gave accent totheir hate. But yet, he adds impartially, when the crushed nobility wereforced to change their names and no longer dared be heard 'Florence wasnot only stripped of arms but likewise of all generosity.' It would beimpossible to follow the History in detail. The second, seventh andeighth books are perhaps the most powerful and dramatic. Outside affairsand lesser events are lightly touched. But no stories in the world havebeen told with more intensity than those of the conspiracies in theseventh and eighth books, and none have given a more intimate andaccurate perception of the modes of thought and feeling at the time. TheHistory ends with the death of Lorenzo de Medici in 1492. Enough hasbeen said of its breadth of scope and originality of method. The spiritof clear flaming patriotism, of undying hope that will not in thedarkest day despair, the plangent appeal to Italy for its own great saketo rouse and live, all these are found pre-eminently in the History asthey are found wherever Machiavelli speaks from the heart of his heart.Of the style a foreigner may not speak. But those who are proper judgesmaintain that in simplicity and lucidity, vigour, and power, softness,elevation, and eloquence, the style of Machiavelli is 'divine,' andremains, as that of Dante among the poets, unchallenged and insuperableamong all writers of Italian prose.[Sidenote: Other Works.]Though Machiavelli must always stand as a political thinker, anhistorian, and a military theorist it would leave an insufficient ideaof his mental activities were there no short notice of his otherliterary works. With his passion for incarnating his theories in asingle personality, he wrote the _Life of Castruccio Castracani_, apolitico-military romance. His hero was a soldier of fortune born Luccain 1281, and, playing with a free hand, Machiavelli weaves a life ofadventure and romance in which his constant ideas of war and politicsrun through and across an almost imaginary tapestry. He seems to haveintended to illustrate and to popularise his ideals and to attain by astory the many whom his discourses could not reach. In verse Machiavelliwas fluent, pungent, and prosaic. The unfinished _Golden Ass_ is merelymade of paragraphs of the _Discorsi_ twined into rhymes. And the othersare little better. Countless pamphlets, essays, and descriptions may besearched without total waste by the very curious and the very leisurely.The many despatches and multitudinous private letters tell the storyboth of his life and his mind. But the short but famous _Novella diBelfagor Arcidiavolo_ is excellent in wit, satire, and invention. As aplaywright he wrote, among many lesser efforts, one supreme comedy,_Mandragola_, which Macaulay declares to be better than the best ofGoldoni's plays, and only less excellent than the very best ofMoliere's. Italian critics call it the finest play in Italian. The plotis not for nursery reading, but there are tears and laughter and pityand anger to furnish forth a copious author, and it has been not illobserved that _Mandragola_ is the comedy of a society of which _ThePrince_ is the tragedy.[Sidenote: The End.]It has been said of the Italians of the Renaissance that with so much ofunfairness in their policy, there was an extraordinary degree offairness in their intellects. They were as direct in thought as theywere tortuous in action and could see no wickedness in deceiving a manwhom they intended to destroy. To such a charge--if charge itbe--Machiavelli would have willingly owned himself answerable. Heobserved, in order to know, and he wished to use his knowledge for theadvancement of good. To him the means were indifferent, provided onlythat they were always apt and moderate in accordance with necessity, Asurgeon has no room for sentiment: in such an operator pity were acrime. It is his to examine, to probe, to diagnose, flinching at noulcer, sparing neither to himself or to his patient. And if he may notact, he is to lay down very clearly the reasons which led to hisconclusions and to state the mode by which life itself may be saved,cost what amputation and agony it may. This was Machiavelli's business,and he applied his eye, his brains, and his knife with a relentlesspersistence, which, only because it was so faithful, was not calledheroic. And we know that he suffered in the doing of it and that hisheart was sore for his patient. But there was no other way. His recordis clear and shining. He has been accused of no treachery, of no evilaction. His patriotism for Italy as a fatherland, a dream undreamt byany other, never glowed more brightly than when Italy lay low in shame,and ruin, and despair. His faith never faltered, his spirit nevershrank. And the Italy that he saw, through dark bursts of storm, brokenand sinking, we see to-day riding in the sunny haven where he would haveher to be.HENRY CUST.CONTENTS             PAGETHE ARTE OF WARRE       1THE PRINCE            251THE ARTE OF WARREWRITTEN FIRST IN ITALIAN BYNICHOLAS MACHIAVELLAND SET FORTHE IN ENGLISHE BYPETER WHITEHORNESTUDIENT AT GRAIES INNEWITH AN ADDICION OF OTHER LIKEMARCIALLE FEATES AND EXPERIMENTESAS IN A TABLEIN THE ENDE OF THE BOOKEMAIE APPERE1560_Menfss.

Whereby thei not onely made their Souldiours so experte, thatthei obtained with a fewe, in faightyng againste a greate hougemultitude of enemies, soche marveilous victories, as in many credibleHistories are mencioned, but also by the same meanes, their unarmed andrascalle people that followed their Campes, gotte soche understandyng inthe feates of warre, that thei in the daie of battaile, beeyng leftedestitute of succour, were able without any other help, to setthemselves in good order, for their defence againste the enemie, thatwould seke to hurte theim, and in soche daungerous times, have doentheir countrie so good service, that verie often by their helpe, theadversaries have been put to flight, and fieldes moste happely wone. Sothat thantiquitie estemed nothing more happie in a common weale, then tohave in the same many men skilfull in warlike affaires: by meaneswhereof, their Empire continually inlarged, and moste wonderfully andtriumphantly prospered. For so longe as men for their valiauntnesse,were then rewarded and had in estimacion, glad was he that could findeoccasion to venter, yea, and spende his life, to benefite his countrie:as by the manly actes that Marcus Curcius, Oracius Cocles, and GaiusMucius did for the savegarde of Rome and also by other innumerable likeexamples dooeth plainly appeare. But when through long and continuallpeace, thei began to bee altogether given to pleasure and delicatenesse,little regardyng Marciall feates, nor soche as were expert in thepractise thereof: Their dominions and estates, did not so moche beforeincrease and prospere, as then by soche meanes and oversight, theisodainly fell into decaie and utter ruine. For soche truly is the natureand condicion, bothe of peace and warre, that where in governemente,there is not had equalle consideration of them bothe, the one in fine,doeth woorke and induce, the others oblivion and utter abholicion.Wherfore, sith the necessitie of the science of warres is so greate, andalso the necessarie use thereof so manifeste, that even Ladie Peace herself, doeth in maner from thens crave her chief defence andpreservacion, and the worthinesse moreover, and honour of the same sogreate, that as by prose we see, the perfecte glorie therof, cannoteasely finde roote, but in the hartes of moste noble couragious andmanlike personages, I thought most excellente Princes, I could noteither to the specialle gratefiyng of your highnesse, the universalldelight of all studious gentlemen, or the common utilitie of the publikewealth, imploie my labours more profitablie in accomplishyng of myduetie and good will, then in settyng foorthe some thing, that mightinduce to the augmentyng and increase of the knowledge thereof:inespecially thexample of your highnes most politike governemente overus, givyng plaine testimonie of the wonderfull prudente desire that isin you, to have your people instructed in this kinde of service, as wellfor the better defence of your highnesse, theim selves, and theircountrie, as also to discourage thereby, and to be able to resist themalingnitie of the enemie, who otherwise would seeke peradventure, toinvade this noble realme or kyngdome.When therfore about x. yeres paste, in the Emperours warres against theMores and certain Turkes beyng in Barberie, at the siege and winnyng ofCalibbia, Monesterio and Africa, I had as well for my furtherinstruction in those affaires, as also the better to acquainte me withthe Italian tongue, reduced into Englishe, the booke called The arte ofWarre, of the famous and excellente Nicholas Machiavell, whiche in timespaste he beyng a counsailour, and Secretarie of the noble Citee ofFlorence, not without his greate laude and praise did write: and havynglately againe, somwhat perused the same, the whiche in soche continuallbroiles and unquietnesse, was by me translated, I determined with myself, by publishyng thereof, to bestowe as greate a gift (sins greater Iwas not able) emongeste my countrie men, not experte in the Italiantongue, as in like woorkes I had seen before me, the Frenchemen,Duchemen, Spaniardes, and other forreine nacions, moste lovyngly to havebestowed emongeste theirs: The rather undoubtedly, that as by privatereadyng of the same booke, I then felt my self in that knowledgemarveilously holpen and increased, so by communicatyng the same to many,our Englishemen findyng out the orderyng and disposyng of exploictes ofwarre therein contained, the aide and direction of these plaine andbriefe preceptes, might no lesse in knowledge of warres becomeincomperable, then in prowes also and exercise of the same, altogetherinvincible: which my translacion moste gracious Soveraine, together withsoche other thynges, as by me hath been gathered, and thought good toadde thereunto, I have presumed to dedicate unto youre highnes: notonely bicause the whole charge and furniture of warlike counsailes andpreparacions, being determined by the arbitremente of Governours andPrinces, the treatise also of like effecte should in like maner as ofright, depende upon the protection of a moste worthie and noblePatronesse, but also that the discourse it self, and the woorke of aforrein aucthour, under the passeport and safeconduite of your highnesmoste noble name, might by speciall aucthoritie of the same, winneemongest your Majesties subjectes, moche better credite and estimacion.And if mooste mightie Queen, in this kind of Philosophie (if I maie soterme it) grave and sage counsailes, learned and wittie preceptes, orpolitike and prudente admonicions, ought not to be accompted the leastand basest tewels of weale publike. Then dare I boldely affirme, that ofmany straungers, whiche from forrein countries, have here tofore in thisyour Majesties realme arrived, there is none in comparison to beepreferred, before this worthie Florentine and Italian, who havyng frelywithout any gaine of exchaunge (as after some acquaintaunce andfamiliaritie will better appeare) brought with hym moste riche, rare andplentiful Treasure, shall deserve I trust of all good Englishe lishehartes, most lovingly and frendly to be intertained, embraced andcherished. Whose newe Englishe apparell, how so ever it shall seme byme, after a grosse fasion, more fitlie appoincted to the Campe, then innice termes attired to the Carpet, and in course clothyng rather puttefoorthe to battaile, then in any brave shewe prepared to the bankette,neverthelesse my good will I truste, shall of your grace be taken ingood parte, havyng fashioned the phraise of my rude stile, evenaccordyng to the purpose of my travaile, whiche was rather to profitethe desirous manne of warre, then to delight the eares of the fineRethorician, or daintie curious scholemanne: Moste humblie besechyngyour highnes, so to accept my labour herein, as the first fruictes of apoore souldiours studie, who to the uttermoste of his smalle power, inthe service of your moste gracious majestie, and of his countrie, willat al tymes, accordyng to his bounden duetie and allegeaunce, promptlieyeld hym self to any labour, travaile, or daunger, what so ever shalhappen. Praiyng in the mean season the almightie God, to give yourhighnes in longe prosperous raigne, perfect health, desiredtranquilitie, and against all your enemies, luckie and joifull victorie.Your humble subject and dailie oratour,PETER WHITEHORNE.THE PROHEMEOF NICHOLAS MACHIAVELL,Citezein and Secretarie of Florence,upon his booke of the Arte of Warre, untoLaurence Philippe Strozze, one of thenobilitie of Florence.There have Laurence, many helde, and do holde this opinion, that thereis no maner of thing, whiche lesse agreeth the one with the other, northat is so much unlike, as the civil life to the Souldiours. Wherby itis often seen, that if any determin in thexercise of that kinde ofservice to prevaile, that incontinent he doeth not only chaunge inapparel, but also in custome and maner, in voice, and from the facion ofall civil use, he doeth alter: For that he thinketh not meete to clothewith civell apparell him, who wil be redie, and promt to all kinde ofviolence, nor the civell customes, and usages maie that man have, thewhiche judgeth bothe those customes to be effeminate, and those usagesnot to be agreable to his profession: Nor it semes not convenient forhim to use the civill gesture and ordinarie wordes, who with fasing andblasphemies, will make afraied other menne: the whiche causeth in thistime, suche opinion to be moste true. But if thei should considerthauncient orders, there should nothing be founde more united, moreconfirmable, and that of necessitie ought to love so much the one theother, as these: for as muche as all the artes that are ordeined in acommon weale, in regarde or respecte of common profite of menne, all theorders made in the same, to live with feare of the Lawe, and of Godshould be vaine, if by force of armes their defence wer not prepared,which, well ordeined, doe maintain those also whiche be not wellordeined. And likewise to the contrarie the good orders, without thesouldiours help, no lesse or otherwise doe disorder, then the habitacionof a sumptuous and roiall palais, although it wer decte with gold andprecious stones, when without being covered, should not have wherewithto defende it from the raine. And if in what so ever other orders ofCities and Kyngdomes, there hath been used al diligence for to maintainmen faithfull, peaceable, and full of the feare of God, in the serviceof warre, it was doubled: if for in what man ought the countrie to sekegreater faith, then in him, who must promise to die for the same? Inwhom ought there to bee more love of peace, then in him, whiche onely bythe warre maie be hurte? In whome ought there to bee more feare of GOD,then in him, which every daie committyng himself to infinite perilles,hath moste neede of his helpe? This necessitie considered wel, bothe ofthem that gave the lawes to Empires, and of those that to the exerciseof service wer apoincted, made that the life of Souldiours, of othermenne was praised, and with all studie folowed and imitated. But theorders of service of war, beyng altogether corrupted, and a greate waiefrom the auncient maners altered, there hath growen these sinisterousopinions, which maketh men to hate the warlike service, and to flie theconversacion of those that dooe exercise it. Albeit I judgeing by thesame, that I have seen and redde, that it is not a thyng impossible, tobryng it again to the auncient maners, and to give it some facion of thevertue passed, I have determined to the entente not to passe this myidell time, without doyng some thyng, to write that whiche I doeunderstande, to the satisfaction of those, who of aunciente actes, arelovers of the science of warre. And although it be a bold thing tointreate of the same matter, wher of otherwise I have made noprofession, notwithstanding I beleve it is no errour, to occupie withwordes a degree, the whiche many with greater presumpcion with theirdeedes have occupied: for as muche as the errours that I maie happen tomake by writing, may be without harme to any man corrected: but thosethe whiche of them be made in doyng cannot be knowen without the ruineof Empires. Therefore Laurence you ought to consider the qualitie ofthis my laboure, and with your judgement to give it that blame, or thatpraise, as shall seeme unto you it hath deserved. The whiche I sendeunto you, as well to shewe my selfe gratefull, although my habilitiereche not to the benefites, which I have received of you, as also forthat beyng the custome to honour with like workes them who fornobilitie, riches, wisedome, and liberalitie doe shine: I knowe you forriches, and nobilitie, not to have many peeres, for wisedome fewe, andfor liberalitie none.THE ARTE OF

BOOKEForasmuch as I beleve that after death, al men maie be praised withoutcharge, al occasion and suspecte of flatterie beyng taken awaie, I shalnot doubte to praise our Cosimo Ruchellay, whose name was neverremembred of me without teares, havyng knowen in him those condicions,the whiche in a good frende or in a citezien, might of his freendes, orof his countrie, be desired: for that I doe not knowe what thyng was somuche his, not excepting any thing (saving his soule) which for hisfrendes willingly of him should not have been spent: I knowe not whatenterprise should have made him afraide, where the same should have benknowen to have been for the benefite of his countrie. And I doe painlyconfesse, not to have mette emongest so many men, as I have knowen, andpractised withal, a man, whose minde was more inflamed then his, untogreat and magnificent thynges. Nor he lamented not with his frendes ofany thyng at his death, but because he was borne to die a yong mannewithin his owne house, before he had gotten honour, and accordynge tohis desire, holpen any manne: for that he knewe, that of him coulde notbe spoken other, savyng that there should be dead a good freende. Yet itresteth not for this, that we, and what so ever other that as we didknow him, are not able to testifie (seeyng his woorkes doe not appere)of his lawdable qualities. True it is, that fortune was not for al this,so muche his enemie, that it left not some brief record of thereadinesse of his witte, as doeth declare certaine of his writinges, andsettyng foorthe of amorous verses, wherin (although he were not in love)yet for that he would not consume time in vain, til unto profounderstudies fortune should have brought him, in his youthfull age heexercised himselfe. Whereby moste plainly maie be comprehended, with howmoche felicitie he did describe his conceiptes, and how moche forPoetrie he should have ben estemed, if the same for the ende therof, hadof him ben exercised. Fortune having therfore deprived us from the useof so great a frende, me thinketh there can bee founde no other remedie,then as muche as is possible, to seke to enjoye the memorie of the same,and to repeate suche thynges as hath been of him either wittely saied,or wisely disputed. And for as much as there is nothyng of him morefreshe, then the reasonyng, the whiche in his last daies SigniorFabricio Collonna, in his orchard had with him, where largely of thesame gentilman were disputed matters of warre, bothe wittely andprudently, for the moste parte of Cosimo demaunded, I thought good, forthat I was present there with certain other of our frendes, to bring itto memorie, so that reading the same, the frendes of Cosimo, whichethether came, might renewe in their mindes, the remembraunce of hisvertue: and the other part beyng sorie for their absence, might partlylearne hereby many thynges profitable, not onely to the life ofSouldiours, but also to civil mennes lives, which gravely of a mostewise man was disputed. Therfore I saie, that Fabricio Collonnaretournyng out of Lombardie, where longe time greatly to his glorie, hehad served in the warres the catholike kyng, he determined, passyng byFlorence, to rest himself certain daies in the same citee, to visite theDukes excellencie, and to see certaine gentilmen, whiche in times pastehe had been acquainted withal. For whiche cause, unto Cosimo it wasthought beste to bid him into his orchard, not so muche to use hisliberalitee, as to have occasion to talke with him at leasure, and ofhim to understande and to learne divers thinges, accordyng as of suche aman maie bee hoped for, semyng to have accasion to spende a daie inreasonyng of suche matters, which to his minde should best satisfie him.Then Fabricio came, accordyng to his desire, and was received of Cosimotogether, with certain of his trustie frendes, emongest whome wer ZanobyBuondelmonti, Baptiste Palla, and Luigi Allamanni, all young men lovedof him and of the very same studies moste ardente, whose good qualities,for as muche as every daie, and at every houre thei dooe praisethemselves, we will omit. Fabricio was then accordyng to the time andplace honoured, of all those honours, that thei could possible devise:But the bankettyng pleasures beyng passed, and the tabel taken up, andal preparacion of feastinges consumed, the which are sone at an ende insight of greate men, who to honorable studies have their mindes set, thedaie beyng longe, and the heate muche, Cosimo judged for to contentbetter his desire, that it wer well doen, takyng occasion to avoide theheate, to bring him into the moste secret, and shadowest place of hisgarden. Where thei beyng come, and caused to sit, some upon herbes, somein the coldest places, other upon litle seates which there was ordeined,under the shadow of moste high trees, Fabricio praiseth the place, to bedelectable, and particularly consideryng the trees, and not knowyng someof them, he did stande musinge in his minde, whereof Cosimo beeyng aware saied, you have not peradventure ben acquainted with some of thesesortes of trees: But doe not marvell at it, for as muche as there beesome, that were more estemed of the antiquitie, then thei are commonlynow a daies: and he tolde him the names of them, and how Barnardo hisgraundfather did travaile in suche kinde of plantyng: Fabricio replied,I thought it shuld be the same you saie, and this place, and thisstudie, made me to remember certaine Princes of the Kyngdome of Naples,whiche of these anncient tillage and shadow doe delight. And staiyngupon this talke, and somewhat standyng in a studdie, saied moreover, ifI thought I should not offende, I woud tell my opinion, but I beleeve Ishall not, commonyng with friendes, and to dispute of thynges, and notto condemne them. How much better thei should have doen (be it spokenwithout displeasure to any man) to have sought to been like theantiquitie in thinges strong, and sharpe, not in the delicate and softe:and in those that thei did in the Sunne, not in the shadowe: and to takethe true and perfecte maners of the antiquitie: not those that are falseand corrupted: for that when these studies pleased my Romaines, mycountrie fell into ruin. Unto which Cosimo answered. But to avoide thetediousnesse to repeate so many times he saied, and the other answered,there shall be onely noted the names of those that speakes, withoutrehersing other.Then COSIMO saied, you have opened the waie of a reasoning, which I havedesired, and I praie you that you will speake withoute respecte, forthat that I without respecte will aske you, and if I demaundyng, orrepliyng shall excuse, or accuse any, it shal not be to excuse, oraccuse, but to understande of you the truth.FABRICIO. And I shall be very well contented to tell you that, whiche Iunderstand of al the same that you shall aske me, the whiche if it shallbe true, or no, I wil report me to your judgemente: and I will be gladthat you aske me, for that I am to learne, as well of you in askyng me,as you of me in aunswerynge you: for as muche as many times a wisedemaunder, maketh one to consider many thynges, and to knowe many other,whiche without havyng been demaunded, he should never have knowen.COSIMO. I will retourne to thesame, that you said first, that mygraundfather and those your Princes, should have doen more wisely, tohave resembled the antiquitie in hard thinges, then in the delicate, andI will excuse my parte, for that, the other I shall leave to excuse foryou. I doe not beleve that in his tyme was any manne, that so mochedetested the livyng in ease, as he did, and that so moche was a lover ofthe same hardenesse of life, whiche you praise: notwithstandyng he knewenot how to bee able in persone, nor in those of his sonnes to use it,beeyng borne in so corrupte a worlde, where one that would digresse fromthe common use, should bee infamed and disdained of every man:consideryng that if one in the hottest day of Summer being naked, shouldwallowe hymself upon the Sande, or in Winter in the moste coldestmonethes upon the snowe, as Diogenes did, he should be taken as a foole.If one, (as the Spartans were wonte to doe) should nourishe his childrenin a village, makyng them to slepe in the open aire, to go with heddeand feete naked, to washe them selves in the colde water for to hardenthem, to be able to abide moche paine, and for to make theim to lovelesse life, and to feare lesse death, he should be scorned, and sonertaken as a wilde beast, then as a manne. If there wer seen also one, tonourishe himself with peason and beanes, and to despise gold, asFabricio doeth, he should bee praised of fewe, and followed of none: sothat he being afraied of this present maner of livyng, he leftthauncient facions, and thesame, that he could with lest admiracionimitate in the antiquitie, he did.FABRICIO. You have excused it in this parte mooste strongly: and surelyyou saie the truthe: but I did not speake so moche of this harde manerof livyng, as of other maners more humaine, and whiche have with thelife now a daies greater conformitie. The whiche I doe not beleve, thatit hath been difficulte to bryng to passe unto one, who is nombredemongest Princes of a citee: for the provyng whereof, I will never sekeother, then thexample of the Romaines. Whose lives, if thei wer wellconsidred, and thorders of thesame common weale, there should therin beseen many thinges, not impossible to induce into a cominaltie, so thatit had in her any good thing.COSIMO. What thynges are those, that you would induce like unto theantiquitie.FABRICIO. To honour, and to reward vertue, not to despise povertie, toesteme the maners and orders of warfare, to constrain the citezeins tolove one an other, to live without sectes, to esteme lesse the private,than the publike, and other like thinges, that easily might bee withthis time accompanied: the which maners ar not difficult to bring topasse, when a man should wel consider them, and entre therin by duemeanes: for asmoche as in thesame, the truth so moche appereth, thatevery common wit, maie easely perceive it: which thing, who thatordeineth, doth plant trees, under the shadowe wherof, thei abide morehappie, and more pleasantly, then under these shadowes of this goodlygardeine.COSIMO. I will not speake any thyng againste thesame that you havesaied, but I will leave it to bee judged of these, whom easely canjudge, and I will tourne my communicacion to you, that is an accusar oftheim, the whiche in grave, and greate doynges, are not followers of theantiquitie, thinkyng by this waie more easely to be in my ententsatisfied. Therfore, I would knowe of you whereof it groweth, that ofthe one side you condempne those, that in their doynges resemble not theantiquitie? Of the other, in the warre, whiche is your art, wherin youare judged excellent, it is not seen, that you have indevoured yourself, to bryng the same to any soche ende, or any thyng at all resembledtherein the auncient maners.FABRICIO. You are happened upon the poincte, where I loked: for that mytalke deserved no other question: nor I desired other: and albeit that Icould save my self with an easie excuse, not withstandyng for my morecontentacion, and yours, seyng that the season beareth it, I will enterin moche longer reasoning. Those men, whiche will enterprise any thyng,ought firste with all diligence to prepare theim selves, to be ready andapte when occasion serveth, to accomplish that, which thei havedetermined to worke: and for that when the preparacions are madecraftely, thei are not knowen, there cannot be accused any man of anynegligence, if firste it be not disclosed by thoccasion: in the whichworking not, is after seen, either that there is not prepared so mocheas suffiseth, or that there hath not been of any part therof thoughtupon. And for as moche as to me there is not come any occasion to beable, to shewe the preparacions made of me, to reduce the servise ofwarre into his auncient orders, if I have not reduced it, I cannot be ofyou, nor of other blamed: I beleve this excuse shuld suffise for answereto your accusement.COSIMO. It should suffice, when I wer certain, that thoccasion were notcome.FABRICIO. But for that I know, that you maie doubt whether this occasionhath been cum, or no, I will largely (when you with pacience will heareme) discourse what preparacions are necessary first to make, whatoccasion muste growe, what difficultie doeth let, that the preparacionshelp not, and why thoccasion cannot come, and how these things at ones,which some contrary endes, is most difficill, and most easie to do.COSIMO. You cannot do bothe to me, and unto these other, a thing morethankfull then this. And if to you it shall not be tedious to speake,unto us it shal never be grevous to heare: but for asmoch as thisreasonyng ought to be long, I will with your license take helpe of thesemy frendes: and thei, and I praie you of one thyng, that is, that youwill not bee greved, if some tyme with some question of importaunce, weinterrupte you.[Sidenote: Why a good man ought never to use the exercise of armes, ashis art.]FABRICIO. I am moste well contented, that you Cosimo with these otheryounge men here, doe aske me: for that I beleve, that youthfulnes, willmake you lovers of warlike thinges, and more easie to beleve thesame,that of me shalbe saied. These other, by reason of havyng nowe theirhedde white, and for havyng upon their backes their bloude congeled,parte of theim are wonte to bee enemies of warre, parte uncorrectable,as those, whom beleve, that tymes, and not the naughtie maners,constraine men to live thus: so that safely aske you all of me, andwithout respecte: the whiche I desire, as well, for that it maie be untome a little ease, as also for that I shall have pleasure, not to leavein your mynde any doubt. I will begin at your woordes, where you saiedunto me, that in the warre, that is my arte, I had not indevoured tobryng it to any aunciente ende: whereupon I saie, as this beyng an arte,whereby men of no maner of age can live honestly, it cannot bee used foran arte, but of a common weale: or of a kyngdome: and the one and theother of these, when thei bee well ordeined, will never consente to anytheir Citezeins, or Subjectes, to use it for any arte, nor never anygood manne doeth exercise it for his particulare arte: for as moche asgood he shall never bee judged, whom maketh an excersise thereof, wherepurposing alwaies to gaine thereby, it is requisite for hym to beravenyng, deceiptfull, violente, and to have many qualities, the whicheof necessitie maketh hym not good: nor those menne cannot, whiche use itfor an arte, as well the greate as the leaste, bee made otherwise: forthat this arte doeth not nourishe them in peace. Wherfore thei arconstrained either to thinke that there is no peace, or so moche toprevaile in the tyme of warre, that in peace thei maie bee able to kepethem selves: and neither of these two thoughtes happeneth in a good man:for that in mindyng to bee able to finde himself at all tymes, dooegrowe robberies, violence, slaughters, whiche soche souldiours make aswell to the frendes, as to the enemies: and in mindyng not to havepeace, there groweth deceiptes, whiche the capitaines use to those,whiche hire them, to the entent the warre maie continue, and yet thoughthe peace come often, it happeneth that the capitaines beyng deprived oftheir stipendes, and of their licencious livyng, thei erecte an ansigneof adventures, and without any pitie thei put to sacke a province. Havenot you in memorie of your affaires, how that beyng many Souldiours inItalie without wages, bicause the warre was ended, thei assembledtogether many companies, and went taxyng the tounes, and sackyng thecountrie, without beyng able to make any remedie? Have you not red, thatthe Carthagenes souldiours, the first warre beyng ended which thei hadwith the Romaines, under Matho, and Spendio, twoo capitaines,rebelliously constituted of theim, made more perillous warre to theCarthaginens, then thesame whiche thei had ended with the Romaines? Inthe time of our fathers, Frances Sforza, to the entente to bee able tolive honourably in the time of peace, not only beguiled the Millenars,whose souldiour he was, but he toke from them their libertie and becametheir Prince. Like unto him hath been all the other souldiours of Italiewhiche have used warfare, for their particulare arte, and albeeit theihave not through their malignitie becomen Dukes of Milein, so moche themore thei deserve to bee blamed: for that although thei have not gottenso moch as he, thei have all (if their lives wer seen) sought to bringthe like thynges to passe. Sforza father of Fraunces, constrained QueneJone, to caste her self into the armes of the king of Aragon, havyng ina sodain forsaken her, and in the middest of her enemies, lefte herdisarmed, onely to satisfie his ambicion, either in taxyng her, or intakyng from her the Kyngdome. Braccio with the verie same industrie,sought to possesse the kyngdome of Naples, and if he had not beenoverthrowen and slaine at Aquila, he had brought it to passe. Likedisorders growe not of other, then of soche men as hath been, that usethe exercise of warfare, for their proper arte. Have not you a Proverbe,whiche fortefieth my reasons, whiche saieth, that warre maketh Theves,and peace hangeth theim up? For as moche as those, whiche knowe not howto live of other exercise, and in the same finding not enie man tosustayne theym, and havyng not so moche power, to knowe how to reducetheim selves together, to make an open rebellion, they are constraynedof necessetie to Robbe in the highe waies, and Justice is enforced toextinguishe theim.COSIMO. You have made me to esteme this arte of warfare almoste asnothyng, and I have supposed it the moste excellentes, and mostehonourableste that hath been used: so that if you declare me it notbetter, I cannot remaine satisfied: For that when it is thesame, thatyou saie, I knowe not, whereof groweth the glorie of Cesar, of Pompei,of Scipio, of Marcello, and of so many Romaine Capitaines, whiche byfame are celebrated as Goddes.FABRICIO. I have not yet made an ende of disputyng al thesame, that Ipurposed to propounde: whiche were twoo thynges, the one, that a goodmanne could not use this exercise for his arte: the other, that a commonweale or a kingdome well governed, did never permitte, that theirSubjectes or Citezeins should use it for an arte. Aboute the firste, Ihave spoken as moche as hath comen into my mynde: there remaineth in meto speake of the seconde where I woll come to aunswere to this yourlaste question, and I saie that Pompey and Cesar, and almoste all thoseCapitaines, whiche were at Rome, after the laste Carthagenens warre,gotte fame as valiaunt men, not as good, and those whiche lived beforethem, gotte glorie as valiaunte and good menne: the whiche grewe, forthat these tooke not the exercise of warre for their arte: and thosewhiche I named firste, as their arte did use it. And so longe as thecommon weale lived unspotted, never any noble Citezein would presume, bythe meane of soche exercise, to availe thereby in peace, breakyng thelawes, spoilyng the Provinces, usurpyng, and plaiyng the Tyraunte in thecountrie, and in every maner prevailyng: nor any of how lowe degree soever thei were, would goe aboute to violate the Religion, confederatyngtheim selves with private men, not to feare the Senate, or to followeany tirannicall insolence, for to bee able to live with the arte ofwarre in all tymes. But those whiche were Capitaines, contented withtriumphe, with desire did tourne to their private life, and those whichewere membres, would be more willyng to laie awaie their weapons, then totake them, and every manne tourned to his science, whereby thei gottetheir livyng: Nor there was never any, that would hope with praie, andwith this arte, to be able to finde theim selves. Of this there maie bemade concernyng Citezeins, moste evidente conjecture, by the ensample ofRegolo Attillio, who beyng Capitain of the Romaine armies in Affrica,and havyng as it wer overcome the Carthegenens, he required of theSenate, licence to retourne home, to kepe his possessions, and toldthem, that thei were marde of his housbandmen. Whereby it is more clerethen the Sunne, that if thesame manne had used the warre as his arte,and by meanes thereof, had purposed to have made it profitable unto him,havyng in praie so many Provinces, he would not have asked license, toreturne to kepe his feldes: for as moche as every daie he mightotherwise, have gotten moche more, then the value of al thosepossessions: but bicause these good men and soche as use not the warrefor their arte, will not take of thesame any thing then labour,perilles, and gloris, when thei are sufficiently glorious, thei desireto returne home, and to live of their owne science. Concernyng menne oflowe degree, and common souldiours, to prove that thei kepte the veriesame order, it doeth appeare that every one willingly absented theimselves from soche exercise, and when thei served not in the warre, theiwould have desired to serve, and when thei did serve, thei would havedesired leave not to have served: whiche is wel knowen through manyinsamples, and inespecially seeyng how emonge the firste privileges,whiche the Romaine people gave to their Citezeins was, that thei shouldnot be constrained against their willes, to serve in the warres.Therefore Rome so long as it was well governed, whiche was untill thecommyng of Graccus, it had not any Souldiour that would take thisexercise for an arte, and therefore it had fewe naughtie, and those fewwer severely punished. Then a citee well governed, ought to desire, thatthis studie of warre, be used in tyme of peace for exercise, and in thetime of warre, for necessitie and for glorie: and to suffer onely thecommon weale to use it for an arte, as Rome did, and what so everCitezein, that hath in soche exercise other ende, is not good, and whatso ever citee is governed otherwise, is not well ordeined.COSIMO. I remain contented enough and satisfied of thesame, whichehetherto you have told, and this conclusion pleaseth me verie wel whicheyou have made, and as muche as is loked for touching a common welth, Ibeleve that it is true, but concerning Kinges, I can not tell nowe, forthat I woulde beleve that a Kinge would have about him, whomeparticularly should take suche exercise for his arte.FABRICIO. A kingdome well ordred ought moste of all to avoide the likekinde of men, for only thei, are the destruction of their king, and alltogether ministers of tiranny, and alledge me not to the contrarie aniepresente kingdome, for that I woll denie you all those to be kingdomeswell ordered, bicause the kingdomes whiche have good orders, give nottheir absolute Empire unto their king, saving in the armies, for as muchas in this place only, a quicke deliberation is necessarie, and for thiscause a principall power ought to be made. In the other affaires, heought not to doe any thing without councell, and those are to be feared,which councell him, leaste he have some aboute him which in time ofpeace desireth to have warre bicause they are not able without the sameto live, but in this, I wilbe a little more large: neither to seke akingdome altogether good, but like unto those whiche be nowe a daieswhere also of a king those ought to be feared, whiche take the warre fortheire art, for that the strength of armies without any doubte are thefoote menne: so that if a king take not order in suche wise, that hismen in time of peace may be content to returne home, and to live oftheir owne trades, it will follow of necessitie, that he ruinate: forthat there is not found more perilous men, then those, whiche make thewarre as their arte: bicause in such case, a king is inforsed eitheralwaies to make warre, or to paie them alwaies, or else to bee inperill, that they take not from him his kingdome. To make warre alwaies,it is not possible: to paie them alwaies it can not be: see that ofnecessitie, he runneth in peril to lese the state. The Romaines (as Ihave saide) so long as they were wise and good, would never permitte,that their Citizeins should take this exercise for their arte, althoughthey were able to nurrishe them therin alwaies, for that that alwaiesthey made warre: but to avoide thesame hurte, whiche this continuallexercise might doe them, seyng the time did not varie, they changed themen, and from time to time toke such order with their legions, that inxv. yeres alwaies, they renewed them: and so thei had their men in thefloure of their age, that is from xviij. to xxxiij. yeres, in which timethe legges, the handes, and the yes answere the one the other, nor theitarried not till there strengthe should decaie, and there naghtinesincrease, as it did after in the corrupted times. For as muche asOctavian first, and after Tiberius, minding more their own proper power,then the publicke profite, began to unarme the Romaine people, to beable easely to commaunde them, and to kepe continually those same armieson the frontries of the Empire: and bicause also they judged those, notsufficient to kepe brideled the people and Romaine Senate, they ordeinedan armie called Pretoriano, which laie harde by the walles of Rome, andwas as a rocke on the backe of the same Citie. And for as much as thenthei began frely to permitte, that suche men as were apoincted in sucheexercises, should use the service of warre for their arte, streight waiethe insolence of theim grewe, that they became fearful unto the Senate,and hurtefull to the Emperour, whereby ensued suche harme, that maniewere slaine thorough there insolensie: for that they gave, and tokeawaie the Empire, to whome they thought good. And some while it hapned,that in one self time there were manie Emperours, created of diversarmies, of whiche thinges proceded first the devision of the Empire, andat laste the ruine of the same. Therefore kinges ought, if thei wil livesafely, to have there souldiours made of men, who when it is time tomake warre, willingly for his love will go to the same, and when thepeace cometh after, more willingly will returne home. Whiche alwaieswilbe, when thei shalbe men that know how to live of other arte thenthis: and so they ought to desire, peace beyng come, that there Princedoo tourne to governe their people, the gentilmen to the tending ofthere possessions, and the common souldiours to their particular arte,and everie one of these, to make warre to have peace, and not to seke totrouble the peace, to have warre.COSIMO. Truely this reasonyng of yours, I thinke to bee well considered,notwithstanding beyng almost contrarie to that, whiche till nowe I havethought, my minde as yet doeth not reste purged of all doubte, for asmuche as I see manie Lordes and gentelmen, to finde them selves in timeof peace, thorough the studies of warre, as your matches bee, who haveprovision of there princes, and of the cominaltie. I see also, almost althe gentelmen of armes, remaine with neir provision, I see maniesouldiours lie in garison of Cities and fortresses, so that my thinkes,that there is place in time of peace, for everie one.FABRICIO. I doe not beleve that you beleve this, that in time of peaceeverie man may have place, bicause, put case that there coulde not bebrought other reason, the small number, that all they make, whicheremaine in the places alledged of you, would answer you. What proporcionhave the souldiours, whiche are requiset to bee in the warre with those,whiche in the peace are occupied? For as much as the fortreses, and thecities that be warded in time of peace, in the warre are warded muchemore, unto whome are joyned the souldiours, whiche kepe in the fielde,whiche are a great number, all whiche in the peace be putte awaie. Andconcerning the garde of states, whiche are a small number, Pope July,and you have shewed to everie man, how muche are to be feared those, whowill not learne to exercise any other art, then the warre, and you havefor there insolence, deprived them from your garde, and have placedtherin Swisers, as men borne and brought up under lawes, and chosen ofthe cominaltie, according to the true election: so that saie no more,that in peace is place for everie man. Concerning men at armes, thei alremaining in peace with their wages, maketh this resolution to seme moredifficulte: notwithstandyng who considereth well all, shall finde theanswere easie, bicause this manner of keping men of armes, is acorrupted manner and not good, the occasion is, for that they be men,who make thereof an arte, and of them their should grow every daie athousande inconveniencies in the states, where thei should be, if theiwere accompanied of sufficient company: but beyng fewe, and not able bythem selves to make an armie, they cannot often doe suche grevoushurtes, neverthelesse they have done oftentimes: as I have said ofFrances, and of Sforza his father, and of Braccio of Perugia: so thatthis use of keping men of armes, I doe not alowe, for it is a corruptemaner, and it may make great inconveniencies.COSIMO. Woulde you live without them? or keping them, how would you kepethem?[Sidenote: A kinge that hath about him any that are to much lovers ofwarre, or to much lovers of peace shal cause him to erre.]FABRICIO. By waie of ordinaunce, not like to those of the king ofFraunce: for as muche as they be perilous, and insolent like unto ours,but I would kepe them like unto those of the auncient Romaines, whomcreated their chivalry of their own subjectes, and in peace time, theisente them home unto their houses, to live of their owne trades, as morelargely before this reasoning ende, I shal dispute. So that if now thispart of an armie, can live in such exercise, as wel when it is peace, itgroweth of the corrupt order. Concerning the provisions, which arereserved to me, and to other capitaines, I saie unto you, that thislikewise is an order moste corrupted: for as much as a wise commonweale, ought not to give such stipendes to any, but rather thei ought touse for Capitaines in the warre, their Citezeins, and in time of peaceto will, that thei returne to their occupations. Likewise also, a wiseking either ought not to give to suche, or giving any, the occasionought to be either for rewarde of some worthy dede, or else for thedesire to kepe suche a kinde of man, as well in peace as in warre. Andbicause you alledged me, I will make ensample upon my self, and saiethat I never used the warre as an arte, for as muche as my arte, is togoverne my subjectes, and to defende them, and to be able to defendethem, to love peace, and to know how to make warre, and my kinge not somuche to rewarde and esteeme me, for my knowledge in the warre, as forthe knowledge that I have to councel him in peace. Then a king ought notto desire to have about him, any that is not of this condicion if he bewise, and prudently minde to governe: for that, that if he shal haveabout him either to muche lovers of peace, or to much lovers of warre,they shall make him to erre. I cannot in this my firste reasoning, andaccording to my purpose saie more, and when this suffiseth you not, itis mete, you seke of them that may satisfie you better. You maie nowverie well understand, how difficulte it is to bringe in use theauncient maners in the presente warres, and what preparations are metefor a wise man to make, and what occasions ought to be loked for, to beable to execute it. But by and by, you shall know these things better,if this reasoning make you not werie, conferring what so ever partes ofthe auncient orders hath ben, to the maners nowe presente.COSIMO. If we desired at the first to here your reason of these thinges,truly thesame whiche hetherto you have spoken, hath doubled our desire:wherefore we thanke you for that we have hard, and the rest, we crave ofyou to here.FABRICIO. Seyng that it is so your pleasure, I will begin to intreate ofthis matter from the beginning, to the intent it maye be betterunderstode, being able by thesame meane, more largely to declare it. Theende of him that wil make warre, is to be able to fight with every enemyin the fielde and to be able to overcum an armie. To purpose to doethis, it is convenient to ordeine an hoost. To ordein an hoost, theirmust be found menne, armed, ordered, and as well in the small, as in thegreat orders exercised, to knowe howe to kepe araie, and to incampe, sothat after bringing them unto the enemie, either standing or marching,they maie know how to behave themselves valiantly. In this thingconsisteth all the industrie of the warre on the lande, whiche is themost necessarie, and the most honorablest, for he that can wel order afielde against the enemie, the other faultes that he should make in theaffaires of warre, wilbe borne with: but he that lacketh this knowledge,although that in other particulars he be verie good, he shal never bringa warre to honor: for as muche as a fielde that thou winnest, lesing?img 94 doeth cancell all other thy evill actes: so like wise lesing it,all thinges well done of thee before, remaine vaine. Therfore, beyngnecessarie first to finde the menne, it is requiset to come to thechoise of them. They whiche unto the warre have given rule, will thatthe menne be chosen out of temperate countries, to the intente they mayhave hardines, and prudence, for as muche as the hote countrey, bredesprudente men and not hardy, the colde, hardy, and not prudente. Thisrule is good to be geven, to one that were prince of all the world,bicause it is lawfull for him to choose men out of those places, whichehe shall thinke beste. But minding to give a rule, that every one mayuse, it is mete to declare, that everie common weale, and everykingdome, ought to choose their souldiours out of their owne countrie,whether it be hote, colde, or temperate: for that it is scene by oldeensamples, how that in every countrie with exercise, their is made goodsouldiours: bicause where nature lacketh, the industry supplieth, thewhich in this case is worthe more, then nature, and taking them in otherplaces, you shal not have of the choise, for choise is as much to saie,as the best of a province, and to have power to chuse those that willnot, as well as those that wil serve. Wherfore, you muste take yourchoise in those places, that are subjecte unto you, for that you cannottake whome you liste, in the countries that are not yours, but you mustetake suche as will goe with you.COSIMO. Yet there maie bee of those, that will come, taken and lefte,and therefore, thei maie be called chosen.[Sidenote: Oute of what Countrie is best to chuse Souldiours to make agood election.]FABUICIO. You saie the truthe in a certaine maner, but consider thefaultes, whiche soche a chosen manne hath in himselfe, for that alsomany times it hapneth, that he is not a chosen manne. For those that arenot thy subjectes, and whiche willyngly doe serve, are not of the beste,but rather of the worste of a Province, for as moche as if any besclanderous, idell, unruly, without Religion, fugetive from the rule oftheir fathers, blasphemours, Dise plaiers, in every condicion evillbrought up, bee those, whiche will serve, whose customes cannot be morecontrarie, to a true and good servise: Albeit, when there bee offeredunto you, so many of soche men, as come to above the nomber, that youhave appoincted, you maie chuse them: but the matter beyng naught, thechoise is not possible to be good: also, many times it chaunceth, thatthei be not so many, as will make up the nomber, whereof you have nede,so that beyng constrained to take them al, it commeth to passe, thatthei cannot then bee called chosen men, but hired Souldiours. With thisdisorder the armies of Italie, are made now a daies, and in otherplaces, except in Almaine, bicause there thei doe not hire any bycommaundemente of the Prince, but accordyng to the will of them, thatare disposed to serve. Then consider now, what maners of those auncientearmies, maie bee brought into an armie of men, put together by likewaies.COSIMO. What waie ought to bee used then?FABRICIO. The same waie that I saied, to chuse them of their ownesubjectes, and with the auethoritie of the Prince.COSMO. In the chosen, shall there bee likewise brought in any auncientfacion?FABRICIO. You know well enough that ye: when he that should commaundetheim, were their Prince, or ordinarie lorde, whether he were madechief, or as a Citezein, and for the same tyme Capitaine, beyng a commonweale, otherwise it is harde to make any thyng good.COSIMO. Why?FABRICIO. I will tell you a nane: For this time I will that this suffiseyou, that it cannot be wrought well by other waie.[Sidenote: Whether it be better to take menne oute of townes or out ofthe countrie to serve.]COSIMO. Having then to make this choyse of men in their owne countries,whether judge you that it be better to take them oute of the citie, orout of the countrie?FABRICIO. Those that have written of such matters, doe all agree, thatit is best to chuse them out of the countrie, being men accustomed to noease, nurished in labours, used to stonde in the sunne, to flie theshadow, knowing how to occupy the spade, to make a diche, to carrie aburden, and to bee without any deceite, and without malisiousnes. But inthis parte my opinion should be, that beyng two sortes of souldiours, onfoote, and on horsebacke, that those on foote, should be chosen out ofthe countrie, and those on horseback, oute of the Cities.[Sidenote: Of what age Souldiours ought to bee chosen.]COSIMO. Of what age would you choose them?FABRICIO. I would take them, when I had to make a newe armie, from xvii.to xl. yeres: when it were made alredy, and I had to restore them, ofxvii. alwaies.COSIMO. I doe not understonde well this distinction.FABRICIO. I shall tell you: when I should ordaine an hooste to makewarre, where were no hooste alredy, it should be necessarie to chuse allthose men, which were most fitte and apte for the warre, so that theywere of servisable age, that I might bee able to instructe theim, as byme shalbe declared: but when I would make my choise of menne in places,where a powre were alredy prepared, for suppliyng of thesame, I wouldtake them of xvii. yeres: for as much as the other of more age be alredychosen and apoincted.COSIMO. Then woulde you prepare a power like to those whiche is in ourcountrie?FABRICIO. Ye truly, it is so that I would arme them, Captaine them,exercise and order them in a maner, whiche I cannot tell, if you haveordred them so.COSIMO. Then do you praise the keping of order?FABRICIO. Wherefore would you that I should dispraise it?COSIMO. Bicause many wise menne have alwaies blamed it.FABRICIO. You speake against all reason, to saie that a wise man blamethorder, he maie bee well thought wise, and be nothyng so.COSIMO. The naughtie profe, which it hath alwaies, maketh us to havesoche opinion thereof.FABRICIO. Take hede it be not your fault, and not the kepyng of order,the whiche you shall knowe, before this reasonyng be ended.COSIMO. You shall doe a thyng moste thankfull, yet I will saieconcernyng thesame, that thei accuse it, to the entente you maie thebetter justifie it. Thei saie thus, either it is unprofitable, and wetrustyng on the same, shall make us to lese our state, or it shall beverteous, and by thesame meane, he that governeth may easely deprive usthereof. Thei alledge the Romaines, who by meane of their owne powers,loste their libertie. Thei alledge the Venicians, and the Frenche king,whiche Venicians, bicause thei will not be constrained, to obeie one oftheir owne Citezeins, use the power of straungers: and the Frenche kynghath disarmed his people, to be able more easely to commaunde them, butthei whiche like not the ordinaunces, feare moche more theunprofitablenesse, that thei suppose maie insue thereby, then any thyngels: the one cause whiche thei allege is, bicause thei are unexperte:The other, for that thei have to serve par force: for asmoche as theisaie, that the aged bee not so dissiplinable, nor apte to learne thefeate of armes, and that by force, is doen never any thyng good.[Sidenote: By what meanes souldiours bee made bolde and experte.]FABRICIO. All these reasons that you have rehearsed, be of men, whicheknoweth the thyng full little, as I shall plainly declare. And firste,concernyng the unprofitablenesse, I tell you, that there is no serviceused in any countrie more profitable, then the service by the Subjectesof thesame nor thesame service cannot bee prepared, but in this maner:and for that this nedeth not to be disputed of, I will not lese mochetyme: bicause al thensamples of auncient histores, make for my purpose,and for that thei alledge the lacke of experience, and to useconstraint: I saie how it is true, that the lacke of experience, causethlacke of courage, and constrainte, maketh evill contentacion: butcourage, and experience thei are made to gette, with the maner of armyngtheim, exercisyng, and orderyng theim, as in proceadyng of thisreasonyng, you shall heare. But concernyng constrainte, you ought tounderstande, that the menne, whiche are conducted to warfare, bycommaundement of their Prince, thei ought to come, neither altogetherforced, nor altogether willyngly, for as moche as to moche willyngnesse,would make thinconveniencies, where I told afore, that he should not bea chosen manne, and those would be fewe that would go: and so to mocheconstraint, will bring forth naughtie effectes. Therefore, a meane oughtto be taken, where is not all constrainte, nor all willingnesse: butbeyng drawen of a respecte, that thei have towardes their Prince, wherethei feare more the displeasure of thesame, then the presente paine: andalwaies it shall happen to be a constrainte, in maner mingled withwillingnesse, that there cannot growe soche evil contentacion, that itmake evill effectes. Yet I saie not for all this, that it cannot beeovercome, for that full many tymes, were overcome the Romaine armies,and the armie of Aniball was overcome, so that it is seen, that an armiecannot be ordained so sure, that it cannot be overthrowen. Therefore,these your wise men, ought not to measure this unprofitablenesse, forhavyng loste ones, but to beleve, that like as thei lese, so thei maiewinne, and remeadie the occasion of the losse: and when thei shall sekethis thei shall finde, that it hath not been through faulte of the waie,but of the order, whiche had not his perfeccion and as I have saied,thei ought to provide, not with blamyng the order, but with redressingit, the whiche how it ought to be doen, you shall understande, frompoinct to poinct. Concernyng the doubte, leste soche ordinaunces, takenot from thee thy state, by meane of one, whiche is made hedde therof, Ianswere, that the armure on the backes of citezeins, or subjectes, givenby the disposicion of order and lawe, did never harme, but ratheralwaies it doeth good, and mainteineth the citee, moche lenger insuretie, through helpe of this armure, then without. Rome continued freeCCCC. yeres, and was armed. Sparta viii.C. Many other citees have beendisarmed, and have remained free, lesse then xl. For as moche as citeeshave nede of defence, and when thei have no defence of their owne, theihire straungers, and the straunges defence, shall hurte moche soner thecommon weale, then their owne: bicause thei be moche easier to becorrupted, and a citezein that becommeth mightie, maie moche sonerusurpe, and more easely bryng his purpose to passe, where the people beedisarmed, that he seketh to oppresse: besides this, a citee ought tofeare a greate deale more, twoo enemies then one. Thesame citee thatuseth straungers power, feareth at one instant the straunger, whiche ithireth, and the Citezein: and whether this feare ought to be, rememberthesame, whiche I rehearsed a little a fore of Frances Sforza. Thatcitee, whiche useth her own proper power, feareth no man, other thenonely her owne Citezein. But for all the reasons that maie bee saied,this shall serve me, that never any ordeined any common weale, orKyngdome, that would not thinke, that thei theim selves, that inhabitethesame, should with their sweardes defende it.And if the Venicians had been so wise in this, as in all their otherorders, thei should have made a new Monarchie in the world, whom somoche the more deserve blame, havyng been armed of their first giver oflawes: for havyng no dominion on the lande, thei wer armed on the sea,where thei made their warre vertuously, and with weapons in theirhandes, increased their countrie. But when thei were driven to makewarre on the lande, to defende Vicenza, where thei ought to have sentone of their citezens, to have fought on the lande, thei hired for theircapitain, the Marques of Mantua: this was thesame foolishe acte, whichecut of their legges, from climyng into heaven, and from enlargyng theirdominion: and if thei did it, bicause thei beleved that as thei knewe,how to make warre on the Sea, so thei mistrusted theim selves, to makeit on the lande, it was a mistruste not wise: for as moche as moreeasely, a capitain of the sea, whiche is used to fight with the windes,with the water, and with men, shall become a Capitaine of the lande,where he shall fight with men onely, then a capitaine of the lande, tobecome a capitain of the sea. The Romanies knowyng how to fight on thelande, and on the sea, commyng to warre, with the Carthaginens, whichewere mightie on the sea, hired not Grekes, or Spaniardes, accustomed tothe sea, but thei committed thesame care, to their Citezeins, whichethei sent on the land, and thei overcame. If thei did it, for that oneof their citezeins should not become a tiraunt, it was a feare smallyconsidered: for that besides thesame reasons, whiche to this purpose, alittle afore I have rehearsed, if a Citezein with the powers on the sea,was never made a tiraunt in a citee standyng in the sea, so moche thelesse he should have been able to accomplishe this with the powers ofthe lande: whereby thei ought to se that the weapons in the handes oftheir Citezeins, could not make tirantes: but the naughtie orders of thegovernement, whiche maketh tirannie in a citee, and thei havyng goodgovernement, thei nede not to feare their owne weapons: thei toketherefore an unwise waie, the whiche hath been occasion, to take fromthem moche glorie, and moche felicitie. Concernyng the erroure, whichethe kyng of Fraunce committeth not kepyng instructed his people in thewarre, the whiche those your wise men alledge for ensample, there is noman, (his particulare passions laied a side) that doeth not judge thisfault, to be in thesame kyngdome, and this negligence onely to make hymweake. But I have made to greate a digression, and peradventure am comeout of my purpose, albeit I have doen it to aunswere you, and to sheweyou, that in no countrie, there can bee made sure foundacion, fordefence in other powers but of their owne subjectes: and their ownpower, cannot be prepared otherwise, then by waie of an ordinaunce, norby other waie, to induce the facion of an armie in any place, nor byother meane to ordein an instruction of warfare. If you have red theorders, whiche those first kynges made in Rome, and inespecially ServioTullo, you shall finde that the orders of the Classi is no other, thenan ordinaunce, to bee able at a sodaine, to bryng together an armie, fordefence of thesame citee. But let us retourne to our choise, I saieagaine, that havyng to renewe an olde order, I would take them of xvii.havyng to make a newe armie, I would take them of all ages, betwenexvii. and xl. to be able to warre straight waie.[Sidenote: Of what science soldiours ought to bee chosen.]COSIMO. Would you make any difference, of what science you would chusethem?FABRICIO. The aucthours, which have written of the arte of warre, makedifference, for that thei will not, that there bee taken Foulers,Fishers, Cookes, baudes, nor none that use any science ofvoluptuousnesse. But thei will, that there bee taken Plowmen, Ferrars,Smithes, Carpenters, Buchars, Hunters, and soche like: but I would makelittle difference, through conjecture of the science, concernyng thegoodnesse of the man, notwithstandyng, in as moche as to be able withmore profite to use theim, I would make difference, and for this cause,the countrie men, which are used to till the grounde, are moreprofitable then any other. Next to whom be Smithes, Carpentars, Ferrars,Masons, wherof it is profitable to have enough: for that theiroccupacions, serve well in many thynges: beyng a thyng verie good tohave a souldiour, of whom maie be had double servise.[Sidenote: Howe to chose a souldiour.]COSIMO. Wherby doe thei knowe those, that be, or are not sufficient toserve.FABRICIO. I will speake of the maner of chusing a new ordinaunce, tomake an armie after, for that parte of this matter, doeth come also tobe reasoned of, in the election, which should be made for thereplenishing, or restoring of an old ordinaunce. I saie therfore, thatthe goodnesse of one, whiche thou muste chuse for a Souldiour, is knoweneither by experience, thorough meane of some of his worthy doynges, orby conjecture. The proofe of vertue, cannot be founde in men whiche arechosen of newe, and whiche never afore have ben chosen, and of these arefounde either fewe or none, in the ordinaunce that of newe is ordeined.It is necessarie therefore, lackyng this experience, to runne to theconjecture, whiche is taken by the yeres, by the occupacion, and by thepersonage: of those two first, hath been reasoned, there remaineth tospeake of the thirde. And therefore, I saie how some have willed, thatthe souldiour bee greate, emongest whom was Pirrus. Some other havechosen theim onely, by the lustinesse of the body, as Cesar did: whichelustinesse of bodie and mynde, is conjectured by the composicion of themembers, and of the grace of the countenaunce: and therefore, these thatwrite saie, that thei would have the iyes lively and cherefull, thenecke full of sinowes, the breaste large, the armes full of musculles,the fingers long, little beallie, the flankes rounde, the legges andfeete drie: whiche partes are wont alwayes to make a manne nimble andstrong, whiche are twoo thynges, that in a souldiour are sought above alother. Regarde ought to bee had above all thynges, to his customes, andthat in hym bee honestie, and shame: otherwise, there shall bee chosenan instrumente of mischief, and a beginnyng of corrupcion: for thatlette no manne beleve that in the dishoneste educacion, and filthyminde, there maie take any vertue, whiche is in any parte laudable. AndI thinke it not superfluous, but rather I beleve it to bee necessarie,to the entente you maie the better understande, the importaunce of thischosen, to tell you the maner that the Romaine Consuls, in the beginnyngof their rule, observed in the chosing of their Romain legions: in thewhiche choise of men, bicause thesame legions were mingled with oldsouldiours and newe, consideryng the continuall warre thei kepte, theimight in their choise procede, with the experince of the old, and withthe conjecture of the newe: and this ought to be noted, that these menbe chosen, either to serve incontinently, or to exercise theimincontinently, and after to serve when nede should require. But myintencion is to shew you, how an armie maie be prepared in the countrie,where there is no warlike discipline: in which countrie, chosen mencannot be had, to use them straight waie, but there, where the customeis to levie armies, and by meane of the Prince, thei maie then well beehad, as the Romaines observed, and as is observed at this daie emong theSuisers: bicause in these chosen, though there be many newe menne, therebe also so many of the other olde Souldiours, accustomed to serve in thewarlike orders, where the newe mingled together with the olde, make abodie united and good, notwithstanding, that themperours after,beginning the staciones of ordinarie Souldiours, had appoincted over thenewe souldiours, whiche were called tironi, a maister to exercise theim,as appeareth in the life of Massimo the Emperour. The whiche thyng,while Rome was free, not onely in the armies, but in the citee wasordeined: and the exercises of warre, beyng accustomed in thesame, wherethe yong men did exercise, there grewe, that beyng chosen after to goeinto warre, thei were so used in the fained exercise of warfare, thatthei could easely worke in the true: but those Emperours havyng afterput doune these exercises, thei wer constrained to use the waies, that Ihave shewed you. Therefore, comyng to the maner of the chosen Romain, Isaie that after the Romain Consulles (to whom was appoincted the chargeof the warre) had taken the rule, myndyng to ordeine their armies, forthat it was the custome, that either of them should have twoo Legions ofRomaine menne, whiche was the strength of their armies, thei createdxxiiii. Tribunes of warre, and thei appoincted sixe for every Legion,whom did thesame office, whiche those doe now a daies, that we callConestables: thei made after to come together, all the Romain men apteto beare weapons and thei put the Tribunes of every Legion, seperate theone from the other. Afterwarde, by lot thei drewe the Tribes, of whichethei had firste to make the chosen, and of thesame Tribe thei chosefower of the best, of whiche was chosen one of the Tribunes, of thefirst Legion, and of the other three was chosen, one of the Tribunes ofthe second Legion, of the other two there was chosen one of the Tribunesof the third, and the same last fell to the fowerth Legion. After theseiiij, thei chose other fower, of which, first one was chosen of theTribunes of the seconde Legion, the seconde of those of the thirde, thethirde of those of the fowerth, the fowerth remained to the first.After, thei chose other fower, the first chose the thirde, the secondthe fowerth, the thirde the fiveth, the fowerth remained to the seconde:and thus thei varied successively, this maner of chosyng, so that theelection came to be equall, and the Legions wer gathered together: andas afore we saied, this choise might bee made to use straighte waie, forthat thei made them of men, of whom a good parte were experiensed in theverie warfare in deede, and all in the fained exercised, and thei mightmake this choise by conjecture, and by experience. But where a powermust be ordeined of newe, and for this to chuse them out of hande, thischosen cannot be made, saving by conjecture, whiche is taken byconsideryng their ages and their likelinesse.COSIMO. I beleve all to be true, as moche as of you hath been spoken:but before that you procede to other reasonyng, I woll aske of you onething, which you have made me to remember: saiyng that the chosen, thatis to be made where men were not used to warre, ought to be made byconjecture: for asmoche as I have heard some men, in many placesdispraise our ordinaunce, and in especially concernyng the nomber, forthat many saie, that there ought to bee taken lesse nomber, whereof isgotten this profite, that thei shall be better and better chosen, andmen shal not be so moche diseased, so that there maie bee given themsome rewarde, whereby thei maie bee more contented, and better beecommaunded, whereof I would understande in this parte your opinion, andwhether you love better the greate nomber, than the little, and whatwaie you would take to chuse theim in the one, and in the other nomber.FABRICIO. Without doubte it is better, and more necessary, the greatnomber, then the little: but to speake more plainly, where there cannotbe ordeined a great nomber of men, there cannot be ordeined a perfectordinaunce: and I will easely confute all the reasons of thempropounded. I saie therefore firste, that the lesse nomber where is manypeople, as is for ensample Tuscane, maketh not that you have better, northat the chosen be more excellent, for that myndyng in chosing themenne, to judge them by experience, there shall be founde in thesamecountrie moste fewe, whom experience should make provable, bothe forthat fewe hath been in warre, as also for that of those, mooste fewehave made triall, whereby thei might deserve to bee chosen before theother: so that he whiche ought in like places to chuse, it is mete heleave a parte the experience, and take them by conjecture. Then beingbrought likewise into soche necessitie, I would understande, if therecome before me twentie young men of good stature, with what rule I oughtto take, or to leave any: where without doubte, I beleve that every manwill confesse, how it is lesse errour to take them al, to arme theim andexercise theim, beyng not able to knowe, whiche of theim is beste, andto reserve to make after more certaine chosen, when in practisyng theimwith exercise, there shall be knowen those of moste spirite, and ofmoste life: which considered, the chusing in this case a fewe, to havethem better, is altogether naught.Concernyng diseasing lesse the countrie, and men, I saie that theordinaunce, either evill or little that it bee, causeth not any disease,for that this order doeth not take menne from any of their businesse, itbindeth them not, that thei cannot go to doe any of their affaires: forthat it bindeth them onely in the idell daies, to assemble together, toexercise them, the whiche thyng doeth not hurt, neither to the countrie,nor to the men, but rather to yong men it shall bryng delite: For thatwhere vilie on the holy daies thei stande idell in tipplyng houses, theiwill go for pleasure to those exercises, for that the handlyng ofweapons, as it is a goodly spectacle, so unto yong men it is pleasaunt.Concernyng to bee able to paie the lesse nomber, and for this to kepetheim more obediente, and more contented, I answere, how there cannot bemade an ordinaunce of so fewe, whiche maie be in maner continuallypaied, where thesame paiment of theirs maie satisfie them. As forensample, if there were ordeined a power of v. thousande men, for topaie them after soche sorte, that it might be thought sufficient, tocontent them, it shal bee convenient to give theim at least, tenthousaunde crounes the moneth: first, this nomber of men are not able tomake an armie, this paie is intolerable to a state, and of the otherside, it is not sufficiente to kepe men contented, and bounde to be ableto serve at al times: so that in doyng this, there shall be spent moche,and a small power kept, whiche shall not be sufficient to defend thee,or to doe any enterprise of thine. If thou shouldest give theim more, orshouldest take more, so moche more impossibilitie it should be, for theeto paie theim: if thou shouldest give them lesse, or should take lesse,so moche the lesse contentacion should be in them, or so moche the lesseprofite thei shal bring thee. Therfore, those that reason of makyng anordinaunce, and whilest thei tary at home to paie them, thei reason of athing either impossible, or unprofitable, but it is necessarie to paiethem, when thei are taken up to be led to the warre: albeit, thoughsoche order should somewhat disease those, in time of peace, that areappoincted in thesame, which I se not how, there is for recompence allthose benefites, whiche a power brynges, that is ordeined in a countrie:for that without thesame, there is nothyng sure. I conclude, that hethat will have the little nomber, to be able to paie them, or for any ofthe other causes alledged of you, doeth not understande, for that alsoit maketh for my opinion, that every nomber shall deminishe in thyhandes, through infinite impedimentes, whiche men have: so that thelittle nomber shall tourne to nothing: again havyng thordinaunce greate,thou maiest at thy pleasure use fewe of many, besides this, it mustserve thee in deede, and in reputacion and alwaies the great nombershall give thee moste reputacion. More over, makyng the ordinaunce tokepe menne exercised, if thou appoincte a fewe nomber of men in manycountries, the handes of men bee so farre a sonder, the one from theother, that thou canst not without their moste grevous losse, gatherthem together to exercise them, and without this exercise, theordinaunce is unprofitable, as hereafter shall be declared.COSIMO. It suffiseth upon this my demaunde, that whiche you have saied:but I desire now, that you declare me an other doubt. Thei saie, thatsoche a multitude of armed men, will make confusion, discension anddisorder in the countrie where thei are.[Sidenote: How to provid againste soche inconveniences as souldioursmaie cause.]FABRICIO. This is an other vaine opinion, the cause wherof, I shall tellyou: soche as are ordeined to serve in the warres, maie cause disorderin twoo maners, either betwene them selves, or against other, whichethinges moste easely maie be withstode, where the order of it self,should not withstande it: for that concernyng the discorde emong theimselves, this order taketh it waie, and doeth not nourishe it, for thatin orderyng them, you give them armour and capitaines. If the countriewhere you ordein them, bee so unapte for the warre, that there are notarmours emong the men of thesame, and that thei bee so united, that theihave no heddes, this order maketh theim moche fearser against thestraunger, but it maketh them not any thyng the more disunited, for thatmen well ordered, feare the lawe beyng armed, as well as unarmed, northei can never alter, if the capitaines, which you give them, cause notthe alteracion, and the waie to make this, shall be tolde now: but ifthe countrie where you ordein them, be warlike and disunited, this orderonely shal be occasion to unite them: bicause this order giveth themarmours profitable for the warre, and heddes, extinguishers ofdiscencion: where their owne armours bee unprofitable for the warres,and their heddes nourishers of discorde. For that so sone as any inthesame countrie is offended, he resorteth by and by to his capitain tomake complaint, who for to maintain his reputacion, comforteth hym torevengement not to peace. To the contrary doeth the publike hed, so thatby this meanes, thoccasion of discorde is taken awaie, and the occasionof union is prepared, and the provinces united and effeminated, getteutilitie, and maintain union: the disunited and discencious, doe agree,and thesame their fearsnesse, which is wont disordinately to worke, istourned into publike utilitie. To minde to have them, to doe no hurtagainst other, it ought to bee considered, that thei cannot dooe this,except by meane of the heddes, whiche governe them. To will that theheddes make no disorder, it is necessarie to have care, that thei getnot over them to much auctoritie. And you must consider that thisauctoritie, is gotten either by nature, or by accidente: and as tonature, it behoveth to provide, that he which is boren in one place, benot apoincted to the men billed in the same, but be made hedde of thoseplaces, where he hath not any naturall aquaintance: and as to theaccident, the thing ought to be ordeined in suche maner, that every yerethe heddes maie be changed from governement to goverment: for as mucheas the continuall auctoritie over one sorte of menne, breedeth amongthem so muche union, that it maie turne easely to the prejudice of thePrince: whiche permutations howe profitable they be to those who haveused theim, and hurtefull to them that have not observed theim, it iswell knowen by the kingdome of the Assirians, and by the Empire of theRomaines: where is seene, that the same kingdome indured a M. yereswithout tumulte, and without any Civill warre: whiche preceded not ofother, then of the permutations, whiche from place to place everie yerethesame Capitaines made, unto whome were apoincted the charge of theArmies. Nor for any other occasion in the Romaine Empire, after thebloud of Cesar was extinguished, there grewe so many civill warres,betwene the Capitaines of the hostes, and so many conspiracies of theforsaied capitaines against the Emperours, not onely kepyng continuallystill those capitaines alwayes in one governement. And if in some ofthose firste Emperoures, of those after, whom helde the Empire withreputacion, as Adriane, Marcus, Severus, and soche like, there had beenso moche foresight, that thei had brought this custome of chaungyng thecapitaines in thesame Empire, without doubte it should have made theimmore quiete, and more durable: For that the Capitaines should have hadlesse occasion to make tumultes, the Emperours lesse cause to feare, andthe senate in the lackes of the successions, should have had in theelection of the Emperour, more aucthoritie, and by consequence shouldhave been better: but the naughtie custome, either for ignoraunce, orthrough the little diligence of menne, neither for the wicked, nor goodensamples, can be taken awaie.COSIMO. I cannot tell, if with my questionyng, I have as it were led youout of your order, bicause from the chusyng of men, we be entred into another matter, and if I had not been a little before excused, I shouldthinke to deserve some reprehension.[Sidenote: The nomber of horsemen, that the Romanies chose for a Legion,and for a Consailes armie.]FABRICIO.

TheRomanes devided their foote men in heavie and lighte armed: Those thatwere light armed, they called by the name of Veliti: Under this namewere understoode all those that threwe with Slinges, shot withCrossebowes, cast Dartes, and they used the most parte of them for theirdefence, to weare on their heade a Murion, with a Targaet on their arme:they fought out of the orders, and farre of from the heavie armed, whichdid weare a head peece, that came downe to their shoulders, a Corselet,which with the tases came downe to the knees, and they had the leggesand armes, covered with greaves, and vambraces, with a targaet on theleft arme, a yarde and a halfe long, and three quarters of a yardebrode, whiche had a hoope of Iron upon it, to bee able to sustaine ablowe, and an other under, to the intente, that it being driven to theearth, it should not breake: for to offende, they had girte on theirleft flanke a swoorde, the length of a yearde and a naile, on theirrighte side, a Dagger: they had a darte in every one of their handes,the which they called Pilo, and in the beginning of the fight, theythrewe those at the enemie. This was the ordering, and importaunce ofthe armours of the Romanes, by the which they possessed all the world.And although some of these ancient writers gave them, besides theforesayde weapons, a staffe in their hande like unto a Partasen, Icannot tell howe a heavy staff, may of him that holdeth a Targaet beoccupied: for that to handle it with both hands, the Targaet should beean impediment, and to occupye the same with one hande, there can be doneno good therewith, by reason of the weightynesse thereof: besides this,to faight in the strong, and in the orders with such long kinde ofweapon, it is unprofitable, except in the first front, where they havespace enough, to thrust out all the staffe, which in the orders within,cannot be done, for that the nature of the battaile (as in the order ofthe same, I shall tell you) is continually to throng together, whichalthough it be an inconvenience, yet in so doing they fear lesse, thento stande wide, where the perill is most evident, so that all theweapons, which passe in length a yarde and a halfe, in the throng, beunprofitable: for that, if a man have the Partasen, and will occupye itwith both handes, put case that the Targaet let him not, he can nothurte with the same an enemy, whom is upon him, if he take it with onehande, to the intent to occupy also the Targaet, being not able to takeit, but in the middest, there remayneth so much of the staff behind,that those which are behinde him, shall let him to welde it. And whetherit were true, either that the Romans had not this Partasen, or thathaving it, did little good withal, read all the battailes, in thehistorye thereof, celebrated of Titus Livius, and you shall see in thesame, most seldom times made mencion of Partasens, but rather alwaies hesaieth, that the Dartes being thrown, they laid their hands on theirsweardes. Therefore I will leave this staffe, and observe, concerningthe Romanes, the swoorde for to hurte, and for defense the Targaet, withthe other armours aforesaide.[Sidenote: A brave and a terrible thing to the enemies.]The Greekes did not arme them selves so heavyly, for their defense, asthe Romans dyd: but for to offend the enemies, they grounded more ontheir staves, then on their swoordes, and in especiallye the Fallangyeof Macedonia, which used staves, that they called Sarisse, seven yardesand a halfe long, with the which they opened the rankes of theirenemies, and they keept the orders in their Fallangy. And although somewriters saie, that they had also the Targaet, I can not tell (by thereasons aforesayde) howe the Sarisse and they coulde stande together.Besides this, in the battaile that Paulus Emilius made, with Persa kingof Macedonia, I do not remember, that there is made any mention ofTargaettes, but only of the Sarisse, and of the difficultie that theRomane armie had, to overcome them: so that I conjecture, that aMacedonicall Fallange, was no other wise, then is now a dayes a battaileof Suizzers, the whiche in their Pikes have all their force, and alltheir power. The Romanes did garnish (besides the armours) the footemenwith feathers; the whiche thinges makes the fight of an armie to thefriendes goodly, to the enemies terrible. The armour of the horsemen, inthe same first Romane antiquitie, was a rounde Targaet, and they hadtheir head armed, and the rest unarmed: They had a swoorde and a staffe,with an Iron head onely before, long and small: whereby it happened,that they were not able to staye the Targaet, and the staffe in theincountring broke, and they through being unarmed, were subjecte tohurtes: after, in processe of time, they armed them as the footemen,albeit they used the Targaette muche shorter, square, and the staffemore stiffe, and with twoo heades, to the entente, that breaking one ofthe heades, they mighte prevaile with the other. With these armours aswell on foote, as on horsebacke, the Romanes conquered all the worlde,and it is to be beleeved, by the fruiet thereof, whiche is seene, thatthey were the beste appointed armies, that ever were: and Titus Liviusin his history, doeth testifie verye often, where comming to comparisonwith the enemies armies, he saieth: But the Romanes, by vertue, by thekinde of their armours, and piactise in the service of warre, weresuperiours: and therfore I have more particularly reasoned of thearmours of conquerours, then of the conquered. But nowe mee thikes good,to reason onelye of the manner of arming men at this presente. Footemenhave for their defence, a breast plate, and for to offende, a launce,sixe yardes and three quarters long, which is called a pike, with aswoorde on their side, rather rounde at the poinct, then sharpe. This isthe ordinarie arming of footemen nowe a dayes, for that fewe there be,which have their legges armed, and their armes, the heade none, andthose fewe, beare insteede of a Pike, a Halberde, the staffe whereof asyou know, is twoo yardes and a quarter long, and it hath the Iron madelike an axe. Betweene them, they have Harkebutters, the which with theviolence of the fire, do the same office, which in olde time theslingers did, and the Crosseboweshoters. This maner of arming, was foundout by the Dutchemen, inespeciallye of Suizzers, whom being poore, anddesirous to live free, they were, and be constrayned to fight, with theambition of the Princes of Almaine, who being riche, were able to keepehorse, the which the same people could not do for povertye. Wherby itgrewe, that being on foote, minding to defende them selves from theenemies, that were on horsebacke, it behooveth them to seeke of theaunciente orders, and to finde weapons, whiche from the furie of horses,should defende them: This necessitie hath made either to be maintayned,or to bee founde of them the aunciente orders, without whiche, as everyeprudente man affirmeth, the footemen is altogether unprofitable.Therefore, they tooke for their weapon the Pike, a moste profitableweapon, not only to withstande horses, but to overcome them: and theDutchemen have by vertue of these weapons, and of these orders, takensuch boldnesse, that XV. or XX. thousande of them, will assault thegreatest nomber of horse that maye be: and of this, there hath beeneexperience enough within this XXV. yeres. And the insamples of theirvertue hath bene so mightie, grounded upon these weapons, and theseorders, that sence King Charles passed into Italie, everye nation hathimitated them: so that the Spanish armies, are become into most greatreputation.COSIMO. Which maner of arming, do you praise moste, either theseDutchemens, or the auncient Romanes?[Sidenote: Whether the Romanes maner in arming of men, be better thenthe arming of men, that is used nowe a daies.]FABRICIO. The Romane without doubte, and I will tell the commoditie, andthe discommoditie of the one, and the other. The Dutche footemen, areable to withstande, and overcome the horses: they bee moste speedie tomarche, and to be set in araye, being not laden with armours: of theother part, they be subjecte to all blowes, both farre of, and at hande:because they be unarmed, they bee unprofitable unto the battaile on thelande, and to everye fighte, where is strong resistaunce. But theRomanes withstoode, and overcame the horses, as well as the Dutchemen,they were safe from blowes at hande, and farre of, being covered witharmours: they were also better able to charge, and better able tosustaine charges, having Targaettes: they might more aptly in the preacefight with the swoorde, then these with the Pike, and though theDutchemen have likewise swoordes, yet being without Targaets, theybecome in suche case unprofitable: The Romanes might safelye assaulttownes, having their bodies cleane covered with armour, and being betterable to cover themselves with their Targaettes. So that they had noother incommoditie, then the waightynesse of their armours, and the painto cary them: the whiche thinges thei overcame, with accustomyng thebody to diseases, and with hardenyng it, to bee able to indure labour.And you knowe, how that in thinges accustomed, men suffer no grief. Andyou have to understand this, that the footemen maie be constrained, tofaight with footemen, and with horse, and alwaies those be unprofitable,whiche cannot either sustain the horses, or beyng able to sustain them,have notwithstandyng neede to feare the footemen, whiche be betterarmed, and better ordeined then thei. Now if you consider the Duchemen,and the Romaines, you shall finde in the Duchemen activitie (as we havesaid) to overcome the horses, but greate dissavauntage, when theifaighte with menne, ordeined as thei them selves are, and armed as theRomaines were: so that there shall be this advauntage more of the one,then of thother, that the Romaines could overcome the men, and thehorses, the Duchemen onely the horses.COSIMO. I would desire, that you would come to some more particulareinsample, whereby wee maie better understande.[Sidenote: An ensample whiche proveth that horsemen with staves, cannotprevaile against footemen with Pikes, and what great advauntage thearmed have, againste the unarmed. The victory of Carminvola against theDuchemen.]FABRICIO. I saie thus, that you shall finde in many places of ourhistories, the Romain footemen to have overcome innumerable horses, andyou shall never finde, that thei have been overcome of men on foote, fordefault that thei have had in their armour, or thorowe the vantage thatthe enemie hath had in the armours: For that if the maner of theirarmyng, should have had defaulte, it had been necessarie, that thereshould folowe, the one of these twoo thynges, either that findyng soche,as should arme theim better then thei, thei should not have gone stillforwardes, with their conquestes, or that thei should have taken thestraungers maners, and should have left their owne, and for that itfolowed not in the one thing, nor in the other, there groweth that thermaie be easely conjectured, that the maner of their armyng, was betterthen thesame of any other. It is not yet thus happened to the Duchemen,for that naughtie profe, hath ben seen made them, when soever thei havechaunsed to faight with men on foote prepared, and as obstinate as thei,the whiche is growen of the vauntage, whiche thesame have incountred inthenemies armours. Philip Vicecounte of Milaine, being assaulted ofxviii. thousande Suizzers, sent against theim the Counte Carminvola,whiche then was his capitaine. He with sixe thousande horse, and a fewefootemen, went to mete with them, and incounteryng theim, he wasrepulsed with his moste greate losse: wherby Carminvola as a prudenteman, knewe straight waie the puisaunce of the enemies weapons, and howmoche against the horses thei prevailed, and the debilitie of thehorses, againste those on foote so appoincted: and gatheryng his mentogether again, he went to finde the Suizzers, and so sone as he wasnere them, he made his men of armes, to a light from their horse, and inthesame mane, faightyng with them he slue theim all, excepte threethousande: the whiche seyng them selves to consume, without havyngreamedy, castyng their weapons to the grounde, yelded.COSIMO. Whereof cometh so moche disavauntage?[Sidenote: The battailes when thei are a faightyng, doe throngtogether.]FABRICIO. I have a little afore tolde you, but seyng that you have notunderstoode it, I will rehearse it againe. The Duchemen (as a littlebefore I saied unto you) as it were unarmed, to defende themselves, haveto offende, the Pike and the swearde: thei come with these weapons, andwith their orders to finde the enemies, whom if thei bee well armed, todefende theim selves, as were the menne of armes of Carminvola, whichemade theim a lighte on foote, thei come with the sweard, and in theirorders to find them, and have no other difficultie, then to come nere tothe Suizzers, so that thei maie reche them with the sweard, for that sosone as thei have gotten unto them, thei faight safely: for asmoche asthe Duch man cannot strike thenemie with the Pike, whom is upon him, forthe length of the staffe, wherefore it is conveniente for hym, to putthe hande to the sweard, the whiche to hym is unprofitable, he beyngunarmed, and havyng against hym an enemie, that is all armed. Whereby hethat considereth the vantage, and the disavantage of the one, and of theother, shall see, how the unarmed, shall have no maner of remeady, andthe overcommyng of the firste faight, and to passe the firste poinctesof the Pikes, is not moche difficulte, he that faighteth beyng wellarmed: for that the battailes go (as you shall better understande, whenI have shewed you, how thei are set together) and incounteryng the onethe other, of necessitie thei thrust together, after soche sorte, thatthei take the one thother by the bosome, and though by the Pikes somebee slaine, or overthrowen, those that remain on their feete, be somany, that thei suffice to obtaine the victorie. Hereof it grewe, thatCarminvola overcame them, with so greate slaughter of the Suizzers, andwith little losse of his.COSIMO. Consider that those of Carminvola, were men of armes, whomalthough thei wer on foote, thei were covered all with stele, andtherefore thei wer able to make the profe thei did: so that me thinkes,that a power ought to be armed as thei, mindyng to make the verie sameprofe.FABRICIO. If you should remember, how I tolde you the Romaines werearmed, you would not thynke so: for as moche as a manne, that hath thehedde covered with Iron, the breaste defended of a Corselet, and of aTargaet, the armes and the legges armed, is moche more apt to defendehymself from the Pike, and to enter emong them, then a man of armes onfoote. I wil give you a little of a late ensample. There wer come out ofCicelie, into the kyngdome of Naples, a power of Spaniardes, for to goto finde Consalvo, who was besieged in Barlet, of the Frenchemen: theremade against theim Mounsier de Vhigni, with his menne of armes, and withaboute fower thousande Duchemen on foote: The Duchemen incountered withtheir Pikes lowe, and thei opened the power of the Spaniardes: but thosebeyng holp, by meane of their bucklers and of the agiletie of theirbodies, mingled togethers with the Duchemen, so that thei might rechethem with the swearde, whereby happened the death, almoste of all theim,and the victorie to the Spaniardes. Every man knoweth, how many Duchemenwere slaine in the battaile of Ravenna, the whiche happened by the veriesame occasion: for that the Spanishe souldiours, got them within aswerdes length of the Duche souldiours, and thei had destroied them all,if of the Frenche horsemen, the Duchemen on foote, had not beensuccored: notwithstandyng, the Spaniardes close together, broughtthemselves into a safe place. I conclude therefore, that a good powerought not onely to be able, to withstande the horses, but also not tohave fear of menne on foote, the which (as I have many tymes saied)procedeth of the armours, and of the order.[Sidenote: How to arme men, and what weapons to appoincte theim, afterthe Romaine maner, and Duche facion.]COSIMO. Tell therefore, how you would arme them?FABRICIO. I would take of the Romaine armours, and of the Duchemennesweapons, and I would that the one haulfe, should bee appoincted like theRomaines, and the other haulfe like the Duchemen: for that if in sixethousande footemen (as I shall tell you a little hereafter) I shouldhave thre thousande men with Targaettes, after the Romain maner, and twothousande Pikes, and a thousand Harkebutters, after the Duche facion,thei should sufice me: for that I would place the Pikes, either in thefronte of the battaile, or where I should feare moste the horses, andthose with the Targaetes and sweardes, shall serve me to make a backe tothe Pikes, and to winne the battaile, as I shall shewe you: so that Ibeleeve, that a power thus ordayned, should overcome at this daye, anyother power.COSIMO. This which hath beene saide, sufficeth concerning footemen, butconcerning horsemen, wee desire to understand which you thinke morestronger armed, either ours, or the antiquitie.[Sidenote: The victorie of Lucullo, against Tiarane king of Armenia; Forwhat pupose horsemen be most requisite.]FABRICIO. I beleeve that in these daies, having respect to the Saddellesbolstered, and to the stiroppes not used of the antiquitie, they standemore stronglye on horsebacke, then in the olde time: I thinke also theyarme them more sure: so that at this daye, a bande of men of armes,paysing very muche, commeth to be with more difficultie withstoode, thenwere the horsemen of old time: notwithstanding for all this, I judge,that there ought not to be made more accompt of horses, then in oldetime was made, for that (as afore is sayde) manye times in our dayes,they have with the footemen receyved shame and shall receyve alwayes,where they incounter, with a power of footemen armed, and ordered, asabove hath bene declared. Tigrane king of Armenia, had againste thearmie of the Romanes, wherof was Capitayne Lucullo, CL. thousandehorsemen, amongest the whiche, were many armed, like unto our men ofarmes, which they called Catafratti, and of the other parte, the Romaneswere about sixe thousande, with xxv. thousand footemen: so that Tigraneseeing the armie of the enemies, saide: these be horses enough for animbassage: notwithstanding, incountering together, he was overthrowen:and he that writeth of the same fighte, disprayseth those Catafratti,declaring them to be unprofitable; for that hee sayeth, because they hadtheir faces covered, they had muche a doe to see, and to offende theenemie, and they falling, being laden with armour coulde not rise upagain, nor welde themselves in any maner to prevaile. I say therefore,that those people or kingdomes, whiche shall esteeme more the power ofhorses, then the power of footemen be alwaies weake, and subjecte to allruine, as by Italie hath been seene in our time, the whiche hath beenetaken, ruinated, and over run with straungers, through not other fault,then for having taken litle care, of the service on foote, and beingbrought the souldiours therof, all on horsebacke. Yet there ought to beehad horses, but for seconde, and not for firste foundaion of an armie:for that to make a discovery, to over run and to destroy the enemiescountrie, and to keepe troubled and disquieted, the armie of the same,and in their armours alwayes, to let them of their victuals, they arenecessary, and most profitable: but concerning for the daye of battaile,and for the fighte in the fielde, whiche is the importaunce of thewarre, and the ende, for which the armies are ordeined, they are moremeeter to follow the enemie being discomfited then to do any other thingwhich in the same is to be done, and they bee in comparison, to thefootemen much inferiour.COSIMO. There is happened unto mee twoo doubtes, the one, where I knowe,that the Parthians dyd not use in the warre, other then horses, and yetthey devided the worlde with the Romanes: the other is, that I wouldethat you should shewe, howe the horsemen can be withstoode of footemen,and wherof groweth the strength of these, and the debilitie of those?[Sidenote: The reason why footmen are able to overcome horsemen; Howfootmen maie save them selves from horsemen; The exercise of Souldiours,ought to be devided into thre partes; What exercises the auncient commonweales used to exercise their youth in, and what commoditie insuedthereby; How the antiquitie, learned their yong soldiours, to handelltheir weapons; What thantiquitie estemed moste happie in a common weale;Mouster Maisters; for thexercisyng of yong men unexperte.]FABRICIO. Either I have tolde you, or I minded to tell you, howe that myreasoning of the affaires of warre, ought not to passe the boundes ofEurope: when thus it is, I am not bounde unto you, to make accompte ofthe same, which is used in Asia, yet I muste saye unto you thus, thatthe warring of the Parthians, was altogether contrarye, to the same ofthe Romanes: for as muche as the Parthians, warred all on horsebacke,and in the fight, they proceeded confusedlye, and scattered, and it wasa maner of fighte unstable, and full of uncertaintie. The Romanes were(it maye be sayde) almoste al on foote, and thei fought close togetherand sure, and thei overcame diversly, the one the other, according tothe largenesse, or straightnesse of the situation: for that in this theRomaines were superiours, in thesame the Parthians, whom might makegreate proofe, with thesame maner of warryng, consideryng the region,which thei had to defende, the which was moste large: for as moche as ithath the sea coaste, distant a thousande miles, the rivers thone fromthother, twoo or three daies journey, the tounes in like maner and theinhabitauntes few: so that a Romaine armie heavie and slowe, by meanesof their armoures, and their orders, could not over run it, withouttheir grevous hurt (those that defended it, being on horsebacke moosteexpedite) so that thei were to daie in one place, and to morowe distauntfiftie miles. Hereof it grewe, that the Parthians might prevaile withtheir chivalrie onely, bothe to the ruine of the armie of Crassus, andto the perill of thesame, of Marcus Antonius: but I (as I have told you)doe not intende in this my reasonyng, to speake of the warfare out ofEurope, therfore I will stand upon thesame, whiche in times past, theRomaines ordained, and the Grekes, and as the Duchemen doe now adaies.But let us se to the other question of yours, where you desire tounderstande, what order, or what naturall vertue makes, that thefootemen overcome the horsmen. And I saie unto you first that the horsescannot go, as the footmen in every place: Thei are slower then thefootemen to obeie, when it is requisite to alter the order: for asmoche, as if it be nedefull, either goyng forward, to turne backwarde,or tournyng backwarde, to go forwarde, or to move themselves standingstil, or goyng to stand still, without doubt, the horsemen cannot dooeit so redilie as the footemen: the horsemen cannot, being of someviolence, disordained, returne in their orders, but with difficultie,although thesame violence cease, the whiche the footemen dooe mosteeasely and quickly. Besides this, it happeneth many tymes, that a hardiemanne shall be upon a vile horse, and a coward upon a good, whereby itfoloweth, that this evill matchyng of stomackes, makes disorder. Nor noman doeth marvell, that a bande of footemenne, susteineth all violenceof horse for that a horse is a beaste, that hath sence, and knoweth theperilles, and with an ill will, will enter in them: and if you consider,what force maketh theim go forwarde, and what holdeth them backwarde,you shall se without doubt thesame to be greater, whiche kepeth thembacke, then that whiche maketh them go forwardes: For that the spurremaketh theim go forwarde, and of the other side, either the swearde, orthe Pike, kepeth theim backe: so that it hath been seen by the olde, andby the late experience, a bande of footemen to bee moste safe, ye,invinsible for horses. And if you should argue to this, that the heate,with whiche thei come, maketh theim more furious to incounter who thatwould withstande them, and lesse to regard the Pike, then the spurre: Isaie, that if the horse so disposed, begin to see, that he must run uponthe poincte of the Pike, either of himself, he wil refrain the course sothat so sone as he shall feele himself pricked, he will stande stillatones, or beeyng come to theim, he will tourne on the right, or on thelefte hande. Whereof if you wil make experience, prove to run a horseagainst a walle: you shall finde fewe, with what so ever furie he comewithall, will strike against it. Cesar havyng in Fraunce, to faightewith the Suizzers, a lighted, and made every manne a light on foote, andto avoide from the araies, the horses, as a thyng more meete to flie,then to faight. But notwithstandyng these naturall impedimentes, whichehorses have, thesame Capitaine, whiche leadeth the footemen, ought tochuse waies, whiche have for horse, the moste impedimentes that maiebee, and seldome tymes it happeneth, but that a manne maie save hymself,by the qualitie of the countrie: for that if thou marche on the hilles,the situacion doeth save thee from thesame furie, whereof you doubt,that thei go withail in the plain, fewe plaines be, whiche through thetillage or by meanes of the woddes, doe not assure thee: for that everyhillocke, every bancke, although it be but small, taketh awaie thesameheate, and every culture where bee Vines, and other trees, lettes thehorses: and if thou come to battaile, the very same lettes happeneth,that chaunceth in marchyng: for as moche as every little impedemente,that the horse hath, abateth his furie. One thyng notwithstandyng, Iwill not forgette to tell you, how the Romaines estemed so moche theirorders, and trusted so moche to their weapons, that if thei shuld havehad, to chuse either so rough a place to save theim selves from horses,where thei should not have been able, to raunge their orders, or a placewhere thei should have nede, to feare more of horses, but ben able todeffende their battaile, alwaies thei toke this, and left that: butbicause it is tyme, to passe to the armie, having armed thesesouldiours, accordyng to the aunciente and newe use, let us see whatexercises the Romaines caused theim make, before the menne were broughtto the battaile. Although thei be well chosen, and better armed, theiought with moste greate studie be exercised, for that without thisexercise, there was never any souldiour good: these exercises ought tobe devided into three partes, the one, for to harden the bodie, and tomake it apte to take paines, and to bee more swifter and more readier,the other, to teach them, how to handell their weapons, the third, forto learne them to kepe the orders in the armie, as well in marchyng, asin faightyng, and in the incampyng: The whiche be three principallactes, that an armie doeth: for asmoche, as if an armie marche, incampe,and faight with order, and expertly, the Capitaine leseth not hishonoure, although the battaile should have no good ende. Therfore, allthauncient common weales, provided these exercises in maner, by custome,and by lawe, that there should not be left behinde any part thereof.Thei exercised then their youth, for to make them swift, in runnyng, tomake theim readie, in leapyng, for to make them strong, in throwyng thebarre, or in wrestlyng: and these three qualities, be as it werenecessarie in souldiours. For that swiftnesse, maketh theim apte topossesse places, before the enemie, and to come to them unloked for, andat unwares to pursue them, when thei are discomfaicted: the readinesse,maketh theim apte to avoide a blowe, to leape over a diche, to winne abanke: strength, maketh them the better able to beare their armours, toincounter the enemie, to withstande a violence. And above all, to makethe bodie the more apte to take paines, thei used to beare greateburthens, the whiche custome is necessarie: for that in difficulteexpedicions it is requisite many tymes, that the souldiour beside hisarmours, beare vitualles for many daies, and if he were not accustomedto this labour, he could not dooe it: and without this, there canneither bee avoided a perill, nor a victorie gotten with fame.Concernyng to learne how to handell the weapons, thei exercised theim,in this maner: thei would have the yong menne, to put on armour, whicheshould waie twise as moche, as their field armour, and in stede of aswearde, thei gave them a cudgell leaded, whiche in comparison of averie swearde in deede, was moste heavie; thei made for every one ofthem, a poste to be set up in the ground, which should be in height twooyardes and a quarter, and in soche maner, and so strong, that the blowesshould not slur nor hurle it doune, against the whiche poste, the yongman with a targaet, and with the cudgell, as against an enemie didexercise, and some whiles he stroke, as though he would hurte the hedde,or the face, somewhile he retired backe, an other while he madeforewarde: and thei had in this exercise, this advertisment, to maketheim apt to cover theim selves, and to hurte the enemie: and havyng thecounterfaight armours moste heavy, their ordinarie armours semed afterunto them more lighter. The Romanies, would that their souldiours shouldhurte with the pricke, and not with the cutte, as well bicause thepricke is more mortalle, and hath lesse defence, as also to thententthat he that should hurt, might lye the lesse open, and be more apt toredouble it, then with cuttes. Dooe not marvaile that these auncientmen, should thinke on these small thynges, for that where theincounteryng of men is reasoned of, you shall perceive, that everylittle vauntage, is of greate importaunce: and I remember you the same,whiche the writers of this declare, rather then I to teache you. Theantiquitie estemed nothing move happie, in a common weale, then to be inthesame, many men exercised in armes: bicause not the shining ofprecious stones and of golde, maketh that the enemies submit themselvesunto thee, but onely the fear of the weapons: afterwarde the errourswhiche are made in other thynges, maie sometymes be corrected, but thosewhiche are dooen in the warre, the paine straight waie commyng on,cannot be amended. Besides that, the knowlege to faight, maketh men morebold, bicause no man feareth to doe that thing, which he thinketh tohave learned to dooe. The antiquitie would therefore, that theirCitezeins should exercise themselves, in all marcial feates, and theimade them to throwe against thesame poste, dartes moche hevier then theordinarie: the whiche exercise, besides the makyng men expert inthrowyng, maketh also the arme more nimble, and moche stronger. Theitaught them also to shote in the long bowe, to whorle with the sling:and to all these thynges, thei appoincted maisters, in soche maner, thatafter when thei were chosen for to go to the warre, thei were now withmynde and disposicion, souldiours. Nor there remained them to learnother, then to go in the orders, and to maintain them selves in those,either marchyng, or faightyng: The whiche moste easely thei learned,mingeling themselves with those, whiche had long tyme served, wherebythei knewe how to stande in the orders.COSIMO. What exercises would you cause theim to make at this present?[Sidenote: The exercises that souldiers ought to make in these daies;The exercise of swimmyng; Tiber, is a river runnyng through Rome thewater wher of will never corrupte; Thexercise of vautyng, and thecommoditie thereof; An order that is taken in certain countries,concerning exercises of warre; What knowledge a Souldiour ought to have;A Cohorte is a bande of men; Of what nomer and of what kind of armoursand weapons, a maine battaile ought to bee, and the distributing andappoinetyng of thesame; veliti are light armed men; Thecapitaines thatar appointed to every band of men; Twoo orders observed in an armie; Howa captain muste instructe muste instructe his souldiours how thei oughtto governe themselves in the battaile.]FABRICIO. A good many of those, whiche have been declared, as runnyng,and wrestlyng, makyng theim to leape, makyng theim to labour in armours,moche heavier then the ordinarie, making them shoote with Crosse bowes,and longe bowes, whereunto I would joyne the harkabus, a newe instrument(as you know) verie necessarie, and to these exercises I would use, althe youth of my state, but with greater industrie, and moresollicitatenesse thesame parte, whiche I should have alreadie appoinctedto serve, and alwaies in the idell daies, thei should bee exercised. Iwould also that thei should learne to swimme, the whiche is a thyngverie profitable: for that there be not alwaies bridges over rivers,boates be not alwaies readie: so that thy army not knowyng howe toswime, remaineth deprived of many commodities: and many occasions towoorke well, is taken awaie. The Romaines for none other cause hadordained, that the yong men should exercise them selves in CampusMartius, then onely, for that havyng Tiber at hande, thei might, beyngweried with the exercise on lande, refreshe theim selves in the water,and partly in swimmyng, to exercise them selves. I would make also, asthe antiquitie, those whiche should serve on horsebacke to exercise, thewhiche is moste necessarie, for that besides to know how to ride, theimuste knowe how on horsebacke thei maie prevaile of them selves. And forthis thei had ordeined horses of wood, upon the which thei practised, toleape by armed, and unarmed, without any helpe, and on every hande: thewhiche made, that atones, and at a beck of a capitain, the horsmen wereon foote, and likewise at a token, thei mounted on horsebacke. And socheexercises, bothe on foote and on horsebacke, as thei were then easie tobee doen, so now thei should not be difficult to thesame common weale,or to thesame prince, whiche would cause them to be put in practise oftheir yong men. As by experience is seen, in certaine citees of theWeste countrie, where is kepte a live like maners with this order. Theidevide all their inhabiters into divers partes: and every parte theiname of the kinde of those weapons, that thei use in the warre. And forthat thei use Pikes, Halbardes, Bowes, and Harkebuses, thei call themPike menne, Halberders, Harkebutters, and Archars: Therefore, it is metefor all the inhabiters to declare, in what orders thei will beappoincted in. And for that all men, either for age, or for otherimpedimentes, be not fitte for the warre, every order maketh a choise ofmen, and thei call them the sworen, whom in idell daies, be bounde toexercise themselves in those weapons, wherof thei be named: and everymanne hath his place appoincted hym of the cominaltie, where socheexercise ought to be made: and those whiche be of thesame order, but notof the sworen, are contributaries with their money, to thesame expenses,whiche in soche exercises be necessarie: therfore thesame that thei doe,we maie doe. But our smal prudence dooeth not suffre us, to take anygood waie. Of these exercises there grewe, that the antiquitie had goodsouldiours, and that now those of the Weste, bee better men then ours:for as moche as the antiquitie exercised them, either at home (as thosecommon weales doe) or in the armies, as those Emperours did, forthoccasions aforesaied: but we, at home will not exercise theim, inCampe we cannot, bicause thei are not our subjectes, and for that we arenot able to binde them to other exercises then thei them selves liste todoe: the whiche occacion hath made, that firste the armies beeneclected, and after, the orders, and that the kyngdomes, and the commonweales, in especially Italians, live in soche debilitie. But let ustourne to our order, and folowyng this matter of exercises, I saie, howit suffiseth not to make good armies, for havyng hardened the men, madethem strong, swift, and handsome, it is nedefull also, that thei learneto stande in the orders, to obeie to signes, to soundes, and to thevoice of the capitain: to knowe, standyng, to retire them selves, goyngforwardes, bothe faightyng, and marchyng to maintain those: bicausewithout this knowlege, withal serious diligence observed, and practised,there was never armie good: and without doubt, the fierce and disorderedmenne, bee moche more weaker, then the fearfull that are ordered, forthat thorder driveth awaie from men feare, the disorder abatethfiercenesse. And to the entente you maie the better perceive that,whiche here folowyng shalbe declared, you have to understande, how everynation, in the orderyng of their men to the warre, have made in theirhoste, or in their armie, a principall member, the whiche though theihave varied with the name, thei have little varied with the nomber ofthe menne: for that thei all have made it, betwene sixe and viii. M.men. This nomber of men was called of the Romaines, a Legion, of Grekesa Fallange, of Frenchemen Caterva: this verie same in our tyme of theSuizzers, whom onely of the auncient warfare, kepe some shadowe, iscalled in their tongue that, whiche in ours signifieththe mainebattaile. True it is, that every one of them, hath after devided it,accordyng to their purposes. Therefore me thinkes beste, that weegrounde our talke, upon this name moste knowen, and after, according tothe aunciente, and to the orders now adaies, the beste that is possibleto ordaine it; and bicause the Romaines devided their Legion, whiche wasmade betwene five and sixe thousande men, in ten Cohortes, I will thatwee devide our main battaile, into ten battailes, and that we make it ofsixe thousande menne on foote, and we will give to every battaile,CCCCL. men, of whiche shall be, CCCC. armed with heavie armour, and L.with light armour: the heavie armed, shall be CCC. Targettes withsweardes, and shalbe called Target men: and C. with Pikes, whiche shalbecalled ordinarie Pikes: the light armed shalbe, L. men armed withHarkabuses, Crosse bowes, and Partisans, and smal Targaettes, and theseby an aunciente name, were called ordinarie Veliti: all of the tenbattailes therefore, comes to have three thousande Targaet men, athousande ordinarie Pikes, CCCC. ordinarie Veliti, all whiche make thenomber of fower thousande and five hundred men. And we saied, that wewould make the maine battaile of six thousande; therefore there must beadded an other thousande, five hundred men, of whiche I will appoinet athousande with Pikes, whom I will call extraordinarie Veliti, and thusmy menne should come (as a little before I have saied) to bee made halfeof Targaetes, and halfe of Pikes and other weapons. I would appoinete toeverie battaile, or bande of men, a Conestable, fower Centurions andfouretic peticapitaines, and moreover a hedde to the ordinarie Veliti.with five peticapitaines; I would give to the thousande extraordinariePikes, three Conestabelles, ten Centurions, and a hundredpeticapitaines; to the extraodrinarie Veliti, two Conestabelles, v.Centurions, and l. peticapitaines: I would then apoinet a generall hed,over all the main battaile: I would that every Conestable should have anAnsigne, and a Drum. Thus there should be made a manne battaile of tenbattailes, of three thousande Targaet men, of a thousande ordinariePikes, of a thousande extraordinarie of five hundred ordinarie Veliti,of five hundred extraordinarie, so there should come to bee sixethousande men, emongeste the whiche there should bee M.D.peticapitaines, and moreover, xv. Conestables, with xv. Drummes, and xv.Ansignes, lv. Centurions, x. heddes of the ordinarie Veliti, and aCapitaine over all the maine battaile with his Asigne and Drume, and Ihave of purpose repeated this order the oftener, to the intent, thatafter when I shall shewe you, the maners of orderyng the battailes, andtharmies, you should not be confounded: I saie therefore, how that, thatking, or that common weale, whiche intendeth to ordeine their subjectesto armes, ought to appoincte theim with these armoures and weapons, andwith these partes, and to make in their countrie so many mainebattailes, as it were able: and when thei should have ordained them,according to the forsaid distribucion, minding to exercise them in theorders, it should suffice to exercise every battaile by it self: andalthough the nomber of the men, of every one of them, cannot by it self,make the facion of a juste armie, notwithstandyng, every man maie learneto dooe thesame, whiche particularly appertaineth unto hym: for that inthe armies, twoo orders is observed, the one, thesame that the men oughtto doe in every battaile, and the other that, whiche the battaile oughtto doe after, when it is with the other in an armie. And those men,whiche doe wel the first, mooste easely maie observe the seconde: Butwithout knowyng thesame, thei can never come to the knowlege of theseconde. Then (as I have saied) every one of these battailes, maie bythem selves, learne to kepe the orders of the araies, in every qualitieof movyng, and of place, and after learne to put them selves togethers,to understande the soundes, by meanes wherof in the faight thei arecommaunded, to learne to know by that, as the Gallics by the whissell,what ought to be doen, either to stande still, or to tourne forward, orto tourne backwarde or whiche waie to tourne the weapons, and the face:so that knowyng how to kepe well the araie, after soche sorte, thatneither place nor movyng maie disorder them, understandyng well thecommaundementes of their heddes, by meanes of the sounde, and knowyngquickly, how to retourne into their place, these battailes maie aftereasly (as I have said) beyng brought many together, learne to do that,whiche all the body together, with the other battailes in a juste armie,is bounde to dooe. And bicause soche universall practise, is also not tobee estemed a little, ones or twise a yere, when there is peace, all themain battaile maie be brought together, to give it the facion of anwhole armie, some daies exercisyng theim, as though thei should faight afielde, settyng the fronte, and the sides with their succours in theirplaces. And bicause a capitaine ordeineth his hoste to the fielde,either for coumpte of the enemie he seeth, or for that, of whichewithout seyng he doubteth, he ought to exercise his armie in the onemaner, and in the other, and to instructe theim in soche sorte, thatthei maie knowe how to marche, and to faight, when nede should require,the wyng to his souldiours, how thei should governe theim selves, whenthei should happen to be assaulted of this, or of that side: and wherehe ought to instructe theim how to faight againste the enemie, whom theishould see: he must shewe them also, how the faight is begun, and wherethei ought to retire: being overthrowen, who hath to succeade in theirplaces, to what signes, to what soundes, to what voices, thei ought toobeie, and to practise them in soche wise in the battaile, and withfained assaultes, that thei may desire the verie thyng in deede. Forthat an armie is not made coragious, bicause in thesame be hardie menne,but by reason the orders thereof bee well appoineted: For as moche as ifI be one of the first faighters, and do knowe, beyng overcome, where Imaie retire, and who hath to succeade in my place, I shall alwaiesfaight with boldnes, seing my succour at hand. If I shall be one of theseconde faighters, the first being driven backe, and overthrowen, Ishall not bee afraied, for that I shall have presuposed that I maie bee,and I shall have desire to be thesame, whiche maie give the victory tomy maister, and not to bee any of the other. These exercises bee mostenecessarie, where an armie is made of newe, and where the old armie is,thei bee also necessarie: for that it is also seen, how the Romainesknew from their infancie, thorder of their armies, notwithstandyng,those capitaines before thei should come to thenemie, continually didexercise them in those. And Josephus in his historie saieth, that thecontinuall exercises of the Romaine armies, made that all thesamemultitude, whiche folowe the campe for gain, was in the daie of battaileprofitable: bicause thei all knewe, how to stande in the orders, and tofaight kepyng the same: but in the armies of newe men, whether thou haveputte theim together, to faight straight waie, or that thou make a powerto faight, when neede requires, without these exercises, as well of thebattailes severally by themselves, as of all the armie, is made nothing:wherefore the orders beying necessarie, it is conveniente with doubleindustrie and laboure, to shewe them unto soche as knoweth them not, andfor to teache it, many excellent capitaines have travailed, without anyrespecte.COSIMO. My thinkes that this reasoning, hath sumwhat transported you:for asmoche, as havyng not yet declared the waies, with the whiche thebattailes bee exercised, you have reasoned of the whole armie, and ofthe daie of battaile.[Sidenote: The chief importance in the exercisyng of bandes of men;Three principall for thorderyng of menne into battaile raie; The mannerhow to bryng a bande of men into battaile raie after a square facion;The better waie for the ordring of a band of men in battaile raie, afterthe first facion; How to exercise men, and to take soche order, wherebya band of men that were by whatsoever chance disordred maye straightewai be brought into order againe; What advertisement ought to bee usedin tourning about a whole bande of menne, after soche sorte, as thoughit were but one bodie; How to order a band of menne after soche sortthat thei maie make their front againste thenemie of whiche flanke theilist; How a band of man oughte to be ordered, when in marchyng theishould bee constrained to faighton their backes.]FABRICIO. You saie truth, but surely thoccasion hath been the affection,whiche I beare to these orders, and the grief that I feele, seyng theibe not put in use: notwithstanding, doubt not but that I will tourne tothe purpose: as I have saied, the chief importaunce that is inthexercise of the battailes, is to knowe how to kepe well the armies:and bicause I tolde you that one of these battailes, ought to bee madeof fower hundred men heavie armed, I wil staie my self upon this nomber.Thei ought then to be brought into lxxx. rankes, and five to a ranke:afterward goyng fast, or softly, to knit them together, and to losethem: the whiche how it is dooen, maie bee shewed better with deedes,then with wordes. Which nedeth not gretly to be taught, for that everymanne, whom is practised in servise of warre, knoweth how this orderprocedeth, whiche is good for no other, then to use the souldiours tokeepe the raie: but let us come to putte together one of thesebattailes, I saie, that there is given them three facions principally,the firste, and the moste profitablest is, to make al massive, and togive it the facion of two squares, the second is, to make it square withthe front horned, the thirde is, to make it with a voide space in themiddest: the maner to put men together in the first facion, maie be oftwoo sortes, tho together in the first facion, maie be of twoo sortes,thone is to double the rankes, that is, to make the seconde ranke enterinto the first, the iiii. into the third, the sixt into the fift, and sofoorth, so that where there was lxxx. rankes, five to a ranke, thei maiebecome xl. rankes, x. to a ranke. Afterward cause theim to double onesmore in thesame maner, settyng the one ranke into an other, and so thereshall remain twentie rankes, twentie men to a ranke: this maketh twoosquares aboute, for as moche as albeit that there bee as many men theone waie, as in the other, notwithstandyng to wardes the hedde, theijoine together, that the one side toucheth the other: but by the otherwaie, thei be distant the one from the other, at least a yarde and ahaulfe, after soche sorte, that the square is moche longer, from thebacke to the fronte, then from the one side to thother: and bicause wehave at this presente, to speake often of the partes afore, of behinde,and of the sides of these battailes, and of all the armie together,knowe you, that when I saie either hedde or fronte, I meane the parteafore, when I shall saie backe, the part behind, when I shall saieflankes, the partes on the sides. The fiftie ordinarie veliti of thebattaile, muste not mingle with the other rankes, but so sone as thebattaile is facioned, thei shalbe set a long by the flankes therof. Theother waie to set together the battaile is this, and bicause it isbetter then the firste, I will set it before your ives juste, how itought to bee ordeined. I beleve that you remember of what nomber ofmenne, of what heddes it is made, and of what armours thei are armed,then the facion, that this battaile ought to have, is (as I have saied)of twentie rankes, twentie men to a ranke, five rankes of Pikes in thefront, and fiftene rankes of Targaettes on the backe, twoo Centurionsstandying in the fronte, twoo behinde on the backe, who shall executethe office of those, whiche the antiquitie called Tergiductori. TheConestable with the Ansigne, and with the Drumme, shall stande inthesame space, that is betwene the five rankes of the Pikes, and thefiftene of the Targeaettes. Of the Peticapitaines, there shall standeone upon every side of the ranckes, so that every one, maie have on hisside his men, those peticapitaines, whiche shalbe on the left hande, tohave their men on the right hand, those Peticapitaines, whiche shall beon the right hand, to have their menne on the left hande: The fiftieVeliti, muste stande a long the flankes, and on the backe of thebattaile. To mynde now, that this battaile maie be set together in thisfacion, the men goyng ordinarily, it is convenient to order them thus.Make the men to be brought into lxxx. rankes, five to a ranke, as alittle afore we have said, leavyng the Veliti either at the hedde, or atthe taile, so that thei stande out of this order: and it ought to beordeined, that every Centurion have behinde his back twentie rankes, andto bee nexte behinde every Centurion, five rankes of Pikes, and thereste Targaettes. The Conestable shall stande with the Drum, and theAnsigne, in thesame space, whiche is betwene the Pikes, and theTargaettes of the seconde Centurion, and to occupie the places of threeTargaette men. Of the Peticapitaines, twentie shall stand on the sidesof the rankes, of the first Centurion, on the lefte hande, and twentieshall stande on the sides of the rankes, of the last Centurion on theright hande. And you muste understande, that the Peticapitaine, whichehath to leade the Pikes, ought to have a Pike, and those that leade theTargaettes, ought to have like weapons. Then the rankes beyng broughtinto this order, and mindyng in marchyng, to bryng them into battaile,for to make the hedde, the first Centurion must be caused to standestill, with the firste twentie rankes, and the seconde to proceademarchyng, and tournyng on the right hand, he must go a long the sides ofthe twentie rankes that stande still, till he come to bee even with theother Centurion, where he must also stande still, and the thirdeCenturion to procede marchyng, likewise tournyng on the right hand, anda long the sides of the rankes that stande still, must go so farre, thathe be even with the other twoo Centurions, and he also standyng still,the other Centurion must folowe with his rankes, likewise tournyng onthe right hande, a longe the sides of the rankes that stande still, sofarre that he come to the hed of the other, and then to stand still, andstraight waie twoo Centurions onely, shall depart from the front, and goto the backe of the battaile, the whiche cometh to bee made in thesamemaner, and with thesame order juste, as a little afore I have shewedyou. The Veliti muste stande a long, by the flankes of thesame,accordyng as is disposed in the first waie, whiche waie is calledredoublyng by right line, this is called redoublyng by flanke: the firstwaie is more easie, this is with better order, and commeth better topasse, and you maie better correcte it, after your owne maner, for thatin redoublyng by righte line, you muste bee ruled by the nomber, bicausefive maketh ten, ten twentie, twentie fourtie, so that with redoublyngby right line, you cannot make a hedde of fiftene, nor of five andtwentie, nor of thirtie, nor of five and thirtie, but you must go wherethesame nomber will leade you. And yet it happeneth every daie inparticulare affaires, that it is convenient to make the forwarde withsixe hundred, or eight hundred men, so that to redouble by right line,should disorder you: therefore this liketh me better: that difficultiethat is, ought moste with practise, and with exercise to bee made easie.Therefore I saie unto you, how it importeth more then any thyng, to havethe souldiours to know how to set themselves in araie quickly, and it isnecessarie to keepe theim in this battaile, to exercise theim therin,and to make them to go apace, either forward or backward, to passethrough difficulte places, without troublyng thorder: for asmoche as thesouldiours, whiche can doe this well, be expert souldiours, and althoughthei have never seen enemies in the face, thei maie be called oldsouldiours, and contrariwise, those whiche cannot keepe these orders,though thei have been in a thousande warres, thei ought alwaies to bereputed new souldiours. This is, concernyng setting them together, whenthei are marching in small rankes: but beyng set, and after beyng brokenby some accident or chaunce, whiche groweth either of the situacion, orof the enemie, to make that in a sodaine, thei maie come into orderagaine, this is the importaunce and the difficultie, and where isnedefull moche exercise, and moche practise, and wherin the antiquitiebestowed moche studie. Therefore it is necessarie to doe twoo thynges,firste to have this battaile full of countersignes, the other, to keepealwaies this order, that those same men maie stand alwaies in the ranke,which thei were firste placed in: as for insample, if one have begon tostande in the seconde, that he stande after alwaie in that, and notonely in that self same rancke, but in that self same place: for theobservyng whereof (as I have saied) bee necessarie many countersignes.In especially it is requisite, that the Ansigne bee after soche sortecountersigned, that companyng with the other battailes, it maie beknowen from theim, accordyng as the Conestable, and the Centurions haveplumes of fethers in their heddes differente, and easie to be knowen,and that whiche importeth moste, is to ordaine that the peticapitainesbee knowen. Whereunto the antiquitie had so moche care, that thei wouldhave nothing els written in their hedde peces, but the nomber that theiwere named by, callyng them firste, seconde, thirde, and fourthe xc. Andyet thei were not contented with this, but made every souldiour to havewritten in his Targaet, the nomber of the ranke, and the nomber of theplace, in whiche ranke he was appoineted. Then the menne beingcountersigned thus, and used to stande betwene these limites, it is aneasie thyng, thei beyng disordered, to sett theim all againe quicklyinto order: considering, that the Ansigne standyng still, theCenturions, and the Peticapitaines maie gesse their places by the iye,and beyng brought the left of the left, the right of the right, withtheir accustomed distance, the souldiours led by their rule, and by thedifferences of the cognisances, maie be quickly in their proper places,no otherwise, then as if the boordes of a tunne should bee taken asunder, whiche beyng first marked, moste easely maie bee set togetheragain, where thesame beyng not countersigned, were impossible to brynginto order any more. These thynges, with diligence and with exercise,are quickely taught, and quickly learned, and beyng learned, withdifficultie are forgotten: for that the newe menne, be led of the olde,and with tyme, a Province with these exercises, may become throughlypractised in the war. It is also necessarie to teache theim, to tournetheim selves all at ones, and when neede requires, to make of theflankes, and of the backe, the fronte, and of the front, flankes, orbacke, whiche is moste easie: bicause it suffiseth that every manne doetourne his bodie, towardes thesame parte that he is commaunded, andwhere thei tourne their faces, there the fronte commeth to bee. True itis, that when thei tourne to any of the flanckes, the orders tourne outof their proporcion: for that from the breast to the backe, there islittle difference, and from the one flancke to the other, there is veriemoche distance, the whiche is al contrarie to the ordinarie order of thebattaile: therefore it is convenient, that practise, and discrecion, doeplace them as thei ought to be: but this is small disorder, for thatmoste easely by themselves, thei maie remedie it. But that whicheimporteth more, and where is requisite more practise, is when a battailewould tourne all at ones, as though it were a whole bodie, here is meeteto have greate practise, and greate discrecion: bicause mindyng totourne, as for insample on the left hande, the left corner must standestill, and those that be next to hym that standeth still, muste marcheso softly, that thei that bee in the right corner, nede not to runne:otherwise all thing should be confounded. But bicause it happenethalwaies, when an armie marcheth from place to place, that the battailes,whiche are not placed in the front, shall be driven to faight not byhedde, but either by flancke, or by backe, so that a battaile muste in asodaine make of flancke, or of backe, hedde: and mindyng that likebattailes in soche cace, maie have their proporcion, as above isdeclared, it is necessarie, that thei have the Pikes on thesame flancke,that ought to be hedde, and the Peticapitaines, Centurions, andConestables, to resorte accordyngly to their places. Therefore to myndeto dooe this, in plasyng them together, you must ordeine the fower skorerankes, of five in a ranke, thus: Set all the Pikes in the first twentierankes, and place the Peticapitaines thereof, five in the first places,and five in the last: the other three score rankes, whiche come after,bee all of Targaettes, whiche come to bee three Centuries. Therefore,the first and the laste ranke of every Centurion, would bePeticapitaines, the Conestable with the Ansigne, and with the Drumme,muste stande in the middest of the first Centurie of Targaettes, and theCenturions in the hed of every Centurie. The bande thus ordained, whenyou would have the Pikes to come on the left flancke, you must redoubleCenturie by Centurie, on the right flancke: if you would have them tocome on the right flancke, you must redouble theim on the lefte. And sothis battaile tourneth with the Pikes upon a flancke, and the Conestablein the middeste: the whiche facion it hath marchyng: but the enemiecommyng, and the tyme that it would make of flancke hedde, it nedeth notbut to make every man to tourne his face, towardes thesame flancke,where the Pikes be, and then the battaile tourneth with the rankes, andwith the heddes in thesame maner, as is aforesaied: for that every manis in his place, excepte the Centurions, and the Centurions straightwaie, and without difficultie, place themselves: But when thei inmarchyng, should bee driven to faight on the backe, it is convenient toordein the rankes after soch sorte, that settyng theim in battaile, thePikes maie come behinde, and to doe this, there is to bee kepte no otherorder, then where in orderyng the battaile, by the ordinarie, everyCenturie hath five rankes of Pikes before, to cause that thei maie havethem behind, and in all the other partes to observe thorder, whiche Ideclared firste.COSIMO. You have tolde (if I dooe well remember me) that this maner ofexercise, is to bee able to bryng these battailes together into anarmie, and that this practise, serveth to be able to order theim selvesin the same: But if it should happen, that these CCCCL. men, should haveto doe an acte seperate, how would you order them?[Sidenote: How a battaile is made with twoo hornes; The orderyng of abattaile with a voide space in the middeste.]FABRICIO. He that leadeth them, ought then to judge, where he will placethe Pikes, and there to put them, the whiche doeth not repugne in anypart to the order above written: for that also, though thesame bee themaner, that is observed to faighte a fielde, together with thotherbattailes, notwithstandyng it is a rule, whiche serveth to all thosewaies, wherein a band of menne should happen to have to doe: but inshewyng you the other twoo waies of me propounded, of ordering thebattailes, I shal also satisfie you more to your question: for thateither thei are never used, or thei are used when a battaile is a lone,and not in companie of other, and to come to the waie of ordering them,with twoo hornes, I saie, that thou oughteste to order the lxxx. rankes,five to a ranke, in this maner. Place in the middest, one Centurion, andafter hym xxv. rankes, whiche muste bee with twoo Pikes on the leftehande, and with three Targaettes on the right, and after the first five,there must be put in the twentie folowyng, twentie Peticapitaines, allbetwene the pikes, and the Targaettes, excepte those whiche beare thePike, whom maie stand with the Pikes: after these xxv. rankes thusordered, there is to be placed an other Centurion, and behinde hymfiftene rankes of Targaettes: after these, the Conestable betwene theDrum and the Ansigne, who also must have after him, other fiftene rankesof Targaettes: after this, the thirde Centurion must be placed, andbehinde hym, xxv. rankes, in every one of whiche, ought to bee threeTargaettes on the lefte flancke, and twoo Pikes on the right, and afterthe five first rankes, there must be xx. Peticapitaines placed betwenethe Pikes, and the Targaettes: after these rankes, the fowerth Centurionmust folowe. Intendying therefore, of these rankes thus ordered, to makea battaile with twoo hornes, the first Centurion must stand still, withthe xxv. rankes, whiche be behinde him, after the second Centurion mustemove, with the fiftene rankes of Targaettes, that bee behinde hym, andto tourne on the right hande, and up by the right flancke of the xxv.rankes, to go so farre, that he arrive to the xv. ranke, and there tostande still: after, the Conestable muste move, with the fiftene rankesof Targaettes, whiche be behinde hym, and tournyng likewise on the righthande, up by the right flancke of the fiftene rankes, that wer firstemoved, muste marche so farre, that he come to their heddes, and there tostand stil: after, the thirde Centurion muste move with the xxv. rankes,and with the fowerth Centurion, whiche was behinde, and turnyng upstraight, must go a long by the right flanck of the fiftene last rankesof the Targaettes, and not to stande still when he is at the heddes ofthem, but to followe marchyng so farre, that the laste ranke of the xxv.maie come to be even with the rankes behinde. And this dooen, theCenturion, whiche was hedde of the firste fiftene rankes of Targaettes,must go awaie from thens where he stoode, and go to the backe in thelefte corner: and thus a battaile shall be made of xxv. rankes, aftertwentie men to a rank, with two hornes, upon every side of the front,one horn, and every one, shall have ten rankes, five to a ranke, andthere shall remain a space betwene the twoo hornes, as moche ascontaineth ten men, whiche tourne their sides, the one to thother.Betwene the two hornes, the capitain shall stande, and on every poinctof a horne, a Centurion: There shall bee also behinde, on every corner,a Centurion: there shal be twoo rankes of Pikes, and xx. Peticapitaineson every flancke. These twoo hornes, serve to kepe betwene theim theartillerie, when this battaile should have any withit, and the cariages:The Veliti muste stande a long the flankes, under the Pikes. But mindyngto bring this horned battaile, with a voide space in the middeste, thereought no other to bee doen, then of fiftene rankes, of twentie to aranke, to take eight rankes, and to place them on the poinctes of thetwoo hornes, whiche then of hornes, become backe of the voide space, inthis place, the cariages are kept, the capitain standeth, and theAnsigne, but never the Artillerie, the whiche is placed either in thefront, or a long the flankes. These be the waies, that a battaile maieuse when it is constrained to passe alone through suspected places:notwithstandyng, the massive battaile without hornes, and without anysoche voide place is better, yet purposyng to assure the disarmed, thesame horned battaile is necessarie. The Suizzers make also many facionsof battailes, emong which, thei make one like unto a crosse: bicause inthe spaces that is betwen the armes therof, thei kepe safe theirHarkebuters from the daunger of the enemies: but bicause soche battailesbe good to faight by theim selves, and my intente is to shew, how manybattailes united, do faight with thenemie, I wil not labour further indescribing them.COSIMO. My thinkes I have verie well comprehended the waie, that oughtto be kept to exercise the men in these battailes: But (if I remember mewell) you have saied, how that besides the tenne battailes, you joyne tothe maine battaile, a thousande extraordinarie Pikes, and five hundredextraordinarie Veliti: will you not appoincte these to be exercised?[Sidenote: To what purpose the Pikes and Velite extraordinarie mustserve.]FABRICIO. I would have theim to bee exercised, and that with moste greatdiligence: and the Pikes I would exercise, at leaste Ansigne afterAnsigne, in the orders of the battailes, as the other: For as moche asthese should doe me more servise, then the ordinarie battailes, in allparticulare affaires: as to make guides, to get booties, and to doe likethynges: but the Veliti, I would exercise at home, without bringing themtogether, for that their office being to faight a sonder, it is notmete, that thei should companie with other, in the common exercises: forthat it shall suffice, to exercise them well in the particularexercises. Thei ought then (as I firste tolde you, nor now me thynkes nolabour to rehearse it againe) to cause their men to exercise them selvesin these battailes, whereby thei maie knowe how to kepe the raie, toknowe their places, to tourne quickly, when either enemie, or situaciontroubleth them: for that, when thei knowe how to do this, the place isafter easely learned, which a battaile hath to kepe, and what is theoffice thereof in the armie: and when a Prince, or a common weale, willtake the paine, and will use their diligence in these orders, and inthese exercisyng, it shall alwaies happen, that in their countrie, thereshall bee good souldiours, and thei to be superiours to theirneighbours, and shalbe those, whiche shall give, and not receive thelawes of other men: but (as I have saied) the disorder wherein theilive, maketh that thei neclecte, and doe not esteme these thynges, andtherefore our armies be not good: and yet though there were either hed,or member naturally vertuous, thei cannot shewe it.COSIMO. What carriages would you, that every one of these battailesshould have?[Sidenote: Neither Centurion nor Peticapitaine, ought not to ride; Whatcarriages the Capitaines ought to have, and the nomber of carragesrequisite to every bande of menne.]FABRICIO. Firste, I would that neither Centurion, nor Peticapitain,should be suffered to ride: and if the Conestable would nedes ride, Iwould that he should have a Mule, and not a horse: I would allowe hymtwoo carriages, and one to every Centurion, and twoo to every threePeticapitaines, for that so many wee lodge in a lodgyng, as in the placetherof we shall tell you: So that every battaile will come to havexxxvi. carriages, the whiche I would should carrie of necessitie thetentes, the vesselles to seeth meate, axes, barres of Iron, sufficientto make the lodgynges, and then if thei can carry any other thyng, theimaie dooe it at their pleasure.COSIMO. I beleve that the heddes of you, ordeined in every one of thesebattailes, be necessarie: albeit, I would doubt, lest that so manycommaunders, should confounde all.[Sidenote: Without many capitaines, an armie cannot be governed; To whatpurpose Ansignes ought to serve; For what purpose Drummes oughte to beeused; The propertie that soundes of instrumentes have in mens myndes.]FABRICIO. That should bee, when it were not referred to one man, butreferryng it, thei cause order, ye and without theim, it is impossibleto governe an armie: for that a wall, whiche on every parte enclineth,requireth rather to have many proppes, and thicke, although not sostrong, then fewe, though thei were strong: bicause the vertue of one alone, doeth not remedie the ruine a farre of. And therefore in tharmies,and emong every ten men, it is convenient that there bee one, of morelife, of more harte, or at leaste wise of more aucthoritie, who withstomacke, with wordes, and with example, maie kepe them constante, anddisposed to faight, and these thynges of me declared, bee necessarie inan armie, as the Heddes, the Ansignes, and the Drummes, is seen that weehave theim all in our armies, but none doeth his office. First to myndethat the Peticapitaines doe thesame, for whiche thei are ordeined, it isnecessarie (as I have said) that there bee a difference, betwene everyone of them and their men, and that thei lodge together, doyng theirduties, standyng in thorder with them: for that thei placed in theirplaces, bee a rule and a temperaunce, to maintaine the raies straightand steddie, and it is impossible that thei disorder, or disorderyng,dooe not reduce themselves quickly into their places. But we now adaies,doe not use them to other purpose, then to give theim more wages, thento other menne, and to cause that thei dooe some particulare feate: Thevery same happeneth of the Ansigne bearers, for that thei are keptrather to make a faire muster, then for any other warlike use: but theantiquitie used theim for guides, and to bryng theim selves againe intoorder: for that every man, so sone as the Ansigne stoode still, knewethe place, that he kept nere to his Ansigne, wherunto he retournedalwaies: thei knewe also, how that the same movyng, or standyng, theishould staie, or move: therfore it is necessarie in an armie, that therebe many bodies, and every bande of menne to have his Ansigne, and hisguide: wherfore havyng this, it is mete that thei have stomackes inough,and by consequence life enough. Then the menne ought to marche,accordyng to the Ansigne: and the Ansigne to move, accordyng to theDrumme, the whiche Drumme well ordered, commaundeth to the armie, thewhiche goyng with paces, that answereth the tyme of thesame, will cometo kepe easilie thorders: for whiche cause the antiquitie had Shalmes,Flutes, and soundes perfectly tymed: For as moche as like as he thatdaunseth, proceadeth with the tyme of the Musick, and goyng with thesamedoeth not erre, even so an armie obeiyng, in movyng it self to thesamesounde, doeth not disorder: and therefore, thei varied the sounde,accordyng as thei would varie the mocion, and accordyng as thei wouldinflame, or quiete, or staie the mindes of men: and like as the soundeswere divers, so diversly thei named them: the sounde Dorico, ingenderedconstancie, the sounde Frigio, furie: whereby thei saie, that Alexanderbeyng at the Table, and one soundyng the sounde Frigio, it kendled somoche his minde, that he laied hande on his weapons. All these manersshould be necessarie to finde again: and when this should beedifficulte, at least there would not be left behind those that teachethe Souldiour to obeie, the whiche every man maie varie, and ordeineafter his owne facion, so that with practise, he accustome the eares ofhis souldiours to knowe it: But now adaies of this sounde, there is noother fruicte taken for the moste part, then to make a rumour.COSIMO. I would desire to understande of you, if ever with your self youhave discourced, whereof groweth so moche vilenesse, and so mochedisorder, and so moche necligence in these daies of this exercise?[Sidenote: A notable discourse of the aucthour, declaryng whereofgroweth so moche vilenes disorder and necligence in these daies,concernyng the exercises of warre.]FABRICIO. With a good will I will tell you thesame, that I thinke. Youknowe how that of the excellente men of warre, there hath been namedmany in Europe, fewe in Affric, and lesse in Asia: this grewe, for thatthese twoo laste partes of the worlde, have had not paste one kyngdome,or twoo, and fewe common weales, but Europe onely, hath had manykyngdomes, and infinite common weales, where menne became excellent, anddid shewe their vertue, accordyng as thei were sette a woorke, andbrought before their Prince, or common weale, or king that he be: itfolloweth therefore, that where be many dominions, there rise manyvaliaunt menne, and where be fewe, fewe. In Asia is founde Ninus, Cirus,Artasercses, Mithridates: and verie fewe other, that to these maie becompared. In Africk, is named (lettyng stande thesame auncient Egipt)Massinissa, Jugurta, and those Capitaines, whiche of the Carthaginenscommon weale were nourished, whom also in respecte to those of Europe,are moste fewe: bicause in Europe, be excellente men without nomber, andso many more should be, if together with those should bee named theother, that be through the malignitie of time extincte: for that theworlde hath been moste vertuous, where hath been moste states, whichehave favoured vertue of necessitie, or for other humaine passion. Thererose therfore in Asia, fewe excellente menne: bicause thesame Province,was all under one kyngdome, in the whiche for the greatnesse thereof,thesame standing for the moste parte of tyme idell, there could notgrowe men in doynges excellent. To Africke there happened the veriesame, yet there were nourished more then in Asia, by reason of theCarthaginens common weale: for that in common weales, there growe moreexcellent men, then in kingdomes, bicause in common weales for the mostpart, vertue is honoured, in Kyngdomes it is helde backe: wherbygroweth, that in thone, vertuous men are nourished, in the other theiare extincte. Therefore he that shall consider the partes of Europe,shall finde it to have been full of common weales, and of princedomes,the whiche for feare, that the one had of the other, thei werconstrained to kepe lively the warlike orders, and to honor them, whichein those moste prevailed: for that in Grece, besides the kyngdome of theMacedonians, there were many common weales, and in every one of theim,were bred moste excellente men. In Italie, were the Romaines, theSannites, the Toscanes, the Gallie Cisalpini. Fraunce, and Almainie, werful of common weales and princedomes. Spaine likewise: and although incomparison of the Romaines, there are named fewe other, it groweththrough the malignitie of the writers, whom folowe fortune, and to theimfor the moste parte it suffised, to honour the conquerours: but itstandeth not with reason, that betwene the Sannites, and the Toscanes,whom fought CL. yeres with the Romaine people, before thei wer overcome,there should not growe exceadyng many excellente menne. And so likewisein Fraunce, and in Spaine: but that vertue, whiche the writers did notcelebrate in particuler menne, thei celebrated generally in the people,where thei exalte to the starres, the obstinatenesse that was in them,to defende their libertie. Beyng then true, that where bee mostedominions, there riseth moste valiaunt menne, it foloweth of necessitie,that extinguishyng those, vertue is extincte straighte waie, theoccasion decaiyng, whiche maketh menne vertuous. Therefore, the RomaineEmpire beyng after increased, and havyng extinguished all the commonweales, and Princedomes of Europe, and of Afrike, and for the moste partthose of Asia, it lefte not any waie to vertue, excepte Rome: wherebygrewe, that vertuous menne began to be as fewe in Europe, as in Asia:the whiche vertue, came after to the laste caste: For as moche, as allthe vertue beyng reduced to Roome, so sone as thesame was corrupted,almoste all the worlde came to bee corrupted: and the Scithian people,were able to come to spoile thesame Empire, the whiche had extinguishedthe vertue of other, and knewe not howe to maintaine their owne: andafter, although through the inundacion of those barberous nacions,thesame Empire was devided into many partes, this vertue is not renued:[Sidenote: The causes why the aunciente orders are neclected.]The one cause is, for that it greveth theim moche, to take againe theorders when thei are marde, the other, bicause the maner of livyng nowadaies, having respect to the Christian religion, commaundeth notthesame necessitie to menne, to defende themselves, whiche in olde tymewas: for that then, the menne overcome in warre, either were killed, orremained perpetuall slaves, where thei led their lives moste miserably:The tounes overcome, either were rased, or the inhabiters thereof drivenout, their goodes taken awaie, sent dispersed through the worlde: sothat the vanquished in warre, suffered all extreme miserie: of thisfeare, men beyng made afraied, thei wer driven to kepe lively thewarlike exercises, and thei honoured soche as were excellente in theim:But nowe adaies, this feare for the moste part is not regarded: of thosethat are overcom, fewe bee killed, none is kepte longe in prison: forthat with facelitie, thei are sette at libertie: the citees also, whichea thousande tymes have rebelled, are not destroied, the men wherof, arelet a lone with their goodes, so that the greateste hurte that isfeared, is but a taske: in so moche, that men will not submit themselves to the orders of warre, and to abide alwaies under those, toavoide the perilles whereof thei are little afraied: again theseProvinces of Europe, be under a verie fewe heddes, in respecte as ithath been in times past: for that al Fraunce, obeieth one kyng, alSpain, an other: Italie is in fewe partes, so that the weake citees, aredefended with leanyng to hym that overcometh, and the strong states, forthe causes aforesaied, feare no soche extreme ruine.COSIMO. Yet ther hath ben seen many tounes that have ben sacked withinthis xxv. yeres, and lost their dominions, whose insample, ought toteache other how to live, and to take again some of those old orders.FABRICIO. You saie true: but if you note what tounes have gone to sacke,you shall not finde that thei have been the heddes of states, but of themembers; as was seen sacked Tortona, and not Milaine: Capua, and notNapelles, Brescia, and not Venice, Ravenna, and not Roome: the whicheinsamples maketh those that governe, not to chaunge their purposes, butrather maketh them to stande more in their opinion, to be able to redemeagain all thynges with taskes, and for this, thei will not submit theimselves to the troubles of thexercises of warre, semyng unto them partlynot necessarie, partly, an intrinsicate matter, whiche thei understandenot: Those other, whiche bee subjectes to them, whom soche insamplesought to make afraied, have no power to remedie it: and those Princes,that have ones loste their estates, are no more able, and those which asyet kept them, know not, nor wil not. Bicause thei will without anydisease rain by fortune, and not by their vertue: for that in the worldebeyng but little vertue, thei see fortune governeth all thynges. Andthei will have it to rule theim, not thei to rule it. And to prove thisthat I have discoursed to bee true, consider Almaine, in the whiche,bicause there is many Princedomes, and common weales, there is mochevertue, and all thesame, whiche in the present service of warre is good,dependeth of the insamples of those people: who beyng all gellious oftheir states, fearing servitude, the which in other places is notfeared, thei all maintaine theim selves Lordes, and honourable: thisthat I have saied, shall suffice to shewe the occacions of the presenteutilitie, accordyng to my opinion: I cannot tell, whether it seemethesame unto you, or whether there be growen in you any doubtyng.COSIMO. None, but rather I understande all verie well: onely I desire,tournyng to our principall matter, to understande of you, how you wouldordein the horses with these battailes, and how many, and how theishould be governed, and how armed.[Sidenote: The armyng of horsemen; The weapons that light horsmenneshould have; The nombre of horsmen requisite for a maine bataille of sixthousand men; The nombre of carrages that men of armes and light horsmenought to have.]FABRICIO. You thinke peraventure, that I have left it behinde: whereatdoe not marvell, for that I purpose for twoo causes, to speake theroflittle, the one is, for that the strengthe, and the importaunce of anarmie, is the footemen, the other is, bicause this part of service ofwarre, is lesse corrupted, then thesame of footemen. For that though itbe not stronger then the old, yet it maie compare with thesame,nevertheles ther hath been spoken a little afore, of the maner ofexercisyng them. And concernyng tharmyng them, I would arme them as theidoe at this present, as wel the light horsemen, as the menne of armes:but the light horsemen, I would that thei should be all Crosseboweshuters, with some Harkebutters emong them: the whiche though in theother affaires of warre, thei bee little profitable, thei be for thismost profitable, to make afraied the countrie menne, and to drive themfrom a passage, that were kept of them: bicause a Harkebutter, shallfeare them more, then twentie other armed. But commyng to the nomber, Isaie, that having taken in hand, to imitate the service of warre of theRomaines, I would not ordein more then three hundred horse, profitablefor every maine battaile, of whiche I would that there were CL. men ofarmes, and CL. light horsmen, and I would give to every one of thesepartes, a hedde, making after emong them fiftene peticapitaines for abande, givyng to every one of them a Trompet, and a standarde: I wouldthat every ten menne of armes, should have five carriages, and every tenlight horsemen twoo, the whiche as those of the footemen, should carriethe tentes, the vesselles, and the axes, and the stakes, and the rest oftheir other harneis. Nor beleve not but that it is disorder, where themenne of armes have to their service fower horse, bicause soche a thyngis a corrupt use: for that the men of armes in Almaine, are seen to beewith their horse alone, every twentie of theim, havyng onely a carte,that carrieth after them their necessary thynges. The Romaine horsemen,were likewise a lone: true it is, that the Triary lodged nere them,whiche wer bound to minister helpe unto theim, in the kepyng of theirhorses the whiche maie easely be imitated of us, as in the distributyngof the lodgynges, I shall shewe you. Thesame then that the Romaines did,and that whiche the Duchmen doe now a daies, we maie doe also, ye, notdoyng it, we erre. These horses ordained and appoincted together with amain battaile, maie sometymes be put together, when the battailes beeassembled, and to cause that betwene theim bee made some sight ofassault, the whiche should be more to make them acquainted together,then for any other necessitie. But now of this part, there hath beenspoke sufficiently, wherefore let us facion the armie, to be able tocome into the field against the enemie, and hope to winne it: whichethyng is the ende, for whiche the exercise of warre is ordeined, and somoche studie therein bestowed.THE THIRDE BOOKECOSIMO.

Then it falleth to you Luigi: and as I have pleasure of soche asuccessour, so you shal satisfie your self of soche a demaunder:therefore I praie you, let us tourne to the matter, and let us lese nomore tyme.[Sidenote: The greateste disorder that is used now a daies in pitchingof a fielde; The order how a Romain Legion was appoincted to faight; Themaner that the Grekes used in their Falangi, when thei fought againsttheir enemies; The order that the Suizzers use in their main battaileswhen thei faight; Howe to appoincte a main battaile with armour andweapons, and to order thesame after the Greke and Romain maner.]FABRICIO. I am certain, that to mynde to shewe wel, how an armie isprepared, to faight a fielde, it should be necessarie to declare, howthe Grekes, and the Romaines ordeined the bandes of their armies:Notwithstandyng, you your selves, beeyng able to rede, and to considerthese tnynges, by meanes of the auncient writers. I will passe over manyparticulars: and I will onely bryng in those thynges, whiche I thinkenecessarie to imitate, mindyng at this tyme, to give to our exercise ofwarre, some parte of perfection: The whiche shall make, that in oneinstant, I shall shewe you, how an armie is prepared to the field, andhow it doeth incounter in the verie faight, and how it maie be exercisedin the fained. The greatest disorder, that thei make, whiche ordeine anarmie to the fielde, is in giving them onely one fronte, and to bindethem to one brunt, and to one fortune: the whiche groweth, of havyngloste the waie, that the antiquitie used to receive one bande within another: bicause without this waie, thei can neither succour the formoste,nor defende them, nor succede in the faight in their steede: the whicheof the Romaines, was moste excellently well observed. Therefore,purposyng to shewe this waie, I saie, how that the Romaines devided intoiii. partes every Legion, in Hastati, Prencipi, and Triarii, of which,the Hastati wer placed in the first front, or forward of the armie, withthorders thicke and sure, behinde whom wer the Prencipi, but placed withtheir orders more thinne: after these, thei set the Triarii, and with somoche thinnes of orders, that thei might, if nede wer, receive betwenethem the Prencipi, and the Hastati. Thei had besides these, theSlingers, and Crosbowshoters, and the other lighte armed, the whichestoode not in these orders, but thei placed them in the bed of tharmie,betwene the horses and the other bandes of footemen: therefore theselight armed, began the faight, if thei overcame (whiche happened seldomtimes) thei folowed the victorie: if thei were repulced, thei retired bythe flanckes of the armie, or by the spaces ordained for soche purposes,and thei brought them selves emong the unarmed: after the departure ofwhom, the Hastati incountered with the enemie, the whiche if thei sawthemselves to be overcome, thei retired by a little and little, by therarenesse of thorders betwene the Prencipi, and together with those,thei renued the faight if these also wer repulced, thei retired al inthe rarenesse of the orders of the Triarii, and al together on a heape,began againe the faight: and then, if thei were overcome, there was nomore remeady, bicause there remained no more waies to renue them again.The horses stoode on the corners of the armie, to the likenes of twoowinges to a bodie, and somewhiles thei fought with the enemies horses,an other while, thei rescued the fotmen, according as nede required.This waie of renuyng theim selves three tymes, is almoste impossible toovercome: for that, fortune muste three tymes forsake thee, and theenemie to have so moche strengthe, that three tymes he maie overcomethee. The Grekes, had not in their Falangi, this maner of renuyng themselves, and although in those wer many heddes, and many orders,notwithstandyng, thei made one bodie, or els one hedde: the maner thatthei kepte in rescuyng the one the other was, not to retire the oneorder within the other, as the Romaines, but to enter the one manne intothe place of the other: the which thei did in this maner. Their Falangebrought into rankes, and admit, that thei put in a ranke fiftie menne,commyng after with their hedde againste the enemie, of all the rankesthe foremoste sixe, mighte faight: Bicause their Launces, the whichethei called Sarisse, were so long, that the sixt ranke, passed with thehedde of their Launces, out of the first ranke: then in faightyng, ifany of the first, either through death, or through woundes fell,straight waie there entered into his place, thesame man, that wasbehinde in the second ranke, and in the place that remained voide of theseconde, thesame man entred, whiche was behind hym in the thirde, andthus successively, in a sodaine the rankes behinde, restored the faultesof those afore, so that the rankes alwaies remained whole, and no placeof the faighters was voide, except the laste rankes, the whiche came toconsume, havyng not menne behinde their backes, whom might restoretheim: So that the hurte that the first rankes suffered, consumed thelaste, and the firste remained alwaies whole: and thus these Falangi bytheir order, might soner be consumed, then broken, for that the grossebodie, made it more immovable. The Romaines used at the beginnyng theFalangi, and did set in order their Legions like unto them: after, thisorder pleased them not, and thei devided the Legions into many bodies,that is, in bandes and companies: Bicause thei judged (as a little aforeI saied) that thesame bodie, should have neede of many capitaines, andthat it should be made of sunderie partes, so that every one by it self,might be governed. The maine battailes of the Suizzers, use at thispresent, all the maners of the Falangi, as well in ordryng it grosse,and whole, as in rescuyng the one the other: and in pitchyng the field,thei set the main battailes, thone to the sides of the other: and thoughthei set them the one behinde the other, thei have no waie, that thefirste retiryng it self, maie bee received of the seconde, but thei usethis order, to the entent to bee able to succour the one thother, wherethei put a maine battaile before, and an other behinde thesame on theright hande: so that if the first have nede of helpe, that then theother maie make forewarde, and succour it: the third main battaile, theiput behind these, but distant from them, a Harkebus shot: this thei doe,for that thesaid two main battailes being repulced, this maie makeforwarde, and have space for theim selves, and for the repulced, andthesame that marcheth forward, to avoide the justling of the one theother: for asmoche as a grosse multitude, cannot bee received as alittle bodie: and therefore, the little bodies beyng destincte, whichewere in a Romaine Legion, might be placed in soche wise, that thei mightreceive betwene theim, and rescue the one the other. And to prove thisorder of the Suizzers not to be so good, as the auncient Romaines, manyinsamples of the Romain Legions doe declare, when thei fought with theGrekes Falangi, where alwaies thei were consumed of theim: for that thekinde of their weapons (as I have said afore) and this waie of renuyngthemselves, could do more, then the massivenesse of the Falangi. Havyngtherefore, with these insamples to ordaine an armie, I have thoughtgood, partly to retaine the maner of armyng and the orders of the GrekesFalangi, and partely of the Romain Legions: and therfore I have saied,that I would have in a main battaile, twoo thousande pikes, whiche bethe weapons of the Macedonicall Falangi, and three thousande Targaetteswith sweardes, whiche be the Romain weapons: I have devided the mainbattaile, into x. battailes, as the Romaines their Legion into tenCohortes: I have ordeined the Veliti, that is the light armed, to beginthe faight, as the Romaines used: and like as the weapons beyng mingled,doe participate of thone and of the other nacion, so the orders also doeparticipate: I have ordained, that every battaile shall have v. rankesof Pikes in the fronte, and the rest of Targaettes, to bee able with thefront, to withstande the horses, and to enter easely into the battaileof the enemies on foot, having in the firste fronte, or vawarde, Pikes,as well as the enemie, the whiche shall suffice me to withstande them,the Targaettes after to overcome theim. And if you note the vertue ofthis order, you shal se al these weapons, to doe fully their office, forthat the Pikes, bee profitable against the horses, and when thei comeagainst the footemenne, thei dooe their office well, before the faightthrong together, bicause so sone as thei presse together, thei becomeunprofitable: wherefore, the Suizzers to avoide this inconvenience, putafter everye three rankes of Pikes, a ranke of Halberdes, the whichethey do to make roome to the Pikes, which is not yet so much assuffiseth. Then putting our Pikes afore, and the Targaettes behinde,they come to withstande the horses, and in the beginning of the fight,they open the rayes, and molest the footemen: But when the fight isthrust together, and that they become unprofitable, the Targaettes andswoords succeede, which may in every narowe place be handled.LUIGI.

And I will not nowe shewe you other, then this: you have tounderstande, how that in an ordinarye Romane armie, which they call aConsull armie, there were no more, then twoo Legions of Romane Citezenswhich were sixe hundred horse, and about aleven thousande footemen: theyhad besides as many more footemen and horsemen, whiche were sente themfrom their friends and confiderates, whome they divided into twoopartes, and called the one, the right horne and the other the lefthorne: nor they never permitted, that these aiding footemen, shouldpasse the nomber of the footemen of their Legions, they were wellcontented, that the nomber of those horse shoulde be more then theirs:with this armie, which was of xxii. thousand footemen, and about twoothousande good horse, a Consul executed all affaires, and went to allenterprises: yet when it was needefull to set against a greater force,twoo Consulles joyned together with twoo armies. You ought also to notein especially, that in all the three principall actes, which an armiedoth that is, to march, to incampe, and to fight, the Romanes used toput their Legions in the middeste, for that they woulde, that the samepower, wherein they most trusted, shoulde bee moste united, as in thereasoning of these three actes, shall be shewed you: those aidingfootemen, through the practise they had with the Legion Souldiours, wereas profitable as they, because they were instructed, according as thesouldiours of the Legions were, and therefore, in like maner in pitchingthe field, they pitched. Then he that knoweth how the Romaines disposeda Legion in their armie, to fight a field, knoweth how they disposedall: therefor, having tolde you how they devided a Legion into threebandes, and how the one bande received the other, I have then told you,how al tharmie in a fielde, was ordained. Wherefore, I minding to ordaina field like unto the Romaines, as they had twoo Legions, I will takeii. main batailes, and these being disposed, the disposicion of all anarmie shalbe understode therby: bycause in joyning more men, there is noother to be doen, then to ingrosse the orders: I thinke I neede not torehearse how many men a maine battaile hath, and howe it hath tenbattailes, and what heades bee in a battaile and what weapons they have,and which be the ordinarie Pikes and Veliti, and which theextraordinarie for that a litle a fore I told you it destinctly, and Iwilled you to kepe it in memorie as a necessarie thing to purpose, tounderstande all the other orders: and therfore I will come to thedemonstracion of the order without repeating it any more: Me thinkesgood, that the ten battailes of one main battaile be set on the leftflanke, and the tenne other, of the other main battaile, on the right:these that are placed on the left flanke, be ordeined in this maner,there is put five battailes the one to the side of the other in thefronte, after suche sorte, that betweene the one and the other, thereremaine a space of three yardes, whiche come to occupie for largenesseCvi. yardes, of ground, and for length thirtie: behinde these fivebattailes, I would put three other distante by right line from thefirste thirtie yardes: twoo of the whiche, should come behinde by rightline, to the uttermoste of the five, and the other should kepe the spacein the middeste, and so these three, shall come to occupie for bredthand length, as moche space, as the five doeth. But where the five havebetwene the one, and the other, a distaunce of three yardes, these shallhave a distance of xxv. yardes. After these, I would place the twoo lastbattailes, in like maner behinde the three by right line, and distauntefrom those three, thirtie yardes, and I would place eche of theim,behinde the uttermoste part of the three, so that the space, whicheshould remain betwen the one and the other, should be lxviii. yardes:then al these battailes thus ordered, will take in bredth Cvi. yardes,and in length CL. Thextraordinarie Pikes, I would deffende a long theflanckes of these battailes, on the left side, distante from themfiftene yardes, makyng Cxliij. rankes, seven to a ranke, after sochesorte, that thei maie impale with their length, all the left sixe of thetenne battailes in thesame wise, declared of me to be ordained: andthere shall remain fourtie rankes to keepe the carriages, and theunarmed, whiche ought to remaine in the taile of the armie, distributyngthe Peticapitaines, and the Centurions, in their places: and of thethree Conestables, I would place one in the hedde, the other in themiddeste, the third in the laste ranke, the whiche should execute theoffice of a Tergiductore, whom the antiquitie so called hym, that wasappoincted to the backe of the armie. But retournyng to the hedde of thearmie, I saie how that I would place nere to the extraordinarie pikes,the Veliti extraordinarie, whiche you knowe to be five hundred, and Iwould give them a space of xxx. yardes: on the side of these likewise onthe left hande, I would place the menne of armes, and I would theishould have a space of a Cxii. yardes: after these, the light horsemen,to whom I would appoinct as moche ground to stande in, as the menne ofarmes have: the ordinarie veliti, I would leave about their ownebattailes, who should stand in those spaces, whiche I appoincte betwenethone battaile and thother: whom should be as their ministers, ifsometyme I thought not good to place them under the extraordinariePikes: in dooyng or not doyng whereof, I would proceade, accordyng asshould tourne best to my purpose. The generall hedde of all the mainebattaile, I would place in thesame space, that were betwene the firstand the seconde order of the battailes, or els in the hedde, and inthesame space, that is betwene the laste battaile of the firste five,and the extraordinarie Pikes, accordyng as beste should serve mypurpose, with thirtie or fourtie chosen men about hym, that knewe byprudence, how to execute a commission, and by force, to withstande aviolence, and thei to be also betwen the Drumme and the Ansigne: this isthorder, with the whiche I would dispose a maine battaile, whiche shouldbee the disposyng of halfe the armie, and it should take in breadththree hundred fourscore and twoo yardes, and in length as moche as aboveis saied, not accomptyng the space, that thesame parte of theextraordinarie Pikes will take, whiche muste make a defence for theunarmed, whiche will bee aboute lxxv. yardes: the other maine battaile,I would dispose on the righte side, after the same maner juste, as Ihave disposed that on the lefte, leavyng betwene the one main battaile,and thother, a space of xxii. yardes: in the hedde of whiche space, Iwould set some little carriages of artillerie, behynde the whiche,should stande the generall capitaine of all the armie, and should haveabout hym with the Trumpet, and with the Capitaine standerde, twoohundred menne at least, chosen to be on foote the moste parte, emongestwhiche there should be tenne or more, mete to execute allcommaundementes, and should bee in soche wise a horsebacke, and armed,that thei mighte bee on horsebacke, and on foote, accordyng as needeshould require. The artillerie of the armie, suffiseth ten Cannons, forthe winning of Townes, whose shotte shoulde not passe fiftie pounde: thewhiche in the fielde should serve mee more for defence of the campe,then for to fight the battaile: The other artillerie, should bee ratherof ten, then of fifteene pounde the shotte: this I would place afore onthe front of all the armie, if sometime the countrie should not standein such wise, that I mighte place it by the flancke in a sure place,where it mighte not of the enemie be in daunger: this fashion of anarmie thus ordered, may in fighting, use the order of the Falangi, andthe order of the Romane Legions: for that in the fronte, bee Pikes, allthe men bee set in the rankes, after such sorte, that incountering withthe enemie, and withstanding him, maye after the use of the Falangi,restore the firste ranckes, with those behinde: on the other parte, ifthey be charged so sore, that they be constrayned to breake the orders,and to retire themselves, they maye enter into the voide places of theseconde battailes, which they have behinde them, and unite their selveswith them, and making a new force, withstande the enemie, and overcomehim: and when this sufficeth not, they may in the verie same maner,retire them selves the seconde time, and the third fight: so that inthis order, concerning to fight, there is to renue them selves, bothaccording to the Greeke maner, and according to the Romane: concerningthe strength of the armie, there cannot be ordayned a more stronger: foras much, as the one and the other borne therof, is exceedingly wellreplenished, both with heades, and weapons, nor there remayneth weake,other then the part behinde of the unarmed, and the same also, hath theflanckes impaled with the extraordinarie Pikes: nor the enemie can notof anye parte assaulte it, where he shall not finde it well appointed,and the hinder parte can not be assaulted: Because there can not bee anenemie, that hath so much puissaunce, whome equallye maye assault theeon everye side: for that hee having so great a power, thou oughtest notthen to matche thy selfe in the fielde with him: but when he were threetimes more then thou, and as well appointed as thou, hee doth weaken himselfe in assaulting thee in divers places, one part that thou breakest,will cause all the reste go to naughte: concerning horses, although hechaunce to have more then thine, thou needest not feare: for that theorders of the Pikes, which impale thee, defende thee from all violenceof them, although thy horses were repulced. The heades besides this, bedisposed in such place, that they may easyly commaunde, and obeye: thespaces that bee between the one battaile, and the other, and betweenethe one order, and the other, not onely serve to be able to receyve theone the other, but also to give place to the messengers, whiche shouldgo and come by order of the Capitayne. And as I tolde you firste, howethe Romanes had for an armie, aboute foure and twentie thousande men,even so this oughte to bee: and as the other souldiours tooke ensampleof the Legions, for the maner of fighting, and the fashion of the armie,so those souldiours, whiche you shoulde joyne to oure twoo maynebattailes, oughte to take the forme and order of them: whereof havingput you an ensample, it is an easye matter to imitate it, for thatincreasing, either twoo other mayne battailes unto the armie, or as manyother souldiours, as they bee, there is no other to bee done, then todouble the orders, and where was put tenne battailes on the lefte parte,to put twentie, either ingrossing, or distending the orders, accordingas the place, or the enemie shoulde compell thee.LUIGI. Surelye sir I imagine in suche wise of this armie, that meethinkes I nowe see it, and I burne with a desire to see it incounter,and I woulde for nothing in the worlde, that you shoulde become FabiusMaximus intendyng to kepe the enemie at a baie, and to deferre the daieof battaile: bicause I would saie worse of you, then the Romain peoplesaied of hym.[Sidenote: The descripcion of a battaile that is a faightyng.]FABRICIO. Doubt not: Doe you not heare the artillerie? Ours have alredieshotte, but little hurte the enemie: and thextraordinarie Veliti,issuyng out of their places together with the light horsemen, mostespeadely, and with moste merveilous furie, and greateste crie that maiebe, thei assaulte the enemie: whose artillerie hath discharged ones, andhath passed over the heddes of our footemen, without doyng them anyhurt, and bicause it cannot shoote the seconde tyme, the Veliti, and ourhorsemen, have nowe gotten it, and the enemies for to defende it, arecome fore warde, so that neither our ordinaunce, nor thenemies, can anymore doe their office. Se with how moche vertue, strengthe and agilitieour men faighteth, and with how moche knowledge through the exercise,whiche hath made them to abide, and by the confidence, that thei have inthe armie, the whiche, see, how with the pace therof, and with the menof armes on the sides, it marcheth in good order, to give the charge onthe adversarie: See our artillerie, whiche to give theim place, and toleave them the space free, is retired by thesame space, from whens theVeliti issued: See how the capitaine incourageth them, sheweth them thevictorie certain: See how the Veliti and light horsemen bee inlarged,and retourned on the flanckes of tharmie, to seke and view, if thei maieby the flanck, doe any injurie to the adversaries: behold how the armiesbe affronted. Se with how moche valiauntnesse thei have withstode theviolence of thenemies, and with how moche silence, and how the capitaincommaundeth the menne of armes, that thei sustain, and not charge, andthat thei breake not from the order of the footemen: see how our lighthorsemen be gone, to give the charge on a band of the enemiesHarkebutters, whiche would have hurt our men by flancke, and how theenemies horse have succoured them, so that tourned betwene the one andthe other horse, thei cannot shoote, but are faine to retire behindetheir owne battaile: see with what furie our Pikes doe also affront, andhow the footemen be now so nere together the one to the other, that thePikes can no more be occupied: so that according to the knowlege learnedof us, our pikes do retire a little and a little betwen the targaettes.Se how in this while a great bande of men of armes of the enemies, havecharged our men of armes on the lefte side, and how ours, accordyng toknowlege, bee retired under the extraordinarie Pikes, and with the helpof those, giving again a freshe charge, have repulced the adversaries,and slain a good part of them: in so moche, that thordinarie pikes ofthe first battailes, be hidden betwene the raies of the Targaettes, theihavyng lefte the faight to the Targaet men: whom you maie see, with howmoche vertue, securitie, and leasure, thei kill the enemie: see you nothow moche by faightyng, the orders be thrust together? That thei canscarse welde their sweardes? Behold with how moche furie the enemiesmove: bicause beyng armed with the pike, and with the swerd unprofitable(the one for beyng to long, the other for findyng thenemie to wellarmed) in part thei fall hurt or dedde, in parte thei flie. See, theiflie on the righte corner, thei flie also on the lefte: behold, thevictorie is ours. Have not we wonne a field moste happely? But with morehappinesse it should bee wonne, if it were graunted me to put it inacte. And see, how there neded not the helpe of the seconde, nor of thethird order, for our first fronte hath sufficed to overcome theim: inthis part, I have no other to saie unto you, then to resolve if anydoubt be growen you.[Sidenote: Questions concerning the shotyng of ordinaunce.]LUIGI. You have with so moche furie wonne this fielde that I so mochemervaile and am so astonied, that I beleve that I am not able toexpresse, if any doubt remain in my mynde: yet trustyng in yourprudence, I will be so bolde to tell thesame that I understande. Tell mefirste, why made you not your ordinaunce to shoote more then ones? Andwhy straighte waie you made them to retire into tharmie, nor after madeno mension of them? Me thought also, that you leveled the artillerie ofthe enemie high, and appoincted it after your own devise: the whichemight very well bee, yet when it should happen, as I beleve it chaunsethoften, that thei strike the rankes, what reamedie have you? And seyngthat I have begun of the artillerie, I will finishe all this question,to the intente I nede not to reason therof any more. I have heard manydispraise the armours, and the orders of the aunciente armies, arguyng,how now a daies, thei can doe little, but rather should bee altogetherunprofitable, havyng respecte to the furie of the artillerie: bicause,this breaketh the orders, and passeth the armours in soche wise, that itsemeth unto them a foolishenesse to make an order, whiche cannot beekepte, and to take pain to beare a harneis, that cannot defende a man.[Sidenote: An aunswere to the questions that were demaunded, concernyngthe shoting of ordinaunce; The best remedie to avoide the hurte that theenemie in the fielde maie doe with his ordinaunce; A policie againstbowes and dartes; Nothyng causeth greater confusion in an armie, than tohinder mennes fightes; Nothing more blindeth the sight of men in anarmie, then the smoke of ordinaunce; A policie to trouble the enemiessight; The shotte of greate ordinaunce in the fielde, is not moche tobee feared of fotemenne; Bicause menne of armes stand closer togetherthen light horsmen, thei ought to remaine behinde the armie till theenemies ordinaunce have done shootyng; The artillerie is no let, why theauncient orders of warfar ought not to be used in these daies.]FABRICIO. This question of yours (bicause it hath many heddes) hathneede of a long aunswere. It is true, that I made not thartillery toshoote more than ones, and also of thesame ones, I stoode in doubte: theoccasion was, for asmoche as it importeth more, for one to take hede notto be striken, then it importeth to strike the enemie. You have tounderstande, that to purpose that a pece of ordinaunce hurte you not, itis necessarie either to stande where it cannot reche you, or to getbehinde a wall, or behinde a banke: other thing there is not that canwitholde it: and it is nedefull also, that the one and the other bemoste strong. Those capitaines whiche come to faight a field, cannotstand behind a wal, or behind bankes, nor where thei maie not bereached: therfore it is mete for them, seyng thei cannot finde a waie todefende them, to finde some mean, by the whiche thei maie be leasthurte: nor thei cannot finde any other waie, then to prevente itquickly: the waie to prevent it, is to go to finde it out of hande, andhastely, not at leasure and in a heape: for that through spede, theblowe is not suffered to bee redoubled, and by the thinnesse, lessenomber of menne maie be hurt. This, a bande of menne ordered, cannotdooe; bicause if thesame marche hastely, it goweth out of order: if itgo scattered, the enemie shall have no paine to breake it, for that itbreaketh by it self: and therfore, I ordered the armie after sochesorte, that it might dooe the one thyng and the other: for as moche ashavyng set in the corners thereof, a thousande Veliti, I appoincted thatafter that our ordinaunce had shotte, thei should issue out togetherwith the light horsemen, to get the enemies artillerie: and therfore, Imade not my ordinance to shoote again, to the intente, to give no tymeto the enemie to shoote: Bicause space could not be given to me, andtaken from other men, and for thesame occasion, where I made myordinaunce not to shoote the seconde tyme, was for that I would not havesuffered the enemie to have shot at al, if I had could: seyng that tomynde that the enemies artillerie be unprofitable, there is no otherremedie, but to assaulte it spedely: for as moche as if the enemiesforsake it, thou takeste it, if thei will defende it, it is requisitethat thei leave it behind, so that being possessed of enemies, and offrendes, it cannot shoote. I would beleve, that with out insamples thesereasons should suffice you, yet beyng able to shewe olde ensamples, toprove my saiynges true, I will. Ventidio commyng to faight a field withthe Parthians, whose strength for the moste part, consisted in bowes andarrowes, he suffered theim almoste to come harde to his campe, before hedrewe out his armie, the whiche onely he did, to be able quickly toprevent them: and not to give them space to shoote. Cesar when he was inFraunce, maketh mencion, that in faighting a battaile with the enemies,he was with so moche furie assaulted of them, that his menne had no timeto whorle their Dartes, accordyng to the custome of the Romaines:wherfore it is seen, that to intende, that a thyng that shooteth farreof, beyng in the field, doe not hurte thee, there is no other remedy,then with as moche celeritie as maie bee, to prevente it. An other causemoved me to procede, without shotyng the ordinaunce, whereatperadventure you will laugh: yet I judge not that it is to bedispraised. Ther is nothyng that causeth greater confusion in an armie,then to hinder mennes fightes: whereby many moste puisaunte armies havebeen broken, by meanes their fighte hath been letted, either with duste,or with the Sunne: yet there is nothyng, that more letteth the sightthen the smoke that the artillerie maketh in shotyng: therfore, I wouldthinke that it wer more wisedome, to suffer the enemie to blindehymself, then to purpose (thou being blind) to go to finde hym: for thiscause, either I would not shote, or (for that this should not be proved,considering the reputacion that the artillerie hath) I would place it onthe corners of the armie, so that shootyng, it should not with the smokethereof, blinde the front of thesame, whiche is the importaunce of mymen. And to prove that it is a profitable thyng, to let the sight of theenemie, there maie be brought for insample Epaminondas, whom to blindthe enemies armie, whiche came to faight with hym, he caused his lighthorsemen, to run before the fronte of the enemies, to raise up theduste, and to lette their sight, whereby he gotte the victorie. Andwhere it semeth unto you, that I have guided the shot of the artillerie,after my owne devise, making it to passe over the heddes of my men, Ianswer you, that most often tymes, and without comparison, the greateordinaunce misse the footemen, moche soner than hitte theim: for thatthe footemen are so lowe, and those so difficult to shoote; that everylittle that thou raisest theim, thei passe over the heddes of men: andif thei be leveled never so little to lowe, thei strike in the yearth,and the blowe cometh not to theim: also the unevenesse of the groundesaveth them, for that every little hillocke, or high place that is,betwene the men and thordinance, letteth the shot therof. And concernynghorsmen, and in especially men of armes, bicause thei ought to standmore close together, then the light horsemen, and for that thei aremoche higher, maie the better be stroken, thei maie, untill theartillerie have shotte, be kepte in the taile of the armie. True it is,that the Harkebutters doe moche more hurt, and the field peces, then thegreate ordinance, for the whiche, the greatest remedy is, to come tohande strokes quickly: and if in the firste assaulte, there be slainesome, alwaies there shall bee slaine: but a good capitaine, and a goodarmie, ought not to make a coumpte of a hurte, that is particulare, butof a generall, and to imitate the Suizzers, whom never eschue to faight,beyng made afraied of the artillerie: but rather punishe with deaththose, whiche for feare thereof, either should go out of the ranke, orshould make with his body any signe of feare. I made them (so sone asthei had shotte) to bee retired into the armie, that thei might leavethe waie free for the battaile: I made no more mencion of theim, as of athyng unprofitable, the faight beyng begun. You have also saied, thatconsideryng the violence of this instrument, many judge the armours, andthe auncient orders to be to no purpose, and it semeth by this yourtalke, that men now a daies, have founde orders and armours, whiche areable to defend them against the artillerie: if you knowe this, I wouldbee glad that you would teache it me: for that hetherto, I never saweany, nor I beleve that there can any be founde: so that I wouldunderstande of soche men, for what cause the souldiours on foote inthese daies, weare the breastplate, or the corselet of steele, and theion horsebacke go all armed: bicause seyng that thei blame the auncientearmyng of men as unprofitable, considryng the artillery, thei ought todespise also this? I would understande moreover, for what occasion theSuizzers, like unto the auncient orders, make a battaile close togetherof sixe, or eight thousande menne, and for what occasion all other haveimitated theim, this order bearyng the verie same perill, concernyng theartillerie, that those other should beare, whiche should imitate theantiquitie. I beleve thei should not knowe what to answere: but if youshould aske soche Souldiours, as had some judgement, thei would aunswerefirst, that thei go armed, for that though thesame armoure defende theimnot from the artillerie: it defendeth them from crossebowes, from Pikes,from sweardes, from stones, and from all other hurt, that commeth fromthe enemies, thei would answere also, that thei went close together,like the Suizzers, to be able more easely to overthrow the footemen, tobe able to withstand better the horse and to give more difficultie tothe enemie to breake them: so that it is seen, that the souldiours haveto fear, many other thynges besides the ordinance: from which thynges,with the armours, and with the orders, thei are defended: whereoffoloweth, that the better that an armie is armed, and the closer that ithath the orders, and stronger, so moche the surer it is: so that he thatis of thesame opinion, that you saie, it behoveth either that he bee ofsmalle wisedome, or that in this thyng, he hath studied verie little:for as moche as if we see, that so little a parte of the aunciente manerof armyng, whiche is used now a daies, that is the pike, and so little aparte of those orders, as are the maine battailes of the Suizzers, dooeus so moche good, and cause our armies to bee so strong, why ought notwe to beleve, that the other armours, and thother orders whiche arelefte, be profitable? Seyng that if we have no regard to the artillerie,in puttyng our selves close together, as the Suizzers, what other ordersmaie make us more to feare thesame? For as moche as no order can causeus so moche to feare thesame, as those, whiche bryng men together.Besides this, if the artillerie of the enemies should not make meafraied, in besiegyng a Toune, where it hurteth me with more safegarde,beyng defended of a wall, I beyng not able to prevente it, but onelywith tyme, with my artillerie to lette it, after soche sorte that itmaie double the blowe as it liste, why should I feare thesame in thefield, where I maie quickly prevent it? So that I conclude thus, thatthe artillerie, according to my opinion, doeth not let, that theaunciente maners cannot be used, and to shewe the auncient vertue: andif I had not talked alreadie with you of this instrument, I would ofthesame, declare unto you more at length: but I will remit my self tothat, whiche then I saied.LUIGI. Wee maie now understande verie well, how moche you have aboutethe artillerie discoursed: and in conclusion, my thinkes you haveshewed, that the preventyng it quickly, is the greatest remedie, thatmaie be had for thesame, beyng in the fielde, and havyng an armieagainste you. Upon the whiche there groweth in me a doubte: bicause methinkes, that the enemie might place his ordinaunce in soche wise, inhis armie, that it should hurt you, and should be after soche sortgarded of the footemen, that it could not be prevented. You have (if youremember your self well) in the orderyng of your armie to faight, madedistaunces of three yardes, betwene the one battaile and the other,makyng those distaunces fiftene, whiche is from the battailes, tothextraordinarie pikes: if thenemie, shuld order his armie like untoyours, and should putte the artillerie a good waie within those spaces,I beleve that from thens, it should hurte you with their moste greatesafegard: bicause menne can not enter into the force of their enemies toprevent it.[Sidenote: A generall rule againste soche thynges as cannot beewithstoode.]FABRICIO. You doubt moste prudently, and I will devise with my self,either to resolve you the doubte, or shewe you the remedie: I have toldeyou, that continually these battailes, either through goyng, or thorowefaightyng, are movyng, and alwaies naturally, thei come to drawe hardetogether, so that if you make the distaunces of a small breadth, whereyou set the artillerie, in a little tyme thei be shootte up, after sochesort, that the artillerie cannot any more shoote: if you make theimlarge, to avoide this perill, you incurre into a greater, where youthrough those distances, not onely give commoditie to the enemie, totake from you the artillerie, but to breake you: but you have tounderstande, that it is impossible to keepe the artillerie betwene thebandes, and in especially those whiche go on carriages: For that theartillerie goeth one waie, and shooteth an other waie: So that havyng togo and to shoote, it is necessary, before thei shote, that thei tourne,and for to tourne theim, thei will have so moche space, that fiftiecartes of artillerie, would disorder any armie: therfore, it is mete tokepe them out of the bandes, where thei may be overcome in the maner, asa little afore we have shewed: but admit thei might be kept, and thatthere might be found a waie betwen bothe, and of soche condicion, thatthe presyng together of men should not hinder the artillerie, and werenot so open that it should give waie to the enemie, I saie, that it isremedied moste easely, with makyng distances in thy armie against it,whiche maie give free passage to the shot of those, and so the violencethereof shall come to be vain, the which maie be doen moste easely: forasmoche, as the enemie mindyng to have his artillerie stand safe, itbehoveth that he put them behinde, in the furthest part of thedistances, so that the shot of the same, he purposyng that thei hurt nothis owne men, ought to passe by right line, and by that very samealwaies: and therefore with givyng theim place, easely thei maie beeavoided: for that this is a generall rule, that to those thynges, whichecannot be withstoode, there must bee given waie, as the antiquitie madeto the Eliphantes, and to the carres full of hookes. I beleve, ye, I ammore then certaine, that it semeth unto you, that I have ordered andwonne a battaile after my own maner: notwithstanding, I answeer unto youthis, when so moche as I have saied hetherto, should not suffice, thatit should be impossible, that an armie thus ordered, and armed, shouldnot overcome at the first incounter, any other armie that should beeordained, as thei order the armies now adaies, whom most often tymes,make not but one front, havyng no targaettes, and are in soche wiseunarmed, that thei cannot defende themselves from the enemie at hand,and thei order theim after soche sorte, that if thei set their battailesby flanck, the one to the other, thei make the armie thinne: if thei putthe one behind the other, havyng no waie to receive the one the other,thei doe it confusedly, and apt to be easly troubled: and although theigive three names to their armies, and devide them into thre companies,vaward, battaile, and rereward, notwithstandyng it serveth to no otherpurpose, then to marche, and to distinguis the lodgynges: but in thedaie of battaile, thei binde them all to the first brunte, and to thefirst fortune.LUIGI. I have noted also in the faightyng of your fielde, how yourhorsemen were repulced of the enemies horsemen: for whiche cause theiretired to the extraordinaire Pikes: whereby grewe, that with the aideof theim, thei withstode, and drave the enemies backe? I beleve that thePikes maie withstande the horses, as you saie, but in a grosse andthicke maine battaile, as the Suizzers make: but you in your army, havefor the hedde five rankes of Pikes, and for the flancke seven, so that Icannot tell how thei maie bee able to withstande them.[Sidenote: A Battaile how greate so ever it bee, cannot atones occupyabove v. rankes of Pikes.]FABRICIO. Yet I have told you, how sixe rankes of pikes wer occupied atones, in the Macedonicall Falangi, albeit you ought to understande, thata maine battaile of Suizzers, if it were made of a thousande rankes, itcannot occupie more then fower, or at the most five: bicause the Pikesbe sixe yardes and three quarters longe, one yarde and halfe a quarter,is occupied of the handes, wherefore to the firste ranke, thereremaineth free five yardes and a half, and a halfe quarter of Pike: theseconde ranke besides that whiche is occupied with the hande, consumetha yarde and half a quarter in the space, whiche remaineth betwene theone ranke and thother: so that there is not left of pike profitable,more then fower yardes and a halfe: to the thirde ranke, by this veriesame reason, there remaineth three yardes and a quarter and a halfe: tothe fowerth, twoo yardes and a quarter: to the fift one yard and halfe aquarter: the other rankes, for to hurte, be unprofitable, but thei serveto restore these firste rankes, as we have declared, and to bee afortificacion to those v. Then if five of their rankes can withstandethe horse, why cannot five of ours withstande theim? to the whiche alsothere lacketh not rankes behinde, that doeth sustain and make them thevery same staie, although thei have no pikes as the other. And when therankes of thextraordinarie pikes, which are placed on the flanckes,should seme unto you thinne, thei maie bee brought into a quadrante, andput on the flancke nere the twoo battailes, whiche I set in the lastecompanie of the armie: From the whiche place, thei maie easelyaltogether succour the fronte, and the backe of the armie, and ministerhelpe to the horses, accordyng as nede shall require.LUIGI. Would you alwaies use this forme of order, when you would pitchea fielde.[Sidenote: An advertiement concernyng the pitchying of a field.]FABRICIO. No in no wise: for that you ought to varie the facion of thearmie, according to the qualitie of the situacion, and the condicion andquantitie of the enemie, as before this reasonyng dooe ende, shall beeshewed certaine insamples: but this forme is given unto you, not somoche as moste strongeste of all, where in deede it is verie strong, asto the intente that thereby you maie take a rule, and an order to learneto knowe the waies to ordeine the other: for as moche, as every sciencehath his generalitie, upon the whiche a good part of it is grounded. Onething onely I advise you, that you never order an armie, after sochesorte, that those that faight afore, cannot bee sucoured of theim,whiche be set behind: bicause he that committeth this errour, maketh thegreateste parte of his armie to bee unprofitable, and if it incounterany strength, it cannot overcome.LUIGI. There is growen in me, upon this parte a doubte. I have seen thatin the placyng of the battailes, you make the fronte of five on a side,the middeste of three, and the last partes of twoo, and I beleve, thatit were better to ordain them contrariwise: for that I thinke, that anarmie should with more difficultie bee broken, when he that shouldcharge upon it, the more that he should entre into the-same, so mochethe stronger he should finde it: and the order devised of you, methinkes maketh, that the more it is entered into, so moche the weaker itis founde.[Sidenote: How the front of the armie ought to bee made; How the middellpart of the armie ought to be ordered.]FABRICIO. If you should remember how to the Triarii, whom were thethirde order of the Romain Legions, there were not assigned more thensixe hundred men, you would doubt lesse, havyng understode how thei wereplaced in the laste companie: For that you should see, how I moved ofthis insample, have placed in the last companie twoo battailes, whicheare nine hundred men, so that I come rather (folowyng the insample ofthe Romaine people) to erre, for havyng taken to many, then to fewe: andalthough this insample should suffice, I will tell you the reason, thewhich is this. The first fronte of the armie, is made perfectly wholeand thicke, bicause it must withstande the brunt of the enemies, and ithath not to receive in it any of their felowes: and for this, it isfitte that it bee full of menne: bicause a fewe menne, should make itweake, either thinnesse, or for lacke of sufficiente nomber: but theseconde companie, for as moche as it must first receive their frendes,to sustain the enemie, it is mete that it have greate spaces, and forthis it behoveth, that it be of lesse nomber then the first: for that ifit wer of greater nomber, or equall, it should bee conveniente, eithernot to leave the distaunces, the whiche should be disorder, or leavyngtheim, to passe the boundes of thoseafore, the whiche should make thefacion of the armie unperfecte: and it is not true that you saie, thatthe enemie, the more that he entereth into the maine battaile, so mochethe weaker he findeth it: for that the enemie, can never faight with theseconde order, except the first be joined with thesame: so that hecometh to finde the middest of the maine battaile more stronger, and notmore weaker, havyng to faight with the first, and with the seconde orderaltogether: the verie same happeneth, when the enemie should come to thethirde companie: for that there, not with twoo battailes, whiche isfounde freshe, but with all the maine battaile he must faight: and forthat this last part hath to receive moste men, the spaces therof isrequisite to be greatest, and that whiche receiveth them, to be theleste nomber.[Sidenote: The orderyng of the hinder part of tharmy.]LUIGI. It pleaseth me thesame that you have told: but answere me alsothis: if the five first battailes doe retire betwene the three secondebattailes, and after the eight betwene the twoo thirde, it semeth notpossible, that the eight beyng brought together, and then the tennetogether, maie bee received when thei bee eight, or when thei be tennein the verie same space, whiche received the five.[Sidenote: The retire of the Pikes, to place the Targaet men.]FABRICIO. The first thyng that I aunswere is, that it is not the veriesame space: For that the five have fower spaces in the middeste, whicheretiryng betwene the thre, or betwene the twoo, thei occupie: then thereremaineth thesame space, that is betwene the one maine battaile andother and thesame that is, betwene the battailes, and the extraordinariePikes, al the whiche spaces makes largenesse: besides this, it is to beeconsidered, that the battailes kepe other maner of spaces, when thei beein the orders without beyng altered, then when thei be altered: for thatin the alteracion: either thei throng together, or thei inlarge theorders: thei inlarge theim, when thei feare so moche, that thei fall tofliyng, thei thrust them together, when thei feare in soche wise, thatthei seke to save them selves, not with runnyng a waie, but withdefence: So that in this case, thei should come to be destingueshed, andnot to be inlarged. Moreover, the five rankes of the Pikes, that arebefore, so sone as thei have begun the faighte, thei ought betwene theirbattailes to retire, into the taile of the armie, for to give place tothe Targaet men, that thei maie faighte: and thei goyng into the taileof the armie, maie dooe soche service as the capitain should judge, weregood to occupie theim aboute, where in the forward, the faight beyngmingled, thei should otherwise bee altogether unprofitable. And for thisthe spaces ordained, come to bee for the remnaunte of the menne, wideinough to receive them: yet when these spaces should not suffice, theflankes on the sides be men, and not walles, whom givyng place, andinlargyng them selves, maie make the space to containe so moche, that itmaie bee sufficient to receive theim.[Sidenote: How the pikes that are placed on the flankes of the armieought to governe them selves when the rest of the armie is driven toretire.]LUIGI. The rankes of the extraordinarie Pikes, whiche you place on theflanckes of the armie, when the first battailes retire into the second,will you have them to stande still, and remain with twoo homes to thearmie? Or will you that thei also retire together, with the battailes?The whiche when thei should do, I see not how thei can, havyng nobattailes behinde with distaunces that maie receive them.[Sidenote: Thexercise of the army in generall; The nomber that is meteto be written in the Ansigne of every band of men; The degrees ofhonours in an armie, whiche soche a man ought to rise by, as should beemade a generall capitain.]FABRICIO. If the enemie overcome theim not, when he inforceth thebattailes to retire, thei maie stande still in their order, and hurtethe enemie on the flanck, after that the firste battailes retired: butif he should also overcome theim, as semeth reason, beyng so puisaunte,that he is able to repulce the other, thei also ought to retire: whichethei maie dooe excellently well, although thei have not behinde, any toreceive them: bicause from the middest thei maie redouble by right line,entring the one ranke into the other, in the maner whereof wee reasoned,when it was spoken of the order of redoublyng: True it is, that to mynderedoublyng to retire backe, it behoveth to take an other waie, thenthesame that I shewed you: for that I told you, that the second ranke,ought to enter into the first, the fowerth into the thirde, and sofoorth: in this case, thei ought not to begin before, but behinde, sothat redoublyng the rankes, thei maie come to retire backewarde not totourne forward: but to aunswere to all thesame, that upon this foughtenfield by me shewed, might of you bee replied. I saie unto you again,that I have ordained you this armie, and shewed this foughten field fortwo causes, thone, for to declare unto you how it is ordered, the otherto shewe you how it is exercised: thorder, I beleve you understandemoste well: and concernyng the exersice, I saie unto you, that theiought to be put together in this forme, as often times as maie be: foras moche as the heddes learne therby, to kepe their battailes in theseorders: for that to particulare souldiours, it appertaineth to keepewell the orders of every battaile, to the heddes of the battailes, itappertaineth to keepe theim well in every order of the armie, and thatthei knowe how to obeie, at the commaundement of the generall capitain:therefore, it is conveniente that thei knowe, how to joyne the onebattaile with thother, that thei maie knowe how to take their placeatones: and for this cause it is mete that thansigne of every battaile,have written in some evident part, the nomber therof: as well for to beable to commaunde them, as also for that the capitain, and thesouldiours by thesame nomber, maie more easely knowe theim againe: alsothe maine battailes, ought to be nombred, and to have the nomber intheir principal Ansigne: Therefore it is requisite, to knowe of whatnomber the maine battaile shall be, that is placed on the left, or onthe right horne of what nombers the battailes bee, that are set in thefronte, and in the middeste, and so foorthe of the other. The antiquitiewould also, that these nombers should bee steppes to degrees, of honorsof the armies: as for insample, the first degree, is the Peticapitain,the seconde, the hedde of fiftie ordinarie Veliti, the thirde, theCenturion, the fowerth, the hedde of the first battaile, the fifte, ofthe second, the sixt, of the thirde, and so forthe, even to the tenthbattaile, the whiche must be honoured in the seconde place, nexte thegenerall capitaine of a maine battaile: nor any ought to come to thesamehedde, if first, he have not risen up by all these degrees. And bicausebesides these heddes, there be the three Conestables of theextraordinarie Pikes, and twoo of the extraordinarie Veliti, I wouldthat thei should be in the same degree of the Conestable of the firstbattaile: nor I would not care, that there were sixe men of like degree,to thintent, that every one of them might strive, who should doe beste,for to be promised to be hedde of the seconde battaile. Then every oneof these heddes, knowyng in what place his battaile ought to be settein, of necessitie it must folowe, that at a sounde of the Trompette, sosone as the hedde standarde shall bee erected, all the armie shall be intheir places: and this is the first exercise, whereunto an armie oughtto bee accustomed, that is to set theim quickly together: and to doethis, it is requisite every daie, and divers times in one daie, to setthem in order, and to disorder them.LUIGI. What armes would you that thansignes of all the armie, shoul'dhave beside the nomber?[Sidenote: The armes that oughte to bee in the standarde, and in theansignes of an armie; The second and thirde exercise of an armie; Thefowerth exercise of an armie; The soundes of the instrumentes ofmusicke, that the antiquitie used in their armies; What is signified bythe sounde of the Trompet.]FABRICIO. The standarde of the generall Capitaine oughte to have thearmes of the Prince of the armie, all the other, maie have the veriesame armes, and to varie with the fieldes, or to varie with the armes,as should seme beste to the Lorde of the armie: Bicause this importethlittle, so that the effect growe, that thei be knowen the one from theother. But let us passe to the other exercise: the which is to make themto move, and with a convenient pace to marche, and to se, that marehyngthei kepe the orders. The third exercise is, that thei learne to handlethemselves in thesame maner, whiche thei ought after to handletheimselves in the daie of battaile, to cause the artillerie to shoote,and to bee drawen out of the waie, to make the extraordinarie Veliti toissue out, after a likenes of an assault, to retire theim: To make thatthe firste battailes, as though thei wer sore charged, retire into thespaces of the second: and after, all into the thirde, and from thensevery one to retourne to his place: and in soche wise to use theim inthis exercise, that to every manne, all thyng maie be knowen, andfamiliar: the which with practise, and with familiaritie, is brought topasse moste quickly. The fowerth exercise is, that thei learne to knoweby meane of the sounde, and of the Ansigne, the commaundemente of theircapitaine: for as moche as that, whiche shall be to them pronounced byvoice, thei without other commaundemente, maie understande: and bicausethe importaunce of this commaundement, ought to growe of the sounde, Ishall tell you what soundes the antiquitie used. Of the Lacedemonians,accordyng as Tucidido affirmeth, in their armies were used Flutes: forthat thei judged, that this armonie, was moste mete to make their armieto procede with gravetie, and with furie: the Carthaginens beyng movedby this verie same reason, in the first assaulte, used the violone.Aliatte kyng of the Lidians, used in the warre the violone, and theFlutes: but Alexander Magnus, and the Romaines, used hornes, andTrumpettes, as thei, that thought by vertue of soche instrumentes, tobee able to incourage more the myndes of Souldiours, and make theim tofaight the more lustely: but as we have in armyng the armie, taken ofthe Greke maner, and of the Romaine, so in distrihutyng the soundes, wewill keepe the customes of the one, and of the other nacion: therefore,nere the generall capitain, I would make the Trompettes to stand, as asounde not onely apt to inflame the armie, but apte to bee heard in allthe whole tumoult more, then any other sounde: all the other soundes,whiche should bee aboute the Conestables, and the heddes of mainebattailes I would, that thei should bee smalle Drummes, and Flutes,sounded not as thei sounde theim now but as thei use to sounde theim atfeastes. The capitaine then with the Trompet, should shewe when theimust stande still, and go forward, or tourne backward, when theartillerie must shoote, when the extraordinarie Veliti must move, andwith the varietie or distinccion of soche soundes, to shewe unto thearmie all those mocions, whiche generally maie bee shewed, the whicheTrompettes, should bee after followed of the Drummes, and in thisexercise, bicause it importeth moche, it behoveth moche to exercise thearmie. Concernyng the horsemen, there would be used likewise Trompettes,but of a lesse sounde, and of a divers voice from those of theCapitaine. This is as moche as is come into my remembraunce, aboute theorder of the armie, and of the exercise of thesame.LUIGI. I praie you let it not be grevous unto you to declare unto me another thyng, that is, for what cause you made the light horsmen, and theextraordinarie Veliti, to goe with cries, rumours, and furie, when theigave the charge? And after in the incountering of the rest of tharmie,you shewed, that the thing folowed with a moste greate scilence? And forthat I understande not the occasion of this varietie, I would desirethat you would declare it unto me.[Sidenote: The cries, and rumours, wher with the firste charge is givenunto the enemies, and the silence that ought to bee used after, when thefaight is ones begunne.]FABRICIO. The opinion of auncient capitaines, hath been divers about thecommyng to handes, whether thei ought with rumour to go a pace, or withscilence to go faire and softely: this laste waie, serveth to kepe theorder more sure, and to understande better the commaundementes of theCapitaine: the firste, serveth to incourage more the mindes of men: andfor that I beleve, that respecte ought to bee had to the one, and to theother of these twoo thynges, I made the one goe with rumour, and thotherwith scilence: nor me thinkes not in any wise, that the continuallrumours bee to purpose: bicause thei lette the commaundementes, thewhiche is a thyng moste pernicious: nor it standeth not with reason,that the Romaines used, except at the firste assaulte to make rumour:for that in their histories, is seen many tymes to have happened, thatthrough the wordes, and comfortinges of the capitain the souldiours thatranne awaie, were made to stande to it, and in sundrie wise by hiscommaundemente, to have varied the orders, the whiche should not havefollowed, if the rumoures had been louder then his voyce.THE FOWERTH BOOKELUIGI.

Ihave tolde you, how I have shewed you a facion of an armie, to theintent, that accordyng to thesame, there maie bee given all thosefacions, that the enemie, and the situacion requireth: For as moche asin this case, bothe accordyng to the power thereof, and accordyng to theenemie, it proceadeth: but note this, that there is not a more perillousfacion, then to deffende moche the front of tharmie, if then thou havenot a most puisant, and moste great hoste: otherwise, thou oughtest tomake it rather grosse, and of small largenesse, then of moche largenesand thin: for when thou hast fewe men in comparison to thenemie, thououghtest to seke other remedies, as is to ordain thine army in soche aplace, wher thou maiest be fortefied, either through rivers, or bymeanes of fennes, after soch sort, that thou canst not bee compassedaboute, or to inclose thy self on the flanckes with diches, as Cesar didin Fraunce. You have to take in this cace, this generall rule, toinlarge your self, or to draw in your self with the front, according toyour nomber, and thesame of the enemie. For thenemies being of lessenomber, thou oughtest to seke large places, havyng in especially thy menwell instructed: to the intent thou maiest, not onely compasse aboutethe enemie, but to deffende thy orders: for that in places rough anddifficulte, beyng not able to prevaile of thy orders, thou commeste notto have any advauntage, hereby grewe, that the Romaines almoste alwaies,sought the open fieldes, and advoided the straightes. To the contrarie,as I have said, thou oughtest to doe, if thou hast fewe menne, or illinstructed: for that then thou oughteste to seeke places, either wherethe little nomber maye be saved, and where the small experience dooe nothurte thee: Thou oughtest also to chuse the higher grounde, to be ablemore easily to infest them: notwithstandyng, this advertisment ought tobe had, not to ordaine thy armie, where the enemie maie spie what thoudoest and in place nere to the rootes of the same, where the enemiesarmie maie come: For that in this case, havyng respecte unto theartillerie, the higher place shall gette thee disadvauntage: Bicausethat alwaies and commodiously, thou mightest of the enemies artilleriebee hurte, without beyng able to make any remedy, and thou couldest notcommodiously hurte thesame, beyng hindered by thine owne men. Also, hethat prepareth an armie to faight a battaile, ought to have respecte,bothe to the Sunne, and to the Winde, that the one and the other, doenot hurte the fronte, for that the one and the other, will let thee thesight, the one with the beames, and the other with the duste: andmoreover, the Winde hindereth the weapons, whiche are stroken at theenemie, and maketh their blowes more feable: and concerning the Sunne,it sufficeth not to have care, that at the firste it shine not in theface, but it is requisite to consider, that increasyng the daie, ithurte thee not: and for this, it should bee requsite in orderyng themen, to have it all on the backe, to the entente it should have to passemoche tyme, to come to lye on the fronte. This waie was observed ofAniball at Canne, and of Mario against the Cimbrians. If thou happen tobe moche inferiour of horses, ordaine thine armie emongeste Vines, andtrees, and like impedimentes, as in our time the Spaniardes did, whenthei overthrewe the Frenchmenne at Cirignuola. And it hath been seenmany times, with all one Souldiours, variyng onely the order, and theplace, that thei have become of losers victorers: as it happened to theCarthageners, whom havyng been overcome of Marcus Regolus divers tymes,were after by the counsaill of Santippo a Lacedemonian, victorious: whommade them to go doune into the plaine, where by vertue of the horses,and of Eliphantes, thei were able to overcome the Romaines. It semesunto me, accordyng to the auncient insamples that almoste all theexcellente Capitaines, when thei have knowen, that the enemie hath madestrong one side of his battaile, thei have not set against it, the mostestrongest parte, but the moste weakest, and thother moste strongest theihave set against the most weakest: after in the beginning the faighte,thei have commaunded to their strongest parte, that onely thei sustainethe enemie, and not to preace upon hym, and to the weaker, that theisuffer them selves to be overcome, and to retire into the hindermostebandes of the armie. This breadeth twoo greate disorders to the enemie:the firste, that he findeth his strongest parte compassed about, thesecond is, that semyng unto him to have the victorie, seldome tymes ithappeneth, that thei disorder not theim selves, whereof groweth hissodain losse. Cornelius Scipio beyng in Spain, againste Asdruball ofCarthage, and understanding how to Asdruball it was knowen, that he inthe orderyng the armie, placed his Legions in the middest, the whichewas the strongest parte of his armie, and for this how Asdruball withlike order ought to procede: after when he came to faighte the battaile,he chaunged order, and put his Legions on the hornes of the armie, andin the middest, placed all his weakeste men: then commyng to the handes,in a sodain those men placed in the middeste, he made to marche softly,and the hornes of the armie, with celeritie to make forwarde, so thatonely the hornes of bothe the armies fought, and the bandes in themiddest, through beyng distaunt the one from the other, joyned nottogether, and thus the strongest parte of Scipio, came to faight withthe weakest of Asdruball, and overcame hym. The whiche waie was thenprofitable, but now havyng respect to the artillerie, it cannot be used:bicause the same space, whiche should remain in the middest, betwene theone armie and the other, should give tyme to thesame to shoote: Thewhiche is moste pernicious, as above is saied: Therefore it is requisiteto laie this waie aside, and to use, as a little afore we saied, makyngall the armie to incounter, and the weakest parte to give place. When acapitaine perceiveth, that he hath a greater armie then his enemie,mindyng to compasse hym aboute, before he be aware let hym ordaine hisfronte equall, to thesame of his adversaries, after, so sone as thefaight is begun, let hym make the fronte by a little and little toretire, and the flanckes to deffende, and alwaies it shall happen, thatthe enemie shal find hymself, before he be aware compassed about. When acapitain will faight, as it wer sure not to be broken, let hym ordainehis armie in place, where he hath refuge nere, and safe, either betweneFennes, or betwene hilles, or by some strong citee: for that in thiscase, he cannot bee followed of the enemie, where the enemie maie bepursued of him: this poincte was used of Aniball, when fortune began tobecome his adversarie, and that he doubted of the valiauntnesse ofMarcus Marcello. Some to trouble the orders of the enemie, havecommaunded those that were light armed, to begin the faight, and thatbeyng begunne, to retire betwene the orders: and when the armies wereafter buckled together, and that the fronte of either of them wereoccupied in faightyng, thei have made theim to issue out by the flanckesof the battaile, and thesame have troubled and broken. If any perceivehymself to bee inferiour of horse, he maie besides the waies that arealredie shewed, place behinde his horsemen a battaile of Pikes, and infaightyng take order, that thei give waie to the Pikes, and he shallremain alwaies superiour. Many have accustomed to use certain fotemennelighte armed, to faighte emong horsemen, the whiche hath been to thechivalrie moste greate helpe. Of all those, which have prepared armiesto the field, be moste praised Aniball and Scipio, when thei fought inAfrick: and for that Aniball had his armie made of Carthaginers, and ofstraungers of divers nacions, he placed in the first fronte thereoflxxx. Elephantes, after he placed the straungers, behinde whom he settehis Carthaginers, in the hindermoste place, he putte the Italians, inwhom he trusted little: the whiche thing he ordained so, for that thestraungers havyng before theim the enemie, and behinde beyng inclosed ofhis men, could not flie: so that being constrained to faight thei shouldovercome, or wearie the Romaines, supposyng after with his freshe andvaliaunte men, to be then able easely to overcome the Romaines, beeyngwearied. Against this order, Scipio set the Astati, the Prencipi, andthe Triarii, in the accustomed maner, to bee able to receive the one theother, and to rescue the one the other: he made the fronte of the armie,full of voide spaces, and bicause it should not be perceived but rathershould seme united, he filled them ful of veliti, to whom he commaunded,that so sone as the Eliphantes came, thei should avoide, and by theordinarie spaces, should enter betwene the Legins, and leave open thewaie to the Eliphauntes, and so it came to passe, that it made vaine theviolence of theim, so that commyng to handes, he was superiour.ZANOBI. You have made me to remember, in alledging me this battaile, howScipio in faighting, made not the Astati to retire into thorders of thePrencipi, but he devided theim, and made theim to retire in the hornesof the armie, to thintent thei might give place to the Prencipi, when hewould force forwarde: therfore I would you should tell me, what occasionmoved hym, not to observe the accustomed order.[Sidenote: Cartes full of hookes made to destroie the enemies; Theremedy that was used against Cartes full of hookes; The straunge manerthat Silla used in orderyng his army against Archelaus; How to troublein the faighte the armie of the enemies; A policie of Caius Sulpitius,to make his enemies afraied; A policie of Marius againste the Duchmenne;A policie of greate importaunce, while a battaile is a faightyng; Howhorsemen maie bee disordered; How the turke gave the Sophie anoverthrowe; How the Spaniardes overcame the armie of Amilcare; How totraine the enemie, to his destruccion; A policie of Tullo Hostilio andLucius Silla in dessemlyng of a mischaunce; Sertorius slue a man fortelling him of the death of one of his capitaines; Howe certainecaptaines have staied their men that hath been running awaie; Attilliusconstrained his men that ran awaie to tourne again and to faight; HowPhilip king of Macedonia made his men afraied to run awaie; Victorieought with all celeritie to bee folowed; What a capitaine ought to dooe,when he should chaunce to receive an overthrowe; How Martius overcamethe armie of the Carthaginers; A policie of Titus Dimius to hide alosse, whiche he had received in a faight; A general rule; Aniball;Scipio; Asdruball; A Capitaine ought not to faight without advantage,excepte he be constrained; How advauntage maie bee taken of the enemies;Furie withstode, converteth into vilenesse; What maner of men acapitaine ought to have about him continually, to consult withall; Thecondicions of the capitain of the enemies, and of those that are abouthym is moste requisite to bee knowen; A timerous army is not to beconducted to faight; How to avoide the faightyng of a fielde.]FABRICIO. I will tell you. Aniball had putte all the strengthe of hisarmie, in the seconde bande: wherefore Scipio for to set againstethesame like strengthe, gathered the Prencipi and the Triarii together:So that the distaunces of the Prencipi, beyng occupied of the Triarii,there was no place to bee able to receive the Astati: and therefore hemade the Astati to devide, and to go in the hornes of the armie, and hedrewe them not betwene the Prencipi. But note, that this waie of openyngthe first bande, for to give place to the seconde, cannot bee used, butwhen a man is superiour to his enemie: for that then there is commoditieto bee able to dooe it, as Scipio was able: but beyng under, andrepulced, it cannot be doen, but with thy manifest ruine: and thereforeit is convenient to have behinde, orders that maie receive thee, but letus tourne to our reasonyng. The auncient Asiaticans, emongest otherthynges devised of them to hurt the enemies, used carres. The whiche hadon the sides certaine hookes, so that not onely thei served to open withtheir violence the bandes, but also to kill with the hookes theadversaries: against the violence of those, in thre maners theiprovided, either thei sustained theim with the thickenesse of the raies,or thei received theim betwene the bandes, as the Eliphantes werereceived, or els thei made with arte some strong resistence: As Silla aRomaine made againste Archelaus, whom had many of these cartes, whichethei called hooked, who for to sustaine theim, drave many stakes intothe grounde, behinde his first bandes of men, whereby the cartes beyngstopped, lost their violence. And the newe maner that Silla used againsthym in orderyng the armie, is to bee noted: for that he put the Veliti,and the horse, behinde, and all the heavie armed afore, leavyng manydistaunces to be able to sende before those behinde, when necessiterequired: whereby the fight beyng begun, with the helpe of the horsemen,to the whiche he gave the waie, he got the victorie. To intende totrouble in the faight the enemies armie, it is conveniente to make somethyng to growe, that maie make theim afraied, either with showyng ofnewe helpe that commeth, or with showyng thynges, whiche maie representea terrour unto theim: after soche sorte, that the enemies begiled ofthat sight, maie be afraied, and being made afraied, thei maie easelybee overcome: the whiche waies Minutio Rufo used, and Accilio GlabrioneConsulls of Rome. Caius Sulpitius also set a greate many of sackes uponMules, and other beastes unprofitable for the warre, but in soche wiseordained, that thei semed men of armes, and he commaunded, that theishould appere upon a hill, while he were a faightyng with theFrenchemen, whereby grewe his victorie. The verie same did Marius, whenhe foughte against the Duchemen. Then the fained assaultes availyngmoche, whilest the faight continueth, it is conveniente, that the veryassaultes in deede, dooe helpe moche: inespecially if at unwares in themiddest of the faight, the enemie might bee assaulted behinde, or on theside: the whiche hardely maie be doen, if the countrie helpe thee not:for that when it is open, parte of thy men cannot bee hid, as is mete tobee doen in like enterprises: but in woddie or hille places, and forthis apt for ambusshes parte of thy men maie be well hidden, to be ablein a sodain, and contrary to thenemies opinion to assaut him, whichethyng alwaies shall be occasion to give thee the victorie. It hath beensometyme of greate importaunce, whilest the faighte continueth, to sowevoices, whiche doe pronounce the capitaine of thenemies to be dedde, orto have overcome on the other side of the armie: the whiche many timesto them that have used it, hath given the victorie. The chivalrie of theenemies maie bee easely troubled, either with sightes, or with rumours,not used: as Creso did, whom put Camelles againste the horses of theadversaries, and Pirrus sette againste the Romaine horsemen Eliphantes,the sighte of whiche troubled and disordered them. In our time, theTurke discomfited the Sophi in Persia, and the Soldane in Surria with noother, then with the noise of Harkabuses, the whiche in soche wise, withtheir straunge rumours, disturbed the horses of those, that the Turkemighte easely overcome them: The Spaniardes to overcome the armie ofAmilcare, put in the firste fronte Cartes full of towe drawen of oxen,and comming to handes, thei kindeled fire to thesame, wherfore the oxento flie from the fire, thrust into the armie of Amilcar, and opened it.Thei are wonte (as we have saied) to begile the enemie in the faight,drawyng him into their ambusshes, where the Countrie is commodious forthe same purpose, but where it were open and large, many have used tomake diches, and after have covered them lightly with bowes and yearth,and lefte certain spaces whole, to be able betnene those to retire:after, so sone as the faight hath been begunne, retiryng by those, andthe enemie folowing them, hath fallen in the pittes. If in the faightthere happen thee, any accident that maie feare thy souldiours, it is amoste prudente thyng, to knowe how to desemble it, and to pervert it togood, as Tullo Hostilio did, and Lucius Silla: whom seyng while theifought, how a parte of his men wer gone to the enemies side, and howthesame thing had verie moche made afraied his men, he made straightewaie throughout all the armie to be understoode, how all thing proceded,accordyng to his order: the whiche not onely did not trouble the armie,but it increased in them so moche stomack, that he remained victorious.It happened also to Silla, that havyng sente certaine souldiours to doesome businesse, and thei beyng slain he saied, to the intent his armieshould not be made afraied thereby, that he had with crafte sent theiminto the handes of the enemies, for that he had found them nothyngfaithfull. Sertorius faightyng a battaile in Spaine, slue one, whomsignified unto hym the death of one of his capitaines, for feare thattellyng the very same to other, he should make theim afraied. It is amoste difficult thyng, an armie beyng now moved to flie, to staie it,and make it to faight. And you have to make this distinccion: eitherthat it is all moved, and then to be impossible to tourne it, or thereis moved a parte thereof, and then there is some remedie. Many Romaincapitaines, with making afore those whiche fled, have caused them tostaie, making them ashamed of running awaie, as Lucius Silla did, wherealredy parte of his Legions beyng tourned to flight, driven awaie by themen of Mithridates, he made afore them with a swearde in his handecriyng: if any aske you, where you left your capitaine, saie, we haveleft hym in Boecia, where he faighteth. Attillius a consull set againstethat ran awaie, them that ranne not awaie, and made them to understande,that if thei would not tourne, thei should be slaine of their frendes,and of their enemies. Philip of Macedonia understanding how his menfeared the Scithian Souldiours, placed behinde his armie, certaine ofhis moste trustie horsemen, and gave commission to theim, that theishould kill whom so ever fledde: wherfore, his men mindyng rather to diefaightyng, then fliyng, overcame. Many Romaines, not so moche to staie aflight, as for to give occasion to their men, to make greater force,have whileste thei have foughte, taken an Ansigne out of their ownemennes handes, and throwen it emongeste the enemies, and appoinctedrewardes to hym that could get it again. I doe not beleve that it is outof purpose, to joyne to this reasonyng those thynges, whiche chaunceafter the faight, in especially beyng brief thinges, and not to be leftbehinde, and to this reasonyng conformable inough. Therefore I saie, howthe fielde is loste, or els wonne: when it is wonne, the victorie oughtwith all celeritie to be folowed, and in this case to imitate Cesar, andnot Aniball, whom staiyng after that he had discomfited the Romaines atCanne, loste the Empire of Rome: The other never rested after thevictorie, but folowed the enemie beyng broken, with greater violence andfurie, then when he assalted hym whole: but when a capitaine dooethloese, he ought to see, if of the losse there maie growe any utiliteunto hym, inespecially if there remain any residue of tharmie. Thecommoditie maie growe of the small advertisment of the enemie, whommoste often times after the victorie, becometh negligent, and giveththee occasion to oppresse hym, as Marcius a Romaine oppressed the armieof the Carthaginers, whom having slain the twoo Scipions, and brokentheir armie, not estemyng thesame remnaunt of menne, whiche with Marciusremained a live, were of hym assaulted and overthrowen: for that it isseen, that there is no thing so moche to bee brought to passe, asthesame, whiche the enemie thinketh, that thou canst not attempte:bicause for the moste parte, men bee hurte moste, where thei doubtleaste: therefore a capitain ought when he cannot doe this, to devise atleast with diligence, that the losse bee lesse hurtfull, to dooe this,it is necessarie for thee to use meanes, that the enemie maie not easelyfolowe thee, or to give him occasion to make delaie: in the first case,some after thei have been sure to lese, have taken order with theirheddes, that in divers partes, and by divers waies thei should flie,havyng appoincted wher thei should after assemble together: the whichmade, that thenemie (fearing to devide the armie) was faine to let gosafe either all, or the greatest part of them. In the seconde case, manyhave cast before the enemie, their dearest thinges, to the entent thathe tariyng about the spoile, might give them more laisure to flie. TitusDimius used no small policie to hide the losse, whiche he had receivedin the faight, for asmoche as havyng fought untill night, with greatlosse of his menne, he made in the night to be buried, the greatest partof them, wherefore in the mornyng, the enemies seyng so many slaine oftheirs, and so fewe of the Romaines, belevyng that thei had thedisavauntage, ran awaie. I trust I have thus confusedly, as I saied,satisfied in good part your demaunde: in dede about the facions of thearmies, there resteth me to tell you, how some tyme, by some Capitaines,it hath been used to make theim with the fronte, like unto a wedge,judgyng to bee able by soche meane, more easely to open the enemiesarmie. Against this facion, thei have used to make a facion like unto apaire of sheres, to be able betwene thesame voide place, to receive thatwedge, and to compasse it about, and to faight with it on every side:whereupon I will that you take this generall rule, that the greatestremedie that is used againste a devise of the enemie, is to dooewillingly thesame, whiche he hath devised that thou shalt dooe perforce:bicause that doyng it willingly, thou doest it with order, and with thyadvauntage, and his disadvauntage, if thou shouldest doe it beynginforced, it should be thy undoyng: For the provyng whereof, I care notto reherse unto you, certain thynges alredy tolde. The adversary makeththe wedge to open thy bandes: if thou gowest with them open, thoudisorderest hym, and he disordereth not thee. Aniball set the Elephantesin the fronte of his armie, to open with theim the armie of Scipio.Scipio went with it open, and it was the occasion of his victorie, andof the ruine of hym. Asdruball placed his strongest men in the middestof the fronte of his armie, to overthrowe Scipios menne: Scipiocommaunded, that by them selves thei should retire and he broke theim:So that like devises when thei are foreseen, bee the causes of thevictorie of him, against whom thei be prepared. There remaineth me also,if I remember my self well, to tell you what respectes a Capitaine oughtto have, before he leade his men to faight: upon whiche I have to tellyou firste, how a capitaine ought never to faight a battaile, except hehave advauntage, or be constrained. The vantage groweth of thesituacion, of the order, of havyng more, or better menne: the necessitiegroweth when thou seest how that not faightyng, thou muste in any wiselose, as should bee for lackyng of money, and for this, thy armie to beeready all maner of waies to resolve, where famishemente is ready toassaulte thee, where the enemie looketh to bee ingrosed with newe men:in these cases, thou oughtest alwaies to faight, although with thydisadvauntage: for that it is moche better to attempte fortune, whereshe maie favour thee, then not attemptyng, to see thy certaine ruine:and it is as grevous a faulte in this case, in a capitain not to faight,as to have had occasion to overcome, and not to have either knowen itthrough ignoraunce, or lefte it through vilenesse. The advauntages sometymes the enemie giveth thee, and some tymes thy prudence: Many inpassyng Rivers have been broken of their enemie, that hath been awarethereof, whom hath taried, till the one halfe hath been of the one side,and the other halfe on the other, and then hath assaulted them: as Cesardid to the Suizzers, where he destroied the fowerth parte of theim,through beyng halfe over a river. Some tyme thy enemie is founde wearie,for havyng folowed thee to undescritely, so that findyng thy self fresheand lustie, thou oughtest not to let passe soche an occasion: besidesthis, if the enemie offer unto thee in the mornyng betymes to faight,thou maiest a good while deferre to issue out of thy lodgyng, and whenhe hath stoode long in armour, and that he hath loste that same firsteheate, with the whiche he came, thou maiest then faight with him. Thiswaie Scipio and Metellus used in Spaine: the one against Asdruball, theother against Sertorius. If the enemie be deminished of power, eitherfor havyng devided the armie, as the Scipions in Spain, or for someother occasion, thou oughteste to prove chaunce. The greateste parte ofprudent capitaines, rather receive the violence of the enemies, then gowith violence to assalte them: for that the furie is easely withstoodeof sure and steddie menne, and the furie beyng sustained, convertethlightly into vilenesse: Thus Fabius did againste the Sannites, andagainst the Galles, and was victorious and his felowe Decius remainedslain. Some fearing the power of their enemies, have begun the faight alittle before night, to the intent that their men chaunsyng to beeovercome, might then by the helpe of the darkenesse thereof, save theimselves. Some havyng knowen, how the enemies armie beyng taken ofcertaine supersticion, not to faight in soche a tyme, have chosenthesame tyme to faighte, and overcome: The whiche Cesar observed inFraunce, againste Arionistus, and Vespasian in Surrie, againste theJewes. The greatest and moste importaunte advertismente, that acapitaine ought to have, is to have aboute hym faithfull menne, that arewise and moste expert in the warre, with whom he must continuallyconsulte and reason of his men, and of those of the enemies, whiche isthe greater nomber, whiche is beste armed, or beste on horsebacke, orbest exercised, whiche be moste apte to suffer necessitie, in whom hetrusteth moste, either in the footemen, or in the horsemen: after theiought to consider the place where thei be, and whether it be more to thepurpose for thenemie, then for him: which of theim hath victualles mostecommodious: whether it be good to deferre the battaile, or to faight it:what good might bee given hym, or taken awaie by tyme: for that manytymes, souldiours seyng the warre to be delaied, are greved, and beyngwearie, in the pain and in the tediousnesse therof, wil forsake thee. Itimporteth above all thyng, to knowe the capitain of the enemies, andwhom he hath aboute hym, whether he be rashe, or politike, whether he befearfull, or hardie: to see how thou maiest truste upon the aidyngsouldiours. And above all thyng thou oughtest to take hede, not toconducte the armie to faight when it feareth, or when in any wise itmistrusteth of the victorie: for that the greatest signe to lose, isthei beleve not to be able to winne: and therfore in this case, thououghtest to avoide the faightyng of the fielde, either with doyng asFabius Maximus, whom incampyng in strong places, gave no courage toAniball, to goe to finde hym, or when thou shouldest thinke, that theenemie also in strong places, would come to finde thee, to departe outof the fielde, and to devide the menne into thy tounes to thentent thattediousnesse of winnyng them, maie wearie hym.ZANOBI. Cannot the faightyng of the battaile be otherwise avoided, thenin devidyng the armie in sunderie partes and placyng the men in tounes?[Sidenote: Fabius Maximus.]FABRICIO. I beleve that ones alreadie, with some of you I have reasoned,how that he, that is in the field, cannot avoide to faight the battaile,when he hath an enemie, which will faight with hym in any wise, and hehath not, but one remedie, and that is, to place him self with his armiedistant fiftie miles at leaste, from his adversarie, to be able betymesto avoide him, when he should go to finde hym. For Fabius Maximus neveravoided to faight the battaile with Aniball, but he would have it withhis advauntage: and Aniball did not presume to bee able to overcome hym,goyng to finde hym in the places where he incamped: where if he hadpresupposed, to have been able to have overcome, it had been convenientefor Fabius, to have fought the battaile with hym, or to have avoided.[Sidenote: Philip king of Macedonia, overcome by the Romaines; HowCingentorige avoided the faightyng of the fielde with Cesar; Theignorance of the Venecians; What is to be doen wher soldiours desire tofaight, contrary to their capitaines minde; How to incourage souldiers;An advertisment to make the soldiour most obstinately to faight.]Philip Kyng of Macedonia, thesame that was father to Perse, commyng towarre with the Romaines, pitched his campe upon a verie high hill, tothe entent not to faight with theim: but the Romaines wente to find hymon thesame hill, and discomfaited hym. Cingentorige capitain of theFrenche menne, for that he would not faight the field with Cesar, whomcontrarie to his opinion, had passed a river, got awaie many miles withhis men. The Venecians in our tyme, if thei would not have come to havefought with the Frenche kyng, thei ought not to have taried till theFrenche armie, had passed the River Addus, but to have gotten from themas Cingentorige, where thei havyng taried knewe not how to take in thepassyng of the men, the occasion to faight the battaile, nor to avoideit: For that the Frenche men beyng nere unto them, as the Venecians wentout of their Campe, assaulted theim, and discomfited theim: so it is,that the battaile cannot bee avoided, when the enemie in any wise willfaight, nor let no man alledge Fabius, for that so moche in thesamecase, he did flie the daie of battaile, as Aniball. It happeneth manytymes, that thy souldiours be willyng to faight, and thou knoweste bythe nomber, and by the situacion, or for some other occasion to havedisadvauntage, and desirest to make them chaunge from this desire: ithappeneth also, that necessitie, or occasion, constraineth thee tofaight, and that thy souldiours are evill to be trusted, and smallydisposed to faight: where it is necessarie in thone case, to make theimafraied, and in the other to incourage theim: In the firste case, whenperswacions suffiseth not, there is no better waie, then to give inpraie, a part of them unto thenemie, to thintent those that have, andthose that have not fought, maie beleve thee: and it may very wel bedoen with art, thesame which to Fabius Maximus hapned by chaunce.Tharmie of Fabius (as you knowe) desired to faight with Aniballs armie:the very same desire had the master of his horses: to Fabius it semednot good, to attempte the faight: so that through soche contraryopinions, he was fain to devide the armie: Fabius kept his men in thecampe, the other fought, and commyng into great perill, had beenoverthrowen, if Fabius had not rescued him: by the whiche insample themaister of the horse, together with all the armie, knewe how it was awise waie to obeie Fabius. Concernyng to incourage theim to faight, itshould be well doen, to make them to disdain the enemies, shewyng howthei speake slaunderous woordes of them, to declare to have intelligencewith them, and to have corrupted part of them, to incampe in place,where thei maie see the enemies, and make some light skirmishe withthem, for that the thyng that is dailie seen, with more facilitie isdespised: to shewe theim to bee unworthie, and with an oracion for thepurpose, to reprehende them of their cowardnesse, and for to make themashamed, to tell theim that you will faight alone, when thei will notbeare you companie. And you ought above all thyng to have thisadvertismente, mindyng to make the Souldiour obstinate to faight, not topermitte, that thei maie send home any of their substaunce, or to leaveit in any place, till the warre bee ended, that thei maie understande,that although fliyng save their life, yet it saveth not theim theirgoodes, the love whereof, is wonte no lesse then thesame, to make menobstinate in defence.ZANOBI.

TO perswade, or to diswade a thyng unto fewe, is verie easie,for that if woordes suffise not, you maie then use aucthoritie andforce: but the difficultie is, to remove from a multitude an evillopinion, and that whiche is contrary either to the common profite, or tothy opinion, where cannot be used but woordes, the whiche is meete thatthei be heard of every man, mindyng to perswade them all. Wherfore, itwas requisite that the excellente Capitaines were oratours: for thatwithout knowyng how to speake to al the army, with difficultie maie bewrought any good thing: the whiche altogether in this our tyme is laiedaside. Rede the life of Alexander Magnus, and you shall see how manytymes it was necessarie for hym to perswade, and to speake publikly tohis armie: otherwise he should never have brought theim, beyng becomeriche, and full of spoile, through the desertes of Arabia, and intoIndia with so moche his disease, and trouble: for that infinite tymesthere growe thynges, wherby an armie ruinateth, when the capitain eitherknoweth not, or useth not to speake unto thesame, for that this speakyngtaketh awaie feare, in courageth the mindes, increaseth the obstinatenesto faight, discovereth the deceiptes, promiseth rewardes, sheweth theperilles, and the waie to avoide theim, reprehendeth, praieth,threatened, filleth full of hope, praise, shame, and doeth a11 thosethynges, by the whiche the humaine passions are extincte or kendled:wherefore, that prince, or common weale, whiche should appoincte to makea newe power, and cause reputacion to their armie, ought to accustomethe Souldiours thereof, to heare the capitain to speake, and thecapitain to know how to speake unto them. In kepyng desposed thesouldiours in old tyme, to faight for their countrie, the religionavailed moche, and the othes whiche thei gave them, when thei led theimto warfare: for as moche as in al their faultes, thei threatned them notonely with those punishementes, whiche might be feared of men but withthose whiche of God might be looked for: the whiche thyng mingled withthe other Religious maners, made many tymes easie to the auncientcapitaines all enterprises, and will doe alwaies, where religion shallbe feared, and observed. Sertorius prevailed, by declaryng that he spakewith a Stagge, the whiche in Goddes parte, promised hym the victorie.Silla saied, he spoke with an Image, whiche he had taken out of theTemple of Apollo. Many have tolde how God hath appered unto them intheir slepe, whom hath admonished them to faight. In our fathers time,Charles the seventh kyng of Fraunce, in the warre whiche he madeagainste the Englishemen, saied, he counsailed with a maide, sent fromGod, who was called every where the Damosell of Fraunce, the which wasoccacion of his victorie. There maie be also used meanes, that maie makethy men to esteme little the enemie, as Agesilao a Spartaine used, whomshewed to his souldiours, certain Persians naked, to the intent thatseyng their delicate members, thei should not have cause to feare them.Some have constrained their men to faight through necessitie, takyngawaie from them all hope of savyng theim selves, savyng in overcommyng.The whiche is the strongest, and the beste provision that is made, topurpose to make the souldiour obstinate to faight: whiche obstinatenesseis increased by the confidence, and love of the Capitaine, or of thecountrie. Confidence is caused through the armour, the order the latevictorie, and the opinion of the Capitaine. The love of the countrie, iscaused of nature: that of the Capitain, through vertue, more then by anyother benefite: the necessities maie be many, but that is strongest,whiche constraineth thee; either to overcome, or to dye.THE FIVETH BOOKE[Sidenote: How the Romaines marched with their armies; How the Romainesordered their armie when it happened to be assaulted on the waie; Howthe main battailes ought to marche; The orderyng of an armie after sochesorte, that it maie marche safelie through the enemies countrie and bealwaies in a redines to faight; The place in the armie wher the bowmenand Harkabutters are appoincted; The place in the armie wherthextraordinarie Pikes are appoincted.

I have shewed you, how an armi, is ordained to faight a fieldewith an other armie, which is seen pitched against it, and have declaredunto you, howe the same is overcome, and after many circumstaunces, Ihave likewise shewed you, what divers chaunces, maie happen aboutthesame, so that me thinkes tyme to shewe you now, how an armie isordered, againste thesame enemie, whiche otherwise is not seen, butcontinually feared, that he assaulte thee: this happeneth when an armiemarcheth through the enemies countrie, or through suspected places.Firste, you must understande, how a Romaine armie, sent alwaiesordinarely afore, certaine bandes of horsemen, as spies of the waie:after followed the right horne, after this, came all the carriages,whiche to thesame apperteined, after this, came a Legion, after it, thecarriages therof, after that, an other legion, and next to it, theircarriages, after whiche, came the left horne, with the carriages thereofat their backe, and in the laste part, folowed the remnaunte of thechivalrie: this was in effecte the maner, with whiche ordinarily theimarched: and if it happened that the armie were assaulted in the waie onthe fronte, or on the backe, thei made straight waie all the carriagesto bee drawen, either on the right, or on the lefte side, accordyng aschaunsed, or as thei could beste, havyng respecte to the situacion: andall the men together free from their impedimentes, made hedde on thatparte, where the enemie came. If thei were assaulted on the flancke,thei drue the carriages towardes thesame parte that was safe, and of theother, thei made hedde. This waie beyng well and prudently governed, Ihave thought meete to imitate, sending afore the light horsemen, asexploratours of the Countrie: Then havyng fower maine battailes I wouldmake them to marche in araie, and every one with their carriagesfolowyng theim. And for that there be twoo sortes of carriages, that ispartainyng to particulare souldiours, and partainyng to the publike useof all the Campe, I would devide the publike Carriages into fowerpartes, and to every maine battaile, I would appoinct his parte,deviding also the artillerie into fower partes, and all the unarmed, sothat every nomber of armed menne, should equally have theirimpedimentes. But bicause it happeneth some times, that thei marchethrough the countrie, not onely suspected, but so daungerous, that thoufearest every hower to be assaulted, thou art constrained for to go moresure, to chaunge the forme of marchyng, and to goe in soche wiseprepared, that neither the countrie menne, nor any armie, maie hurtethee, findyng thee in any parte unprovided. In soche case, the auncientecapitaines were wont, to marche with the armie quadrante, whiche so theicalled this forme, not for that it was altogether quadrante, but forthat it was apte to faight of fower partes, and thei saied, that theiwente prepared, bothe for the waie, and for the faight: from whichewaie, I will not digresse, and I will ordaine my twoo maine battailes,whiche I have taken for to make an armie of, to this effect. Mindyngtherefore, to marche safely through the enemies Countrie, and to beeable to aunswere hym on every side, when at unwares the armie mightchaunce to be assaulted, and intendyng therefore, accordyng to theantiquitie, to bryng thesame into a square, I would devise to make aquadrant, that the rome therof should be of space on every part Clix.yardes, in this maner. First I would put the flanckes, distant the oneflanck from the other, Clix. yardes, and I would place five battailesfor a flancke, in a raie in length, and distant the one from the other,twoo yardes and a quarter: the whiche shall occupie with their spaces,every battaile occupiyng thirtie yardes, Clix. yardes. Then betwen thehedde and the taile of these two flanckes, I would place the other tennebattailes, in every parte five, orderyng them after soche sorte, thatfower should joyne to the hedde of the right flanck, and fower to thetaile of the lefte flancke, leaving betwene every one of them, adistance of thre yardes: one should after joyne to the hedde of thelefte flancke, and one to the taile of the right flancke: and for thatthe space that is betwene the one flancke and the other, is Clix.yardes, and these battailes whiche are set the one to the side of theother by breadth, and not by length, will come to occupie with thedistaunces one hundred yardes and a halfe yarde, there shall comebetwene theim fower battailes, placed in the fronte on the rightflancke, and the one placed in thesame on the lefte, to remaine a spaceof fiftie and eighte yardes and a halfe, and the verie same space willcome to remaine in the battailes, placed in the hinder parte: nor thereshall bee no difference, saving that the one space shall come on theparte behind towardes the right horne, and thother shall come on theparte afore, towardes the lefte home. In the space of the lviii. yardesand a halfe before, I would place all the ordinarie Veliti, in thesamebehinde, the extraordinarie, which wil come to be a thousande for aspace, and mindyng to have the space that ought to be within the armie,to be every waie Clix. yardes, it is mete that the five battailes,whiche are placed in the hedde, and those whiche are placed in thetaile, occupie not any parte of the space, whiche the flanckes keepe:and therefore it shall be convenient, that the five battailes behinde,doe touche with the fronte, the taile of their flanckes, and thoseafore, with the taile to touche he hedde, after soche sorte, that uponevery corner of the ame armie, there maie remaine a space, to receive another battaile: and for that there bee fower spaces, I would take fowerbandes of the extraordinarie Pikes, and in every corner I would placeone, and the twoo Ansignes of the foresaied Pikes, whiche shall remainoverplus, I would sette in the middest of the rome of this armie, in asquare battaile, on the hedde whereof, should stande the generallcapitaine, with his menne about him. And for that these battailesordeined thus, marche all one waie, but faight not all one waie, inputtyng them together, those sides ought to be ordained to faight,whiche are not defended of thother battailes. And therfore it ought tobe considered, that the five battailes that be in the front, have alltheir other partes defended, excepte the fronte: and therfore theseought to bee put together in good order, and with the Pikes afore. Thefive battailes whiche are behinde, have all their sides defended, exceptthe parte behinde, and therefore those ought to bee put together insoche wise, that the Pikes come behind, as in the place therof we shallshewe. The five battailes that bee in the right flancke, have all theirsides defended, except the right flancke. The five that be on the leftflanck, have all their partes defended, excepte the lefte flancke: andtherefore in orderyng the battailes, thei ought to bee made, that thePikes maie tourne on the same flanck, that lieth open: and thePeticapitaines to stand on the hedde, and on the taile, so that nedyngto faight, all the armour and weapons maie be in their due places, thewaie to doe this, is declared where we reasoned of the maner of orderyngthe battailes. The artillerie I would devide, and one parte I wouldplace without, on the lefte flancke, and the other on the right. Thelight horsemen, I would sende afore to discover the countrie. Of themenne of armes, I would place part behinde, on the right home, and parteon the lefte, distante about thirtie yardes from the battailes: andconcerning horse, you have to take this for a general rule in everycondicion, where you ordaine an armie, that alwaies thei ought to beput, either behinde, or on the flanckes of thesame: he that putteth themafore, over against the armie, it behoveth hym to doe one of these twoothinges, either that he put them so moche afore, that beyng repulced,thei maie have so moche space, that maie give them tyme, to be able togo a side from thy footemen, and not to runne upon them, or to orderthem in soche wise, with so many spaces, that the horses by those maieenter betwene them, without disorderyng them. Nor let no man estemelittle this remembraunce, for as moche as many capitaines, whom havyngtaken no hede thereof, have been ruinated, and by themselves have beendisordered, and broken. The carriages and the unarmed menne are placed,in the rome that remaineth within the armie, and in soche sorte equallydevided, that thei maie give the waie easely, to whom so ever would go,either from the one corner to the other, or from the one hedde, to theother of the armie. These battailes without the artillerie and thehorse, occupie every waie from the utter side, twoo hundred and elevenyardes and a halfe of space: and bicause this quadrante is made of twoomain battailes, it is convenient to distinguishe, what part thone mainebattaile maketh, and what the other: and for that the main battailes arecalled by the nomber, and every of theim hath (as you knowe) tennebattailes, and a generall hed, I would cause that the first mainbattaile, should set the first v. battailes therof in the front, theother five, in the left flanck, and the capitain of the same shouldstande in the left corner of the front. The seconde maine battaile,should then put the firste five battailes therof, in the right flanck,and the other five in the taile, and the hedde capitain of thesame,should stande in the right corner, whom should come to dooe the officeof the Tergiductor. The armie ordained in this maner, ought to be madeto move, and in the marchyng, to observe all this order, and withoutdoubte, it is sure from all the tumultes of the countrie men. Nor thecapitain ought not to make other provision, to the tumultuarieassaultes, then to give sometyme Commission to some horse, or Ansigne ofVeliti, that thei set themselves in order: nor it shall never happenthat these tumultuous people, will come to finde thee at the drawyng ofthe swerd, or pikes poincte: for that men out of order, have feare ofthose that be in araie: and alwaies it shall bee seen, that with criesand rumours, thei will make a greate assaulte, without otherwise commyngnere unto thee, like unto barking curres aboute a Mastie. Aniball whenhe came to the hurte of the Romaines into Italie, he passed through allFraunce, and alwaies of the Frenche tumultes, he took small regarde.Mindyng to marche, it is conveniente to have plainers and labourersafore, whom maie make thee the waie plaine, whiche shall bee garded ofthose horsemen, that are sent afore to viewe the countrie: an armie inthis order maie marche tenne mile the daie, and shall have tyme inoughto incampe, and suppe before Sunne goyng doune, for that ordinarely, anarmie maie marche twentie mile: if it happen that thou be assaulted, ofan armie set in order, this assaulte cannot growe sodainly: for that anarmie in order, commeth with his pace, so that thou maiest have tymeinough, to set thy self in order to faight the field, and reduce thymenne quickly into thesame facion, or like to thesame facion of anarmie, which afore is shewed thee. For that if thou be assaulted, on theparte afore, thou needeste not but to cause, that the artillerie that beon the flanckes, and the horse that be behinde, to come before, andplace theimselves in those places, and with those distaunces, as aforeis declared. The thousande Veliti that bee before, must go out of theirplace, and be devided into CCCCC. for a parte, and go into their place,betwene the horse and the hornes of tharmy: then in the voide place thatthei shal leave, the twoo Ansignes of the extraordinarie Pikes musteentre, whiche I did set in the middest of the quadrante of the armie.The thousande Veliti, whiche I placed behinde, must departe from thesameplace, and devide them selves in the flanckes of the battailes, to thefortificacion of those: and by the open place that thei shal leave, allthe carriages and unarmed menne must go out, and place themselves on thebacke of the battaile. Then the rome in the middeste beyng voided, andevery man gone to his place: the five battailes, whiche I placed behindeon the armie, must make forward in the voide place, that is betwene theone and the other flanck, and marche towardes the battailes, that standin the hedde, and three of theim, muste stande within thirtie yardes ofthose, with equall distances, betwene the one and the other, and theother twoo shal remain behinde, distaunte other thirtie yardes: thewhiche facion maie bee ordained in a sodaine, and commeth almoste to beelike, unto the firste disposicion, whiche of tharmy afore we shewed. Andthough it come straighter in the fronte, it commeth grosser in theflanckes, whiche giveth it no lesse strength: but bicause the fivebattailes, that be in the taile, have the Pikes on the hinder parte, forthe occasion that before we have declared, it is necessarie to maketheim to come on the parte afore, mindyng to have theim to make a backeto the front of tharmie: and therfore it behoveth either to make them totourne battaile after battaile, as a whole body, or to make them quicklyto enter betwen thorders of targettes, and conduct them afore, thewhiche waie is more spedy, and of lesse disorder, then to make them toturn al together: and so thou oughtest to doe of all those, whicheremain behind in every condicion of assault, as I shal shewe you. If itappere that thenemie come on the part behinde, the first thyng thatought to bee dooen, is to cause that every man tourne his face where hisbacke stode, and straight waie tharmie cometh to have made of taile,hed, and of hed taile: then al those waies ought to be kept, in orderyngthesame fronte, as I tolde afore. If the enemie come to incounter theright flancke, the face of thy armie ought to bee made to tournetowardes thesame side: after, make all those thynges in fortificacion ofthesame hedde, whiche above is saied, so that the horsemen, the Veliti,and the artillerie, maie be in places conformable to the hed thereof:onely you have this difference, that in variyng the hed of those, whichare transposed, some have to go more, and some lesse. In deede makynghedde of the right flancke, the Veliti ought to enter in the spaces,that bee betwene the horne of the armie, and those horse, whiche werenerest to the lefte flancke, in whose place ought to enter, the twooAnsignes of the extraordinarie Pikes, placed in the middest: But firstethe carriages and the unarmed, shall goe out by the open place, avoidyngthe rome in the middest, and retiryng themselves behinde the lefteflancke, whiche shall come to bee then the taile of the armie: the otherVeliti that were placed in the taile, accordyng to the principallorderyng of the armie, in this case, shall not move: Bicause the sameplace should not remaine open, whiche of taile shall come to be flancke:all other thyng ought to bee dooen, as in orderyng of the firste heddeis saied: this that is told about the makyng hed of the right flanck,must be understode to be told, havyng nede to make it of the leftflanck: for that the very same order ought to bee observed. If theenemie should come grose, and in order to assaulte thee on twoo sides,those twoo sides, whiche he commeth to assaulte thee on, ought to beemade stronge with the other twoo sides, that are not assaulted, doublyngthe orders in eche of theim, and devidyng for bothe partes theartillerie, the Veliti, and the horse. If he come on three or on fowersides, it is necessarie that either thou or he lacke prudence: for thatif thou shalt bee wise, thou wilte never putte thy self in place, thatthe enemie on three or fower sides, with a greate nomber of men, and inorder, maie assault thee: for that mindyng, safely to hurte thee, it isrequisit, that he be so great, that on every side, he maie assault thee,with as many men, as thou haste almoste in al thy army: and if thou beso unwise, that thou put thy self in the daunger and force of an enemie,whom hath three tymes more menne ordained then thou, if thou catchehurte, thou canste blame no man but thy self: if it happen not throughthy faulte, but throughe some mischaunce, the hurt shall be without theshame, and it shal chaunce unto thee, as unto the Scipions in Spaine,and to Asdruball in Italie but if the enemie have not many more men thenthou, and intende for to disorder thee, to assaulte thee on diverssides, it shal be his foolishnesse, and thy good fortune: for as mocheas to doe so, it is convenient, that he become so thinne in soche wise,that then easely thou maiste overthrow one bande, and withstande another, and in short time ruinate him: this maner of ordering an armieagainst an enemie, whiche is not seen, but whiche is feared, is anecessarie and a profitable thing, to accustome thy souldiours, to putthemselves together, and to march with soche order, and in marchyng, toorder theimselves to faight, accordyng to the first hedde, and after toretourne in the forme, that thei marched in, then to make hedde of thetaile, after, of the flanckes, from these, to retourne into the firstfacion: the whiche exercises and uses bee necessarie, mindyng to have anarmie, throughly instructed and practised: in whiche thyng the Princesand the capitaines, ought to take paine. Nor the discipline of warre isno other, then to knowe how to commaunde, and to execute these thynges.Nor an instructed armie is no other, then an armie that is wel practisedin these orders: nor it cannot be possible, that who so ever in thistime, should use like disciplin shall ever bee broken. And if thisquadrante forme whiche I have shewed you, is somewhat difficulte, sochedifficultnesse is necessarie, takyng it for an exercise: for as moche asknowyng well, how to set theim selves in order, and to maintaine theimselves in the same, thei shall knowe after more easely, how to stand inthose, whiche should not have so moche difficultie.ZANOBI. I beleve as you saie, that these orders bee verie necessarie,and I for my parte, knowe not what to adde or take from it: true it is,that I desire to know of you twoo thynges, the one, if when you willmake of the taile, or of the flancke hedde, and would make them totourne, whether this be commaunded by the voice, or with the sounde:thother, whether those that you sende afore, to make plain the waie, forthe armie to marche, ought to be of the verie same souldiours of yourbattailes, or other vile menne appoincted, to like exercise.[Sidenote: Commaundementes of Capitaines being not wel understoode, maiebe the destruction of an armie; Respect that is to be had incommaundementes made with the sounde of the Trompet; In commaundmentesmade with the voice, what respect is to be had; Of Pianars.]FABRICIO. Your firste question importeth moche: for that many tymes thecommaundementes of Capitaines, beyng not well understoode, or evillinterpreted, have disordered their armie: therfore the voices, with thewhiche thei commaunde in perilles, ought to bee cleare, and nete. And ifthou commaunde with the sounde, it is convenient to make, that betwenethe one waie and the other, there be so moche difference, that the onecannot be chaunged for the other: and if thou commaundest with thevoice, thou oughteste to take heede, that thou flie the general voices,and to use the particulares, and of the particulars, to flie those,whiche maie be interpreted sinisterly. Many tymes the saiyng backe,backe, hath made to ruinate an armie; therfore this voice ought not tobe used, but in steede therof to use, retire you. If you will make theimto tourne, for to chaunge the hedde, either to flanck, or to backe, usenever to saie tourne you, but saie to the lefte, to the right, to thebacke, to the front: thus all the other voices ought to be simple, andnete, as thrust on, march, stande stronge, forwarde, retourne you: andall those thynges, whiche maie bee dooen with the voice, thei doe, theother is dooen with the sounde. Concernyng those menne, that must makethe waies plaine for the armie to marche, whiche is your secondequestion, I would cause my owne souldiours to dooe this office, as wellbicause in the aunciente warfare thei did so, as also for that thereshould be in the armie, lesser nomber of unarmed men, and lesseimpedimentes: and I would choose out of every battaile, thesame nomberthat should nede, and I would make theim to take the instrumentes, meeteto plaine the grounde withall, and their weapons to leave with thoserankes, that should bee nereste them, who should carrie them, and theenemie commyng, thei shall have no other to doe, then to take themagain, and to retourne into their araie.ZANOBI.

I doubte whether you should ever brynge these our souldiours, tolabour with Shovell or Mattocke, after soche sorte.[Sidenote: The victualles that thantiquitie made provision of, for theirarmies.]FABRICIO. All these thynges shall bee reasoned in the place thereof, butnow I will let alone this parte, and reason of the maner of thevictualing of the armie: for that me thinketh, havyng so mochetraivailed theim, it is tyme to refreshe them, and to comfort them withmeate. You have to understande, that a Prince ought to ordaine hisarmie, as expedite as is possible, and take from thesame all thosethynges, whiche maie cause any trouble or burthen unto it, and make untohym any enterprise difficulte. Emongest those thynges that causeth mostedifficultie, is to be constrained to keepe the armie provided of wine,and baked bread. The antiquitie cared not for Wine, for that lackyng it,thei dranke water, mingeled with a little vinegre, to give it a taste:For whiche cause, emong the municions of victualles for the hoste,vineger was one, and not wine. Thei baked not the breade in Ovens, asthei use for Citees, but thei provided the Meale, and of thesame, everySouldiour after his owne maner, satisfied hym self, havyng forcondimente Larde and Baken, the whiche made the breade saverie, thatthei made, and maintained theim strong, so that the provision ofvictualles for the armie, was Meale, Vineger, Larde, and Bacon, and forthe horses Barley. Thei had ordinarely heardes of greate beastes andsmall, whiche folowed the armie, the whiche havyng no nede to beecarried, caused not moche impedimente. Of this order there grewe, thatan armie in old time, marched somtymes many daies through solitarieplaces, and difficulte, without sufferyng disease of victualles: forthat thei lived of thyngs, whiche easely thei might convey after them.To the contrarie it happeneth in the armies, that are now a daies,whiche mindyng not to lacke wine, and to eate baked breade in thesamemaner, as when thei are at home, whereof beyng not able to makeprovision long, thei remaine often tymes famished, or though thei beprovided, it is dooen with disease, and with moste greate coste:therfore I would reduce my armie to this maner of living: and I wouldnot that thei should eate other bread, then that, which by themselvesthei should bake. Concernyng wine, I would not prohibite the drinkyngthereof, nor yet the commyng of it into the armie, but I would not useindevour, nor any labour for to have it, and in the other provisions, Iwould governe my self altogether, like unto the antiquitie: the whichething, if you consider well, you shall see how moche difficultie istaken awaie, and how moche trouble and disease, an armie and a capitaineis avoided of, and how moche commoditie shall bee given, to what so everenterprise is to bee dooen.ZANOBI. We have overcome thenemie in the field, marched afterward uponhis countrie, reason would, that spoiles be made, tounes sacked,prisoners taken, therefore I would knowe how the antiquitie in thesethynges, governed them selves.[Sidenote: The occasions why the warres made nowe adaies, doeimpoverishe the conquerors as well as the conquered; The order that theRomaines toke, concerning the spoile and the booties that theirsouldiours gotte; An order that the antiquitie tooke, concernyng theirsoldiours wages.]FABRICIO. Beholde, I will satisfie you. I beleve you have considered,for that once alredie with some of you I have reasoned, howe thesepresent warres, impoverishe as well those lordes that overcome, as thosethat leese: for that if the one leese his estate, the other leeseth hismoney, and his movables: the whiche in olde time was not, for that theconquerour of the warre, waxed ritche. This groweth of keepyng no comptein these daies of the spoiles, as in olde tyme thei did, but thei leaveit to the discreacion of the souldiours. This manner maketh twoo mostegreat disorders: the one, that whiche I have tolde: the other that thesouldiour becometh more covetous to spoyle, and lesse observeth theorders: and manie times it hath been seen, howe the covetousnesse of thepraye, hath made those to leese, whome were victorious. Therefore theRomaines whiche were princes of armies, provided to the one and to theother of these inconvenienses, ordainyng that all the spoyle shouldapertaine to the publicke, and that the publicke after should bestoweit, as shoulde be thought good: and therfore thei had in tharmie thequestours, whom were as we would say, the chamberlaines, to whose chargeall the spoyle and booties were committed: whereof the consull wasserved to geve the ordinarie pay to the souldiours, to succour thewounded, and the sicke, and for the other businesse of the armie. Theconsull might well, and he used it often, to graunte a spoyle tosoldiours: but this grauntyng, made no disorder: for that the armiebeyng broken all the pray was put in the middest, and distributed byhedde, accordyng to the qualitee of everie man: the which maner theiconstituted, to thintente, that the soldiours should attend to overcome,and not to robbe: and the Romaine Legions overcame the enemies, andfolowed them not, for that thei never departed from their orders: onelythere folowed them, the horsemenne with those that were light armed, andif there were any other souldiours then those of the legions, theylikewyse pursued the chase. Where if the spoyle shoulde have ben histhat gotte it, it had not ben possible nor reasonable, to have kepte thelegions steddie, and to withstonde manie perils; hereby grewe therefore,that the common weale inritched, and every Consull carried with histriumphe into the treasurie, muche treasure, whiche all was of bootiesand spoiles. An other thing the antiquetie did upon good consideration,that of the wages, whiche they gave to every souldiour, the thirde partethey woulde shoulde be laied up nexte to him, whome carried the ansigneof their bande, whiche never gave it them againe, before the warre wasended: this thei did, beyng moved of twoo reasons, the first was tothintente, that the souldiour should thrive by his wages, because thegreatest parte of them beyng yonge men, and carelesse, the more theihave, so muche the more without neede thei spende, the other cause was,for that knowyng, that their movabelles were nexte to the ansigne, theishould be constrained to have more care thereof, and with moreobstinatenesse to defende it: and this made them stronge and to holdetogether: all which thynges is necessarie to observe, purposinge toreduce the exercise of armes unto the intier perfection therof.ZANOBI. I beleeve that it is not possible, that to an armie thatmarcheth from place to place, there fal not perrilous accidentes, wherethe industerie of the capitaine is needefull, and the worthinesse of thesouldiours, mindyng to avoyde them. Therefore I woulde be glad, that youremembring any, would shew them.[Sidenote: Captaines mai incurre the daunger of ambusshes twoo maner ofwayes; How to avoide the perill of ambusshes; Howe ambusshes have benperceived; Howe the Capitaine of the enemies ought to be esteemed; Wheremen be in greatest perill; The description of the countrey where an armymuste marche, is most requiset for a Capitaine to have; A mostprofitable thyng it is for a capitayne to be secrete in all hisaffaires; An advertisment concernyng the marchyng of an armie; Themarching of an armie ought to be ruled by the stroke of the Drumme; Thecondicion of the enemie ought to be considered.]FABRICIO. I shall contente you with a good will, beyng inespetiallynecessarie, intendyng to make of this exercise a perfecte science. TheCapitaines ought above all other thynges, whileste thei marche with anarmie, to take heede of ambusshes, wherein they incurre daunger twoowaies, either marchynge thou entrest into them, or thoroughe crafte ofthe enemie thou arte trained in before thou arte aware. In the firstcase, mindyng to avoide suche perill, it is necessarie to sende aforedouble warde, whome may discover the countrey, and so muche the moredilligence ought to be used, the more that the countrey is apte forambusshes, as be the woddie or hilly countries, for that alwaies thei belayd either in a wodde, or behind a hille: and as the ambusshe notforseene, doeth ruin thee, so forseyng the same, it cannot hurte thee.Manie tymes birdes or muche duste have discovered the enemie: for thatalwayes where the enemie cometh to finde thee, he shall make greatduste, whiche shall signifie unto thee his comyng: so often tymes aCapitaine seyng in the places where he ought to passe, Doves to rise, orother of those birdes that flie in flockes, and to tourne aboute and notto light, hath knowen by the same the ambusshe of the enemies to bethere, and sendynge before his men, and sertainely understandyng it,hath saved him selfe and hurte his enemie. Concernyng the seconde case,to be trained in, (which these our men cal to be drawen to the shot)thou ought to take heede, not straight way to beleve those thinges,which are nothyng reasonable, that thei be as they seeme: as shoulde be,if the enemie should set afore thee a praie, thou oughtest to beleevethat in the same is the hooke, and that therin is hid the deceipte. Ifmany enemies be driven away by a fewe of thine, if a fewe enemiesassaulte manie of thine, if the enemies make a sodeine flight, and notstandynge with reason, alwaies thou oughtest in suche cases to fearedeceipte, and oughtest never to beleeve that the enemie knoweth not howto doe his businesse, but rather intendyng that he may begile thee thelesse, and mindyng to stand in lesse peril, the weaker that he is, andthe lesse craftier that the enemie is, so muche the more thou oughtestto esteeme him: and thou muste in this case use twoo sundrie poinctes,for that thou oughtest to feare him in thy minde and with the order, butwith wordes, and with other outewarde demonstracion, to seeme to dispysehim: because this laste way, maketh that the souldiours hope the more tohave the victorie: the other maketh thee more warie, and lesse apte tobe begyled. And thou hast to understand, that when men marche thoroughethe enemies countrey, they ar in muche more, and greater perils, then infayghtyng the fielde: and therefore the Capitaine in marchyng, ought touse double diligence: and the first thyng that he ought to doo, is toget described, and payncted oute all the countrie, thorough the which hemust marche, so that he maye know the places, the number, the distances,the waies, the hilles, the rivers, the fennes, and all the quallites ofthem: and to cause this to bee knowen, it is convenient to have with himdiversly, and in sundrie maners such men, as know the places, and toaske them with diligence, and to se whether their talke agree, andaccordyng to the agreyng therof, to note: he oughte also to sende aforethe horsemen, and with them prudente heddes, not so muche to discoverthe enemie, as to viewe the countrey, to se whether it agree with thedescription, and with the knowledge that they have of the same. Also theguydes that are sente, ought to be kepte with hope of rewarde, and feareof paine. And above all thynges it ought to be provided, that the armieknowe not to what businesse he leadeth them: for that there is nothyngin the warre more profitable, then to keepe secret the thynges that isto be dooen: and to thintente a suddeine assaulte dooe not trouble thysoldiours, thou oughteste to see them to stande reddie with theirweapons, because the thynges that ar provided for, offend lesse. Maniefor to avoyde the confusion of marchyng, have placed under thestanderde, the carriages, and the unarmed, and have commaunded them tofolow the same, to the intente that in marchyng needyng to staye, or toretire, they might dooe it more easely, which thyng as profitable, Ialowe very muche. Also in marchyng, advertismente ought to be had, thatthe one parte of the armie goe not a sunder from the other, or thatthoroughe some goyng fast, and some softe, the armie become not slender:the whiche thynges, be occation of dissorder: therfore the heddes mustebe placed in suche wise, that they may maintaine the pace even, causingto goe softe those that goe to fast, and to haste forward the other thatgoe to sloe, the whiche pace can not bee better ruled, then by thestroke of the drumme. The waies ought to be caused to be inlarged, sothat alwaies at least a bande of iiii. hundred men may marche in orderof battaile. The custome and the qualitie of the enemie ought to beconsidered, and whether that he wil assaulte thee either in the mornyng,or at none or in the evenynge, and whether he be more puisante withfotemen or horsemen, and accordyng as thou understandest, to ordeine andto provide for thy self. But let us come to some particular accidente.It hapneth sometime, that thou gettyng from the enemie, because thoujudgest thy selfe inferiour, and therfore mindynge not to faight withhim, and he comyng at thy backe, thou arivest at the banke of a river,passyng over the which, asketh time, so that the enemie is redie toovertake thee and to fayght with thee. Some, which chaunsing to bee insuche perill, have inclosed their armie on the hinder parte with adiche, and fillyng the same full of towe, and firyng it, have thenpassed with the armie without beyng able to be letted of the enemie, hebeyng by the same fire that was betwene them held backe.[Sidenote: Annone of Carthage.]ZANOBI. I am harde of beliefe, that this fyre coulde stay theim, inespecially because I remember that I have harde, howe Annone ofCarthage, beyng besieged of enemies, inclosed him selfe on the sameparte, with wodde, which he did set on fire where he purposed to makeeruption. Wherfore the enemies beyng not intentive on the same parte tolooke to him, he made his armie to passe over the same flame, causingevery man to holde his Target before his face for to defend them fromthe fire, and smoke.[Sidenote: Nabide a spartayne; Quintus Luttatius pollecie to passe overa river; How to passe a ryver without a bridge; A polecie of Cesar topasse a river, where his enemie beyng on the other side therof sought tolette hym.]FABRICIO. You saye well: but consider you howe I have saied, and howeAnnone did: for as muche as I saied that they made a diche, and filledit with towe, so that he, that woulde passe over the same, should beconstrained to contende with the diche and with fire: Annone made thefire, without the diche, and because he intended to passe over it, hemade it not great, for that otherwise without the diche, it shoulde haveletted him. Dooe you not knowe, that Nabide a Spartan beyng besieged inSparta of the Romaines, set fire on parte of his towne to let the way tothe Romaines, who alredie wer entred in? And by meane of the same flamenot onely hindered their way, but drave them oute: but let us turne toour matter. Quintus Luttatius a Romaine, havyng at his backe the Cimbri,and commyng to a river, to thentente the enemie should give him time topasse over, semed to geve time to them to faight with him: and therforehe fained that he would lodge there, and caused trenches to be made, andcertaine pavilions to be erected, and sent certayne horsemen into thecountrie for forredge: so that the Cimbrise beleevyng, that he incamped,they also incamped, and devided them selves into sundrie partes, toprovide for victuals, wherof Luttatius being aware, passed the riverthey beyng not able to let him. Some for to passe a river havynge nobridge, have devided it, and one parte they have turned behynde theirbackes, and the other then becomynge shalower, with ease they havepassed it: when the rivers be swift, purposyng to have their footemen topasse safely, they place their strongest horses on the higher side, thatthei may sustain the water, and an other parte be lowe that may succourthe men, if any of the river in passyng should be overcome with thewater: They passe also rivers, that be verie deepe, with bridges, withbotes, and with barrelles: and therfore it is good to have in aredinesse in an armie wherewith to be able to make all these thynges. Itfortuneth sometime that in passyng a river, the enemie standynge agaynstthee on the other banke, doeth let thee: to minde to overcome thisdifficultie, I know not a better insample to folow, then the same ofCesar, whome havynge his armie on the banke of a river in Fraunce, andhis passage beynge letted of Vergintorige a Frenche man, the whiche onthe other side of the river had his men, marched many daies a longe theriver, and the like did the enemie: wherfore Cesar incamping in a woddieplace, apte to hide men, he tooke out of every legion three cohortes,and made them to tarie in the same place, commaundynge theim that sosoone as he was departed, they shoulde caste over a bridge, and shouldfortefie it, and he with his other menne folowed on the waye: wherforeVergintorige seyng the number of the legions, thinkyng that there wasnot left anie parte of theim behinde, folowed also his way: but Cesarwhen he supposed that the bridge was made, tourned backewarde, andfindynge all thinges in order, passed the river without difficultee.ZANOBI.

The remedie is to make hardels of roddes whiche must be placedin the bottome of the river, and so to passe upon those: but let usfolowe our reasonyng. If it happen that a capitain be led with hisarmie, betwen two hilles, and that he have not but twoo waies to savehymself, either that before, or that behinde, and those beyng beset ofthenemies, he hath for remidie to doe the same, which some have doenheretofore: that which have made on their hinder parte a greate trenche,difficult to passe over, and semed to the enemie, to mynde to kepe himof, for to be able with al his power, without neding to feare behinde,to make force that waie, whiche before remaineth open. The whiche theenemies belevyng, have made theim selves stronge, towardes the openparte, and have forsaken the inclosed and he then castyng a bridge ofwoode over the Trenche, for soche an effect prepared, bothe on thesameparte, with out any impedimente hath passed, and also delivered hymselfout of the handes of the enemie. Lucius Minutus a Consul of Rome, was inLiguria with an armie, and was of the enemies inclosed, betwene certainehilles, whereby he could not go out: therefore he sente certainesouldiours of Numidia on horsebacke, whiche he had in his armie (whomwere evill armed, and upon little leane horses) towardes the places thatwere kepte of the enemies, whom at the first sight made the enemies, toorder theim selves together, to defende the passage: but after that theisawe those men ill apoincted, and accordyng to their facion evillhorsed, regardyng theim little, enlarged the orders of their warde,wherof so sone as the Numidians wer a ware, givyng the spurres to theirhorses, and runnyng violently upon theim, passed before thei couldprovide any remedy, whom beyng passed, destroied and spoiled thecountrie after soche sorte, that thei constrained the enemies, to leavethe passage free to the armie of Lucius. Some capitaine, whiche hathperceived hymself to be assaulted of a greate multitude of enemies, hathdrawen together his men, and hath given to the enemie commoditie, tocompasse hym all about, and then on thesame part, whiche he hathperceived to be moste weake, hath made force, and by thesame waie, hathcaused to make waie, and saved hymself.Marcus Antonius retiryng before the armie of the Parthians, perceivedhow the enemies every daie before Sunne risyng, when he removed,assaulted him, and all the waie troubled hym: in so moch, that hedetermined not to departe the nexte daie, before None: so that theParthians beleving, that he would not remove that daie, retourned totheir tentes. Whereby Marcus Antonius might then all the reste of thedaie, marche without any disquietnesse. This self same man for to avoidethe arrowes of the Parthians, commaunded his men, that when theParthians came towardes them, thei should knele, and that the secondranke of the battailes, should cover with their Targaettes, the heddesof the firste, the thirde, the seconde, the fowerth the third, and sosuccessively, that all the armie came, to be as it were under apentehouse, and defended from the shotte of the enemies. This is asmoche as is come into my remembraunce, to tell you, which maie happenunto an armie marchyng: therefore, if you remember not any thyng els, Iwill passe to an other parte.THE SIXTHE BOOKEZANOBI.

I have let my self been governed hetherto, so I minde to doestill. Therfore be contente sir, to folowe your reasonyng, and if weinterrupte you with this practise of ours, have us excused.[Sidenote: How the Grekes incamped; Howe the Romaines incamped; Themaner of the incamping of an armie; The lodging for the generallcapitaine.]FABRICIO. You dooe me, as all readie I have saied, a moste greatepleasure; for this your interrupting me, taketh not awaie my fantasie,but rather refresheth me. But mindyng to followe our matter I saie, howthat it is now tyme, that we lodge this our armie, for that you knoweevery thyng desireth reste and saftie, bicause to reste, and not toreste safely, is no perfecte reste: I doubte moche, whether it hath notbeen desired of you, that I should firste have lodged them, after madetheim to marche, and laste of all to faight, and we have doen thecontrary: whereunto necessitie hath brought us, for that intendyng toshewe, how an armie in going, is reduced from the forme of marching, tothesame maner of faightyng, it was necessarie to have firste shewed, howthei ordered it to faight. But tournyng to our matter, I saie, thatminding to have the Campe sure, it is requisite that it be strong, andin good order: the industrie of the Capitaine, maketh it in order, thesituacion, or the arte, maketh it stronge. The Grekes sought strongsituacions, nor thei would never place theim selves, where had not beeneither cave, or bancke of a river, or multitude of trees, or othernaturall fortificacion, that might defende theim: but the Romaines notso moche incamped safe through the situacion, as through arte, nor theiwould never incampe in place, where thei should not have been able tohave raunged all their bandes of menne, accordyng to their discipline.Hereby grewe, that the Romaines might kepe alwaies one forme ofincamping, for that thei would, that the situacion should bee ruled bythem, not thei by the situacion: the which the Grekes could not observe,for that beyng ruled by the situacion, and variyng the situacion andforme, it was conveniente, that also thei should varie the maner ofincampyng, and the facion of their lodgynges. Therefore the Romaines,where the situacion lacked strength thei supplied thesame with arte, andwith industrie. And for that I in this my declaracion, have willed toimitate the Romaines, I will not departe from the maner of theirincamping, yet not observyng altogether their order, but takyng thesameparte, whiche semeth unto me, to be mete for this present tyme. I havetold you many tymes, how the Romaines had in their consull armies, twooLegions of Romaine men, whiche were aboute a leven thousande footemen,and sixe hundred horsemen, and moreover thei had an other leventhousande footemen, sente from their frendes in their aide: nor in theirarmie thei had never more souldiers that were straungers, then Romaines,excepte horsemenne, whom thei cared not, though thei were more in nomberthen theirs: and in all their doynges, thei did place their Legions inthe middeste, and the aiders, on the sides: the whiche maner, theiobserved also in incampyng, as by your self you maie rede, in thoseaucthoures, that write of their actes: and therefore I purpose not toshewe you distinctly how thei incamped, but to tell you onely with whatorder, I at this presente would incampe my armie, whereby you shall thenknowe, what parte I have taken out of the Romaine maners. You knowe,that in stede of twoo Romaine Legions, I have taken twoo maine battailesof footemen, of sixe thousande footemen, and three hundred horsemen,profitable for a maine battaile, and into what battailes, into whatweapons, into what names I have devided theim: you knowe howe inorderyng tharmie to marche, and to faight, I have not made mencion ofother men, but onely have shewed, how that doublyng the men, thei nedednot but to double the orders: but mindyng at this presente, to shew youthe maner of incampyng, me thinketh good not to stande onely with twoomaine battailes, but to bryng together a juste armie, made like unto theRomaines, of twoo maine battailes, and of as many more aidyng men: thewhiche I make, to the intent that the forme of the incampyng, maie bethe more perfect, by lodgyng a perfecte armie: whiche thyng in the otherdemonstracions, hath not semed unto me so necessarie. Purposing then, toincampe a juste armie, of xxiiii. thousande footemen, and of twoothousande good horsemenne, beeyng devided into fower maine battailes,twoo of our owne menne, and twoo of straungers, I would take this waie.The situacion beyng founde, where I would incampe, I would erecte thehed standarde, and aboute it, I would marke out a quadrant, whicheshould have every side distante from it xxxvii. yardes and a half, ofwhiche every one of them should lye, towardes one of the fower regionsof heaven, as Easte, Weste, Southe, and Northe: betwene the whichespace, I would that the capitaines lodgyng should be appoincted. Andbicause I beleve that it is wisedom, to devide the armed from theunarmed, seyng that so, for the moste parte the Romaines did, I wouldtherefore seperate the menne, that were cumbered with any thing, fromthe uncombered. I would lodge all, or the greatest parte of the armed,on the side towardes the Easte, and the unarmed, and the cumbred, on theWeste side, makyng Easte the hedde, and Weste the backe of the Campe,and Southe, and Northe should be the flanckes: and for to distinguishethe lodgynges of the armed, I would take this waie. I would drawe a linefrom the hedde standarde, and lead it towardes the Easte, the space ofCCCCC.x. yardes and a half: I would after, make two other lines, thatshould place in the middeste the same, and should bee as longe as that,but distante eche of theim from it a leven yardes and a quarter: in theende whereof, I would have the Easte gate, and the space that is betwenethe twoo uttermoste lines, should make a waie, that should go from thegate, to the capitaines lodging, whiche shall come to be xxii. yardesand a halfe broad, and CCCClxxii. yardes and a halfe longe, for thexxxvii. yardes and a halfe, the lodgyng of the Capitaine will take up:and this shall bee called the Capitaine waie. Then there shall be madean other waie, from the Southe gate, to the Northe gate, and shall passeby the hedde of the capitaine waie, and leave the Capitaines lodgyngtowardes theaste, whiche waie shalbe ix.C.xxxvii. yardes and a halfelong (for the length therof wilbe as moche as the breadth of all thelodgynges) and shall likewise be xxii. yardes and a half broad, andshalbe called the crosse waie. Then so sone as the Capitaines lodgyng,were appoincted out, and these twoo waies, there shall bee begun to beappoincted out, the lodginges of our own two main battailes, one of thewhiche, I would lodge on the right hand of the capitaines waie, and theother, on the lefte: and therefore passing over the space, that thebreadth of the crosse waie taketh, I would place xxxii. lodgynges, onthe lefte side of the capitain waie, and xxxii. on the right side,leavyng betwene the xvi. and the xvii. lodgyng, a space of xxii. yardesand a halfe, the whiche should serve for a waie overthwart, whicheshould runne overthwarte, throughout all the lodgynges of the mainebattailes as in the distributyng of them shall bee seen.[Sidenote: The lodgings for the men of armes, and their Capitaine; Note,which is breadth and whiche length in the square campe; The lodgings forthe lighte horsemen, and their capitain; The lodgings for the footemenof twoo ordinary main battailes; The lodgings for the conestables; Thenomber of footemen appoincted to every lodging; The lodynges for thechiefe Capitaines of the maine battayles and for the treasurers,marshals and straungers; Lodginges for the horsemen, of theextraordinarie mayne battailes; The lodgynges for the extraordinariePykes and Veliti; How the Artillerie must be placed in the Campe;Lodgynges for the unarmed men, and the places that are apoineted for theimpedimentes of the campe.]Of these twoo orders of lodgynges in the beginnyng of the head, whicheshall come to joygne to the crosse waye, I would lodge the Capitaine ofthe men of armes, in the xv. lodgynges, which on everie side folowethnext, their men of armes, where eche main battaile, havyng a CL. men ofarmes, it will come to ten men of armes for a lodgyng. The spaces of theCapitaines lodgynges, should be in bredth xxx. and in length vii. yardesand a halfe. And note that when so ever I sai bredeth, it signifieth thespace of the middest from Southe to Northe, and saiyng length, thatwhiche is from weste to Easte. Those of the men of armes, shoulde be xi.yardes and a quarter in length, and xxii. yardes and a halfe in bredeth.In the other xv. lodgynges, that on everie syde should folowe, thewhiche should have their beginnyng on the other side of the overthwarteway, and whiche shall have the very same space, that those of the men ofarmes had, I woulde lodge the light horsemen: wherof beynge a hundredand fiftie, it will come to x. horsemen for a lodgyng, and in the xvi.that remaineth, I woulde lodge their Capitaine, gevynge him the veriesame space, that is geven to the Capitain of the men of armes: and thusthe lodginges of the horsemen of two maine battailes, will come to placein the middest the Capitaine way, and geve rule to the lodginges of thefootemen, as I shall declare. You have noted how I have lodged the CCC.horsemen of everie main battaile with their Capitaines, in xxxii.lodgynges placed on the Captaine waie, havynge begun from the crossewaie, and how from the xvi. to the xvii. there remaineth a space ofxxii. yardes and a halfe, to make awaie overthwarte. Mindyng thereforeto lodge the xx. battailes, which the twoo ordinarie maine battaileshave, I woulde place the lodgyng of everie twoo battailes, behinde thelodgynges of the horsemen, everie one of whiche, should have in lengthxi. yardes and a quarter, and in bredeth xxii. yardes and a half asthose of the horsemens, and shoulde bee joigned on the hinder parte,that thei shoulde touche the one the other. And in every first lodgyngon everie side which cometh to lie on the crosse waie, I woulde lodgethe Counstable of a battaile, whiche should come to stand even with thelodgyng of the Capitayne of the men of armes, and this lodgyng shallhave onely of space for bredeth xv. yardes, and for length vii. yardesand a halfe. In the other xv. lodgynges, that on everie side followethafter these, even unto the overthwarte way, I would lodge on everie parta battaile of foote men, whiche beyng iiii. hundred and fiftie, therewill come to a lodgyng xxx. The other xv. lodgynges, I woulde placecontinually on every side on those of the light horse men, with theverie same spaces, where I woulde lodge on everie part, an otherbattaile of fote men, and in the laste lodgyng, I would place on everyparte the Conestable of the battaile, whiche will come to joigne withthe same of the Capitaine of the lighte horsemen, with the space of vii.yardes and a halfe for length, and xv. for bredeth: and so these twofirste orders of lodgynges, shal be halfe of horsemen, and halfe offootemen. And for that I woulde (as in the place therof I have toldeyou) these horse menne shoulde be all profitable, and for this havyngeno servauntes whiche in kepyng the horses, or in other necessariethynges might helpe them, I woulde that these footemen, who lodgebehynde the horse, should bee bounde to helpe to provide, and to keepetheim for their maisters: and for this to bee exempted from the otherdoynges of the Campe. The whiche maner, was observed of the Romanies.Then leavyng after these lodgynges on everie parte, a space of xxii.yardes and a halfe, whiche shoulde make awaye, that shoulde be calledthe one, the firste waye on the righte hande, and the other the firstewaie on the lefte hand, I woulde pitche on everie side an other order ofxxxii. double lodgynges, whiche should tourne their hinder partes theone againste the other with the verie same spaces, as those that I havetolde you of, and devided after the sixtenth in the verie same maner forto make the overthwarte waie, where I would lodge on every side iiii.battailes of footemen, with their constables in bothe endes. Thenleavyng on every side an other space of xxii. yardes and a halfe, thatshoulde make a waie, whiche shoulde be called of the one side, theseconde waie on the right hande, and on the other syde, the seconde wayon the lefte hande, I would place an other order on everie side ofxxxii. double lodgynges, with the verie same distance and devisions,where I would lodge on everie side, other iiii. battailes with theirConstables: and thus the horesemenne and the bandes of the twooordinarie maine battailes, should come to be lodged in three orders oflodgynges, on the one side of the capitaine waie, and in three otherorders of lodgynges on the other side of the Capitaine waie. The twooaidyng maine battels (for that I cause them to be made of the verie samenation) I woulde lodge them on everie parte of these twoo ordinariemaine battailes, with the very same orders of double lodgynges, pitchyngfirst one order of lodgynges, where should lodge halfe the horsemen, andhalf the foote men, distance xxii. yardes and a halfe from the other,for to make a way whiche should be called the one, the thirde waie onthe right hande, and the other the thirde waie on the lefte hande. Andafter, I woulde make on everie side, twoo other orders of lodgynges, inthe verie same maner destinguesshed and ordeined, as those were of theordinarie maine battelles, which shall make twoo other wayes, and theyall should be called of the numbre, and of the hande, where thei shouldbe placed: in suche wyse, that all this side of the armie, shoulde cometo be lodged in xii. orders of double lodgynges, and in xiii. waies,reckenynge captaine waie, and crosse waie: I would there should remaynea space from the lodgynges to the Trenche of lxxv. yardes rounde aboute:and if you recken al these spaces, you shall see that from the middestof the Capitaines lodgyng to the easte gate, there is Dx. yardes. Nowthere remaineth twoo spaces, whereof one is from the Capitaines lodgyngto the Southe gate, the other is from thense to the Northe gate: whichecome to be (either of them measurynge them from the poincte in themiddest) CCCC.lxxvi. yardes. Then takyng out of everie one of thesespaces xxxvii. yardes and a halfe, whiche the Capitaynes lodgyngeoccupieth, and xxxiiii. yardes everie waie for a market place, and xxii.yardes and a halfe for way that devides everie one of the saied spacesin the middest, and lxxv. yardes, that is lefte on everie part betweenethe lodgynges and the Trenche, there remaineth on every side a space forlodginges of CCC. yardes broade, and lxxv. yardes longe, measurynge thelength with the space that the Captaines lodgynge taketh up. Devidyngethen in the middest the saied lengthe, there woulde be made on everyhande of the Capitaine xl. lodgynges xxxvii. yardes and a halfe longe,and xv. broade, whiche will come to be in all lxxx. lodgynges, wherinshall be lodged the heddes of the maine battailes, the Treasurers, theMarshalles of the fielde, and all those that shoulde have office in thearmie, leavyng some voide for straungers that shoulde happen to come,and for those that shall serve for good will of the Capitaine. On theparte behinde the Capitaines lodgynge, I would have a way from Southe toNorthe xxiii. yardes large, and shoulde be called the bed way, whicheshall come to be placed a longe by the lxxx. lodgynges aforesayd: forthat this waie, and the crosseway, shall come to place in the middestbetweene them bothe the Capitaines lodgynge, and the lxxx. lodgyngesthat be on the sides therof. From this bed waie, and from over agaynstthe captaines lodgyng, I would make an other waie, which shoulde goefrom thens to the weste gate, lykewyse broade xxii. yardes and a halfe,and should aunswer in situation and in length to the Captaine way, andshould be called the market waie. These twoo waies beynge made, I wouldeordeine the market place, where the market shall bee kepte, whiche Iwoulde place on the head of the market way over against the capitaineslodgynge, and joigned to the head way, and I woulde have it to bequadrante, and woulde assigne lxxxx. yardes and three quarters to asquare: and on the right hande and lefte hande, of the saied marketplace, I would make two orders of lodginges, where everie order shalhave eight double lodginges, which shall take up in length, ix. yardes,and in bredeth xxii. yardes and a halfe, so that there shall come to beon every hande of the market place, xvi. lodgynges that shall place thesame in the middest which shall be in al xxxii. wherin I woulde lodgethose horsemen, which shoulde remaine to the aidyng mayne battailes: andwhen these should not suffise, I woulde assigne theim some of thoselodginges that placeth between them the Capitaines lodgynge, and inespecially those, that lie towardes the Trenche. There resteth now tolodge the Pikes, and extraordinarie Veliti, that everie main battailehath, which you know accordynge to our order, how everie one hathbesides the x. battailes M. extraordinarie Pikes, and five hundrethVeliti: so that the twoo cheefe maine battailes, have two thousandeextraordinarie Pikes, and a thousande extraordinarie Veliti, and theayders as many as those, so that yet there remaineth to be lodged, vi.M. menne, whome I woulde lodge all on the weste side, and a longe theTrenche. Then from the ende of the hed waye, towardes Northe, leavyngthe space of lxxv. yardes from them to the trenche, I woulde place anorder of v. double lodgynges, whiche in all shoulde take up lvi. yardesin lengthe, and xxx. in bredeth: so that the bredeth devided, there willcome to everie lodgyng xi. yardes and a quarter for lengthe, and forbredeth twoo and twentie yardes and a half. And because there shall bex. lodgynges, I will lodge three hundred men, apoinctyng to everylodging xxx. men: leavyng then a space of three and twentie yardes and aquarter, I woulde place in like wise, and with like spaces an otherorder of five double lodgynges, and againe an other, till there werefive orders of five double lodgynges: which wil come to be fiftielodgynges placed by right line on the Northe side, every one of themdistante from the Trenche lxxv. yardes, which will lodge fifteenehundred men. Tournyng after on the lefte hande towardes the weste gate,I woulde pitche in all the same tracte, whiche were from them to thesaied gate, five other orders of double lodgynges, with the verie samespaces, and with the verie same maner: true it is, that from the oneorder to the other, there shall not be more then a xi. yardes and aquarter of space: wherin shall be lodged also fifteene hundred men: andthus from the Northe gate to the weste, as the Trenche turneth, in ahundred lodginges devided in x. rewes of five double lodgynges in arowe, there will be lodged all the Pikes and extraordinarie Veliti ofthe cheefe maine battayles. And so from the west gate to the Southe, asthe Trenche tourneth even in the verie same maner, in other ten rewes often lodgynges in a rewe, there shall be lodged the pikes, andextraordinarie Veliti of the aidyng mayne battailes. Their headdes ortheir counstables may take those lodgynges, that shal seeme unto themmoste commodious, on the parte towardes the trenche. The Artillerie, Iwoulde dispose throughoute all the Campe, a longe the banke of theTrenche: and in all the other space that shoulde remaine towardes weste,I woulde lodge all the unarmed, and place all the impedimentes of theCampe. And it is to be understoode, that under this name of impedimentes(as you know) the antiquitee mente all the same trayne, and all thosethynges, which are necessarie for an armie, besides the souldiours: asare Carpenters, Smithes, Masons, Ingeners, Bombardiers, althoughe thatthose might be counted in the numbre of the armed, herdemen with theirherdes of motons and beeves whiche for victuallyng of the armie, arerequiset: and moreover maisters of all sciences, together with publickecarriages of the publicke munition, whiche pertaine as well tovictuallyng, as to armynge. Nor I would not distinguishe these lodgingesperticularly, only I would marke out the waies which should not beoccupied of them: then the other spaces, that betweene the waies shallremaine, whiche shall be fower, I woulde appoincte theim generally forall the saied impedimentes, that is one for the herdemen, the other forartificers and craftes men, the thirde for publicke carriages ofvictuals, the fowerth for the municion of armour and weapons. The waieswhiche I woulde shoulde be lefte without ocupiyng them, shal be themarket waie, the head waye, and more over a waie that shoulde be calledthe midde waye, whiche should goe from Northe to Southe, and shouldpasse thoroughe the middest of the market waie, whiche from the westeparte, shoulde serve for the same purpose that the overthwarte way doethon the east parte. And besides this, a waye whiche shall goe aboute onthe hinder parte, alonge the lodgynges of the Pikes and extraordinarieVeliti, and all these wayes shall be twoo and tweentie vardes and ahalfe broade. And the Artilerie, I woulde place a longe the Trenche ofthe Campe, rounde aboute the same.BAPTISTE. I confesse that I understand not, nor I beleeve that also tosaye so, is any shame unto me, this beyng not my exercise:notwithstandyng, this order pleaseth me muche: onely I woulde that youshoulde declare me these doubtes: The one, whie you make the waie, andthe spaces aboute so large. The other, that troubleth me more, is thesespaces, whiche you apoincte oute for the lodgynges, howe they ought tobe used.[Sidenote: The Campe ought to be all waies of one facion.]FABRICIO. You must note, that I make all the waies, xxii. yardes and ahalfe broade, to the intente that thorowe them, maie go a battaile ofmen in araie, where if you remember wel, I tolde you how every bande ofmenne, taketh in breadth betwene xviii. and xxii. yardes of space tomarche or stande in. Nowe where the space that is betwene the trenche,and the lodgynges, is lxxv. yardes broade, thesame is moste necessarie,to the intent thei maie there order the battailes, and the artillerie,bothe to conducte by thesame the praies, and to have space to retiretheim selves with newe trenches, and newe fortificacion if neede were:The lodginges also, stande better so farre from the diches, beyng themore out of daunger of fires, and other thynges, whiche the enemie,might throwe to hurte them. Concernyng the seconde demaunde, my intentis not that every space, of me marked out, bee covered with a paviliononely, but to be used, as tourneth commodious to soch as lodge there,either with more or with lesse Tentes, so that thei go not out of theboundes of thesame. And for to marke out these lodginges, there ought tobee moste cunnyng menne, and moste excellente Architectours, whom, sosone as the Capitaine hath chosen the place, maie knowe how to give itthe facion, and to distribute it, distinguishyng the waies, devidyng thelodgynges with Coardes and staves, in soche practised wise, thatstraight waie, thei maie bee ordained, and devided: and to minde thatthere growe no confusion, it is conveniente to tourne the Campe, alwaiesone waie, to the intente that every manne maie knowe in what waie, inwhat space he hath to finde his lodgyng: and this ought to be observedin every tyme, in every place, and after soche maner, that it seme amovyng Citee, the whiche where so ever it goweth, carrieth with it theverie same waies, the verie same habitacions, and the verie sameaspectes, that it had at the firste: The whiche thing thei cannotobserve, whom sekyng strong situacions, must chaunge forme, accordyng tothe variacion of the grounde: but the Romaines in the plaine, madestronge the place where thei incamped with trenches, and with Rampires,bicause thei made a space about the campe, and before thesame a ditche,ordinary broad fower yardes and a halfe, and depe aboute twoo yardes anda quarter, the which spaces, thei increased, according as thei intendedto tarie in a place, and accordyng as thei feared the enemie. I for myparte at this presente, would not make the listes, if I intende not toWinter in a place: yet I would make the Trenche and the bancke no lesse,then the foresaied, but greater, accordyng to necessitie. Also,consideryng the artellerie, I would intrench upon every corner of theCampe, a halfe circle of ground, from whens the artillerie mightflancke, whom so ever should seke to come over the Trenche. In thispractise in knowyng how to ordain a campe, the souldiours ought also tobe exercised, and to make with them the officers expert, that areappoincted to marke it out, and the Souldiours readie to knowe theirplaces: nor nothyng therein is difficulte, as in the place thereof shallbee declared: wherefore, I will goe forewarde at this tyme to the wardeof the campe, bicause without distribucion of the watche, all the otherpain that hath been taken, should be vain.BAPTISTE. Before you passe to the watche, I desire that you woulddeclare unto me, when one would pitche his campe nere the enemie, whatwaie is used: for that I knowe not, how a man maie have tyme, to be ableto ordaine it without perill.FABRICIO. You shall understande this, that no Capitaine will lye nerethe enemie, except he, that is desposed to faight the fielde, when soever his adversarie will: and when a capitaine is so disposed, there isno perill, but ordinarie: for that the twoo partes of the armie, standealwaies in a redinesse, to faight the battaile, and thother maketh thelodginges. The Romaines in this case, gave this order of fortifiyng theCampe, unto the Triarii: and the Prencipi, and the Astati, stoode inarmes. This thei did, for as moche as the Triarii, beyng the last tofaight, might have time inough, if the enemie came, to leave the woorke,and to take their weapons, and to get them into their places. Therfore,accordyng unto the Romaines maner, you ought to cause the Campe to bemade of those battailes, whiche you will set in the hinder parte of thearmie, in the place of the Triarii. But let us tourne to reason of thewatche.[Sidenote: Theantiquitie used no Scoutes; The watche and warde of theCampe.]I thinke I have not founde, emongest the antiquitie, that for to wardethe campe in the night, thei have kepte watche without the Trenche,distaunte as thei use now a daies, whom thei call Scoutes: the whiche Ibeleve thei did, thinkyng that the armie might easely bee deceived,through the difficultie, that is in seeyng them againe, for that theimight bee either corrupted, or oppressed of the enemie: So that totruste either in parte, or altogether on them, thei judged it perillous.And therefore, all the strength of the watche, was with in the trenche,whiche thei did withall diligence kepe, and with moste greate order,punished with death, whom so ever observed not thesame order: the whichehow it was of them ordained, I will tell you no other wise, leaste Ishould bee tedious unto you, beyng able by your self to see it, if asyet you have not seen it: I shall onely briefly tell that, whiche shallmake for my purpose, I wold cause to stand ordinarely every night, thethirde parte of the armie armed, and of thesame, the fowerth partealwaies on foote, whom I would make to bee destributed, throughout allthe banckes, and throughout all the places of the armie, with doublewarde, placed in every quadrante of thesame: Of whiche, parte shouldstande still, parte continually should go from the one corner of theCampe, to the other: and this order, I would observe also in the daie,when I should have the enemie nere.[Sidenote: Dilligence ought to be used, to knowe who lieth oute of theCampe, and who they be that cometh of newe; Claudius Nero; The justicethat ought to be in a campe. The fauts that the antiquitie punisshedwith Death; Where greate punishementes be, there oughte likewise to beegreat rewardes; It was no marvel that the Romaines became mightiePrinces; A meane to punishe and execute Justice, without raisingtumultes; Manlius Capitolinus; Souldiours sworen to kepe the disciplineof warre.]Concernyng the givyng of the watche worde, and renuyng thesame everyevening, and to doe the other thynges, whiche in like watches is used,bicause thei are thynges well inough knowen, I will speake no further ofthem: onely I shall remember one thyng, for that it is of greateimportaunce, and whiche causeth great saulfgarde observyng it, and notobservyng it, moche harme: The whiche is, that there be observed greatediligence, to knowe at night, who lodgeth not in the Campe, and whocommeth a newe: and this is an easie thing to see who lodgeth, withthesame order that wee have appoincted: for as moche as every lodgynghavyng the determined nomber of menne, it is an easie matter to see, ifthei lacke, or if there be more menne: and when thei come to be absentewithout lisence, to punishe them as Fugetives, and if there bee more, tounderstande what thei be, what they make there, and of their othercondicions. This diligence maketh that the enemie cannot but withdifficultie, practise with thy capitaines, and have knowlege of thycounsailes: which thing if of the Romaines, had not been diligentlyobserved, Claudius Nero could not, havyng Aniball nere hym, depart fromhis Campe, whiche he had in Lucania, and to go and to retourne fromMarca, without Aniball should have firste heard thereof some thyng. Butit suffiseth not to make these orders good, excepte thei bee caused tobee observed, with a greate severtie: for that there is nothyng thatwould have more observacion, then is requisite in an armie: thereforethe lawes for the maintenaunce of thesame, ought to be sharpe and harde,and the executour therof moste harde. The Romaines punished with deathhim that lacked in the watch, he that forsoke the place that was givenhym to faight in, he that caried any thynge, hidde out of the Campe, ifany manne should saie, that he had doen some worthy thing in the faight,and had not doen it, if any had fought without the commaundemente of theCapitaine, if any had for feare, caste awaie his weapons: and when ithappened, that a Cohorte, or a whole Legion, had committed like fault,bicause thei would not put to death all, thei yet tooke al their names,and did put them in a bagge, and then by lotte, thei drue oute thetenthe parte, and so those were put to death: the whiche punishemente,was in soche wise made, that though every man did not feele it every mannotwithstandyng feared it: and bicause where be greate punishementes,there ought to be also rewardes, mindyng to have menne at one instant,to feare and to hope, thei had appoincted rewardes to every worthieacte: as he that faighting, saved the life of one of his Citezeins, tohym that firste leapte upon the walle of the enemies Toune, to hym thatentered firste into the Campe of the enemies, to hym that had infaightyng hurte, or slaine the enemie, he that had stroken him from hishorse: and so every vertuous act, was of the Consulles knowen andrewarded, and openly of every manne praised: and soche as obtainedgiftes, for any of these thynges, besides the glorie and fame, whichethei got emongest the souldiours, after when thei returned into theircountrie, with solemne pompe, and with greate demonstracion emong theirfrendes and kinsfolkes, thei shewed them. Therefore it was no marveile,though thesame people gotte so moche dominion, having so mocheobservacion in punishemente, and rewarde towardes theim, whom either fortheir well doyng, or for their ill doyng, should deserve either praiseor blame: Of whiche thynges it were convenient, to observe the greaterparte. Nor I thinke not good to kepe secrete, one maner of punishmenteof theim observed, whiche was, that so sone as the offendour, was beforethe Tribune, or Consulle convicted, he was of the same lightely strokenwith a rodde: after the whiche strikyng, it was lawfull for theoffendour to flie, and to all the Souldiours to kill hym: so thatstraight waie, every man threwe at hym either stones, or dartes, or withother weapons, stroke hym in soche wise, that he went but little waie alive, and moste fewe escaped, and to those that so escaped, it was notlawfull for them to retourne home, but with so many incommodities, andsoche greate shame and ignomie, that it should have ben moche better forhim to have died. This maner is seen to be almoste observed of theSuizzers, who make the condempned to be put to death openly, of thothersouldiours, the whiche is well considered, and excellently dooen: forthat intendyng, that one be not a defendour of an evill doer, thegreateste reamedie that is founde, is to make hym punisher of thesame:bicause otherwise, with other respecte he favoureth hym: where when hehymself is made execucioner, with other desire, he desireth hispunishemente, then when the execucion commeth to an other. Thereforemindyng, not to have one favored in his faulte of the people, a greateremedie it is, to make that the people, maie have hym to judge. For thegreater proofe of this, thinsample of Manlius Capitolinus might bebrought, who being accused of the Scenate, was defended of the people,so longe as thei were not Judge, but becommyng arbitratours in hiscause, thei condempned hym to death. This is then a waie to punishe,without raisyng tumultes, and to make justise to be kepte: and for asmoche as to bridell armed menne, neither the feare of the Lawes, nor ofmenne suffise not, the antiquitie joined thereunto the aucthoritie ofGod: and therefore with moste greate Ceremonies, thei made theirsouldiours to sweare, to kepe the discipline of warre, so that doyngcontrariewise, thei should not onely have to feare the Lawes, and menne,but God: and thei used all diligence, to fill them with Religion.[Sidenote: Women and idell games, were not suffered by the antiquitie,to bee in their armies.]BAPTISTE. Did the Romaines permitte, that women might bee in theirarmies, or that there might be used these idell plaies, whiche thei usenow a daies.FABRICIO. Thei prohibited the one and thother, and this prohibicion wasnot moche difficulte: For that there were so many exercises, in thewhiche thei kept every daie the souldiours, some whiles particularely,somewhiles generally occupied that thei had no time to thinke, either onVenus, or on plaies, nor on any other thyng, whiche sedicious andunproffitable souldiours doe.BAPTISTE. I am herein satisfied, but tell me, when the armie had toremove, what order kepte thei?[Sidenote: Ordre in the removing the armie by the soundes of a Trumpet.]FABRICIO. The chief Trumpet sounded three tymes, at the firste sound,thei toke up the Tentes, and made the packes, at the seconde, thei ladedthe carriage, at the thirde, thei removed in thesame maner aforsaied,with the impedimentes after every parte of armed men, placyng theLegions in the middeste: and therefore you ought to cause after thesamesorte, an extraordinarie maine battaile to remove: and after that, theparticulare impedimentes therof, and with those, the fowerth part of thepublike impedimentes, which should bee all those, that were lodged inone of those partes, whiche a little afore we declared: and therfore itis conveniente, to have every one of them, appointed to a mainebattaile, to the entente that the armie removyng, every one might knowehis place in marchyng: and thus every maine battaile ought to goe awaie,with their owne impedimentes, and with the fowerth parte of the publikeimpedimentes, followyng after in soche maner, as wee shewed that theRomaines marched.BAPTISTE. In pitchyng the Campe, had thei other respectes, then thoseyou have tolde?[Sidenote: Respectes to be had for incampyng; How to choose a place toincampe; How to avoide diseases from the armie; The wonderfullcommoditie of exercise; The provision of victualles that ought alwaiesto bee in a readinesse in an armie.]FABRICIO. I tell you again, that the Romaines when thei encamped, wouldbe able to kepe the accustomed fashion of their maner, the whiche toobserve, thei had no other respecte: but concernyng for otherconsideracions, thei had twoo principall, the one, to incampe theimselves in a wholesome place, the other, to place themselves, wherethenemie could not besiege theim, nor take from them the waie to thewater, or victualles. Then for to avoide infirmitie, thei did flie fromplaces Fennie, or subjecte to hurtfull windes: whiche thei knewe not sowell, by the qualitie of the situacion, as by the face of theinhabitours: for when thei sawe theim evill coloured, or swollen, orfull of other infeccion, thei would not lodge there: concernyng thotherrespecte to provide not to be besieged, it is requisite to consider thenature of the place, where the friendes lye, and thenemies, and of thisto make a conjecture, if thou maiest be besieged or no: and therefore itis meete, that the Capitaine be moste experte, in the knowlege ofsituacions of countries, and have aboute him divers men, that have theverie same expertenes. Thei avoide also diseases, and famishment, withcausyng the armie to kepe no misrule, for that to purpose to maintain itin health, it is nedefull to provide, that the souldiours maie slepeunder tentes, that thei maie lodge where bee Trees, that make shadowe,where woodde is for to dresse their meate, that thei go not in theheate, and therefore thei muste bee drawen out of the campe, before daiein Summer, and in Winter, to take hede that thei marche not in theSnowe, and in the Froste, without havyng comoditie to make fire, and notto lack necessarie aparel, nor to drink naughtie water: those that fallsicke by chaunce, make them to bee cured of Phisicions: bicause acapitain hath no reamedie, when he hath to faight with sicknesse, andwith an enemie: but nothing is so profitable, to maintaine the armie inhealth, as is the exercise: and therfore the antiquitie every daie, madethem to exercise: wherby is seen how muche exercise availeth: for thatin the Campe, it kepeth thee in health, and in the faight victorious.Concernyng famishemente, it is necessarie to see, that the enemie hinderthee not of thy victualles, but to provide where thou maieste have it,and to see that thesame whiche thou haste, bee not loste: and thereforeit is requisite, that thou have alwaies in provision with the armie,sufficiente victuall for a monethe, and then removyng into some strongplace, thou muste take order with thy nexte frendes, that daily theimaie provide for thee, and above al thinges bestowe the victual withdiligence, givyng every daie to every manne, a reasonable measure, andobserve after soche sorte this poincte, that it disorder thee not:bicause all other thyng in the warre, maie with tyme be overcome, thisonely with tyme overcometh thee: nor there shall never any enemie ofthyne, who maie overcome thee with famishemente, that will seeke toovercome thee with iron. For that though the victory be not sohonourable, yet it is more sure and more certaine: Then, thesame armiecannot avoide famishemente, that is not an observer of justice, whichelicenciously consumeth what it liste: bicause the one disorder, makeththat the victualls commeth not unto you, the other, that soche victuallas commeth, is unprofitably consumed: therefore thantiquitie ordained,that thei should spende thesame, whiche thei gave, and in thesame tymewhen thei appoincted: for that no souldiour did eate, but when theCapitaine did eate: The whiche how moche it is observed of the armiesnowe adaies, every manne knoweth, and worthely thei can not bee calledmenne of good order and sober, as the antiquitie, but lasivious anddrunkardes.BAPTISTE. You saied in the beginnyng of orderynge the Campe, that youwoulde not stande onely uppon twoo maine battailes, but woulde takefower, for to shewe how a juste armie incamped: therfore I would youshoulde tell me twoo thynges, the one, when I shoulde have more or lessemen, howe I ought to incampe them, the other, what numbre of souldioursshould suffice you to faight against what so ever enemie that were.[Sidenote: Howe to lodge in the Campe more or lesse menne, then theordinarie; The nombre of men that an army ought to be made of, to beeable to faighte with the puisantest enemie that is; Howe to cause men todo soche a thing as shold bee profitable for thee, and hurtfull to themselves; Howe to overcome menne at unwares; How to tourne to commoditiethe doynges of soche, as use to advertise thy enemie of thyproceadynges; How to order the campe, that the enemie shal not perceivewhether the same bee deminished, or increased; A saiyng of Metellus;Marcus Crassus; How to understand the secretes of thy enemie; A policieof Marius, to understande howe he might truste the Frenchmen; What someCapitaines have doen when their countrie have been invaded of enemies;To make the enemie necligente in his doynges; Silla Asdruball; Thepolicie of Aniball, where by he escaped out of the danger of FabiusMaximus; A Capitayne muste devise how to devide the force of hisenemies; How to cause the enemie to have in suspect his most trusty men;Aniball Coriolanus; Metellus against Jugurte; A practis of the Romayneoratours, to bryng Aniball out of Credit with Antiochus; Howe to causethe enemie to devide his power; Howe Titus Didius staied his enemiesthat wer going to incounter a legion of men that were commyng in hisayde; Howe some have caused the enemie to devide his force; A policie towinne the enemies countrie before he be aware; Howe to reforme sedicionand discorde; The benefitte that the reputacion of the Capitainecauseth, which is only gotten by vertue; The chiefe thyng that acapitayne ought to doe; When paie wanteth, punishment is not to beexecuted; The inconvenience of not punisshynge; Cesar chaunsynge tofall, made the same to be supposed to signifi good lucke; Religiontaketh away fantasticall opinions; In what cases a Capitaine ought notto faight with his enemie if he may otherwyse choose; A policie ofFulvius wherby he got and spoyled his enemies Campe; A policie todisorder the enemie; A policie to overcome the enemie; A policie; How tobeguile the enemie; Howe Mennonus trained his enemies oute of strongeplaces to bee the better able to overcom them.]FABRICIO. To the first question I answer you, that if the armie be moreor lesse, then fower or sixe thousande souldiours, the orders oflodgynges, may bee taken awaie or joined, so many as suffiseth: and withthis way a man may goe in more, and in lesse, into infinite:Notwithstandynge the Romaines, when thei joigned together twoo consullarmies, thei made twoo campes, and thei tourned the partes of theunarmed, thone against thother. Concernyng the second question, I sayunto you, that the Romaines ordinary armie, was about xxiiii. M.souldiours: but when thei were driven to faight against the greatestpower that might be, the moste that thei put together, wer L. M. Withthis number, thei did set against two hundred thousand Frenchemen, whomeassaulted them after the first warre, that thei had with theCarthageners. With this verie same numbre, thei fought againsteAnniball. And you muste note, that the Romaines, and the Grekes, havemade warre with fewe, fortefiyng themselves thorough order, and thorougharte: the west, and the easte, have made it with multitude: But the oneof these nacions, doeth serve with naturall furie: as doe the men of thewest partes, the other through the great obedience whiche those men haveto their kyng. But in Grece, and in Italy, beyng no naturall furie, northe naturall reverence towardes their king, it hath been necessary forthem to learne the discipline of warre, the whiche is of so muche force,that it hath made that a fewe, hath been able to overcome the furie, andthe naturall obstinatenesse of manie. Therefore I saie, that mindyng toimitate the Romaines, and the Grekes, the number of L. M. souldiersought not to bee passed, but rather to take lesse: because manie makeconfucion, nor suffer not the discipline to be observed, and the orderslearned, and Pirrus used to saie, that with xv. thousande men he wouldeassaile the worlde: but let us pas to an other parte. We have made thisour armie to winne a field and shewed the travailes, that in the samefight may happen: we have made it to marche, and declared of whatimpedimentes in marchyng it may be disturbed: and finally we have lodgedit: where not only it ought to take a littell reste of the labourspassed, but also to thinke howe the warre ought to be ended: for that inthe lodgynges, is handeled many thynges, inespecially thy enemies as yetremainyng in the fielde, and in suspected townes, of whome it is good tobe assured, and those that be enemies to overcome them: therfore it isnecessarie to come to this demonstracion, and to passe this difficultiewith the same glorie, as hitherto we have warred. Therfore comynge toparticular matters, I saie that if it shoulde happen, that thou wouldesthave manie men, or many people to dooe a thyng, whiche were to theeprofittable, and to theim greate hurte, as should be to breake downe thewall of their citie, or to sende into exile many of them, it isnecessarie for thee, either to beguile them in such wise that everie onebeleeve not that it toucheth him: so that succouryng not the one theother, thei may finde them selves al to be oppressed without remedie, orels unto all to commaunde the same, whiche they ought to dooe in oneselfe daie, to the intente that every man belevyng to be alone, to whomethe commaundement is made, maie thinke to obey and not to remedie it:and so withoute tumulte thy commaundement to be of everie man executed.If thou shouldest suspecte the fidelitie of anie people, and wouldeassure thee, and overcome them at unawares, for to colour thy intentemore easelie, thou canst not doe better, then to counsel with them ofsome purpose of thine, desiryng their aide, and to seeme to intende tomake an other enterprise, and to have thy minde farre from thinkyng onthem: the whiche will make, that thei shall not think on their ownedefence, beleevyng not that thou purposest to hurte them, and thei shalgeve thee commoditie, to be able easely to satisfie thy desire. Whenthou shouldest perceive, that there were in thine armie some, that usedto advertise thy enemie of thy devises, thou canst not doe better,myndynge to take commoditie by their traiterous mindes, then to commenwith them of those thynges, that thou wilte not doe, and those that thouwilt doe, to kepe secret, and to say to doubte of thynges, that thoudoubtest not, and those of whiche thou doubtest, to hide: the whichshall make thenemie to take some enterprise in hand, beleving to knowthy devises, where by easly thou maiest beguile and opresse hym. If thoushouldest intende (as Claudius Nero did) to deminishe thy armie,sendynge helpe to some freende, and that the enemie shoulde not beeaware therof, it is necessarie not to deminishe the lodgynges, but tomaintayne the signes, and the orders whole, makyng the verie same fires,and the verye same wardes throughout all the campe, as wer wont to beafore. Lykewise if with thy armie there should joigne new men, andwouldest that the enemie shoulde not know that thou werte ingrosed, itis necessarie not to increase the lodgynges: Because keepyng secretedoynges and devises, hath alwaies been moste profitable. WherforeMetellus beyng with an armie in Hispayne, to one, who asked him what hewould doe the nexte daie, answered, that if his sherte knew therof, hewould bourne it. Marcus Craussus, unto one, whome asked him, when thearmie shoulde remove, saied beleevest thou to be alone not to here thetrumpet? If thou shouldest desire to understande the secretes of thyenemie, and to know his orders, some have used to sende embassadours,and with theim in servauntes aparel, moste expertest men in warre: whomhavynge taken occasion to se the enemies armie, and to consider hisstrengthe and weakenesse, it hath geven them oportunitie to overcomehim. Some have sente into exile one of their familiars, and by meanes ofthe same, hath knowen the devises of his adversarie. Also like secrettesare understoode of the enemies when for this effecte there were takenany prisoners. Marius whiche in the warre that he made with the Cimbrie,for to know the faieth of those Frenchmen, who then inhabited Lombardie,and were in leage with the Romaine people, sent them letters open, andsealed: and in the open he wrote, that they shoulde not open the sealed,but at a certaine time, and before the same time demaundyng them againe,and finding them opened, knew thereby that their faithe was not to betrusted. Some Capitaines, being invaded, have not desired to goe tomeete the enemie, but have gone to assaulte his countrey, andconstrained him to retorne to defende his owne home: The whiche manietimes hath come wel to passe, for that those soldiours beginnyng to filthem selves with booties, and confidence to overcome, shall sone makethe enemies souldiours to wexe afraide, when they supposynge theimselves conquerours, shal understand to become losers: So that to himthat hath made this diversion, manie times it hath proved well. Butonely it may be doen by him, whiche hath his countrey stronger then thatof the enemies, because when it were otherwise, he should goe to leese.It hath been often a profitable thyng to a capitaine, that hath beenbesieged in his lodgynges by the enemie, to move an intreatie ofagreemente, and to make truse with him for certaine daies: the which iswonte to make the enemies more necligente in all doynges: so thatavaylynge thee of their necligence, thou maiest easely have occacion toget thee oute of handes. By this way Silla delivered him selfe twisefrom the enemies: and with this verie same deceipte, Asdruball inHispayne got oute of the force of Claudious Nero, whome had besiegedhim. It helpeth also to deliver a man out of the daunger of the enemie,to do some thyng beside the forsaied, that may keepe him at a baye: thisis dooen in two maners, either to assaulte him with parte of thy power,so that he beyng attentive to the same faight, may geve commoditie tothe reste of thy men to bee able to save theim selves, or to cause torise some newe accidente, which for the strayngenesse of the thynge,maie make him to marvell, and for this occasion to stande doubtefull,and still: as you knowe howe Anniball dyd, who beynge inclosed of FabiusMaximus, tied in the nighte small Bavens kindeled beetweene the hornesof manie Oxen, so that Fabius astonied at the strangenesse of the samesight, thought not to lette him at all the passage. A Capitayne oughteamonge all other of his affaires, with al subtiltie to devise to devidethe force of the enemie, either with makyng him to suspecte his ownemenne, in whome he trusteth, or to give him occasion, that he mayeseperate his menne, and therby to be come more weake. The fyrste way isdooen with keepyng saulfe the thynges of some of those whiche he hathaboute him, as to save in the warre their menne and their possessions,renderynge theim their children, or other their necessaries withouteraunsome. You know that Anniball havynge burned all the fieldes abouteRome, he made onely to bee reserved saulfe those of Fabius Maximus. Youknow how Coriolanus comyng with an armie to Rome, preserved thepossessions of the nobilitie, and those of the comminaltie he bourned,and sacked. Metellus havinge an armie againste Jugurte, all theoratours, whiche of Jugurte were sente him, were required of him, thatthey woulde geve him Jugurte prisoner, and after to the verie same menwrityng letters of the verie same matter, wrought in suche wise, that inshorte tyme Jugurte havyng in suspecte all his counsellours, in diversemaners put them to death. Anniball beynge fled to Antiochus, the Romaineoratours practised with him so familiarly, that Antiochus beyng insuspecte of him, trusted not anie more after to his counselles.Concernyng to devide the enemies men, there is no more certainer waie,then to cause their countrie to be assaulted to the intente that beingconstrained to goe to defende the same, they maie forsake the warre.This way Fabius used havynge agaynst his armie the power of theFrenchemen, of the Tuscans, Umbries and Sannites. Titus Didius havyng afew men in respecte to those of the enemies, and lookynge for a legionfrom Rome, and the enemies purposinge to goe to incounter it, to theintente that they should not goe caused to bee noised through all hisarmie, that he intended the nexte daie to faighte the field with theenemies: after he used means, that certaine of the prisoners, that hehad taken afore, had occasion to runne awaie. Who declaryng the orderthat the Consull had taken to faighte the nexte daie, by reason wherofthe enemies beyng afraide to deminishe their owne strength, went not toincounter the same legion, and by this way thei wer conducted safe. Thewhich means serveth not to devide the force of the enemies, but toaugmente a mans owne. Some have used to devide the enemies force, bylettyng him to enter into their countrie, and in profe have let him takemanie townes, to the intente that puttynge in the same garrisons, hemight thereby deminishe his power, and by this waie havynge made himweake, have assaulted and overcomen him. Some other mindyng to goe intoone province, have made as though they woulde have invaded an other, andused so much diligence, that sodenly entryng into the same, where it wasnot doubted that they woulde enter, they have first wonne it, before theennemie coulde have time to succour it: for that thy enemie beynge notsure, whether thou purposest to tourne backe, to the place fyrste ofthee threatned, is constrained not to forsake the one place, to succourthe other, and so many times he defendeth neither the one nor the other.It importeth besides the sayde thynges to a Capitaine, if there growesedicion or discorde amonge the souldiours, to knowe with arte howe toextynguishe it: The beste waie is to chastise the headdes of thefaultes, but it muste be doen in such wise, that thou maiest first haveoppressed them, before they be able to be aware: The way is if they bedistante from thee, not onely to call the offenders, but together withtheim all the other, to the entente that not beleevynge, that it is forany cause to punishe them, they become not contumelius, but gevecommoditie to the execution of the punishemente: when thei be present,thou oughtest to make thy selfe stronge with those that be not infaulte, and by meane of their helpe to punishe the other. When therehapneth discorde amonge them, the beste waye is, to bryng them to theperill, the feare whereof is wonte alwaies to make them agree. But that,which above all other thynge kepeth the armie in unitee, is thereputacion of the Capitaine, the whiche onely groweth of his vertue:because neither bloud, nor authoritie gave it ever without vertue. Andthe chiefe thyng, whiche of a Capitain is looked for to be doen, is, tokeepe his souldiours punisshed, and paied: for that when so ever thepaie lacketh, it is conveniente that the punisshement lacke: becausethou canst not correcte a souldiour, that robbeth, if thou doest notpaie him, nor the same mindynge to live, cannot abstaine from robbynge:but if thou paiest him and punisshest him not, he beecometh in everiecondicion insolente: For that thou becomest of small estimacion, wherethou chaunsest not to bee able to maintaine the dignitie of thy degree,and not mainetainyng it, there foloweth of necessitee tumulte, anddiscorde, whiche is the ruine of an armie. Olde Capitaines had atroubell, of the which the presente be almoste free, whiche was tointerprete to their purpose the sinister auguries: because if there fella thunderbolte in an armie, if the sunne were darkened or the Moone, ifthere came an erthequake, if the Capitaine either in gettyng up, or inlightynge of his horse fell, it was of the souldiours interpretedsinisterously: And it ingendred in them so moche feare, that comynge tofaight the fielde, easely they should have lost it: and therefore theaunciente Capitaines so sone as a lyke accidente grewe, either theyshewed the cause of the same, and redused it to a naturall cause, orthey interpreted it to their purpose. Cesar fallyng in Africa, in comyngof the sea saied, Africa I have taken thee. Moreover manie have declaredthe cause of the obscuryng of the Moone, and of earthquakes: which thingin our time cannot happen, as well because our men be not sosupersticious, as also for that our religion taketh away altogether suchopinions: al be it when they should chaunse, the orders of theantiquitie ought to be imitated. When either famishement, or othernaturall necessitie, or humaine passion, hath broughte thy enemie to anutter desperation, and he driven of the same, cometh to faight withthee, thou oughtest to stande within thy campe, and as muche as lieth inthy power, to flie the faight. So the Lacedemonians did against theMasonians, so Cesar did against Afranio, and Petreio. Fulvius beyngConsul, against the Cimbrians, made his horsemen manie daies continuallyto assaulte the enemies, and considered how thei issued out of theircampe for to folow them: wherfore he sette an ambusshe behinde the Campeof the Cimbrians, and made them to be assaulted of his horsmen, and theCimbrians issuyng oute of their campe for to follow them. Fulvio gotteit, and sacked it. It hath ben of great utilitie to a Capitaine, havynghis armie nere to the enemies armie, to sende his menne with the enemiesansignes to robbe, and to burne his owne countrey, whereby the enemiesbeleevynge those to bee menne, whiche are come in their aide, have alsorunne to helpe to make them the pray: and for this disorderyng themselves, hathe therby given oportunitie to the adversary to overcomethem. This waie Alexander of Epirus used againste the Illirans andLeptenus of Siracusa against the Carthaginers and bothe to the one andto the other, the devise came to passe most happely. Manie have overcomethe enemie, gevyng him occasion to eate and to drinke oute of measure,fayning to have feared, and leaving their Campes full of wyne and herdesof cattell, wherof the enemie beyng filled above all naturall use, havethen assaulted him, and with his destruction overthrowen him. So Tamirusdid against Cirus, and Tiberius Graccus agaynst the Spaniardes. Somehave poysoned the wine, and other thynges to feede on, for to be ablemore easely to overcome them. I saied a littel afore how I founde not,that the antiquetie kepte in the night Scoutes abroade, and supposedthat they did it for to avoide the hurte, whiche might growe therby:because it is founde, that through no other meane then throughe thewatche man, whiche was set in the daie to watche the enemie, hath beencause of the ruin of him, that set him there: for that manie times ithath hapned, that he beyng taken, hath been made perforce to tell theimthe token, whereby they might call his felowes, who commyng to thetoken, have been slaine or taken. It helpeth to beguile the enemiesometime to varie a custome of thine, whereupon he having grounded himself, remaineth ruinated: as a Capitaine did once, whome usinge to causeto be made signes to his men for comynge of the enemies in the nightwith fire, and in the daie with smoke, commaunded that withoute anieintermission, they shoulde make smoke and fire, and after commynge uponthem the enemie, they should reste, whome beleevyng to come withoutbeynge seen, perceivyng no signe to be made of beyng discovered, caused(through goeyng disordered) more easie the victorie to his adversarie.Mennonus a Rodian mindynge to drawe from stronge places the enemiesarmie, sente one under colour of a fugitive, the whiche affirmed, howehis armie was in discorde, and that the greater parte of them wenteawaie: and for to make the thynge to be credited, he caused to make insporte, certaine tumultes amonge the lodgynges: whereby the enemiethvnkyng thereby to be able to discomfaighte them, assaultynge theim,were overthrowen.[Sidenote: The enemie ought not to be brought into extreme desperacion;How Lucullus constrained certaine men that ran awaie from him to hisenemies, to fayght whether they wold or not.]Besides thesaied thynges, regarde ought to be had not to brynge theenemie into extreme desperacion: whereunto Cesar had regarde, faightyngwith the Duchemen, who opened them the waie, seyng, howe thei beyng notable to flie, necessitie made them strong, and would rather take paineto followe theim, when thei fled, then the perill to overcome them, whenthei defended them selves. Lucullus seyng, how certaine Macedonianhorsemenne, whiche were with hym, went to the enemies parte, straightwaie made to sounde to battaile, and commaunded, that the other menshould folowe hym: whereby the enemies beleving, that Lucullus wouldbegin the faight, went to incounter the same Macedonians, with socheviolence, that thei were constrained to defende themselves: and so theibecame against their willes, of fugetives, faighters. It importeth alsoto knowe, how to be assured of a toune, when thou doubteste of thefidelitie thereof, so sone as thou haste wonne the fielde, or before,the whiche certain old insamples maie teache thee.[Sidenote: A policie wher by Pompey got a towne; How Publius Valeriusassured him self of a towne; A policie that Alexander Magnus used to beassured of all Tracia, which Philip kynge of Spaine did practise to beasured of England when he wente to sainct Quintens; Examples forCapitaines to winne the hartes of the people.]Pompei doubtyng of the Catinensians, praied them that thei would beecontente, to receive certaine sicke menne, that he had in his armie, andsendyng under the habite of sicke persones, most lustie menne, gotte thetoune. Publius Valerius, fearyng the fidelitie of the Epidannians,caused to come, as who saieth, a Pardon to a churche without the toune,and when al the people wer gone for Pardon, he shutte the gates,receivyng after none in, but those whom he trusted. Alexander Magnus,mindyng to goe into Asia, and to assure himself of Thracia, toke withhim all the principall of thesame Province, givyng theim provision, andhe set over the common people of Thracia, men of lowe degree, and so hemade the Princes contented with paiyng theim, and the people quiete,havyng no heddes that should disquiete them: But emong all the thynges,with the whiche the Capitaines, winne the hartes of the people, be theinsamples of chastitie and justice, as was thesame of Scipio in Spaine,when he rendered that yong woman, moste faire of personage to herfather, and to her housebande: the whiche made him more, then with forceof armes to winne Spain.Cesar having caused that woodde to bee paied for, whiche he had occupiedfor to make the Listes, about his armie in Fraunce, got so moche a nameof justice, that he made easier the conquest of thesame province. Icannot tell what remaineth me, to speake more upon these accidentes, forthat concerning this matter, there is not lefte any parte, that hath notbeen of us disputed. Onely there lacketh to tell, of the maner ofwinnyng, and defendyng a toune: the whiche I am readie to doe willingly,if you be not now wearie.BAPTISTE. Your humanitie is so moche, that it maketh us to followe ourdesires, without beyng afraied to be reputed presumptuous, seyng thatyou liberally offer thesame, whiche we should have been ashamed, to haveasked you: Therefore, we saie unto you onely this, that to us you cannotdooe a greater, nor a more gratefuller benefite, then to finishe thisreasonyng. But before that you passe to that other matter, declare us adoubte, whether it bee better to continewe the warre, as well in theWinter, as thei use now adaies, or to make it onely in the Sommer, andto goe home in the Winter, as the antiquitie did.[Sidenote: Warre ought not to be made in winter; Rough situacions, coldeand watrie times, are enemies to the oder of warre; An overthrowe causedby winter.]FABRICIO. See, that if the prudence of the demaunder were not, there hadremained behinde a speciall part, that deserveth consideracion. Ianswere you againe, that the antiquitie did all thynges better, and withmore prudence then wee: and if wee in other things commit some erroure,in the affaires of warre, wee commit all errour. There is nothing moreundiscrete, or more perrillous to a Capitayne, then to make warre in theWinter, and muche more perrill beareth he, that maketh it, then he thatabideth it: the reason is this. All the industrie that is used in thediscipline of warre, is used for to bee prepared to fighte a fielde withthy enemie, because this is the ende, whereunto a Capitayne oughte togoo or endevour him selfe: For that the foughten field, geveth thee thewarre wonne or loste: then he that knoweth best how to order it, and hethat hath his army beste instructed, hath moste advauntage in this, andmaye beste hope to overcome. On the other side, there is nothing moreenemie to the orders, and then the rough situacions, or the colde waterytime: for that the rough situacions, suffereth thee not to deffende thybandes, according to thee discipline: the coulde and watery times,suffereth thee not to keepe thy men together, nor thou canst not bringthem in good order to the enemy: but it is convenient for thee to lodgethem a sunder of necessitie, and without order, being constrayned toobeye to Castells, to Boroughes, and to the Villages, that maye receyvethee, in maner that all thy laboure of thee, used to instructe the armyis vaine. Nor marvayle you not though now a daies, they warre in theWinter, because the armies being without discipline, know not the hurtthat it dooth them, in lodging not together, for that it is no griefe tothem not to be able to keepe those orders, and to observe thatdiscipline, which they have not: yet they oughte to see howe much harme,the Camping in the Winter hath caused, and to remember, how theFrenchmen in the yeare of oure Lorde God, a thousande five hundred andthree, were broken at Gariliano of the Winter, and not of theSpaniardes: For as much as I have saide, he that assaulteth, hath moredisadvauntage then he that defendeth: because the fowle weather hurtethhim not a littell, being in the dominion of others and minding to makewarre. For that he is constrayned, either to stande together with hismen, and to sustaine the incommoditie of water and colde, or to avoideit to devide his power: But he that defendeth, may chuse the place as helisteth, and tary him with his freshe men: and he in a sodayne may sethis men in araye, and goo to find a band of the enemies men, who cannotresiste the violence of them. So the Frenchemen were discomfited, and sothey shall alwayes be discomfited, which will assaulte in the Winter anenemye, whoo hath in him prudence. Then he that will that force, thatorders, that discipline and vertue, in anye condition availe him not,let him make warre in the fielde in the winter: and because that theRomaines woulde that all these thinges, in which they bestowed so muchdiligence, should availe them, fleedde no otherwise the Winter, then thehighe Alpes, and difficulte places, and whatsoever other thing shouldelet them, for being able to shewe their arte and their vertue. So thissuffiseth to your demaund, wherefore we wil come to intreate of thedefending and besieging of tounes, and of their situacions andedifications.THE SEVENTH BOOKE[Sidenote: Tounes and Fortresses maie be strong twoo waies; The placethat now a daies is moste sought to fortifie in; How a Toune walle oughtto bee made; The walle of a toune ought to bee high, and the dichewithin, and not without; The thickenes that a Toune walle ought to beeof, and the distaunces betwene everie flancker, and of what breadth anddeapth the dich ought to bee; How the ordinaunce is planted, for thedefence of a toune; The nature of the batterie.]You oughte to knowe, how that tounes and fortresses, maie bee strongeither by nature, or by industrie; by nature, those bee strong, whichebee compassed aboute with rivers, or with Fennes, as Mantua is andFerrara, or whiche bee builded upon a Rocke, or upon a stepe hille, asMonaco, and Sanleo: For that those that stande upon hilles, that be notmoche difficulct to goe up, be now a daies, consideryng the artillerieand the Caves, moste weake. And therfore moste often times in building,thei seke now a daies a plain, for to make it stronge with industrie.The firste industrie is, to make the walles crooked, and full oftournynges, and of receiptes: the whiche thyng maketh, that thenemiecannot come nere to it, bicause he maie be hurte, not onely on thefront, but by flancke. If the walles be made high, thei bee to mochesubjecte to the blowes of the artillerie: if thei be made lowe, thei beemoste easie to scale. If thou makeste the diches on the out sidethereof, for to give difficultie to the Ladders, if it happen that theenemie fill them up (whiche a great armie maie easely dooe) the wallremaineth taken of thenemie. Therefore purposyng to provide to the oneand thother foresaid inconveniences, I beleve (savyng alwaies betterjudgement) that the walle ought to be made highe, and the Diche within,and not without. This is the moste strongeste waie of edificacion, thatis made, for that it defendeth thee from the artillerie, and fromLadders, and it giveth not facilitie to the enemie, to fill up thediche: Then the walle ought to be high, of that heighth as shall beethought beste, and no lesse thick, then two yardes and a quarter, for tomake it more difficult to ruinate. Moreover it ought to have the touresplaced, with distances of CL. yardes betwen thone and thother: the dichewithin, ought to be at leaste twoo and twentie yardes and a halfe broad,and nine depe, and al the yearth that is digged out, for to make thediche, muste be throwen towardes the Citee, and kepte up of a walle,that muste be raised from the bottome of the diche, and goe so high overthe toune, that a man maie bee covered behinde thesame, the whiche thingshal make the depth of the diche the greater. In the bottome of thediche, within every hundred and l. yardes, there would be a slaughterhouse, which with the ordinaunce, maie hurte whom so ever should goedoune into thesame: the greate artillerie that defende the citee, areplanted behinde the walle, that shutteth the diche, bicause for todefende the utter walle, being high, there cannot bee occupiedcommodiously, other then smalle or meane peeses. If the enemie come toscale, the heigth of the firste walle moste easely defendeth thee: if hecome with ordinaunce, it is convenient for hym to batter the utterwalle: but it beyng battered, for that the nature of the batterie is, tomake the walle to fall, towardes the parte battered, the ruine of thewalle commeth, finding no diche that receiveth and hideth it, toredouble the profunditie of thesame diche: after soche sorte, that topasse any further, it is not possible, findyng a ruine that with holdeththee, a diche that letteth thee, and the enemies ordinaunce, that fromthe walle of the diche, moste safely killeth thee. Onely there is thisremedie, to fill the diche: the whiche is moste difficulte to dooe, aswell bicause the capacitie thereof is greate, as also for thedifficultie, that is in commyng nere it, the walle beeyng strong andconcaved, betwene the whiche, by the reasons aforesaied, withdifficultie maie be entered, havyng after to goe up a breache through aruin, whiche giveth thee moste greate difficultie, so that I suppose acitee thus builded, to be altogether invinsible.BAPTISTE. When there should bee made besides the diche within, a dichealso without, should it not bee stronger?FABRICIO. It should be without doubt, but mindyng to make one dicheonely, myne opinion is, that it standeth better within then without.BAPTISTE. Would you, that water should bee in the diches, or would youhave them drie?[Sidenote: A drie diche is moste sureste.]FABRICIO. The opinion of men herein bee divers, bicause the diches fullof water, saveth thee from mines under grounde, the Diches withoutwater, maketh more difficulte the fillyng of them: but I havyngconsidered all, would make them without water, for that thei bee moresure: For diches with water, have been seen in the Winter to bee frosen,and to make easie the winnyng of a citee, as it happened to Mirandola,when Pope Julie besieged it: and for to save me from mines, I would makeit so deepe, that he that would digge lower, should finde water.[Sidenote: An advertisemente for the buildyng and defending of a Touneor Fortresse; Small fortresses cannot bee defended; A toune of war orFortresse, ought not to have in them any retiring places; Cesar Borgia;The causes of the losse of the Fortresse of Furlie, that was thoughtinvincible; Howe the houses that are in a toune of war or Fortresseought to be builded.]The Fortresses also, I would builde concernyng the diches and the wallesin like maner, to the intent thei should have the like difficultie to bewonne. One thyng I will earnestly advise hym, that defendeth a Citee:and that is, that he make no Bulwarkes without distaunte from the walleof thesame: and an other to hym that buildeth the Fortresse, and thisis, that he make not any refuge place in them, in whiche he that iswithin, the firste walle beyng loste, maie retire: That whiche maketh meto give the firste counsaile is, that no manne ought to make any thyng,by meane wherof, he maie be driven without remedie to lese his firstereputacion, the whiche losyng, causeth to be estemed lesse his otherdoinges, and maketh afraied them, whom have taken upon theim hisdefence, and alwaies it shall chaunce him this, whiche I saie, whenthere are made Bulwarkes out of the Toune, that is to bee defended,bicause alwaies he shall leese theim, little thynges now a daies, beyngnot able to bee defended, when thei be subject to the furie ofordinance, in soche wise that lesyng them, thei be beginning and causeof his ruine. When Genua rebelled againste king Leus of Fraunce, it madecertaine Bulwarkes alofte on those hilles, whiche bee about it, thewhiche so sone as thei were loste, whiche was sodainly, made also thecitee to be loste. Concernyng the second counsaile, I affirme nothyng tobe to a Fortresse more perilous, then to be in thesame refuge places, tobe able to retire: Bicause the hope that menne have thereby, maketh thatthei leese the utter warde, when it is assaulted: and that loste, makethto bee loste after, all the Fortresse. For insample there is freshe inremembraunce, the losse of the Fortresse of Furly, when Catherin theCountesse defended it againste Cesar Borgia, sonne to Pope Alexander thevi. who had conducted thether the armie of the king of Fraunce: thesameFortresse, was al full of places, to retire out of one into an other:for that there was firste the kepe, from the same to the Fortresse, wasa diche after soche sorte, that thei passed over it by a draw bridge:the fortresse was devided into three partes, and every parte was devidedfrom the other with diches, and with water, and by Bridges, thei passedfrom the one place to the other: wherefore the Duke battered with hisartillerie, one of the partes of the fortresse, and opened part of thewalle: For whiche cause Maister Jhon Casale, whiche was appoincted tothat Warde, thought not good to defende that breache, but abandoned itfor to retire hymself into the other places: so that the Dukes menhaving entered into that parte without incounter, in a sodaine theigotte it all: For that the Dukes menne became lordes of the bridges,whiche went from one place to an other. Thei loste then this Fortresse,whiche was thought invinsible, through two defaultes, the one for havyngso many retiryng places, the other, bicause every retiryng place, wasnot Lorde of the bridge thereof. Therefore, the naughtie buildedFortresse, and the little wisedome of them that defended it, causedshame to the noble enterprise of the countesse, whoe had thought to haveabidden an armie, whiche neither the kyng of Naples, nor the Duke ofMilaine would have abidden: and although his inforcementes had no goodende, yet notwithstandyng he gotte that honoure, whiche hisvaliauntnesse had deserved: The whiche was testified of many Epigrammes,made in those daies in his praise. Therefore, if I should have to buildea Fortresse, I would make the walles strong, and the diches in the maneras we have reasoned, nor I would not make therein other, then houses toinhabite, and those I would make weake and lowe, after soche sorte thatthei should not let him that should stande in the middest of the Marketplace, the sight of all the walle, to the intente that the Capitainmight see with the iye, where he maie succour: and that every manneshould understande, that the walle and the diche beyng lost, thefortresse were lost. And yet when I should make any retiryng places, Iwould make the bridges devided in soche wise, that every parte should beLorde of the bridges of his side, ordainyng, that thei should fall uponpostes, in the middest of the diche.BAPTISTE. You have saied that littel thynges now a daies can not beedefended, and it seemed unto me to have understoode the contrarie, thatthe lesser that a thyng wer, the better it might be defended.[Sidenote: The fortifiyng of the entrance of a Toune.]FABRICIO. You have not understoode well, because that place cannot benow a daies called stronge, wher he that defendeth it, hath not space toretire with new diches, and with new fortificacions, for that the forceof the ordinance is so much, that he that trusteth uppon the warde ofone wall and of one fortification only, is deceived: and because theBulwarkes (mindyng that they passe not their ordinarie measure, for thatthen they shoulde be townes and Castels) be not made, in suche wise thatmen maie have space within them to retire, thei are loste straight waie.Therefore it is wisdom to let alone those Bulwarkes without, and tofortifie thenterance of the toune, and to kever the gates of the samewith turnyngs after suche sort, that men cannot goe in nor oute of thegate by right line: and from the tournynges to the gate, to make a dichewith a bridge. Also they fortifie the gate, with a Percullis, for to beeabell to put therin their menne, when they be issued out to faight, andhapnyng that the enemies pursue them, to avoide, that in the mingelyngetogether, they enter not in with them: and therfore these be used, thewhich the antiquitie called Cattarratte, the whiche beyng let fall,exclude thenemies, and save the freendes, for that in suche a case, mencan do no good neither by bridges nor by a gate, the one and the otherbeynge ocupied with prease of menne.BAPTISTE. I have seene these Perculleses that you speake of, made inAlmayne of littell quarters of woodde after the facion of a grate ofIron, and these percullises of ouers, be made of plankes all massive: Iwoulde desire to understande whereof groweth this difference, and whichbe the strongest.[Sidenote: Battelments ought to be large and thicke and the flanckerslarge within.]FABRICIO. I tell you agayne, that the manners and orders of the warre,throughe oute all the worlde, in respecte to those of the antiquitie, beextinguesshed, and in Italye they bee altogether loste, for if there beea thing somewhat stronger then the ordinarye, it groweth of the insampleof other countries. You mighte have understoode and these other mayremember, with howe muche debilitie before, that king Charles of Frauncein the yere of our salvation a thousande CCCC. xciiii. had passed intoItalie, they made the batelmentes not halfe a yarde thicke, the loopes,and the flanckers were made with a litle opening without, and muchewithin, and with manye other faultes whiche not to be tedious I will letpasse: for that easely from thinne battelments the defence is takenawaye, the flanckers builded in the same maner, moste easylye areopened: Nowe of the Frenchemen is learned to make the battelment largeand thicke, and the flanckers to bee large on the parte within, and todrawe together in the middeste of the wall, and then agayn to waxe widerunto the uttermost parte without: this maketh that the ordinauncehardlye can take away the defence. Therfore the Frenchmen have, manyeother devises like these, the whiche because they have not beene seeneof our men, they have not beene considered. Among whiche, is this kindeof perculles made like unto a grate, the which is a greate deale betterthen oures: for that if you have for defence of a gate a massiveparculles as oures, letting it fall, you shutte in your menne, and youcan not though the same hurte the enemie, so that hee with axes, andwith fire, maye breake it downe safely: but if it bee made like a grate,you maye, it being let downe, through those holes and through those openplaces, defende it with Pikes, with crosbowes, and with all other kindeof weapons.BAPTISTE. I have seene in Italye an other use after the outelandishefashion, and this is, to make the carriage of the artillery with thespokes of the wheele crooked towardes the Axeltree. I woulde knowe whythey make them so: seeming unto mee that they bee stronger when they aremade straighte as those of oure wheeles.[Sidenote: Neither the ditche, wall tillage, nor any kinde ofedificacion, ought to be within a mile of a toune of warre.]FABRICIO. Never beleeve that the thinges that differ from the ordinariewayes, be made by chaunce: and if you shoulde beleeve that they makethem so, to shewe fayrer, you are deceaved: because where strength isnecessarie, there is made no counte of fayrenesse: but all groweth, forthat they be muche surer and muche stronger then ours. The reason isthis: the carte when it is laden, either goeth even, or leaning upon therighte, or upon the lefte side: when it goeth even, the wheeles equallysustayne the wayght, the which being equallye devided betweene them,doth not burden much, but leaning, it commeth to have all the paise ofthe cariage on the backe of that wheele upon the which it leaneth. Ifthe spokes of the same be straight they wil soone breake: for that thewheele leaning, the spokes come also to leane, and not to sustaine thepaise by the straightnesse of them, and so when the carte goeth even,and when they are least burdened, they come to bee strongest: when theCarte goeth awrye, and that they come to have moste paise, they beeweakest. Even the contrarie happeneth to the crooked spokes of theFrenche Cartes, for that when the carte leaning upon one side poinctethuppon them, because they bee ordinary crooked, they come then to beestraight, and to be able to sustayne strongly al the payse, where whenthe carte goeth even, and that they bee crooked, they sustayne it halfe:but let us tourne to our citie and Fortresse. The Frenchemen use alsofor more safegarde of the gates of their townes, and for to bee able insieges more easylye to convey and set oute men of them, besides thesayde thinges, an other devise, of which I have not seene yet in Italyeanye insample: and this is, where they rayse on the oute side from theende of the drawe bridge twoo postes, and upon either of them theyjoigne a beame, in suche wise that the one halfe of them comes over thebridge, the other halfe with oute: then all the same parte that commethwithoute, they joygne together with small quarters of woodde, the whichethey set thicke from one beame to an other like unto a grate, and on theparte within, they fasten to the ende of either of the beames a chaine:then when they will shutte the bridge on the oute side, they slacke thechaines, and let downe all the same parte like unto a grate, the whichecomming downe, shuttethe the bridge, and when they will open it, theydrawe the chaines, and the same commeth to rise up, and they maye raiseit up so much that a man may passe under it, and not a horse, and somuch that there maye passe horse and man, and shutte it againe at ones,for that it falleth and riseth as a window of a battelment. This deviseis more sure than the Parculles, because hardely it maye be of theenemye lette in such wise, that it fall not downe, falling not by arighte line as the Parculles, which easely may be underpropped. Therforethey which will make a citie oughte to cause to be ordained all thesaide things: and moreover aboute the walle, there woulde not beesuffered any grounde to be tilled, within a myle thereof, nor any wallmade, but shoulde be all champaine, where should be neither ditch norbanck, neither tree nor house, which might let the fighte, and makedefence for the enemie that incampeth.[Sidenote: Noote; The provision that is meete to be made for the defenceof a toune.]And noote, that a Towne, whiche hathe the ditches withoute, with thebanckes higher then the grounde, is moste weake: for as muche as theymake defence to the enemye which assaulteth thee, and letteth him nothurte thee, because easely they may be opened, and geve place to hisartillerye: but let us passe into the Towne. I will not loose so muchetime in shewing you howe that besides the foresayde thinges, it isrequisite to have provision of victualles, and wherewith to fight, forthat they be thinges that everye man underdeth, and without them, allother provision is vaine: and generally twoo thinges oughte to be done,to provide and to take the commoditie from the enemie that he availe notby the things of thy countrey: therfore the straw, the beastes, thegraine, whiche thou canste not receive into house, ought to bedestroied. Also he that defendeth a Towne, oughte to provide thatnothing bee done tumultuouslye and disordinatelye, and to take sucheorder, that in all accidentes everye man maye knowe what he hath to doo.[Sidenote: What incoragethe the enemy most that besiegeth a toune; Whathe that besiegeth and he that defendeth oughte to doo; Advertisementesfor a besieged towne; Howe the Romaines vitaled Casalino besieged ofAniball; A policie for the besieged.]The order that oughte to be taken is thus, that the women, the oldefolkes, the children, and the impotent, be made to keepe within doores,that the Towne maye be left free, to yong and lustie men, whom beingarmed, must be destributed for the defence of the same, appointing partof them to the wall, parte to the gates, parte to the principall placesof the Citie, for to remedie those inconveniences, that might growewithin: an other parte must not be bound to any place, but be ready tosuccour all, neede requiring: and the thing beeing ordained thus, withdifficultie tumulte can growe, whiche maye disorder thee. Also I willthat you note this, in the besieging and defending of a Citie, thatnothing geveth so muche hoope to the adversarye to be able to winne atowne, as when he knoweth that the same is not accustomed to see theenemie: for that many times for feare onely without other experience offorce, cities have bene loste: Therefore a man oughte, when heassaulteth a like Citie, to make all his ostentacions terrible. On theother parte he that is assaulted, oughte to appoincte to the same parte,whiche the enemie fighteth againste, strong men and suche as opinionmakethe not afraide, but weapons onely: for that if the first proofeturne vaine, it increaseth boldenesse to the besieged, and then theenemie is constrained to overcome them within, with vertue andreputacion. The instrumentes wherwith the antiquitie defended townes,where manie: as balistes, onagris, scorpions, Arcubalistes, Fustibals,Slinges: and also those were manie with which thei gave assaultes. AsArrieti, Towers, Musculi Plutei, Viney, Falci, testudeni, in steede ofwhich thynges be now a daies the ordinance, the whiche serve him thatbessegeth, and him that defendeth: and therfore I will speake no fortherof theim: But let us retourne to our reasonyng and let us come toparticular offences. They ought to have care not to be taken by famine,and not to be overcome through assaultes: concernyng famin, it hath bentolde, that it is requiset before the siege come, to be well provided ofvitualles. But when a towne throughe longe siege, lacketh victuals, sometimes hath ben seen used certaine extraordinarie waies to be provided oftheir friendes, whome woulde save them: inespeciall if through themiddest of the besieged Citie there runne a river, as the Romainesvittelled their castell called Casalino besieged of Anibal, whom beingnot able by the river to sende them other victual then Nuttes, wherofcastyng in the same great quantitie, the which carried of the river,without beyng abel to be letted, fedde longe time the Casalinians. Somebesieged, for to shew unto the enemie, that they have graine more theninough and for to make him to dispaire, that he cannot, by faminovercome theim, have caste breade oute of the gates, or geven a Bullockegraine to eate, and after have suffered the same to be taken, to theintent that kilde and founde full of graine, might shewe thataboundance, whiche they had not. On the other parte excellent Capitaineshave used sundrie waies to werie the enemie.[Sidenote: A policie of Fabius in besieging of a toune; A policie ofDionisius in besiegynge of a toune.]Fabius suffered them whome he besieged, to sowe their fieldes, to theentente that thei should lacke the same corne, whiche they sowed.Dionisius beynge in Campe at Regio, fained to minde to make an agreementwith them, and duryng the practise therof he caused him selfe to beprovided of their victuales, and then when he had by this mean got fromthem their graine, he kepte them straight and famished them.[Sidenote: Howe Alexander wanne Leucadia.]Alexander Magnus mindyng to winne Leucadia overcame all the Castelsaboute it, and by that means drivyng into the same citie a greatmultitude of their owne countrie men, famished them.[Sidenote: The besieged ought to take heed of the first brunte; Theremedie that townes men have, when the enemies ar entred into the towne;How to make the townes men yeelde.]Concernynge the assaultes, there hath been tolde that chiefely theiought to beware of the firste bronte, with whiche the Romaines gotteoften times manie townes, assaultyng them sodainly, and on every side:and thei called it _Aggredi urbem corona_. As Scipio did, when he wannenewe Carthage in Hispayne: the which brunte if of a towne it bewithstoode, with difficultie after will bee overcome: and yet thoughe itshould happen that the enemie were entred into the citie, by overcomyngethe wall, yet the townes men have some remedie, so thei forsake it not:for as much as manie armies through entring into a toune, have benrepulced or slaine: the remedie is, that the townes men doe keepe themselves in highe places, and from the houses, and from the towers tofaight with them: the whiche thynge, they that have entered into thecitie, have devised to overcome in twoo manners: the one with openyngthe gates of the citie, and to make the waie for the townes men, thatthei might safely flie: the other with sendynge foorthe a proclamacion,that signifieth, that none shall be hurte but the armed, and to themthat caste their weapons on the grounde, pardon shall be graunted: thewhiche thynge hath made easie the victorie of manie cities.[Sidenote: How townes or cities are easelie wonne; How duke Valentinegot the citie of Urbine; The besieged ought to take heede of thedeciptes and policies of the enemie; How Domitio Calvino wan a towne.]Besides this, the Citees are easie to bee wonne, if thou come upon themunawares: whiche is dooen beyng with thy armie farre of, after sochesort, that it be not beleved, either that thou wilte assaulte theim, orthat thou canst dooe it, without commyng openly, bicause of the distanceof the place: wherefore, if thou secretely and spedely assaulte theim,almoste alwaies it shall followe, that thou shalte gette the victorie. Ireason unwillingly of the thynges succeded in our tyme, for that to meand to mine, it should be a burthen, and to reason of other, I cannottel what to saie: notwithstanding, I cannot to this purpose but declare,the insample of Cesar Borgia, called duke Valentine, who beyng at Nocerawith his menne, under colour of goyng to besiege Camerino, tournedtowardes the state of Urbin, and gotte a state in a daie, and withoutany paine, the whiche an other with moche time and cost, should scantehave gotten. It is conveniente also to those, that be besieged, to takeheede of the deceiptes, and of the policies of the enemie, and thereforethe besieged ought not to truste to any thyng, whiche thei see theenemie dooe continually, but let theim beleve alwaies, that it is underdeceipte, and that he can to their hurte varie it. Domitio Calvinobesiegyng a toune, used for a custome to compasse aboute every daie,with a good parte of his menne, the wall of the same: whereby the Tounesmenne, belevyng that he did it for exercise, slacked the Ward: whereofDomicius beyng aware, assaulted and overcame them.[Sidenote: A policie to get a towne.]Certaine Capitaines understandyng, that there should come aide to thebesieged, have apareled their Souldiours, under the Ansigne of those,that should come, and beyng let in, have gotte the Toune.[Sidenote: How Simon of Athens wan a towne; A policie to get a towne;How Scipio gotte certaine castels in Afrike.]Simon of Athens set fire in a night on a Temple, whiche was out of thetoune, wherefore, the tounes menne goyng to succour it, lefte the tounein praie to the enemie. Some have slaine those, whiche from the besiegedCastle, have gone a foragyng, and have appareled their souldiours, withthe apparell of the forragers, whom after have gotte the toune. Theaunciente Capitaines, have also used divers waies, to destroie theGarison of the Toune, whiche thei have sought to take. Scipio beyng inAfrica, and desiring to gette certaine Castles, in whiche were putte theGarrisons of Carthage, he made many tymes, as though he would assaultetheim, albeit, he fained after, not onely to abstaine, but to goe awaiefrom them for feare: the whiche Aniball belevyng to bee true, for topursue hym with greater force, and for to bee able more easely tooppresse him, drewe out all the garrisons of theim: The whiche Scipioknowyng, sente Massinissa his Capitaine to overcome them.[Sidenote: Howe Pirrus wan the chiefe Citie of Sclavonie; A policie toget a towne; How the beseiged are made to yelde; Howe to get a towne bytreason; A policie of Aniball for the betraiyng of a Castell; How thebesieged maie be begiled; How Formion overcame the Calcidensians; Whatthe besieged muste take heede of; Liberalitie maketh enemies frendes;The diligence that the besieged ought to use in their watche and ward.]Pirrus makyng warre in Sclavonie, to the chiefe citee of the samecountrie, where were brought many menne in Garrison, fained to dispaireto bee able to winne it, and tourning to other places, made that thesame for to succour them, emptied it self of the warde, and became easieto bee wonne. Many have corrupted the water, and have tourned the riversan other waie to take Tounes. Also the besieged, are easely made toyelde them selves, makyng theim afraied, with signifiyng unto them avictorie gotten, or with new aides, whiche come in their disfavour. Theold Capitaines have sought to gette Tounes by treason, corruptyng somewithin, but thei have used divers meanes. Sum have sente a manne oftheirs, whiche under the name of a fugetive, might take aucthoritie andtruste with the enemies, who after have used it to their profite. Someby this meanes, have understode the maner of the watche, and by meanesof the same knowledge, have taken the Toune. Some with a Carte, or withBeames under some colour, have letted the gate, that it could not beeshutte, and with this waie, made the entrie easie to the enemie. Aniballperswaded one, to give him a castle of the Romaines, and that he shouldfain to go a huntyng in the night, makyng as though he could not goe bydaie, for feare of the enemies, and tournyng after with the Venison,should put in with hym certaine of his menne, and so killyng thewatchmen, should give hym the gate. Also the besieged are beguiled, withdrawyng them out of the Toune, and goyng awaie from them, faining toflie when thei assault thee. And many (emong whom was Anibal) have forno other intente, let their Campe to be taken, but to have occasion toget betwene theim and home, and to take their Toune. Also, thei arebeguiled with fainyng to departe from them, as Formion of Athens did,who havyng spoiled the countrie of the Calcidensians, received aftertheir ambassadours, fillyng their Citee with faire promises, and hope ofsafetie, under the which as simple menne, thei were a little after ofFormione oppressed. The besieged ought to beware of the men, whiche theihave in suspecte emong them: but some times thei are wont, as well toassure them selves with deserte, as with punishemente. Marcellusknoweyng how Lucius Bancius a Nolane, was tourned to favour Aniball somoche humanitie and liberalitie, he used towardes him, that of anenemie, he made him moste frendely. The besieged ought to use morediligence in the warde, when the enemie is gone from theim, then when heis at hande. And thei ought to warde those places, whiche thei thinke,that maie bee hurt least: for that many tounes have been loste, whenthenemie assaulteth it on thesame part, where thei beleve not possibleto be assaulted. And this deceipt groweth of twoo causes, either for theplace being strong, and to beleve, that it is invinsible, or throughcraft beyng used of the enemie, in assaltyng theim on one side withfained alaroms, and on the other without noise, and with verie assaltesin deede: and therefore the besieged, ought to have greate advertisment,and above all thynges at all times, and in especially in the night tomake good watche to bee kepte on the walles, and not onely to appoinctemenne, but Dogges, and soche fiearse Mastives, and lively, the whiche bytheir sente maie descrie the enemie, and with barkyng discover him: andnot Dogges onely, but Geese have ben seen to have saved a citee, as ithappened to Roome, when the Frenchemen besieged the Capitoll.[Sidenote: An order of Alcibiades for the dew keping of watch andwarde.]Alcibiades for to see, whether the warde watched, Athense beeyngbesieged of the Spartaines, ordained that when in the night, he shouldlifte up a light, all the ward should lift up likewise, constitutyngpunishmente to hym that observed it not.[Sidenote: The secrete conveighyng of Letters; The defence against abreach; How the antiquitie got tounes by muining under grounde.]Isicrates of Athens killed a watchman, which slept, saiyng that he leftehim as he found him. Those that have been besieged, have used diversmeanes, to sende advise to their frendes: and mindyng not to send theirmessage by mouth, thei have written letters in Cifers, and hidden themin sundrie wise: the Cifers be according, as pleaseth him that ordaineththem, the maner of hidyng them is divers. Some have written within thescaberde of a sweard: Other have put the Letters in an unbaked lofe, andafter have baked the same, and given it for meate to hym that cariedtheim. Certaine have hidden them, in the secreteste place of theirbodies: other have hidden them in the collor of a Dogge, that isfamiliare with hym, whiche carrieth theim: Some have written in a letterordinarie thinges, and after betwene thone line and thother, have alsowritten with water, that wetyng it or warming it after, the lettersshould appere. This waie hath been moste politikely observed in ourtime: where some myndyng to signifie to their freendes inhabityng withina towne, thinges to be kept secret, and mindynge not to truste anyperson, have sente common matters written, accordyng to the common useand enterlined it, as I have saied above, and the same have made to behanged on the gates of the Temples, the whiche by countersignes beyngknowen of those, unto whome they have been sente, were taken of andredde: the whiche way is moste politique, bicause he that carrieth themmaie bee beguiled, and there shall happen hym no perill. There be mosteinfinite other waies, whiche every manne maie by himself rede and finde:but with more facilitie, the besieged maie bee written unto, then thebesieged to their frendes without, for that soche letters cannot besent, but by one, under colour of a fugetive, that commeth out of atoune: the whiche is a daungerous and perilous thing, when thenemie isany whit craftie: But those that sende in, he that is sente, maie undermany colours, goe into the Campe that besiegeth, and from thens takyngconveniente occasion, maie leape into the toune: but lette us come tospeake of the present winnyng of tounes. I saie that if it happen, thatthou bee besieged in thy citee, whiche is not ordained with dicheswithin, as a little before we shewed, to mynde that thenemie shall notenter through the breach of the walle, whiche the artillerie maketh:bicause there is no remedie to lette thesame from makyng of a breache,it is therefore necessarie for thee, whileste the ordinance battereth,to caste a diche within the wall which is battered, and that it be inbredth at leaste twoo and twentie yardes and a halfe, and to throwe allthesame that is digged towardes the toun, whiche maie make banke, andthe diche more deper: and it is convenient for thee, to sollicitate thisworke in soche wise, that when the walle falleth, the Diche maie bedigged at least, fower or five yardes in depth: the whiche diche isnecessarie, while it is a digging, to shutte it on every side with aslaughter house: and when the wall is so strong, that it giveth theetime to make the diche, and the slaughter houses, that battered parte,commeth to be moche stronger, then the rest of the citee: for that sochefortificacion, cometh to have the forme, of the diches which we devisedwithin: but when the walle is weake, and that it giveth thee not tyme,to make like fortificacions, then strengthe and valiauntnesse muste beeshewed, settyng againste the enemies armed menne, with all thy force.This maner of fortificacion was observed of the Pisans, when youbesieged theim, and thei might doe it, bicause thei had strong walles,whiche gave them time, the yearth beyng softe and moste meete to raiseup banckes, and to make fortificacions: where if thei had lacked thiscommoditie, thei should have loste the toune. Therefore it shall beealwaies prudently doen, to provide afore hand, makyng diches within thecitee, and through out all the circuite thereof, as a little before weedevised: for that in this case, the enemie maie safely be taried for atlaisure, the fortificacions beyng redy made. The antiquitie many tymesgotte tounes, with muinyng under ground in twoo maners, either thei madea waie under grounde secretely, whiche risse in the toune, and bythesame entered, in whiche maner the Romaines toke the citee of Veienti,or with the muinyng, thei overthrewe a walle, and made it ruinate: thislaste waie is now a daies moste stronge, and maketh, that the citeesplaced high, be most weake, bicause thei maie better bee under muined:and puttyng after in a Cave of this Gunne pouder, whiche in a momentekindelyng, not onely ruinateth a wall, but it openeth the hilles, andutterly dissolveth the strength of them.[Sidenote: The reamedie against Caves or undermuinynges; What care thebesieged ought to have; What maketh a citee or campe difficulte to beedefended; By what meanes thei that besiege ar made afraied; Honour gotby constancie.]The remedie for this, is to builde in the plain, and to make the dichethat compasseth thy citee, so deepe, that the enemie maie not diggelower then thesame, where he shall not finde water, whiche onely isenemie to the caves: for if thou be in a toune, which thou defendest ona high ground, thou canst not remedie it otherwise, then to make withinthy walles many deepe Welles, the whiche be as drouners to thesameCaves, that the enemie is able to ordain against thee. An other remediethere is, to make a cave againste it, when thou shouldeste bee awarewhere he muineth, the whiche waie easely hindereth hym, but difficultlyit is foreseen, beyng besieged of a craftie enemie. He that is besieged,ought above al thinges to have care, not to bee oppressed in the tyme ofreste: as is after a battaile fought, after the watche made, whiche isin the Mornyng at breake of daie, and in the Evenyng betwen daie andnight, and above al, at meale times: in whiche tyme many tounes havebeen wonne, and armies have been of them within ruinated: therefore itis requisite with diligence on all partes, to stande alwaies garded, andin a good part armed. I will not lacke to tell you, how that, whichemaketh a citee or a campe difficult to be defended, is to be driven tokepe sundred all the force, that thou haste in theim, for that theenemie beyng able to assaulte thee at his pleasure altogether, it isconveniente for thee on every side, to garde every place, and so heassaulteth thee with all his force, and thou with parte of thinedefendest thee. Also, the besieged maie bee overcome altogether, hewithout cannot bee, but repulced: wherefore many, whom have beenbesieged, either in a Campe, or in a Toune, although thei have beeninferiour of power, have issued out with their men at a sodaine, andhave overcome the enemie. This Marcellus of Nola did: this did Cesar inFraunce, where his Campe beeyng assaulted of a moste great nomber ofFrenchmen, and seeyng hymself not able to defende it, beyng constrainedto devide his force into many partes, and not to bee able standyngwithin the Listes, with violence to repulce thenemie: he opened thecampe on thone side, and turning towardes thesame parte with all hispower, made so moche violence against them, and with moche valiantnes,that he vanquisshed and overcame them. The constancie also of thebesieged, causeth many tymes displeasure, and maketh afraied them thatdoe besiege. Pompei beyng against Cesar, and Cesars armie beeyng ingreate distresse through famine, there was brought of his bredde toPompei, whom seyng it made of grasse, commaunded, that it should not beeshewed unto his armie, least it shoulde make them afraide, seyng whatenemies they had against theim. Nothyng caused so muche honour to theRomaines in the warre of Aniball, as their constancie: for as muche asin what so ever envious, and adverse fortune thei were troubled, theynever demaunded peace, thei never made anie signe of feare, but ratherwhen Aniball was aboute Rome, thei solde those fieldes, where he hadpitched his campe, dearer then ordinarie in other times shoulde havebeen solde: and they stoode in so much obstinacie in their enterprises,that for to defende Rome, thei would not raise their campe from Capua,the whiche in the verie same time that Roome was besieged, the Romainesdid besiege.I knowe that I have tolde you of manie thynges, the whiche by your selfeyou might have understoode, and considered, notwithstandyng I have doenit (as to daie also I have tolde you) for to be abell to shewe youbetter by meane therof, the qualitie of this armie, and also for tosatisfie those, if there be anie, whome have not had the same commoditieto understand them as you. Nor me thinkes that there resteth other totell you, then certaine generall rules, the whiche you shal have mostefamiliar, which be these.[Sidenote: Generall rules of warre.]The same that helpeth the enemie, hurteth thee: and the same thathelpeth thee, hurteth the enemie.He that shall be in the warre moste vigilant to observe the devises ofthe enemie, and shall take moste payne to exercise his armie, shallincurre least perilles and maie hope moste of the victorie.Never conducte thy men to faight the field, if first them hast notconfirmed their mindes and knowest them to be without feare, and to bein good order: for thou oughteste never to enterprise any dangerousthyng with thy souldiours, but when thou seest, that they hope toovercome.It is better to conquere the enemie with faminne, then with yron: in thevictorie of which, fortune maie doe much more then valiantnesse.No purpose is better then that, whiche is hidde from the enemie untillthou have executed it.To know in the warre how to understande occasion, and to take it,helpeth more then anie other thynge.Nature breedeth few stronge menne, the industrie and the exercise makethmanie.Discipline maie doe more in warre, then furie.When anie departe from the enemies side for to come to serve thee, whenthei be faithfull, thei shalbe unto thee alwaies great gaines: for thatthe power of thadversaries are more deminisshed with the losse of them,that runne awaie, then of those that be slaine, although that the nameof a fugetive be to new frendes suspected, to olde odius.Better it is in pitchyng the fielde, to reserve behynde the first frontaide inoughe, then to make the fronte bigger to disperse the souldiours.He is difficultely overcome, whiche can know his owne power and the sameof the enemie.The valiantenesse of the souldiours availeth more then the multitude.Some times the situacion helpeth more then the valiantenesse.New and sudden thynges, make armies afrayde.Slowe and accustomed thinges, be littell regarded of them. Therfore makethy armie to practise and to know with small faightes a new enemie,before thou come to faight the fielde with him.He that with disorder foloweth the enemie after that he is broken, willdoe no other, then to become of a conquerour a loser.He that prepareth not necessarie victualles to live upon, is overcomewithout yron.He that trusteth more in horsemen then in footemen, more in footementhen in horsemen, must accommodate him selfe with the situacion.When thou wilte see if in the daie there be comen anie spie into theCampe, cause everie man to goe to his lodgynge.Chaunge purpose, when thou perceivest that the enemie hath forseene it.[Sidenote: How to consulte.]Consulte with many of those thinges, which thou oughtest to dooe: thesame that thou wilt after dooe, conferre with fewe.Souldiours when thei abide at home, are mainteined with feare andpunishemente, after when thei ar led to the warre with hope and withrewarde.Good Capitaines come never to faight the fielde, excepte necessitieconstraine theim, and occasion call them.Cause that thenemies know not, how thou wilte order thy armie to faight,and in what so ever maner that thou ordainest it, make that the firstebande may be received of the seconde and of the thirde.In the faight never occupie a battell to any other thyng, then to thesame, for whiche thou haste apoineted it, if thou wilt make no disorder.The sodene accidentes, with difficultie are reamedied: those that arethought upon, with facilitie.[Sidenote: What thynges are the strength of the warre.]Men, yron, money, and bread, be the strengthe of the warre, but of thesefower, the first twoo be moste necessarie: because men and yron, findemoney and breade: but breade and money fynde not men and yron.The unarmed riche man, is a bootie to the poore souldiour.Accustome thy souldiours to dispise delicate livyng and laciviusaparell.This is as muche as hapneth me generally to remember you, and I knowthat there might have ben saied manie other thynges in all this myreasonynge: as should be, howe and in howe manie kinde of waies theantiquitie ordered their bandes, how thei appareled them, and how inmanie other thynges they exercised them, and to have joygned hereuntomanie other particulars, the whiche I have not judged necessarie toshew, as wel for that you your self may se them, as also for that myintente hath not been to shew juste how the olde servis of warre wasapoincted, but howe in these daies a servis of warre might be ordained,whiche should have more vertue then the same that is used. Wherfore Ihave not thought good of the auncient thynges to reason other, thenthat, which I have judged to suche introduction necessarie. I know alsothat I might have delated more upon the service on horsebacke, and afterhave reasoned of the warre on the Sea: for as muche as he thatdestinguissheth the servis of warre, saieth, how there is an armie onthe sea, and of the lande, on foote, and on horsebacke. Of that on thesea, I will not presume to speake, for that I have no knowledge therof:but I will let the Genoues, and the Venecians speake therof, whome withlike studies have heretofore doen great thinges.Also of horses, I wil speake no other, then as afore I have saied, thisparte beynge (as I have declared) least corrupted. Besides this, thefootemen being wel ordained, which is the puissance of the armie, goodhorses of necessitie will come to be made.[Sidenote: Provisions that maie bee made to fill a Realme full of goodhorse; The knowledge that a capitaine oughte to have.]Onely I counsel him that would ordayne the exercise of armes in his ownecountrey, and desireth to fill the same with good horses, that he maketwo provisions: the one is, that he destribute Mares of a good racethroughe his dominion, and accustome his menne to make choise of coltes,as you in this countrie make of Calves and Mules: the other is, that tothentente the excepted might finde a byer, I woulde prohibet that no manshould kepe a Mule excepte he woulde keepe a horse: so that he thatwoulde kepe but one beaste to ride on, shoulde be constrained to keepe ahorse: and moreover that no man should weare fine cloathe except hewhich doeth keepe a horse: this order I under stande hath beene devisedof certaine princes in our time, whome in short space have therby,brought into their countrey an excellente numbre of good horses. Aboutethe other thynges, as much as might be looked for concernynge horse, Iremit to as much as I have saied to daie, and to that whiche they use.Peradventure also you woulde desire to understand what condicions aCapitaine ought to have: wherof I shal satisfie you moste breeflie: forthat I cannot tell how to chose anie other man then the same, whoshoulde know howe to doe all those thynges whiche this daie hath benreasoned of by us: the which also should not suffise, when he should notknowe howe to devise of him selfe: for that no man without invencion,was ever excellent in anie science: and if invencion causeth honour inother thynges, in this above all, it maketh a man honorable: for everieinvention is seen, although it were but simple, to be of writerscelebrated: as it is seen, where Alexander Magnus is praised, who for toremove his Campe moste secretely, gave not warnyng with the Trumpette,but with a hatte upon a Launce. And was praised also for havyng takenorder that his souldiours in buckelynge with the enemies, shoulde kneelewith the lefte legge, to bee able more strongly to withstande theirviolence: the whiche havyng geven him the victorie, it got him also somuche praise, that all the Images, whiche were erected in his honour,stoode after the same facion. But because it is tyme to finishe thisreasonyng, I wil turne againe to my first purpose, and partly I shallavoide the same reproche, wherin they use to condempne in this towne,such as knoweth not when to make an ende.[Sidenote: The auctor retorneth to his first purpose and maketh a litteldiscorse to make an ende of his reasonyng.]If you remembre Cosimus you tolde me, that I beyng of one side anexalter of the antiquitie, and a dispraiser of those, which in waightiematters imitated them not, and of the other side, I havynge not in theaffaires of war, wherin I have taken paine, imitated them, you couldenot perceive the occasion: wherunto I answered, how that men which wildoo any thing, muste firste prepare to knowe how to doe it, for to beable, after to use it, when occasion permitteth: whether I doe know howto bryng the servis of warre to the auncient manners or no, I will bejudged by you, whiche have hearde me upon this matter longe disputewherby you may know, how much time I have consumed in these studies: andalso I beleeve that you maie imagen, how much desire is in me to bryngeit to effecte: the whiche whether I have been able to have doen, or thatever occasion hath been geven me, most easely you maie conjecture: yetfor to make you more certaine and for my better justificacion, I willalso aledge the occasions: and as much as I have promised, I willpartely performe, to shew you the difficultie and the facelitie, whichebee at this presente in suche imitacions.[Sidenote: A prince may easelie brynge to intiere perfection the servisof warre; Two sortes of Capitaines worthie to bee praysed.]Therfore I saie, how that no deede that is doen now a daies emong men,is more easie to be reduced unto the aunciente maners, then the serviceof Warre: but by them onely that be Princes of so moche state, who canat least gather together of their owne subjectes, xv. or twentiethousande yong menne: otherwise, no thyng is more difficulte, then this,to them whiche have not soche commoditie: and for that you maie thebetter understande this parte, you have to knowe, howe that there bee oftwoo condicions, Capitaines to bee praised: The one are those, that withan armie ordained through the naturalle discipline thereof, have dooengreate thynges: as were the greater parte of the Romaine Citezeins, andsuche as have ledde armies, the which have had no other paine, then tomaintaine them good, and to se them guided safely: the other are they,whiche not onely have had to overcome the enemie, but before they cometo the same, have been constrained to make good and well ordered theirarmie: who without doubte deserve muche more praise, then those havedeserved, which with olde armies, and good, have valiantely wrought. Ofthese, such wer Pelopida, and Epaminonda, Tullus Hostillius, Phillip ofMacedony father of Alexander, Cirus kyng of the Percians, Graccus aRomaine: they all were driven first to make their armies good, and afterto faighte with them: they all coulde doe it, as well throughe theirprudence, as also for havynge subjectes whome thei might in likeexercises instruct: nor it shuld never have ben otherwise possible, thatanie of theim, though they had ben never so good and ful of alexcellencie, should have been able in a straunge countrey, full of mencorrupted, not used to anie honest obedience, to have brought to passeanie laudable worke. It suffiseth not then in Italie, to know how togoverne an army made, but first it is necessarie to know how to make itand after to know how to commaunde it: and to do these things it isrequisit they bee those princes, whome havyng much dominion, andsubjectes inoughe, maie have commoditie to doe it: of whiche I can notbee, who never commaunded, nor cannot commaunde, but to armies ofstraungers, and to men bounde to other, and not to me: in whiche if itbe possible, or no, to introduce anie of those thynges that this daie ofme hath ben reasoned, I will leave it to your judgement.Albeit when coulde I make one of these souldiours which now a daiespractise, to weare more armur then the ordinarie, and besides the armur,to beare their owne meate for two or three daies, with a mattocke: Whencoulde I make theim to digge, or keepe theim every daie manie howersarmed, in fained exercises, for to bee able after in the verie thyng indeede to prevaile? When woulde thei abstaine from plaie, fromlaciviousnesse, from swearynge, from the insolence, whiche everie daiethey committe? when would they be reduced into so muche dissepline, intoso much obedience and reverence, that a tree full of appels in themiddest of their Campe, shoulde be founde there and lefte untouched? Asis redde, that in the auncient armies manie times hapned. What thyngemaye I promis them, by meane wherof thei may have me in reverence tolove, or to feare, when the warre beyng ended, they have not anie moreto doe with me? wher of maie I make them ashamed, whiche be borne andbrought up without shame? whie shoulde thei be ruled by me who knowe menot? By what God or by what sainctes may I make them to sweare? By thosethat thei worship, or by those that they blaspheme? Who they worship Iknowe not anie: but I knowe well they blaspheme all. How shoulde Ibeleeve that thei will keepe their promise to them, whome everie howerthey dispise? How can they, that dispise God, reverence men? Then whatgood fashion shoulde that be, whiche might be impressed in this matter?And if you should aledge unto me that Suyzzers and Spaniardes bee goodsouldiours, I woulde confesse unto you, how they be farre better thenthe Italians: but if you note my reasonynge, and the maner of procedyngof bothe, you shall see, howe they lacke many thynges to joygne to theperfection of the antiquetie. And how the Suyzzers be made good of oneof their naturall uses caused of that, whiche to daie I tolde you: thoseother are made good by mean of a necessitie: for that servyng in astraunge countrie, and seemyng unto them to be constrained either todie, or to overcome, thei perceivynge to have no place to flie, doebecome good: but it is a goodnesse in manie partes fawtie: for that inthe same there is no other good, but that they bee accustomed to tariethe enemie at the Pike and sweardes poincte: nor that, which thei lacke,no man should be meete to teache them, and so much the lesse, he thatcoulde not speake their language.[Sidenote: The Auctor excuseth the people of Italie to the greatreproche of their prynces for their ignorance in the affaires of warre.]But let us turne to the Italians, who for havynge not had wise Princes,have not taken anie good order: and for havyng not had the samenecessitie, whiche the Spaniardes have hadde, they have not taken it oftheim selves, so that they remaine the shame of the worlde: and thepeople be not to blame, but onely their princes, who have ben chastised,and for their ignorance have ben justely punisshed, leesinge mosteshamefully their states, without shewing anie vertuous ensample. And ifyou will see whether this that I say be trew: consider how manie warreshave ben in Italie since the departure of kyng Charles to this day,where the war beyng wonte to make men warlyke and of reputacion, thesethe greater and fierser that they have been, so muche the more they havemade the reputacion of the members and of the headdes therof to beeloste. This proveth that it groweth, that the accustomed orders were notnor bee not good, and of the newe orders, there is not anie whiche haveknowen how to take them. Nor never beleeve that reputacion will begotten, by the Italians weapons, but by the same waie that I haveshewed, and by means of theim, that have great states in Italie: forthat this forme maie be impressed in simple rude men, of their owne, andnot in malicious, ill brought up, and straungers. Nor there shall neverbee founde anie good mason, whiche will beleeve to be able to make afaire image of a peece of Marbell ill hewed, but verye well of a rudepeece.[Sidenote: A discription of the folishenesse of the Italian princes;Cesar and Alexander, were the formoste in battell; The Venecians and theduke of Ferare began to have reduced the warfare to the Auncientemaners; He that despiseth the servis of warre, despiseth his ownwelthe.]Our Italian Princes beleved, before thei tasted the blowes of theoutlandishe warre, that it should suffice a Prince to knowe bywritynges, how to make a subtell answere, to write a goodly letter, toshewe in saiynges, and in woordes, witte and promptenesse, to knowe howto canvas a fraude, to decke theim selves with precious stones and gold,to slepe and to eate with greater glorie then other: To keepe manylascivious persones aboute them, to governe theim selves with theirsubjectes, covetuously and proudely: To rotte in idlenesse, to give thedegrees of the exercise of warre, for good will, to despise if anyshould have shewed them any laudable waie, minding that their wordesshould bee aunswers of oracles: nor the sely wretches were not aware,that thei prepared theim selves to bee a praie, to whom so ever shouldassaulte theim. Hereby grewe then in the thousande fower hundred nintieand fower yere, the greate feares, the sodain flightes, and themarveilous losses: and so three most mightie states which were inItalie, have been divers times sacked and destroied. But that which isworse, is where those that remaine, continue in the verie same erroure,and live in the verie same disorder, and consider not, that those, whoin old time would kepe their states, caused to be dooen these thynges,which of me hath been reasoned, and that their studies wer, to preparethe body to diseases, and the minde not to feare perilles. Whereby grewethat Cesar, Alexander, and all those menne and excellente Princes in oldtyme, were the formoste emongest the faighters, goyng armed on foote:and if thei loste their state, thei would loose their life, so that theilived and died vertuously. And if in theim, or in parte of theim, theremight bee condempned to muche ambicion to reason of: yet there shallnever bee founde, that in theim is condempned any tendernesse or anythynge that maketh menne delicate and feable: the whiche thyng, if ofthese Princes were redde and beleved, it should be impossible, that theishould not change their forme of living, and their provinces not tochaunge fortune. And for that you in the beginnyng of this ourreasonyng, lamented your ordinaunces, I saie unto you, that if you hadordained it, as I afore have reasoned, and it had given of it self nogood experience, you might with reason have been greved therewith: butif it bee not so ordained, and exercised, as I have saied, it maie begreeved with you, who have made a counterfaite thereof, and no perfectefigure. The Venecians also, and the Duke of Ferare, beganne it, andfollowed it not, the whiche hath been through their faulte, not throughtheir menne. And therfore I assure you, that who so ever of those,whiche at this daie have states in Italie, shall enter firste into thiswaie, shall be firste, before any other, Lorde of this Province, and itshall happen to his state, as to the kyngdome of the Macedonians, thewhich commyng under Philip, who had learned the maner of settyng armiesin order of Epaminondas a Thebane, became with this order, and withthese exercises (whileste the reste of Grece stoode in idlenesse, andattended to risite comedes) so puisant, that he was able in few yeres topossesse it all, and to leave soche foundacion to his sonne, that he wasable to make hymself, prince of all the world. He then that despiseththese studies, if he be a Prince, despiseth his Princedome: if he bee aCitezein, his Citee. Wherefore, I lamente me of nature, the whicheeither ought not to have made me a knower of this, or it ought to havegiven me power, to have been able to have executed it: For now beyngolde, I cannot hope to have any occasion, to bee able so to dooe: Inconsideracion whereof, I have been liberall with you, who beeyng graveyong menne, maie (when the thynges saied of me shall please you) at duetymes in favour of your Princes, helpe theim and counsaile them, whereinI would have you not to bee afraied, or mistrustfull, bicause thisProvince seemes to bee altogether given, to raise up againe the thyngesdedde, as is seen by the perfeccion that poesie, paintyng, and writing,is now brought unto: Albeit, as moche as is looked for of me, beyngstrooken in yeres, I do mistruste. Where surely, if Fortune hadheretofore graunted me so moche state, as suffiseth for a likeenterprise, I would not have doubted, but in moste shorte tyme, to haveshewed to the worlde, how moche the aunciente orders availe: and withoutperadventure, either I would have increased it with glory, or loste itwithout shame.       *       *       *       *       *The ende of the seventh and laste booke of the arte of warre, ofNicholas Machiavell, Citezein and Secretarie of Florence, translated outof Italian into Englishe: By Peter Whitehorne, felow of Graise Inne.NICHOLAS MACHIAVEL,CITEZEIN AND SECRETARIE OF FLORENCE,TO THE READERSTo thentente that such as rede this booke maie without difficultieunderstande the order of the battailes, or bandes of men, and of thearmies, and lodgynges in the Campe, accordynge as they in thediscription of theim are apoincted, I thinke it necessarie to shewe youthe figure of everie one of them: wherefore it is requiset firste, todeclare unto you, by what poinctes and letters, the footemen, thehorsemen, and everie other particuler membre are set foorthe.KNOW THERFORE THAT.} Signifieth {Targetmen.'} {Pikemen.c} {a Capitaine of ten men.v} {Veliti ordinarie.

Having then a mind tooffer up my self to your Magnificence, with some testimony of my serviceto you, I found nothing in my whole inventory, that I think better of,or more esteeme, than the knowlege of great mens actions, which I havelearned by a long experience of modern affairs, and a continual readingof those of the ancients. Which, now that I have with great diligencelong workt it out, and throughly sifted, I commend to your Magnificence.And, however I may well think this work unworthy of your view; yet suchis your humanity, that I doubt not but it shall find acceptance,considering, that for my part I am not able to tender a greater gift,than to present you with the means, whereby in a very short time you maybe able to understand all that, which I, in the space of many years, andwith many sufferances and dangers, have made proof and gaind theknowledge of. And this work I have not set forth either with elegancy ofdiscourse or stile, nor with any other ornament whereby to captivate thereader, as others use, because I would not have it gain its esteem fromelsewhere than from the truth of the matter, and the gravity of thesubject. Nor can this be thought presumption, if a man of humble and lowcondition venture to dilate and discourse upon the governments ofPrinces; for even as they that with their pensils designe out countreys,get themselves into the plains below to consider the nature of themountains, and other high places above; and again to consider the plainsbelow, they get up to the tops of the mountains; in like manner tounderstand the nature of the people, it is fit to be a Prince; and toknow well the dispositions of Princes, sutes best with the understandingof a subject. Your Magnificence then may be pleased, to receive thissmall present, with the same mind that I send it; which if you shallthroughly peruse and consider, you shall perceive therein that Iexceedingly wish, that you may attain to that greatness, which your ownfortune, and your excellent endowments promise you: and if yourMagnificence from the very point of your Highness shall sometime castyour eyes upon these inferior places, you shall see how undeservedly Iundergoe an extream and continual despight of Fortune.THE TABLE OF THE CHAPTERSCHAP. 1.How many sorts of Principalities there are, and how many wayes they areattained to, 263CHAP. 2.Of hereditary Principalities, 264CHAP. 3.Of mixt Principalities, 265CHAP. 4.Wherefore Darius his Kingdome, taken by Alexander, rebelled not againsthis successors after Alexanders death, 273CHAP. 5.In what manner Cities and Principalities are to be governed, whichbefore they were conquered, lived under their own laws, 276CHAP. 6.Of new Principalities that are conquered by ones own armes and valor,277CHAP. 7.Of new Principalities gotten by fortune and other mens forces, 281CHAP. 8.Concerning those who by wicked means have attaind to a Principality, 289CHAP. 9.Of the Civil Principality, 293CHAP. 10.In what manner the forces of all Principalities ought to be measured,297CHAP. 11.Concerning Ecclesiastical Principalities, 299CHAP. 12.How many sorts of Military discipline there be; and touching mercenarysoldiers, 302CHAP. 13.Of Auxiliary Soldiers, mixt and natives, 307CHAP. 14.What belongs to the Prince touching military discipline, 310CHAP. 15.Of those things in respect whereof men, and especially Princes areprais'd or disprais'd, 313CHAP. 16.Of Liberality and Miserableness, 315CHAP. 17.Of Cruelty and Clemency, and whether it is better to be belov'd orfeared, 318CHAP. 18.In what manner Princes ought to keep their word, 321CHAP. 19.That Princes should take a care not to incur contempt or hatred, 325CHAP. 20.Whether the Citadels and many other things, which Princes make use of,are profitable or dammageable, 335CHAP. 21.How a Prince ought to behave himself to gain reputation, 339CHAP. 22.Touching Princes Secretaries, 343CHAP. 23.That Flatterers are to be avoyded, 344CHAP. 24.Wherefore the Princes of Italy have lost their States, 347CHAP. 25.How great power Fortune hath in humane affairs, and what means there isto resist it, 349CHAP. 26.An exhortation to free Italy from the Barbarions, 353THE PRINCEWritten byNICHOLAS MACHIAVELLI,Secretary and Citizen of Florence.CHAP. IHow many sorts of Principalities there are, and how many wayes they areattained to.All States, all Dominions that have had, or now have rule over men, havebeen and are, either Republiques or Principalities. Principalities areeither hereditary, whereof they of the blood of the Lord thereof havelong time been Princes; or else they are new; and those that are new,are either all new, as was the Dutchy of Millan to Francis Sforce; orare as members adjoyned to the hereditary State of the Prince that gainsit; as the Kingdom of Naples is to the King of Spain. These Dominions sogotten, are accustomed either to live under a Prince, or to enjoy theirliberty; and are made conquest of, either with others forces, or onesown, either by fortune, or by valor.CHAP. IIOf Hereditary Principalities.I will not here discourse of Republiques, because I have other wheretreated of them at large: I will apply my self only to a Principality,and proceed, while I weave this web, by arguing thereupon, how thesePrincipallities can be governed and maintained. I say then that inStates of inheritance, and accustomed to the blood of their Princes,there are far fewer difficulties to keep them, than in the new: for itsuffices only not to transgress the course his Ancestors took, and soafterward to temporise with those accidents that can happen; that ifsuch a Prince be but of ordinary industry, he shall allwaies be able tomaintain himself in his State, unless by some extraordinary or excessivepower he be deprived thereof; and when he had lost it, upon the leastsinister chance that befalls the usurper, he recovers it again. We havein Italy the Duke of Ferrara for example hereof, who was of ability toresist the Venetians, in the year 84, and to withstand Pope Julius inthe tenth for no other reason, than because he had of old continued inthat rule; for the natural Prince hath fewer occasions, and less heed togive offence, whereupon of necessity he must be more beloved; and unlessit be that some extravagant vices of his bring him into hatred, it isagreeable to reason, that naturally he should be well beloved by his ownsubjects: and in the antiquity and continuation of the Dominion, theremembrances and occasions of innovations are quite extinguished: forevermore one change leaves a kind of breach or dent, to fasten thebuilding of another.CHAP. IIIOf mixt Principalities.But the difficulties consist in the new Principality; and first, if itbe not all new, but as a member, so that it may be termed altogether asmixt; and the variations thereof proceed in the first place from anatural difficulty, which we commonly finde in all new Principalities;for men do willingly change their Lord, beleeving to better theircondition; and this beliefe causes them to take armes against him thatrules over them, whereby they deceive themselves, because they findafter by experience, they have made it worse: which depends upon anothernatural and ordinary necessity, forcing him alwaies to offend those,whose Prince he newly becomes, as well by his soldiers he is put toentertain upon them as by many other injuries, which a new conquestdraws along with it; in such manner as thou findest all those thineenemies, whom thou hast endammaged in the seizing of that Principality,and afterwards canst not keep them thy friends that have seated thee init, for not being able to satisfie them according to their expectations,nor put in practice strong remedies against them, being obliged to them.For however one be very well provided with strong armies, yet hath healwaies need of the favor of the inhabitants in the Countrey, to enterthereinto. For these reasons, Lewis the twelfth, King of France,suddenly took Milan, and as soon lost it; and the first time Lodwick hisown forces served well enough to wrest it out of his hands; for thosepeople that had opened him the gates, finding themselves deceived oftheir opinion, and of that future good which they had promisedthemselves, could not endure the distastes the new Prince gave them.True it is, that Countreys that have rebelled again the second time,being recovered, are harder lost; for their Lord, taking occasion fromtheir rebellion, is less respective of persons, but cares only to securehimself, by punishing the delinquents, to clear all suspicions, and toprovide for himself where he thinks he is weakest: so that if to makeFrance lose Milan the first time, it was enough for Duke Lodwick to makesome small stir only upon the confines; yet afterwards, before theycould make him lose it the second time, they had need of the whole worldtogether against him, and that all his armies should be wasted anddriven out of Italy; which proceeded from the forenamed causes: howeverthough both the first and second time it was taken from him. Thegenerall causes of the first we have treated of; it remains now that wesee those of the second; and set down the remedies that he had, or anyone else can have that should chance to be in those termes he was,whereby he might be able to maintain himself better in his conquest thanthe King of France did. I say therefore, that these States which byConquest are annexed to the ancient states of their conqueror, areeither of the same province and the same language, or otherwise; andwhen they are, it is very easy to hold them, especially when they arenot used to live free; and to enjoy them securely, it is enough to haveextinguished the Princes line who ruled over them: For in other matters,allowing them their ancient conditions, and there being not muchdifference of manners betwixt them, men ordinarily live quiet enough; aswe have seen that Burgundy did, Britany, Gascony, and Normandy, which solong time continued with France: for however there be some difference oflanguage between them, yet can they easily comport one with another; andwhosoever makes the conquest of them, meaning to hold them, must havetwo regards; the first, that the race of their former Prince be quiteextinguished; the other, that he change nothing, neither in their lawesnor taxes, so that in a very short time they become one entire body withtheir ancient Principality. But when any States are gaind in a Provincedisagreeing in language, manners, and orders, here are the difficulties,and here is there need of good fortune, and great industry to maintainthem; and it would be one of the best and livelyest remedies, for theConqueror to goe in person and dwell there; this would make thepossession hereof more secure and durable; as the Turk hath done inGreece, who among all the other courses taken by him for to hold thatState, had he not gone thither himself in person to dwell, it had neverbeen possible for him to have kept it: for abiding there, he sees thedisorders growing in their beginnings, and forthwith can remedy them;whereas being not there present, they are heard of when they are grownto some height, and then is there no help for them. Moreover, theProvince is not pillaged by the officers thou sendest thither: thesubjects are much satisfied of having recourse to the Prince near athand, whereupon have they more reason to love him, if they mean to begood; and intending to do otherwise, to fear him: and forrein Princeswill be well aware how they invade that State; insomuch, that making hisabode there, he can very hardly lose it. Another remedy, which is also abetter, is to send Colonies into one or two places, which may be as itwere the keys of that State; for it is necessary either to do this, orto maintain there many horse and foot. In these colonies the Princemakes no great expence, and either without his charge, or at a verysmall rate, he may both send and maintain them; and gives offence onlyto them from whom he takes their fields and houses, to bestow them onthose new inhabitants who are but a very small part of that State; andthose that he offends, remaining dispersed and poore, can never hurthim: and all the rest on one part, have no offence given them, andtherefore a small matter keeps them in quiet: on the other side, theyare wary not to erre, for fear it befalls not them, as it did those thatwere dispoild. I conclude then, that those colonies that are notchargeable, are the more trusty, give the less offence; and they thatare offended, being but poor and scattered, can do but little harme, asI have said; for it is to be noted, that men must either be dallyed andflattered withall, or else be quite crusht; for they revenge themselvesof small dammages; but of great ones they are not able; so that whenwrong is done to any man, it ought so to be done, that it need fear noreturn of revenge again. But in lieu of Colonies, by maintainingsoldiers there, the expence is great; for the whole revenues of thatState are to be spent in the keeping of it; so the conquest proves but aloss to him that hath got it, and endammages him rather; for it hurtsthat whole State to remove the army from place to place, of whichannoyance every one hath a feeling, and so becomes enemie to thee; asthey are enemies, I wis, who are outraged by thee in their own houses,whensoever they are able to do thee mischief. Every way then is thisguard unprofitable. Besides, he that is in a different Province, (as itis said) should make himself Head and defender of his less powerfullneighbors, and devise alwaies to weaken those that are more mightytherein, and take care that upon no chance there enter not any foreineras mighty as himself; for it will alwaies come to pass, that they shallbe brought in by those that are discontented, either upon ambition, orfear; as the Etolians brought the Romans into Greece; and they werebrought into every countrey they came, by the Natives; and the course ofthe matter is, that so soon as a powerfull Stranger enters a countrey,all those that are the less powerfull there, cleave to him, provoked byan envy they beare him that is more mighty than they; so that for theseof the weaker sort, he may easily gain them without any pains: forpresently all of them together very willingly make one lump with that hehath gotten: He hath only to beware that these increase not theirstrengths, nor their authorities, and so he shall easily be able by hisown forces, and their assistances, to take down those that are mighty,and remain himself absolute arbitre of that Countrey. And he that playesnot well this part, shall quickly lose what he hath gotten; and while heholds it, shall find therein a great many troubles and vexations. TheRomans in the Provinces they seiz'd on, observed well these points, sentcolonies thither, entertained the weaker sort, without augmenting anything their power, abated the forces of those that were mighty, andpermitted not any powerfull forreiner to gain too much reputation there.And I will content my self only with the countrey of Greece for examplehereof. The Achayans and Etolians were entertained by them, the Macedonskingdome was brought low, Antiochus was driven thence, nor ever did theAchayans or Etolians deserts prevail so far for them, that they wouldever promise to enlarge their State, nor the perswasions of Philipinduce them ever to be his friends, without bringing him lower; nor yetcould Antiochus his power make them ever consent that he should hold anyState in that countrey: for the Romans did in these cases that which alljudicious Princes ought to do, who are not only to have regard unto allpresent mischiefs, but also to the future, and to provide for those withall industry; for by taking order for those when they are afarre off, itis easie to prevent them; but by delaying till they come near hand tothee, the remedy comes too late; for this malignity is grown incurable:and it befalls this, as the physicians say of the hectick feaver, thatin the beginning it is easily cur'd, but hardly known; but in the courseof time, not having been known in the beginning, nor cured, it becomeseasie to know, but hard to cure. Even so falls it out in matters ofState; for by knowing it aloof off (which is given only to a wise man todo) the mischiefs that then spring up, are quickly helped; but when, fornot having been perceived, they are suffered to increase, so that everyone sees them, there is then no cure for them: therefore the Romans,seeing these inconvenients afar off, alwaies prevented them, and neversufferd them to follow; for to escape a war, because they knew that awar is not undertaken, but deferred for anothers advantage; thereforewould they rather make a war with Philip and Antiochus in Greece, to theend it should not afterwards be made with them in Italy, though for thattime they were able to avoid both the one and the other, which theythought not good to do: nor did they approve of that saying that isordinarily in the mouthes of the Sages of our dayes, _to enjoy thebenefits of the present time_; but that rather, to take the benefit oftheir valor and wisdome; for time drives forward everything, and maybring with it as well good as evil, and evil as good. But let us returnto France, and examine if any of the things prescribed have been done bythem: and we will speak of Lewis, and not of Charles, as of whom byreason of the long possession he held in Italy we better knew the wayeshe went: and you shall see he did the clean contrary to what should havebeen done by him that would maintain a State of different Language andconditions. King Lewis was brought into Italy by the Venetians ambition,who would have gotten for their shares half the State of Lombardy: Iwill not blame his comming, or the course he took, because he had a mindto begin to set a foot in Italy; but having not any friends in thecountry, all gates being barred against him, by reason of King Charleshis carriage there, he was constrained to joyn friendship with those hecould; and this consideration well taken, would have proved lucky tohim, when in the rest of his courses he had not committed any error. TheKing then having conquered Lombardy, recovered presently all thatreputation that Charles had lost him; Genua yeelded to him, theFlorentines became friends with him; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke ofFerrara, the Bentivolti, the Lady of Furli, the Lord of Faenza, PesaroRimino, Camerino, and Piombino, the Lucheses, Pisans and Sienses, everyone came and offered him friendship: then might the Venetians considerthe rashness of the course they had taken, who, only to get into theirhands two Townes in Lombardy, made the King Lord of two thirds in Italy.Let any man now consider with how small difficulty could the King havemaintained his reputation in Italy, if he had followed these aforenamedrules, and secured and defended those his friends, who because theirnumber was great, and they weak and fearful, some of the Church, andothers of the Venetians were alwaies forced to hold with him, and bytheir means he might easily have been able to secure himself againstthose that were mightiest: but he was no sooner got into Milan, than hetook a quite wrong course, by giving ayd to Pope Alexander, to seizeupon Romania, and perceiv'd not that by this resolution he weaknedhimself, ruining his own friends, and those had cast themselves into hisbosom, making the Church puissant, by adding to their Spiritual power,they gaind their authority, and so much temporal estate. And having oncegot out of the way, he was constrained to go on forward; insomuch as tostop Alexanders ambition, and that he should not become Lord of allTuscany, of force he was to come into Italy: and this sufficed him not,to have made the Church mighty, and taken away his own friends; but forthe desire he had to get the Kingdome of Naples, he divided it with theKing of Spain: and where before he was the sole arbitre of Italy, hebrought in a competitor, to the end that all the ambitious persons ofthat country, and all that were ill affected to him, might haveotherwhere to make their recourse: and whereas he might have left inthat Kingdome some Vice-King of his own, he took him from thence, toplace another there, that might afterward chace him thence. It is athing indeed very natural and ordinary, to desire to be of the gettinghand: and alwaies when men undertake it, if they can effect it, theyshall be prais'd for it, or at least not blam'd: but when they are notable, and yet will undertake it, here lies the blame, here is the errorcommitted. If France then was able with her own power to assail theKingdome of Naples, she might well have done it; but not being able, sheshould not have divided it: and if the division she made of Lombardywith the Venetians, deserv'd some excuse, thereby to set one foot inItaly; yet this merits blame, for not being excused by that necessity.Lewis then committed these five faults; extinguisht the feebler ones,augmented the State of another that was already powerful in Italy,brought thereinto a very puissant forreiner, came not thither himself todwell there, nor planted any colonies there: which faults while heliv'd, he could not but be the worse for; yet all could not have gone soill, had he not committed the sixt, to take from the Venetians theirState; for if he had not enlarg'd the Churches territories nor broughtthe Spaniard into Italy, it had bin necessary to take them lower; buthaving first taken those other courses, he should never have given wayto their destruction; for while they had been strong, they would alwaieshave kept the others off from venturing on the conquest of Lombardy. Forthe Venetians would never have given their consents thereto, unless theyshould have been made Lords of it themselves; and the others would neverhave taken it from France, to give it them: and then they would neverhave dar'd to go and set upon them both together. And if any one shouldsay, that King Lewis yeelded Romania to Alexander, and the Kingdome ofNaples to Spain, to avoid a war; I answer with the reasons abovealledged, that one should never suffer any disorder to follow, foravoiding of a war; for that war is not sav'd, but put off to thydisadvantage. And if any others argue, that the King had given his wordto the Pope, to do that exploit for him, for dissolving of his marriage,and for giving the Cardinals Cap to him of Roan; I answer with thatwhich hereafter I shall say touching Princes words, how they ought to bekept. King Lewis then lost Lombardy, for not having observ'd some ofthose termes which others us'd, who have possessed themselves ofcountries, and desir'd to keep them. Nor is this any strange thing, butvery ordinary and reasonable: and to this purpose I spake at Nantes withthat French Cardinal, when Valentine (for so ordinarily was Caesar BorgiaPope Alexanders son call'd) made himself master of Romania; for when theCardinal said to me, that the Italians understood not the feats of war;I answered, the Frenchmen understood not matters of State: for had theybeen well vers'd therein, they would never have suffer'd the Church tohave grown to that greatness. And by experience we have seen it, thatthe power hereof in Italy, and that of Spain also, was caused by France,and their own ruine proceeded from themselves. From whence a generalrule may be taken, which never, or very seldom fails, _That he thatgives the means to another to become powerful, ruines himself_; for thatpower is caus'd by him either with his industry, or with his force; andas well the one as the other of these two is suspected by him that isgrown puissant.CHAP. IVWherefore Darius his Kingdome taken by Alexander, rebelled not againstAlexanders Successors after his death.The difficulties being consider'd, which a man hath in the maintainingof a State new gotten, some might marvaile how it came to pass, thatAlexander the great subdued all Asia in a few years; and having hardlypossessed himself of it, died; whereupon it seemed probable that allthat State should have rebelled; nevertheless his Successors kept thepossession of it, nor found they other difficulty in holding it, thanwhat arose among themselves through their own ambition. I answer, thatall the Principalities whereof we have memory left us, have beengoverned in two several manners; either by a Prince, and all the restVassals, who as ministers by his favor and allowance, do help to governthat Kingdom; or by a Prince and by Barons, who not by their Princesfavor, but by the antiquity of blood hold that degree. And these kindsof Barons have both states of their own, and Vassals who acknowledgethem for their Lords; and bare them a true natural affection. ThoseStates that are govern'd by a Prince and by Vassals, have their Princeruling over them with more authority; for in all his countrey, there isnone acknowledged for superior, but himself: and if they yeeld obedienceto any one else, it is but as to his minister and officer, nor bearethey him any particular good will. The examples of these two differentGovernments now in our dayes, are, the Turk, and the King of France. TheTurks whole Monarchy is govern'd by one Lord, and the rest are all hisVassals; and dividing his whole Kingdom into divers Sangiacques orGovernments, he sends several thither, and those he chops and changes,as he pleases. But the King of France is seated in the midst of amultitude of Lords, who of old have been acknowledg'd for such by theirsubjects, and being belov'd by them, enjoy their preheminencies; nor canthe King take their States from them without danger. He then thatconsiders the one and the other of these two States, shall finddifficulty in the conquest of the Turks State; but when once it issubdu'd, great facility to hold it. The reasons of these difficulties intaking of the Turks Kingdom from him, are, because the Invader cannot becalled in by the Princes of that Kingdom, nor hope by the rebellion ofthose which he hath about him, to be able to facilitate his enterprize:which proceeds from the reasons aforesaid; for they being all hisslaves, and oblig'd to him, can more hardly be corrupted; and put casethey were corrupted, little profit could he get by it, they not beingable to draw after them any people, for the reasons we have shewed:whereupon he that assails the Turk, must think to find him united; andmust rather relie upon his own forces, than in the others disorders: butwhen once he is overcome and broken in the field, so that he cannotrepair his armies, there is nothing else to be doubted than the Royalblood, which being once quite out, there is none else left to be feard,none of the others having any credit with the people. And as theconqueror before the victory could not hope in them; so after it, oughthe not to fear them. The contrary falls out in Kingdoms governed as isthat of France: for it is easie to be enterd by the gaining of any Baronin the Kingdom; for there are alwaies some malecontents to be found, andthose that are glad of innovation. Those for the reasons alledg'd areable to open thee a way into that State, and to further thy victory,which afterwards to make good to thee, draws with it exceeding manydifficulties, as well with those that have ayded thee, as those thouhast supprest. Nor is it enough for thee to root out the Princes race:for there remaine still those Lords who quickly will be the ring-leadersof new changes; and in case thou art not able to content these, norextinguish them, thou losest that State, whensoever the occasion isofferd. Now if thou shalt consider what sort of government that ofDarius was, thou shalt find it like to the Turks dominion, and thereforeAlexander was necessitated first to defeat him utterly, and drive himout of the field; after which victory Darius being dead, that State wasleft secure to Alexander, for the reasons we treated of before: and hissuccessors, had they continued in amity, might have enjoy'd it at ease:nor ever arose there in that Kingdome other tumults, than those theythemselves stir'd up. But of the States that are order'd and grounded asthat of France, it is impossible to become master at such ease: and fromhence grew the frequent rebellions of Spain, France, and Greece againstthe Romans, by reason of the many Principalities those States had:whereof while the memory lasted, the Romans were alwayes doubtfull ofthe possession of them; but the memory of them being quite wip't out, bythe power and continuance of the Empire, at length they enjoy'd itsecurely; and they also were able afterwards fighting one with another,each of one them to draw after them the greater part of those provinces,according as their authority had gain'd them credit therein: and thatbecause the blood of their ancient Lords was quite spent, theyacknowledg'd no other but the Romans. By the consideration then of thesethings, no man will marvaile that Alexander had so little trouble tokeep together the State of Asia; and that others have had such greatdifficulties to maintain their conquest, as Pyrrhus, and many others;which proceeds not from the small or great valour of the conquerour, butfrom the difference of the subject.CHAP. VIn what manner Cities and Principalities are to be govern'd, which,before they were conquer'd, liv'd under their own Laws.When those States that are conquered, as it is said, have beenaccustomed to live under their own Laws, and in liberty, there are threewayes for a man to hold them. The first is to demolish all their strongplaces; the other, personally to goe and dwell there; the third, tosuffer them to live under their own Laws, drawing from them sometribute, and creating therein an Oligarchy, that may continue it in thyservice: for that State being created by that Prince, knowes it cannotconsist without his aid and force, who is like to doe all he can tomaintain it; and with more facility is a City kept by meanes of her ownCitizens, which hath been us'd before to live free, than by any otherway of keeping. We have for example the Spartans and the Romans; theSpartans held Athens and Thebes, creating there an Oligarchy: yet theylost it. The Romans to be sure of Capua, Carthage, and Numantia,dismantell'd them quite, and so lost them not: they would have keptGreece as the Spartans had held them, leaving them free, and lettingthem enjoy their own Laws; and it prospered not with them: so that theywere forc'd to deface many Cities of that province to hold it. For intruth there is not a surer way to keep them under, than bydemolishments; and whoever becomes master of a City us'd to live free,and dismantells it not, let him look himselfe to bee ruin'd by it; forit alwayes in time of rebellion takes the name of liberty for refuge,and the ancient orders it had; which neither by length of time, nor forany favours afforded them, are ever forgotten; and for any thing thatcan be done, or order'd, unlesse the inhabitants be disunited anddispers'd, that name is never forgotten, nor those customes: butpresently in every chance recourse is thither made: as Pisa did after somany yeeres that she had been subdu'd by the Florentines. But when theCities or the Provinces are accustomed to live under a Prince, and thatwhole race is quite extirpated: on one part being us'd to obey; on theother, not having their old Prince; they agree not to make one fromamong themselves: they know not how to live in liberty, in such mannerthat they are much slower to take armes; and with more facility may aPrince gaine them, and secure himselfe of them. But in Republiques thereis more life in them, more violent hatred, more earnest desire ofrevenge; nor does the remembrance of the ancient liberty ever leavethem, or suffer them to rest; so that the safest way, is, either toruine them, or dwell among them.CHAP. VIOf new Principalities, that are conquer'd by ones own armes and valour.Let no man marvaile, if in the discourse I shall make of newPrincipalities, both touching a Prince, and touching a State, I shallalledge very famous examples: for seeing men almost alwayes walk in thepathes beaten by others, and proceed in their actions by imitation; andbeing that others wayes cannot bee exactly follow'd, nor their vertues,whose patterne thou set'st before thee, attain'd unto; a wise man oughtalwayes to tread the footsteps of the worthiest persons, and imitatethose that have been the most excellent: to the end that if his vertuearrive not thereto, at least it may yeeld some favour thereof, and doeas good Archers use, who thinking the place they intend to hit, toofarre distant, and knowing how farr the strength of their bow willcarry, they lay their ayme a great deale higher than the mark; not forto hit so high with their arrow, but to bee able with the help of sohigh an aime to reach the place they shoot at. I say, that inPrincipalities wholly new, where there is a new Prince, there is moreand lesse difficulty in maintaining them, as the vertue of theirConquerour is greater or lesser. And because this successe, to become aPrince of a private man, presupposes either vertue, or fortune; meethinks the one and other of these two things in part should mitigatemany difficulties; however he that hath lesse stood upon fortune, hathmaintain'd himselfe the better. Moreover it somewhat facilitates thematter in that the Prince is constrain'd, because he hath not otherdominions, in person to come and dwell there. But to come to these whoby their own vertues, and not by fortune, attain'd to be Princes; theexcellentest of these are Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and such like;and though of Moses we are not to reason, he onely executing the thingsthat were commanded him by God; yet merits he well to be admir'd, wereit only for that grace that made him worthy to converse with God. Butconsidering Cyrus, and the others, who either got or founded Kingdomes,we shall find them all admirable; and if there particular actions andLawes be throughly weigh'd, they will not appeare much differing fromthose of Moyses, which he receiv'd from so Sovraigne an instructer. Andexamining their lives and actions, it will not appeare, that they hadother help of fortune, than the occasion, which presented them with thematter wherein they might introduce what forme they then pleas'd; andwithout that occasion, the vertue of their mind had been extinguish'd;and without that vertue, the occasion had been offer'd in vaine. It wasthen necessary for Moses to find the people of Israel slaves in AEgypt,and oppress'd by the AEgyptians, to the end that they to get out of theirthraldome, should bee willing to follow him. It was fit that Romulusshould not be kept in Albia, but expos'd presently after his birth, thathe might become King of Rome, and founder of that City. There was needthat Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the Medesgovernment, and the Medes delicate and effeminate through their longpeace. Theseus could not make proof his vertue, had not he found theAthenians dispers'd. These occasions therefore made these men happy, andtheir excellent vertue made the occasion be taken notice of, wherebytheir countrey became enobled, and exceeding fortunate. They, who byvertuous waies, like unto these, become Princes, attain the Principalitywith difficulty, but hold it with much ease; and the difficulties theyfind in gaining the Principality, arise partly from the new orders andcourses they are forc'd to bring in, to lay the foundation of theirState, and work their own security. And it is to be consider'd, howthere is not any thing harder to take in hand, nor doubtfuller tosucceed, nor more dangerous to mannage, than to be the chief in bringingin new orders; for this Chief finds all those his enemies, that thriveupon the old orders; and hath but luke warme defenders of all those thatwould do well upon the new orders, which luke-warme temper proceedspartly from fear of the opposers who have the laws to their advantage;partly from the incredulity of the men who truly beleeve not a newthing, unless there be some certain proof given them thereof. Whereuponit arises, that whensoever they that are adversaries, take the occasionto assayle, they do it factiously; and these others defend but cooly, sothat their whole party altogether runs a hazzard. Therefore it isnecessary, being we intend throughly to discourse this part, to examineif these innovators stand of themselves, or if they depend upon others;that is, if to bring their work to effect, it be necessary they shouldintreat, or be able to constrain; in the first case they allwayessucceed ill, and bring nothing to pass; but when they depend ofthemselves, and are able to force, then seldom it is that they hazzard.Hence came it that all the prophets that were arm'd, prevail'd; butthose that were unarm'd, were too weak: for besides what we havealledg'd, the nature of the people is changeable, and easie to beperswaded to a matter; but it is hard also to settle them in thatperswasion. And therefore it behoves a man to be so provided, that whenthey beleeve no longer, he may be able to compel them thereto by force.Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus would never have been able to causetheir Laws to be obey'd, had they been disarm'd; as in our times itbefel Fryer Jerome Savanarola, who perished in his new constitutions,when the multitude began not to beleeve him; neither had he the means tokeep them firme, that had beleev'd; not to force beleefe in them thathad not beleev'd him. Wherefore such men as these, in their proceedingsfind great difficulty, and all their dangers are in the way, and thesethey must surmount by their vertue; but having once master'd them, andbeginning to be honored by all, when they have rooted those out thatenvi'd their dignities, they remain powerful, secure, honorable, andhappy. To these choice examples, I will add one of less remark; but itshall hold some proportion with them, and this shall suffice me for allothers of this kind, which is Hiero the Siracusan. He of a private man,became Prince of Siracusa, nor knew he any other ayd of fortune than theoccasion: for the Siracusans being oppress'd, made choyce of him fortheir Captain, whereupon he deserv'd to be made their Prince: and he wasof such vertue even in his private fortune, that he who writes of him,sayes, he wanted nothing of reigning, but a Kingdom; this manextinguish'd all the old soldiery, ordaind the new; left the oldallyances, entertained new; and as he had friendship, and soldiers thatwere his own, upon that ground he was able to build any edifice; so thathe indured much trouble in gaining, and suffered but little inmaintaining.CHAP. VIIOf new Principalities, gotten by fortune, and other mens forces.They who by fortune only become Princes of private men, with small painsattain to it, but have much ado to maintain themselves in it; and findno difficulty at all in the way, because they are carried thither withwings: but all the difficulties arise there, after they are plac'd inthem. And of such sort are those who have an estate given them formoney, by the favor of some one that grants it them: as it befell manyin Greece, in the cities of Jonia, and Hellespont; where divers Princeswere made by Darius, as well for his own safety as his glory; as alsothem that were made Emperors; who from private men by corrupting thesoldiers, attaind to the Empire. These subsist meerly upon the will, andfortune of those that have advanced them; which are two voluble andunsteady things; and they neither know how, nor are able to continue inthat dignity: they know not how, because unless it be a man of greatunderstanding and vertue, it is not probable that he who hath alwaysliv'd a private life, can know how to command: neither are they able,because they have not any forces that can be friendly or faithful tothem. Moreover those States that suddenly fall into a mans hands, as allother things in nature that spring and grow quickly, cannot well havetaken root, nor have made their correspondencies so firm, but that thefirst storm that takes them, ruines them; in case these, who (as it issaid) are thus on a sudden clambred up to be Princes, are not of thatworth and vertue as to know how to prepare themselves to maintain thatwhich chance hath cast into their bosoms, and can afterwards lay thosefoundations, which others have cast before they were Princes. For theone and the other of these wayes about the attaining to be a Prince, byVertue, or by Fortune, I will alledge you two examples which have beenin the dayes of our memory. These were Francis Sforza, and Caesar Borgia;Francis by just means and with a great deal of vertue, of a private mangot to be Duke of Millan; and that which with much pains he had gaind,he kept with small ado. On the other side Caeesar Borgia (commonly termedDuke Valentine) got his state by his Fathers fortune, and with the samelost it; however that for his own part no pains was spar'd, nor anything omitted, which by a discreet and valorus man ought to have beendone, to fasten his roots in those Estates, which others armes orfortune had bestowed on him; for (as it was formerly said) he that laysnot the foundations first, yet might be able by means of hisextraordinary vertues to lay them afterwards, however it be with thegreat trouble of the architect, and danger of the edifice. If thereforewe consider all the Dukes progresses, we may perceive how greatfoundations he had cast for his future power, which I judge a matter notsuperfluous to run over; because I should not well know, what betterrules I might give to a new Prince, than the pattern of his actions; andhowever the courses he took, availd him not, yet was it not his fault,but it proceeded from an extraordinary and extream malignity of fortune.Pope Alexander the sixt, desiring to make the Duke his son a great man,had a great many difficulties, present and future: first he saw no waythere was whereby he might be able to make him Lord of any State, thatwas not the Churches; and if he turnd to take that from the Church, heknew that the Duke of Milan, and the Venetians would never agree to it;for Faenza and Riminum were under the Venetians protection. Moreover, hesaw that the armes of Italy, and those whereof in particular he mighthave been able to make some use, were in their hands, who ought to fearthe Popes greatness; and therefore could not any wayes rely upon them:being all in the Orsins and Colonies hands, and those of their faction.It was necessary then, that those matters thus appointed by them shouldbe disturbed, and the States of Italy disordered, to be able safely tomaster part of them, which he then found easie to do, seeing theVenetians upon three considerations had us'd the means to bring theFrench men back again into Italy: which he not only did not withstand,but furthered, with a resolution of King Lewis his ancient marriage. TheKing then past into Italy with the Venetians ayd, and Alexandersconsent; nor was he sooner arrived in Milan, than the Pope had soldiersfrom him for the service of Romania, which was quickly yeelded up to himupon the reputation of the Kings forces. The Duke then having madehimself master of Romania, and beaten the Colonies, desiring to hold it,and proceed forward, two things hindered him: the one, his own soldiers,which he thought were not true to him; the other, the French mens goodwills; that is to say, he feared that the Princes soldiers, whereof hehad served himself, would fail him, and not only hinder his conquest,but take from him what he had gotten; and that the King also would servehim the same turn. He had experience of the Orsini upon an occasion,when after the taking of Faenza he assaulted Bolonia, to which assaulthe saw them go very cold. And touching the King, he discovered his mind,when having taken the Dutchy of Urbin, he invaded Tuscany; from whichaction the King made him retire; whereupon the Duke resolved to dependno more upon fortune, and other mens armes. And the first thing he did,was, to weaken the Orsini, and Colonnies factions in Rome: for he gain'dall their adherents that were gentlemen, giving them large allowances,and honoring them according to their qualities with charges andgovernments; so that in a few months the good will they bare to theparties was quite extinguisht, and wholly bent to the Duke. After this,he waited an occasion to root out the Orsini, having before dispersedthose of the family of Colonnia, which fell out well to his hand; and heus'd it better. For the Orsini being too late aware, that the Dukes andthe Churches greatness was their destruction, held a Council together ina dwelling house of theirs in the country adjoyning to Perusia. Fromthence grew the rebellion of Urbin, and the troubles of Romania, andmany other dangers befell the Duke, which he overcame all with the helpof the French: and having regained his reputation, trusting neitherFrance, nor any forrein forces, to the end he might not be put to maketrial of them again, he betook himself to his sleghts; and he knew sowell to disguise his intention, that the Orsins, by the mediation ofPaul Orsine, were reconciled to him, to whom the Duke was no way wantingin all manner of courtesies whereby to bring them into security, givingthem rich garments, money, and horses, til their own simplicities ledthem all to Sinigallia, into his hands. These heads being then pluck'doff, and their partisans made his friends; the Duke had laid very goodfoundations, to build his own greatness on, having in his power allRomania with the Dutchy of Urbin, and gained the hearts of those people,by beginning to give them some relish of their well being. And becausethis part is worthy to be taken notice of, and to be imitated by others,I will not let it escape. The Duke, when he had taken Romania, findingit had been under the hands of poor Lords who had rather pillag'd theirsubjects, than chastis'd or amended them, giving them more cause ofdiscord, than of peace and union, so that the whole countrey was fraughtwith robberies, quarrels, and other sorts of insolencies; thought thebest way to reduce them to termes of pacification, and obedience to aPrincely power, was, to give them some good government: and therefore heset over them one Remiro D'Orco, a cruel hasty man, to whom he gave anabsolute power. This man in a very short time setled peace and unionamongst them with very great reputation. Afterwards the Duke thoughtsuch excessive authority serv'd not so well to his purpose, and doubtingit would grow odious, he erected a civil Judicature in the midst of thecountrey, where one excellent Judge did Preside, and thither every Citysent their Advocate: and because he knew the rigors past had bred somehatred against him, to purge the minds of those people, and to gain themwholly to himself, he purpos'd to shew, that if there was any crueltyused, it proceeded not from any order of his, but from the harshdisposition of his Officers. Whereupon laying hold on him, at thisoccasion, he caus'd his head to be struck off one morning early in themarket place at Cesena, where he was left upon a gibbet, with a bloodysword by his side; the cruelty of which spectacle for a while satisfiedand amaz'd those people. But to return from whence we have digressd: Isay, that the Duke finding himself very strong, and in part out of doubtof the present dangers, because he was arm'd after his own manner, andhad in some good measure suppress'd those forces, which, because oftheir vicinity, were able to annoy him, he wanted nothing else to go onwith his Conquest, but the consideration of France: for he knew, thatthe King, who now, though late, was advis'd of his error, would neversuffer him: and hereupon he began to seek after new allyances, and towaver with France, when the French came towards Naples against theSpaniards, who then besieged Gagetta; and his design was only to be outof their danger, which had been effected for him, had Pope Alexanderlived. And thus were his businesses carried touching his present estate.As for the future, he had reason to doubt lest the new successor to thePapacy would not be his friend, and would endeavor to take that from himthat Alexander had bestowed on him; and he thought to provide for thisfoure waies: First by rooting out the races of all those Lords he haddispoyled, whereby to take those occasions from the Pope. Secondly, bygaining all the gentlemen of Rome, whereby he might be able with thoseto keep the Pope in some awe. Thirdly, to make the Colledge of Cardinalsas much at his devotion as possibly might be. Fourthly, by making of solarge Conquests, before the Popes death, as that he might be able ofhimself to withstand the first fury of his enemies. Three of these fowreat Pope Alexanders death he had effected, and the fourth he had nearebrought to a point. For of those Lords he had stript, he put to death asmany as he could come at, and very few escap'd him: he gaind him theRoman Gentlemen: and in the Colledge he had made a great faction. Andtouching his new Conquest, he had a designe to become Lord of Tuscany.And he had possessed himself already of Perusia, and Pombin, and takenprotection of Pisa: and so soon as he should have cast off his respectto France (which now he meant to hold no longer) being the French werenow driven out of the Kingdome of Naples by the Spaniards, so that eachof them was forc'd to buy his friendship at any termes; he was then toleap into Pisa. After this Lucca and Siena were presently to fall tohim, partly for envy to the Florentines, and partly for fear. TheFlorentines had no way to escape him: all which, had it succeeded withhim, as without question it had, the very same year that Alexander dy'd,he had made himself master of so great forces, and such reputation, thathe would have been able to have stood upon his own bottom, without anydependance of fortune, or resting upon others helps, but only upon hisown strength and valor. But Alexander dy'd five years after that he hadbegun to draw forth his sword: and left him setled only in the State ofRomania, with all his other designes in the ayre, sick unto death,between two very strong armies of his enemies; and yet was there in thisDuke such a spirit and courage; and he understood so well, how men areto be gaind, and how to be lost, and so firm were the grounds he hadlaid in a short time, that, had he not had those armies upon his back,or had been in health, he would have carried through his purpose inspight of all opposition; and that the foundations he grounded upon weregood, it appeard in that Romania held for him above a moneth, and heremained secure in Rome, though even at deaths doore: and however theBaglioni, Vitelli, and Orsini came into Rome; yet found they none wouldtake their parts against him. And this he was able to have effected,that if he could not have made him Pope whom be would, he could havehindred him that he would not should be Pope. But had he been in healthwhen Alexander dy'd, every thing had gone easily with him; and he toldme on that day that Julius the second was created Pope, that he hadfore-thought on all that which could happen, in case his father chanc'dto dye, and for every thing provided its remedy, this onely excepted,that he foresaw not that he should at the same time be brought untodeaths dore also. Having then collected all the Dukes actions, me thinksI could not well blame him, but rather (as I have here done) set him asa pattern to be followed by all those who by fortune and others armeshave been exalted to an Empire. For he being of great courage, andhaving lofty designes, could not carry himself otherwise; and the onlyobstacle of his purposes was the brevity of Alexanders life, and his ownsickness. Whoever therefore deemes it necessary in his entrance into anew Principality, to secure himself of his enemies, and gain himfriends, to overcome either by force or by cunning, to make himselfbeloved, or feared of his people, be followed and reverenced by hissoldiers, to root out those that can, or owe thee any hurt, to changethe ancient orders with new wayes, to be severe, and yet acceptable,magnanimous, and liberall; to extinguish the unfaithfull soldiery, andcreate new; to maintain to himself the armities of Kings and Princes, sothat they shall either with favor benefit thee, or be wary how to offendthee; cannot find more fresh and lively examples than the actions ofthis man. He deserves to be found fault withall for the creation ofJulius the second, wherein an evil choice was made for him: for, as itis said, not being able to make a Pope to his mind, he could havewithheld any one from being Pope; and should never have consented thatany one of those Cardinals should have got the Papacy, whom he had everdone harme to; or who having attaind the Pontificate were likely to beafraid of him: because men ordinarily do hurt either for fear, orhatred. Those whom he had offended, were among others, he who had thetitle of St. Peter ad Vincula, Colonna, St. George, and Ascanius; allthe others that were in possibility of the Popedome, were such as mighthave feard him rather, except the Cardinal of Roan, and the Spaniards;these by reason of their allyance and obligation with him, the otherbecause of the power they had, having the Kingdome of France on theirparty; wherefore the Duke above all things should have created aSpanyard Pope, and in case he could not have done that, he should haveagreed that Roan should have been, and not St. Peter ad Vincula. Andwhoever beleeves, that with great personages new benefits blot on theremembrance of old injuries, is much deceiv'd. The Duke therefore inthis election, was the cause of his own ruine at last.    Till wee come to this seaventh Chapter, I find not any thing    much blame-worthy, unlesse it be on ground he layes in the    second Chapter; whereupon hee builds most of this Fabrick, viz.    That Subjects must either be dallyed or flatterd withall, or    quite crusht. Whereby our Author advises his Prince to support    his authority with two Cardinall Vertues, Dissimulation, and    Cruelty. He considers not herein that the head is but a member    of the body, though the principall; and the end of the parts is    the good of the whole. And here he goes against himselfe in the    twenty sixt Chapter of his Rep. 1. 1. where hee blames Philip of    Macedon for such courses, terming them very cruell, and against    all Christian manner of living; and that every man should refuse    to be a King, and desire rather to live a private life, than to    reigne so much to the ruine of mankind. The life of Caesar    Borgia, which is here given as a paterne to new Princes, we    shall find to have been nothing else but a cunning carriage of    things so, that he might thereby first deceive and inveigle, and    then suppresse all those that could oppose or hinder his    ambition. For if you runne over his life, you shall see the    Father Pope Alexander the sixt and him, both imbarqued for his    advancement, wherein they engag'd the Papall authority, and    reputation of Religion; for faith and conscience these men never    knew, though they exacted it of others: there was never promise    made, but it was only so farre kept as servd for advantage;    Liberality was made use of: Clemency and Cruelty, all alike, as    they might serve to worke with their purposes. All was    sacrific'd to ambition; no friendship could tye these men, nor    any religion: and no marvell: for ambition made them forget both    God and man. But see the end of all this cunning: though this    Caesar Borgia contrived all his businesse so warily, that our    Author much commends him, and hee had attaind neere the pitch of    his hopes, and had provided for each misadventure could befall    him its remedy; Policy shewd it selefe short-sighted; for hee    foresaw not at the time of his Fathers death, he himself should    bee brought unto deaths doore also. And me thinks this Example    might have given occasion to our Author to confesse, that surely    there is a God that ruleth the earth. And many times God cutts    off those cunning and mighty men in the hight of their purposes,    when they think they have neare surmounted all dangers and    difficulties. 'To the intent that the living may know, that the    most high ruleth in the Kingdome of men, and giveth it to    whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.'    Daniel. 4. 17.CHAP. VIIIConcerning those who by wicked meanes have attaind to a Principality.But because a man becomes a Prince of a private man two wayes, whichcannot wholly be attributed either to Fortune or Vertue, I think not fitto let them passe me: howbeit the one of them may be more largelydiscoursed upon, where the Republicks are treated of. These are, when bysome wicked and unlawfull meanes a man rises to the Principality; orwhen a private person by the favour of his fellow Citizens becomesPrince of his countrey. And speaking of the first manner, it shall bemade evident by two Examples, the one ancient, the other moderne,without entring otherwise into the justice or merit of this part; for Itake it that these are sufficient for any body that is forc'd to followthem. Agathocles the Sicilian, not of a private man onely, but from abase and abject fortune, got to be King of Siracusa. This man borne butof a Potter, continued alwayes a wicked life throughout all the degreesof this fortune: neverthelesse he accompanied his lewdnesse with such acourage and resolution, that applying himselfe to military affaires, bythe degrees thereof he attained to bee Praetour of Siracusa, and beingsetled in that degree, and having determined that he would becomePrince, and hold that by violence and without obligation to any other,which by consent had been granted him: and to this purpose haveing hadsome private intelligence touching his designe with Amilcar theCarthaginian, who was imployd with his army in Sicily, one morininggatherd the people together and the Senate of Syracusa, as if he hadsome what to advise with them of matters belonging to the Commonwealth,and upon a signe given, caus'd his souldiers to kill his Senatours, andthe richest of the people; who being slaine, he usurp'd the Principalityof that City without any civill strife: and however he was twice brokenby the Carthaginians, and at last besieged, was able not onely to defendhis own City, but leaving part of his own army at the defence thereof,with the other invaded Affrique, and in a short time freed Siracusa fromthe siege, and brought the Carthaginians into extreme necessity, whowere constraind to accord with him, be contented with the possession ofAffrique, and quitt Sicily to Agathocles. He then that should considerthe actions and valour of this man, would not see any, or very fewthings to be attributed unto Fortune; seeing that as is formerly sayd,not by any ones favour, but by the degrees of service in warre with manysufferings and dangers, to which he had risen, he came to thePrincipality; and that hee maintained afterwards with so many resoluteand hazardous undertakings. Yet cannot this be term'd vertue or valourto slay his own Citizens, betray his friends, to be without faith,without pitty, without religion, which wayes are of force to gainedominion, but not glory: for if Agathocles his valour bee well weighd,in his enturing upon, and comming off from dangers, and the greatnesseof his courage, in supporting and mastering of adversities, no man cansee why he should be thought any way inferiour even to the ablestCaptaines. Notwithstanding his beastly cruelty and inhumanity withinnumerable wickednesses, allow not that he should be celebrated amongthe most excellent men. That cannot then be attributed to Fortune orVertue, which without the one or the other was attaind to by him. In ourdayes, while Alexander the sixth held the sea, Oliverotte of Fermo, whosome few yeeres before had been left young by his parents, was broughtup under the care of an uncle of his on the mothers side, called JohnFoliani, and in the beginning of his youth given, by him to serve in thewarres under Paulo Vitelli: to the end that being well instructed inthat discipline, he might rise to some worthy degree in the warrs.Afterwards when Paulo was dead, he served under Vitellozzo his brother,and in very short time, being ingenious, of a good personage, and bravecourage, he became one of the prime men among the troops he served in:but thinking it but servile to depend upon another, he plotted by theayd of some Citizens of Fermo (who lik'd rather the thraldome of theirCity than the liberty of it) and by the favour of the Vitelli, to makehimselfe master of Fermo; and writ to John Foliani, that having beenmany yeeres from home, he had a mind to come and see him and the City,and in some part take notice of his own patrimony; and because he hadnot imployd himselfe but to purchase honour, to the end his Citizensmight perceive, that he had not vainely spent his time, he had a desireto come in good equipage and accompanied with a hundred horse of hisfriends and servants; and he intreated him that he would be pleasd so totake order, that he might be honourably received by the inhabitants ofFermo, which turnd as well to his honor that was his uncle, as his thatwas the nephew. In this, John faild not in any office of courtesie dueto his nephew: and caused him to be well receivd by them of Fermo, andlodged him in his own house: where having passed some dayes, and staydto put in order somewhat that was necessary for his intended villany, hemade a very solemne feast, whether he invited John Foliani, and all theprime men of Fermo: and when all their chear was ended, and all theirother entertainments, as in such feasts it is customary, Oliverotto ofpurpose mov'd some grave discourses; speaking of the greatnesse of PopeAlexander, and Caesar his son, and their undertakings; where unto Johnand the others making answer, he of a sudden stood up, saying, thatthose were things to be spoken of in a more secret place, and so retir'dinto a chamber, whether John and all the other Citizens followd him; norwere they sooner set downe there, than from some secret place thereincamp forth diverse souldiers, who slew John and all the others: afterwhich homicide Oliverotto got a horsebacke and ravaged the whole towne,and besieged the supreme Magistrate in the palace, so that for fearethey were all constraind to obey him, and to settle a government,whereof hee made himselfe Prince; and they being all dead who, had theybeen discontented with him, could have hurt him; he strengthned himselfewith new civill and military orders, so that in the space of a yeer thathe held the Principality, he was not only secure in the City of Fermo,but became fearefull to all his neighbours; and the conquest of himwould have prov'd difficult, as that of Agathocles, had he not lethimselfe been deceivd by Caesar Borgia, when at Sinigallia, as before wassaid, he took the Orsini and Vitelli: where he also being taken a yeereafter he had committed the parricide, was strangled together withVitellozzo (whome he had had for master both of his vertues and vices.)Some man might doubt from whence it should proceed, that Agathocles, andsuch like, after many treacheries and crueltyes, could possibly livelong secure in his own countrey, and defend himselfe from his forreinenemies, and that never any of his own Citizens conspir'd against him,seeing that by means of cruelty, many others have never been able evenin peaceable times to maintaine their States, much lesse in thedoubtfull times of warre. I beleeve that this proceeds from the well, orill using of those cruelties: they may bee termd well us'd (if it beelawfull to say well of evill) that are put in practice only once ofnecessity for securities sake, not insisting therein afterwards; butthere is use made of them for the subjects profit, as much as may be.But those that are ill us'd, are such as though they bee but few in thebeginning, yet they multiply rather in time, than diminish. They thattake that first way, may with the help of God, and mens care, find someremedy for their State, as Agathocles did: for the others, it isimpossible they should continue. Whereupon it is to be noted, that inthe laying hold of a State, the usurper thereof ought to runne over andexecute all his cruelties at once, that he be not forced often toreturne to them, and that he may be able, by not renewing of them, togive men some security, and gaine their affections by doing them somecourtesies. Hee that carries it otherwise, either for fearefullnesse, orupon evill advice, is alwayes constraind to hold his sword drawne in hishand; nor ever can hee rely upon his subjects, there being nopossibility for them, because of his daily and continuall injuries, tolive in any safety: for his injuries should bee done altogether, thatbeing seldomer tasted, they might lesse offend; his favours should beebestowd by little, and little to the end they might keep their taste thebetter; and above all things a Prince must live with his subjects insuch sort, that no accident either of good or evill can make him vary:for necessity comming upon him by reason of adversities, thou hast nottime given thee to make advantage of thy cruelties; and the favourswhich then thou bestowest, will little help thee, being taken as if theycame from thee perforce, and so yeeld no returne of thanks.CHAP. IXOf the Civill Principality.But comming to the other part, when a principall Citizen, not byvillany, or any other insufferable violence, but by the favour of hisfellow-citizens becomes Prince of his native countrey: which we mayterme a Civill Principality; nor to attaine hereunto is Vertue wholly orFortune wholly necessary, but rather a fortunate cunning: I say, thisPrincipality is climb'd up to, either by the peoples help, or the greatmens. For, in every City we finde these two humours differ; and theyspring from this, that the people desire not to be commanded noroppressed by the great ones, and the great ones are desirous to commandand oppresse the people: and from these two several appetites, arise inthe City one of these three effects, either a Principality, or Liberty,or Tumultuary licentiousnesse. The Principality is caused either by thepeople, or the great ones, according as the one or other of thesefactions have the occasion offerd; for the great ones seeing themselvesnot able to resist the people, begin to turne the whole reputation toone among them, and make him Prince, whereby they may under his shadowvent their spleenes. The people also, not being able to support thegreat mens insolencies, converting the whole reputation to one man,create him their Prince, to be protected by his authority. He that comesto the Principality by the assistance of the great ones, subsists withmore difficulty, than he that attaines to it by the peoples favour; forhe being made Prince, hath many about him, who account themselves hisequalls, and therefore cannot dispose nor command them at his pleasure.But he that gaines the Principality by the peoples favor, finds himselfealone in his throne, and hath none or very few neare him that are notvery supple to bend: besides this, the great ones cannot upon easietermes be satisfied, or without doing of wrong to others, where as asmall matter contents the people: for the end which the people propoundto themselves, is more honest than that of the great men, these desiringto oppresse, they only not to be oppressed. To this may be added also,that the Prince which is the peoples enemy, can never well securehimselfe of them, because of their multitude; well may hee bee sure ofthe Nobles, they being but a few. The worst that a Prince can look forof the people become his enemy, is to be abandoned by them: but when thegreat ones once grow his enemies, he is not only to feare theirabandoning of him, but their making of a party against him also: forthere being in them more forecast and craft, they alwayes take time bythe forelocks whereby to save themselves, and seeke credit with him whothey hope shall get the mastery. The Prince likewise is necessitatedalwayes to live with the same people, but can doe well enough withoutthe same great men; he being able to create new ones, and destroy themagain every day, and to take from them, and give them credit as hepleases: and to cleare this part, I say, that great men ought to beconsiderd two wayes principally, that is, if they take thy proceedingsso much to heart, as to engage their fortunes wholly in thine, in casethey lye not alwayes catching at spoyle, they ought to be well honourdand esteem'd: those that bind themselves not to thy fortune, are to beconsiderd also two wayes; either they doe it for lack of courage, andnaturall want of spirit, and then shouldst thou serve thy selfe of them,and of them especially that are men of good advice; for if thy affairesprosper, thou dost thy selfe honour thereby; if crost, thou needst notfeare them: but when they oblige not themselves to thee of purpose, andupon occasion of ambition, it is a signe they think more of themselvesthan of thee: and of these the Prince ought to beware, and account ofthem as his discoverd enemyes: for alwayes in thy adversity they willgive a hand too to ruine thee. Therefore ought hee that comes to bePrince by the peoples favour, keepe them his friends: which he mayeasily doe, they desiring only to live free from oppression: but he thatbecomes Prince by the great mens favour, against the will of the people,ought above all things to gaine the people to him, which he may easilyeffect, when he takes upon him their protection: And because men whenthey find good, where they look for evill, are thereby more endered totheir benefactour, therefore growes the people so pliant in theirsubjection to him, as if by their favours he had attaind his dignity.And the Prince is able to gaine them to his side by many wayes, whichbecause they vary according to the subject, no certaine rule can begiven thereupon; wherefore we shall let them passe I will only conclude,that it is necessary for a Prince to have the people his friend;otherwise in his adversities he hath no helpe. Nabis Prince of theSpartans supported the siege of all Greece, and an exceeding victoriousarmy of the Romans, and against those defended his native countrey andState, and this suffic'd him alone, that as the danger came upon him, hesecur'd himself of a fewer; whereas if the people had been his enemy,this had nothing availd him. And let no man think to overthrow this myopinion with that common proverb, that He who relyes upon the people,layes his foundation in the dirt; for that is true where a privateCitizen grounds upon them, making his account that the people shall freehim, when either his enemyes or the Magistrates oppresse him: In thiscase he should find himself often deceiv'd, as it befell the Gracchyesin Rome, and in Florence George Scali: but he being a Prince thatgrounds thereupon, who can command, and is a man of courage, who hathhis wits about him in his adversityes, and wants not other preparations,and holds together the whole multitude animated with his valour andorders, shall not prove deceiv'd by them, and shall find he hath laydgood foundations. These Principalityes are wont to be upon the point offalling when they goe about to skip from the civil order to theabsolute: for these Princes either command of themselves, or by theMagistrate; in this last case their State is more weak and dangerous,because they stand wholly at the will and pleasure of these Citizens,who then are set over the Magistrates, who especially in adverse timesare able with facility to take their State from them either by rising upagainst them, or by not obeying them; and then the Prince is not at handin those dangers to take the absolute authority upon him: for theCitizens and subjects that are accustomed to receive the commands fromthe Magistrates, are not like in those fractions to obey his: and indoubtfull times he shall alwayes have greatest penury of whom he maytrust; for such a Prince cannot ground upon that which he sees inpeaceable times, when the Citizens have need of the State; for thenevery one runs, and every one promises, and every one will venture hislife for him, where there is no danger neare; but in times of hazzard,when the State hath need of Citizens, there are but few of them then,and so much the more is this experience dangerous, in that it can be butonce made. Therefore a prudent Prince ought to devise a way whereby hisCitizens alwayes and in any case and quality of time may have need ofhis government, and they shall alwaies after prove faithfull to him.CHAP. XIn what manner the Forces of all Principalities ought to be measured.It is requisite in examining the quality of those Principalities, tohave another consideration of them, that is, if a Prince have suchdominions, that he is able in case of necessity to subsist of himself,or else whether he hath alwaies need of another to defend him. And tocleer this point the better, I judge them able to stand of themselves,who are of power either for their multitudes of men, or quantity ofmoney, to bring into the field a compleat armie, and joyn battel withwhoever comes to assail them: and so I think those alwaies to stand inneed of others help, who are not able to appear in the field against theenemy, but are forc'd to retire within their walls and guard them.Touching the first case, we have treated already, and shall adde somwhatthereto as occasion shall require. In the second case, we cannot sayother, save only to encourage such Princes to fortifie and guard theirown Capital city, and of the countrey about, not to hold much account;and whoever shall have well fortified that town, and touching othermatters of governments shall have behaved himself towards his subjects,as hath been formerly said, and hereafter shall be, shall never beassaild but with great regard; for men willingly undertake notenterprises, where they see difficulty to work them through; nor canmuch facility be there found, where one assails him, who hath his townstrong and wel guarded, and is not hated of his people. The cities ofGermany are very free; they have but very little of the countrey aboutthem belonging to them; and they obey the Emperor, when they please, andthey stand not in fear, neither of him nor any other Potentate aboutthem: for they are in such a manner fortified, that every one thinks thesiege of any of them would prove hard and tedious: for all of them haveditches, and rampires, and good store of Artillery, and alwaies havetheir publick cellars well provided with meat and drink and firing for ayeer: besides this, whereby to feed the common people, and without anyloss to the publick, they have alwaies in common whereby they are ablefor a year to imploy them in the labor of those trades that are thesinews and the life of that city, and of that industry whereby thecommons ordinarily supported themselves: they hold up also the militaryexercises in repute, and hereupon have they many orders to maintainthem. A Prince then that is master of a good strong city, and causethnot himself to be hated, cannot be assaulted; and in case he were, hethat should assail him, would be fain to quit him with shame: for theaffairs of the world are so various, that it is almost impossible thatan army can lie incampt before a town for the space of a whole yeer: andif any should reply, that the people having their possessions abroad, incase they should see them a fire, would not have patience, and thetedious siege and their love to themselves would make them forget theirPrince: I answer that a Prince puissant and couragious, will easilymaster those difficulties, now giving his subjects hope, that themischief will not be of durance; sometimes affright them with thecruelty of their enemies, and other whiles cunningly securing himself ofthose whom he thinks too forward to run to the enemy. Besides this byordinary reason the enemy should burne and waste their countrey, uponhis arrival, and at those times while mens minds are yet warme, andresolute in their defence: and therefore so much the less ought a Princedoubt: for after some few dayes, that their courages grow coole, thedammages are all done, and mischiefs received, and there is no help forit, and then have they more occasion to cleave faster to their Prince,thinking he is now more bound to them, their houses having for hisdefence been fired, and their possessions wasted; and mens nature is aswell to hold themselves oblig'd for the kindnesses they do, as for thosethey receive; whereupon if all be well weigh'd, a wise Prince shall notfind much difficulty to keep sure and true to him his Citizens hearts atthe beginning and latter end of the siege, when he hath no want ofprovision for food and ammunition.CHAP. XIConcerning Ecclesiastical Principalities.There remains now only that we treat of the EcclesiasticalPrincipalities, about which all the difficulties are before they aregotten: for they are attained to either by vertue, or Fortune; andwithout the one or the other they are held: for they are maintaind byorders inveterated in the religion, all which are so powerfull and ofsuch nature, that they maintain their Princes in their dominions in whatmanner soever they proceed and live. These only have an Estate anddefend it not; have subjects and govern them not; and yet their Statesbecause undefended, are not taken from them; nor their subjects, thoughnot govern'd, care not, think not, neither are able to aliene themselvesfrom them. These Principalities then are only happy and secure: but theybeing sustained by superior causes, whereunto humane understandingreaches not, I will not meddle with them: for being set up andmaintained by God, it would be the part of a presumptuous and rash manto enter into discourse of them. Yet if any man should ask me whence itproceeds, that the Church in temporal power hath attaind to suchgreatness, seeing that till the time of Alexander the sixt, the ItalianPotentates, and not only they who are entituled the potentates, butevery Baron and Lord though of the meanest condition in regard of thetemporality, made but small account of it; and now a King of Francetrembles at the power thereof; and it hath been able to drive him out ofItaly, and ruine the Venetians; and however this be well known, methinks it is not superstitious in some part to recall it to memory.Before that Charles King of France past into Italy, this countrey wasunder the rule of the Pope, Venetians, the King of Naples, the Duke ofMilan, and the Florentines. These Potentates took two things principallyto their care; the one, that no forreiner should invade Italy; the otherthat no one of them should inlarge their State. They, against whom thiscare was most taken, were the Pope and the Venetians; and to restrainthe Venetians, there needed the union of all the rest, as it was in thedefence of Ferrara; and to keep the Pope low, they served themselves ofthe Barons of Rome, who being divided into two factions, the Orsini andColonnesi, there was alwaies occasion of offence between them, whostanding ready with their armes in hand in the view of the Pope, heldthe Popedome weak and feeble: and however sometimes there arose acouragious Pope, as was Sextus; yet either his fortune, or his wisdomewas not able to free him of these incommodities, and the brevity oftheir lives was the cause thereof; for in ten years, which time, onewith another, Popes ordinarily liv'd, with much ado could they bring lowone of the factions. And if, as we may say, one had near put out theColonnesi, there arose another enemy to the Orsini, who made them growagain, so that there was never time quite to root them out. This thenwas the cause, why the Popes temporal power was of small esteem inItaly; there arose afterwards Pope Alexander the sixt, who of all thePopes that ever were, shewed what a Pope was able to do with money andforces: and he effected, by means of his instrument, Duke Valentine, andby the ocasion of the French mens passage, all those things which I haveformerly discoursed upon in the Dukes actions: and however his purposewas nothing at all to inlarge the Church dominions, but to make the Dukegreat; yet what he did, turnd to the Churches advantage, which after hisdeath when the Duke was taken away, was the heir of all his pains.Afterwards succeeded Pope Julius, and found the Church great, having allRomania, and all the Barons of Rome being quite rooted out, and byAlexanders persecutions, all their factions worne down; he found alsothe way open for the heaping up of moneys, never practised beforeAlexanders time; which things Julius not only follow'd, but augmented;and thought to make himself master of Bolonia, and extinguish theVenetians, and chase the French men out of Italy: and these designes ofhis prov'd all lucky to him, and so much the more to his praise in thathe did all for the good of the Church, and in no private regard: he keptalso the factions of the Orsins and Colonnesi, in the same State hefound them: and though there were among them some head whereby to causean alteration; yet two things have held them quiet; the one the power ofthe Church, which somewhat affrights them; the other because they haveno Cardinals of their factions, who are the primary causes of all thetroubles amongst them: nor shall these parties ever be at rest, whilethey have Cardinals; because they nourish the factions both in Rome, andabroad; and the Barons then are forced to undertake the defence of them:and thus from the Prelates ambitions arise the discords and tumultsamong the Barons. And now hath Pope Leo his Holiness found the Popedomeexceeding puissant, of whom it is hoped, that if they amplified it byarmes, he by his goodness, and infinite other vertues, will much moreadvantage and dignifie it.CHAP. XIIHow many sorts of Military discipline there are and touching Mercenarysoldiers.Having treated particularly of the qualities of those Principalities,which in the beginning I propounded to discourse upon, and considered insome part the reasons of their well and ill being, and shewd the waieswhereby many have sought to gain, and hold them, it remains now that Ispeak in general of the offences and defences, that may chance in eachof the forenamed. We have formerly said that it is necessary for aPrince to have good foundations laid; otherwise it must needs be that hego to wrack. The Principal foundations that all States have, as wellnew, as old, or mixt, are good laws, and good armes; and because therecannot be good laws, where there are not good armes; and where there aregood armes, there must needs be good laws, I will omit to discourse ofthe laws, and speak of armes. I say then that the armes, wherewithall aPrince defends his State, either are his own, or mercenary, orauxiliary, or mixt. Those that are mercenary and auxiliar, areunprofitable, and dangerous, and if any one holds his State founded uponmercenary armes, he shall never be quiet, nor secure, because they arenever well united, ambitious, and without discipline, treacherous, amongtheir friends stour, among their enemies cowardly; they have no fear ofGod, nor keep any faith with men; and so long only defer they the doingof mischief, till the enemy comes to assul thee; and in time of peacethou art despoyled by them, in war by thy enemies: the reason hereof is,because they have no other love, nor other cause to keep them in thefield, but only a small stipend, which is not of force to make themwilling to hazard their lives for thee: they are willing indeed to bethy soldiers, till thou goest to fight; but then they fly, or run away;which thing would cost me but small pains to perswade; for the ruine ofItaly hath not had any other cause now a dayes, than for that it haththese many years rely'd upon mercenary armes; which a good while sinceperhaps may have done some man some service, and among themselves theymay have been thought valiant: but so soon as any forrein enemyappeared, they quickly shewed what they were. Whereupon Charles the Kingof France, without opposition, made himself master of all Italy: and hethat said, that the causes thereof were our faults, said true; but thesewere not those they beleeved, but what I have told; and because theywere the Princes faults, they also have suffered the punishment. I willfuller shew the infelicity of these armes. The mercenary Captains areeither very able men, or not: if they be, thou canst not repose anytrust in them: for they will alwaies aspire unto their own properadvancements, either by suppressing of thee that art their Lord, or bysuppressing of some one else quite out of thy purpose: but if theCaptain be not valorous, he ordinarily ruines thee: and in case it beanswered, that whoever shall have his armes in his hands, whethermercenary or not, will do so: I would reply, that armes are to beimployed either by a Prince, or Common-wealth. The Prince ought to go inperson, and performe the office of a commander: the Republick is to sendforth her Citizens: and when she sends forth one that proves not ofabilities, she ought to change him then; and when he does provevalorous, to bridle him so by the laws, that he exceed not hiscommission. And by experience we see, that Princes and Republiques ofthemselves alone, make very great conquests; but that mercenary armesnever do other than harme; and more hardly falls a Republick armed withher own armes under the obedience of one of her own Citizens, than onethat is armed by forrein armes. Rome and Sparta subsisted many agesarmed and free. The Swissers are exceedingly well armed, and yet veryfree. Touching mercenary armes that were of old, we have an example ofthe Carthagians, who near upon were oppress'd by their own mercenarysoldiers, when the first war with the Romans was finished; however theCarthagians had their own Citizens for their Captains. Philip of Macedonwas made by the Thebans after Epaminondas his death, General of theirArmies; and after the victory, he took from them liberty. The Milaneseswhen Duke Philip was dead, entertaind Francis Sforza into their payagainst the Venetians, who having vanquisht their enemie at Caravaggio,afterwards joyned with them, where by to usurp upon the Milaneses hisMasters. Sforza his father, being in Joan the Queen of Naples pay, lefther on a sudden disarmed; whereupon she, to save her Kingdom, wasconstraind to cast her self into the King of Arrragon's bosome. And incase the Venetians and the Florentines have formerly augmented theirState with these kind of armes, and their own Captains, and yet none ofthem have ever made themselves their Princes, but rather defended them:I answer, that the Florentines in this case have had fortune much theirfriend: for of valorous Captains, which they might any way fear, somehave not been victors, some have had opposition, and others have laidthe aim of their ambitions another way. He who overcame not, was JohnAouto, of whose faith there could no proof be made, being he vanquishtnot; but every one will acknowledge, that, had he vanquisht, theFlorentines were at his discretion. Sforza had alwaies the Bracceschifor his adversaries, so that they were as a guard one upon another.Francis converted all his ambition against Lombardy. Braccio against theChurch, and the Kingdome of Naples. But let us come to that whichfollowed a while agoe. The Florentines made Paul Vitelli their General,a throughly advis'd man, and who from a private fortune had rose to verygreat reputation: had he taken Pisa, no man will deny but that theFlorentines must have held fast with him; for had he been entertained intheir enemies pay, they had no remedy; and they themselves holding ofhim, of force were to obey him. The Venetians, if we consider theirproceedings, we shall see wrought both warily and gloriously, whilethemselves made war, which was before their undertakings by land, wherethe gentlemen with their own Commons in armes behav'd themselvesbravely: but when they began to fight by land, they lost their valor,and follow'd the customes of Italy; and in the beginning of theirenlargement by land, because they had not much territory, and yet wereof great reputation, they had not much cause to fear their Captains; butas they began to extend their bounds, which was under their CommanderCarminiola, they had a taste of this error: for perceiving he wasexceeding valorous, having under his conduct beaten the Duke of Milan;and knowing on the other side, how he was cold in the war, they judg'dthat they could not make any great conquest with him; and because theyneither would, nor could cashier him, that they might not lose what theyhad gotten, they were forced for their own safeties to put him to death.Since they have had for their General Bartholomew of Berganio, Robert ofSt. Severin, the Count of Petilian, and such like: whereby they were tofear their losses, as well as to hope for gain: as it fell outafterwards at Vayla, where in one day they lost that, which with so muchpains they had gotten in eight hundred years: for from these kind ofarmes grow slack and slow and weak gains; but sudden and wonderfulllosses: And because I am now come with these examples into Italy, whichnow these many years, have been governd by mercenary armes, I willsearch deeper into them, to the end that their course and progress beingbetter discoverd, they may be the better amended. You have tounderstand, that so soon as in these later times the yoak of the ItalianEmpire began to be shaken off, and the Pope had gotten reputation in thetemporality, Italy was divided into several States: for many of thegreat cities took armes against their Nobility; who under the Emperorsprotection had held them in oppression; and the Pope favored these,whereby he might get himself reputation, in the temporality; of manyothers, their Citizens became Princes, so that hereupon Italy being comeinto the Churches hands as it were, and some few Republicks, thosePriests and Citizens not accustomed to the use of armes, began to takestrangers to their pay. The first that gave reputation to these soldierswas Alberick of Como in Romania. From his discipline among othersdescended Brachio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbitres ofItaly; after these followed all others, who even till our dayes havecommanded the armes of Italy; and the success of their valor hath been,that it was overrun by Charles, pillaged by Lewis, forc'd by Ferdinand,and disgrac'd by the Swissers. The order which they have held, hathbeen, first whereby to give reputation to their own armes to take awaythe credit of the Infantry. This they did, because they having no Stateof their own, but living upon their industry, their few foot gave themno reputation, and many they were not able to maintain; whereupon theyreduc'd themselves to cavalery, and so with a supportable number theywere entertained and honored: and matters were brought to such termes,that in an army of twenty thousand soldiers you should not find twothousand foot. They had moreover us'd all industry to free themselvesand their soldiers of all pains and fear, in their skirmishes, notkilling, but taking one another prisoners, and without ransome for theirfreedom; they repaired not all to their tents by night, nor madepalizado or trench thereabout, nor lay in the field in the summer: andall these things were thus contrived and agreed of among them in theirmilitary orders, whereby (as is said) to avoid pains and dangers,insomuch as they have brought Italy into slavery and disgrace.CHAP. XIIIOf Auxiliary Soldiers, mixt, and native.The Auxiliary forces, being the other kind of unprofitable armes, are,when any puissant one is called in, who with his forces comes to assistand defend thee; such as in these later times did Pope Julius use, whohaving seen the evil proof of his mercenary soldiers in the enterprizeof Ferrara, applied himself to the Auxiliaries, and agreed withFerdinand King of Spain, that with his Forces he should aid him. Thesearmes may be profitable and advantagious for themselves; but for himthat calls them in, hurtfull; because in losing, thou art left defeated;and conquering, thou becomest their prisoner. And however that of theseexamples the ancient stories are full fraught; yet will I not part fromthis of Pope Julius the second, which is as yet fresh: whose coursecould not have been more inconsiderate, for the desire he had to getFerrara, putting himself wholly into strangers hands: but his goodfortune caused another cause to arise, that hindred him from receivingthe fruit of his evil choice; for his Auxiliaries being broken atRavenna, and the Swissers thereupon arriving, who put the Conquerors toflight beyond all opinion, even their own and others, he chanced not toremain his enemies prisoner, they being put to flight, nor prisoner tohis Auxiliaries, having vanquished by other forces than theirs. TheFlorentines being wholly disarmed, brought ten thousand French to Pisafor to take it: by which course they ran more hazzard, than in any timeof their troubles. The Emperor of Constantinople, to oppress hisneighbors, brought into Greece ten thousand Turks, who when the war wasended, could not be got out thence, which was the beginning of Greecesservitude under the Infidels. He then that will in no case be able toovercome, let him serve himself of these armes; for they are much moredangerous than the mercenaries; for by those thy ruine is more suddenlyexecuted; for they are all united, and all bent to the obedience ofanother. But for the mercenaries to hurt thee, when they havevanquished, there is no more need of time, and greater occasion, theynot being all united in a body, and being found out and paid by thee,wherein a third that thou mak'st their head, cannot suddenly gaine sogreat authority, that he can endammage thee. In summe, in themercenaries their sloth and lazinesse to fight is more dangerous: in theauxiliaries their valour. Wherefore a wise Prince hath alwayes avoydedthese kind of armes, and betaken himselfe to his owne, and desiredrather to loss with his owne, than conquer with anothers, accountingthat not a true victorie which was gotten with others armes. I will notdoubt to alleadge Caesar Borgia, and his actions. This Duke entred intoRomania with auxiliarie armes, bringing with him all French souldiers:but afterwards not accounting those armes secure, bent himselfe tomercenaries, judging lesse danger to be in those, and tooke in pay theOrsini and the Vitelli, which afterwards in the proof of them, findingwavering, unfaithful, and dangerous, he extinguishd, and betook himselfeto his owne; and it may easily be perceiv'd what difference there isbetween the one and the other of these armes, considering the differencethat was between the Dukes reputation, when he had the French men alone,and when he had the Orsini and Vitelli; but when he remaind with hisown, and stood of himselfe, we shall find it was much augmented: norever was it of grate esteeme, but when every one saw, that he whollypossessed his owne armes. I thought not to have parted from the Italianexamples of late memory; but that I must not let passe that of Hiero theSiracusan, being one of those I formerly nam'd. This man (as I saidbefore) being made general of the Siracusans forces, knew presently thatmercenary souldiery was nothing for their profit in that they werehirelings, as our Italians are; and finding no way either to hold, orcashier them made them all bee cut to peeces, and afterwards waged warrewith his owne men, and none others. I will also call to memory a figureof the old Testament serving just to this purpose. When David presentedhimselfe before Saul to goe to fight with Goliah the PhilistinsChampion, Saul to encourage him, clad him with his owne armes, whichDavid when he had them upon back, refused, saying, he was not able tomake any proofe of himself therein, and therefore would goe meet theenemy with his own sling and sword. In summe, others armes either fallfrom thy shoulders, or cumber or streighten thee. Charls the seventh,Father of Lewis the eleventh, having by his good fortune and valour setFrance at liberty from the English, knew well this necessity of beingarm'd with his owne armes, and settled in his Kingdome the ordinances ofmen at armes, and infantry. Afterwards King Lewis his sonne abolishtthose of the infantry, and began to take the Swissers to pay; whicherrour follow'd by the others, is (as now indeed it appeares) the causeof that Kingdomes dangers. For having given reputation to the Swissers,they have renderd all their own armes contemptible; for this hath whollyruind their foot, and oblig'd their men at armes to forrein armes: forbeing accustomed to serve with the Swissers, they think they are notable to overcome without them. From whence it comes that the French arenot of force against the Swissers, and without them also against othersthey use not to adventure. Therefore are the French armies mixt, partmercenaries, and part natives, which armes are farre better than thesimple mercenaries or simple auxiliaries, and much inferiour to thenatives; and let the said example suffice for that: for the Kingdome ofFrance would have been unconquerable, if Charles his order had beenaugmented and maintaind: but men in their small wisdome begin a thing,which then because it hath some favour of good, discovers not the poysonthat lurkes thereunder, as I before said of the hectick feavers.Wherefore that Prince which perceives not mischiefes, but as they growup, is not truely wise; and this is given but to few: and if we considerthe first ruine of the Romane Empire, we shall find it was from takingthe Goths first into their pay; for from that beginning the forces ofthe Romane Empire began to grow weak, and all the valour that was takenhence was given to them. I conclude then that without having armes oftheir owne, no Principality can be secure, or rather is wholly oblig'dto fortune, not having valour to shelter it in adversity. And it wasalwayes the opinion and saying of wise men, that nothing is so weak andunsetled, as is the reputation of power not founded upon ones owneproper forces: which are those that are composed of thy subjects, orCitizens, or servants; all the rest are mercenary or auxiliary; and themanner how to order those well, is easie to find out, if those ordersabove nam'd by me, shall be but run over, and if it shall be butconsider'd, how Philip Alexander the Great his Father, and in whatmanner many Republicks and Princes have armd and appointed themselves,to which appointments I referre my selfe wholly.CHAP. XIVWhat belongs to the Prince touching military Discipline.A prince then ought to have no other ayme, nor other thought, nor takeany thing else for his proper art, but warr, and the orders anddiscipline thereof: for that is the sole arte which belongs to him thatcommands, and is of so great excellency, that not only those that areborne Princes, it maintains so; but many times raises men from a privatefortune to that dignity. And it is seene by the contrary, that whenPrinces have given themselves more to their delights, than to thewarres, they have lost their States; and the first cause that makes theelose it, is the neglect of that arte; and the cause that makes theegaine it, is that thou art experienc'd and approvd in that arte. FrancisSforza by being a man at armes, of a private man became Duke of Milan;and his sons by excusing themselves of the troubles and paines belongingto those imployments of Princes, became private men. For among othermischiefes thy neglect of armes brings upon thee, it causes thee to becontemnd, which is one of those disgraces, from which a Prince ought tokeepe himselfe, as hereafter shall be sayd: for from one that is disarmdto one that is armd there is no proportion; and reason will not, that hewho is in armes, should willingly yeeld obedience to him that isunfurnishd of them, and that he that is disarmd should be in securityamong his armed vassalls; for there being disdaine in the one, andsuspicion in the other, it is impossible these should ever wellcooperate. And therefore a Prince who is quite unexperienced in matterof warre, besides the other infelicities belonging to him, as is said,cannot be had in any esteeme among his souldiers, nor yet trust in them.Wherefore he ought never to neglect the practice of the arte of warre,and in time of peace should he exercise it more than in the warre; whichhe may be able to doe two wayes; the one practically, and in his laboursand recreations of his body, the other theoretically. And touching thepractick part, he ought besides the keeping of his own subjects welltraind up in the discipline and exercise of armes, give himselfe much tothe chase, whereby to accustome his body to paines, and partly tounderstand the manner of situations, and to know how the mountainesarise, which way the vallyes open themselves, and how the plaines aredistended flat abroad, and to conceive well the nature of the rivers,and marrish ground, and herein to bestow very much care, which knowledgeis profitable in two kinds: first he learnes thereby to know his owncountrey, and is the better enabled to understand the defence thereof,and afterwards by meanes of this knowledge and experience in thesesituations, easily comprehends any other situation, which a new he hathneed to view, for the little hillocks, vallies, plaines, rivers, andmarrish places. For example, they in Tuscany are like unto those ofother countries: so that from the knowledge of the site of one country,it is easie to attain to know that of others. And that Prince that wantsthis skill, failes of the principall part a Commander should be furnishtwith; for this shows the way how to discover the enemy, to pitch thecamp, to lead their armies, to order their battells, and also to besiegea town at thy best advantage, Philopomenes Prince of the Achayans, amongother praises Writers give him, they say, that in time of peace, hethought not upon any thing so much as the practise of warre; andwhensoever he was abroad in the field to disport himselfe with hisfriends, would often stand still, and discourse with them, in case theenemies were upon the top of that hill, and we here with our army,whether of us two should have the advantage, and how might we safely goeto find them, keeping still our orders; and if we would retire ourselves, what course should we take if they retir'd, how should we followthem? and thus on the way, propounded them all such accidents couldbefall in any army; would heare their opinions, and tell his owne, andconfirme it by argument; so that by his continuall thought hereupon,when ever he led any army no chance could happen, for which he had not aremedy. But touching the exercise of the mind, a Prince ought to readHistories, and in them consider the actions of the worthiest men, markehow they have behav'd themselves in the warrs, examine the occasions oftheir victories, and their losses; wherby they may be able to avoydthese, and obtaine those; and above all, doe as formerly some excellentman hath done, who hath taken upon him to imitate, if any one that hathgone before him hath left his memory glorious; the course he took, andkept alwaies near unto him the remembrances of his actions and worthydeeds: as it is said, that Alexander the great imitated Achilles; CaesarAlexander, and Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of Cyrus,written by Xenophon, may easily perceive afterwards in Scipio's life howmuch glory his imitation gaind him, and how much Scipio did conformehimselfe in his chastity, affability, humanity, and liberality withthose things, that are written by Xenophon of Cyrus. Such like wayesought a wise Prince to take, nor ever be idle in quiet times, but by hispaines then, as it were provide himself of store, whereof he may makesome use in his adversity, the end that when the times change, he may beable to resist the stormes of his hard fortune.CHAP. XVOf those things, in respect whereof, men, and especially Princes, arepraised, or dispraised.It now remaines that we consider what the conditions of a Prince oughtto be, and his termes of government over his subjects, and towards hisfriends. And because I know that many have written hereupon; I doubt,lest I venturing also to treat thereof, may be branded with presumption,especially seeing I am like enough to deliver an opinion different fromothers. But my intent being to write for the advantage of him thatunderstands me, I thought it fitter to follow the effectuall truth ofthe matter, than the imagination thereof; And many Principalities andRepubliques, have been in imagination, which neither have been seen norknowne to be indeed: for there is such a distance between how men doelive, and how men ought to live; that he who leaves that which is done,for that which ought to be done, learnes sooner his ruine than hispreservation; for that man who will professe honesty in all his actions,must needs goe to ruine among so many that are dishonest. Whereupon itis necessary for a Prince, desiring to preserve himselfe, to be able tomake use of that honestie, and to lay it aside againe, as need shallrequire. Passing by then things that are only in imagination belongingto a Prince, to discourse upon those that are really true; I say thatall men, whensoever mention is made of them, and especially Princes,because they are placed aloft in the view of all, are taken notice offor some of these qualities, which procure them either commendations orblame: and this is that some one is held liberal, some miserable,(miserable I say, nor covetous; for the covetous desire to have, thoughit were by rapine; but a miserable man is he, that too much for bears tomake use of his owne) some free givers, others extortioners; somecruell, others pitious; the one a Leaguebreaker, another faithfull; theone effeminate and of small courage, the other fierce and couragious;the one courteous, the other proud; the one lascivious, the otherchaste; the one of faire dealing, the other wily and crafty; the onehard, the other easie; the one grave, the other light; the onereligious, the other incredulous, and such like. I know that every onewill confesse, it were exceedingly praise worthy for a Prince to beadorned with all these above nam'd qualities that are good: but becausethis is not possible, nor doe humane conditions admit such perfection invertues, it is necessary for him to be so discret, that he know how toavoid the infamie of those vices which would thrust him out of hisState; and if it be possible, beware of those also which are not able toremove him thence; but where it cannot be, let them passe with lesseregard. And yet, let him not stand much upon it, though he incurre theinfamie of those vices, without which he can very hardly save his State:for if all be throughly considerd, some thing we shall find which willhave the colour and very face of Vertue, and following them, they willlead the to thy destruction; whereas some others that shall as muchseeme vice, if we take the course they lead us, shall discover unto usthe way to our safety and well-being.    The second blemish in this our Authours book, I find in his    fifteenth Chapter: where he instructs his Prince to use such an    ambidexterity as that he may serve himselfe either of vertue, or    vice, according to his advantage, which in true pollicy is    neither good in attaining the Principality nor in securing it    when it is attaind. For Politicks, presuppose Ethiques, which    will never allow this rule: as that a man might make this small    difference between vertue, and vice, that he may indifferently    lay aside, or take up the one or the other, and put it in    practise as best conduceth to the end he propounds himselfe. I    doubt our Authour would have blamd Davids regard to Saul when 1    Sam. 24. in the cave he cut off the lap of Sauls garment, and    spared his head; and afterwards in the 26. when he forbad    Abishai to strike him as he lay sleeping. Worthy of a Princes    consideration is that saying of Abigal to David 1 Sam. 25. 30.    'It shall come to passe when the Lord shall have done to my Lord    according to all that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall    have appointed thee Ruler over Israel, that this shall be no    grief to thee, nor offence of heart unto my Lord, that thou hast    forborne to shed blood, etc.'    For surely the conscience of this evill ground whereupon they    have either built, or underpropped their tyranny, causes men, as    well _metus_ as _spes in longum projicere_, which sets them a    work on further mischiefe.CHAP. XVIOf Liberality, and Miserablenesse.Beginning then at the first of the above mentioned qualities, I say thatit would be very well to be accounted liberall: neverthelesse,liberality used in such a manner, as to make thee be accounted so,wrongs thee: for in case it be used vertuously, and as it ought to be,it shall never come to be taken notice of, so as to free thee from theinfamie of its contrary. And therefore for one to hold the name ofliberal among men, it were needfull not to omit any sumptuous quality,insomuch that a Prince alwayes so dispos'd, shall waste all hisrevenues, and at the end shall be forc'd, if he will still maintainethat reputation of liberality, heavily to burthen his subjects, andbecome a great exactour; and put in practise all those things that canbe done to get mony: Which begins to make him hatefull to his subjects,and fall into every ones contempt, growing necessitous: so that havingwith this liberality wrong'd many, and imparted of his bounty but to afew; he feels every first mischance, and runs a hazard of every firstdanger: Which he knowing, and desiring to withdraw himself from, incurspresently the disgrace of being termed miserable. A Prince therefore notbeing able to use this vertue of liberality, without his own damage, insuch a sort, that it may be taken notice of, ought, if he be wise, notto regard the name of Miserable; for in time he shall alwaies beesteemed the more liberal, seeing that by his parsimony his own revenuesare sufficient for him; as also he can defend himself against whoevermakes war against him, and can do some exploits without grieving hissubjects: so that he comes to use his liberality to all those, from whomhe takes nothing, who are infinite in number; and his miserablenesstowards those to whom he gives nothing, who are but a few. In our dayeswe have not seen any, but those who have been held miserable, do anygreat matters; but the others all quite ruin'd. Pope Julius the second,however he serv'd himself of the name of Liberal, to get the Papacy, yetnever intended he to continue it, to the end he might be able to makewar against the King of France: and he made so many wars withoutimposing any extraordinary tax, because his long thrift supplyed hislarge expences. This present King of Spain could never have undertaken,nor gone through with so many exploits, had he been accounted liberal.Wherefore a Prince ought little to regard (that he may not be driven topillage his subjects, that he may be able to defend himself, that he maynot fall into poverty and contempt, that he be not forced to become anextortioner) though he incurre the name of miserable; for this is one ofthose vices, which does not pluck him from his throne. And if any oneshould say, Caesar by his liberality obtained the Empire, and many others(because they both were, and were esteemd liberal) attaind to exceedinggreat dignities. I answer, either thou art already come to be a Prince,or thou art in the way to it; in the first case, this liberality ishurtful; in the second, it is necessary to be accounted so; and Caesarwas one of those that aspired to the Principality of Rome. But if afterhe had gotten it, he had survived, and not forborne those expences, hewould quite have ruined that Empire. And if any one should reply; manyhave been Princes, and with their armies have done great exploits, whohave been held very liberal. I answer, either the Prince spends of hisown and his subjects, or that which belongs to others: in the first, heought to be sparing; in the second, he should not omit any part ofliberality. And that Prince that goes abroad with his army, and feedsupon prey, and spoyle, and tributes, and hath the disposing of thatwhich belongs to others, necessarily should use this liberality;otherwise would his soldiers never follow him; and of that which isneither thine, nor thy subjects, thou mayest well be a free giver, aswere Cyrus, Caesar and Alexander; for the spending of that which isanothers, takes not away thy reputation, but rather adds to it, only thewasting of that which is thine own hurts thee; nor is there any thingconsumes itself so much as liberality, which whilest thou usest, thoulosest the means to make use of it, and becomest poore and abject; or toavoid this poverty, an extortioner and hatefull person. And among allthose things which a Prince ought to beware of is, to be dispised, andodious; to one and the other of which, liberality brings thee. Whereforethere is more discretion to hold the stile of Miserable, which begets aninfamy without hatred, than to desire that of Liberal, whereby toincurre the necessity of being thought an extortioner, which procures aninfamy with hatred.CHAP. XVIIOf Cruelty, and Clemency, and whether it is better to be belov'd, orfeard.Descending afterwards unto the other fore-alledged qualities, I say,that every Prince should desire to be held pitiful, and not cruel.Nevertheless ought he beware that he ill uses not this pitty. CaesarBorgia was accounted cruel, yet had his cruelty redrest the disorders inRomania, setled it in union, and restored it to peace, and fidelity:which, if it be well weighed, we shall see was an act of more pitty,than that of the people of Florence, who to avoyd the terme of cruelty,suffered Pistoya to fall to destruction. Wherefore a Prince ought not toregard the infamy of cruelty, for to hold his subjects united andfaithfull: for by giving a very few proofes of himself the other way, heshall be held more pittiful than they, who through their too much pitty,suffer disorders to follow, from whence arise murthers and rapines: forthese are wont to hurt an intire universality, whereas the executionspractised by a Prince, hurt only some particular. And among all sorts ofPrinces, it is impossible for a new Prince to avoyd the name of cruel,because all new States are full of dangers: whereupon Virgil by themouth of Dido excuses the inhumanity of her Kingdom, saying,  _Res dura et Regni novitas me talia cogunt  Moliri et late fines custode tenere._  My hard plight and new State force me to guard  My confines all about with watch and ward.Nevertheless ought he to be judicious in his giving belief to any thing,or moving himself thereat, nor make his people extreamly afraid of him;but proceed in a moderate way with wisdome, and humanity, that his toomuch confidence make him not unwary, and his too much distrustintolerable; from hence arises a dispute, whether it is better to bebelov'd or feard: I answer, a man would wish he might be the one and theother: but because hardly can they subsist both together, it is muchsafer to be feard, than be loved; being that one of the two must needsfail; for touching men, we may say this in general, they are unthankful,unconstant, dissemblers, they avoyd dangers, and are covetous of gain;and whilest thou doest them good, they are wholly thine; their blood,their fortunes, lives and children are at thy service, as is saidbefore, when the danger is remote; but when it approaches, they revolt.And that Prince who wholly relies upon their words, unfurnished of allother preparations, goes to wrack: for the friendships that are gottenwith rewards, and not by the magnificence and worth of the mind, aredearly bought indeed; but they will neither keep long, nor serve well intime of need: and men do less regard to offend one that is supported bylove, than by fear. For love is held by a certainty of obligation, whichbecause men are mischievous, is broken upon any occasion of their ownprofit. But fear restrains with a dread of punishment which neverforsakes a man. Yet ought a Prince cause himself to be belov'd in such amanner, that if he gains not love, he may avoid hatred: for it may wellstand together, that a man may be feard and not hated; which shall neverfail, if he abstain from his subjects goods, and their wives; andwhensoever he should be forc'd to proceed against any of their lives, doit when it is to be done upon a just cause, and apparent conviction; butabove all things forbeare to lay his hands on other mens goods; for menforget sooner the death of their father, than the loss of theirpatrimony. Moreover the occasions of taking from men their goods, donever fail: and alwaies he that begins to live by rapine, finds occasionto lay hold upon other mens goods: but against mens lives, they areseldome found, and sooner fail. But where a Prince is abroad in thefield with his army, and hath a multitude of soldiers under hisgovernment, then is it necessary that he stands not much upon it, thoughhe be termed cruel: for unless he be so, he shall never have hissoldiers live in accord one with another, nor ever well disposed to anybrave piece of service. Among Hannibals actions of mervail, this isreckoned for one, that having a very huge army, gathered out of severalnations, and all led to serve in a strange countrey, there was never anydissention neither amongst themselves, nor against their General, aswell in their bad fortune as their good. Which could not proceed fromany thing else than from that barbarous cruelty of his, which togetherwith his exceeding many vertues, rendred him to his soldiers bothvenerable and terrible; without which, to that effect his other vertueshad served him to little purpose: and some writers though not of thebest advised, on one side admire these his worthy actions, and on theotherside, condemn the principal causes thereof. And that it is true,that his other vertues would not have suffic'd him, we may consider inScipio, the rarest man not only in the dayes he liv'd, but even in thememory of man; from whom his army rebel'd in Spain: which grew only uponhis too much clemency, which had given way to his soldiers to becomemore licentious, than was well tollerable by military discipline: forwhich he was reprov'd by Fabius Maximus in the Senate, who termed himthe corrupter of the Roman soldiery. The Locrensians having beendestroyed by a Lieutenant of Scipio's, were never reveng'd by him, northe insolence of that Lieutenant punisht; all this arising from hiseasie nature: so that one desiring to excuse him in the Senate, said,that there were many men knew better how to keep themselves from faults,than to correct the faults of other men: which disposition of his intime would have wrong'd Scipio's reputation and glory, had he therewithcontinu'd in his commands: but living under the government of theSenate, this quality of his that would have disgrac'd him not only wasconceal'd, but prov'd to the advancement of his glory. I conclude then,returning to the purpose of being feard, and belov'd; insomuch as menlove at their own pleasure, and to serve their own turne, and their feardepends upon the Princes pleasure, every wise Prince ought to groundupon that which is of himself, and not upon that which is of another:only this, he ought to use his best wits to avoid hatred, as was said.CHAP. XVIIIIn what manner Princes ought to keep their words.How commendable in a Prince it is to keep his word, and live withintegrity, not making use of cunning and subtlety, every one knows well:yet we see by experience in these our dayes, that those Princes haveeffected great matters, who have made small reckoning of keeping theirwords, and have known by their craft to turne and wind men about, and inthe end, have overcome those who have grounded upon the truth. You mustthen know, there are two kinds of combating or fighting; the one byright of the laws, the other meerly by force. That first way is properto men, the other is also common to beasts: but because the first manytimes suffices not, there is a necessity to make recourse to the second;wherefore it behooves a Prince to know how to make good use of that partwhich belongs to a beast, as well as that which is proper to a man. Thispart hath been covertly shew'd to Princes by ancient writers; who saythat Achilles and many others of those ancient Princes were intrusted toChiron the Senator, to be brought up under his discipline: the moral ofthis, having for their teacher one that was half a beast and half a man,was nothing else, but that it was needful for a Prince to understand howto make his advantage of the one and the other nature, because neithercould subsist without the other. A Prince then being necessitated toknow how to make use of that part belonging to a beast, ought to servehimself of the conditions of the Fox and the Lion; for the Lion cannotkeep himself from snares, nor the Fox defend himself against the Wolves.He had need then be a Fox, that he may beware of the snares, and a Lionthat he may scare the wolves. Those that stand wholly upon the Lion,understand not well themselves. And therefore a wise Prince cannot, norought not keep his faith given when the observance thereof turnes todisadvantage, and the occasions that made him promise, are past. For ifmen were all good, this rule would not be allowable; but being they arefull of mischief, and would not make it good to thee, neither art thoutyed to keep it with them: nor shall a Prince ever want lawfulloccasions to give colour to this breach. Very many modern exampleshereof might be alledg'd, wherein might be shewed how many peacesconcluded, and how many promises made, have been violated and broken bythe infidelity of Princes; and ordinarily things have best succeededwith him that hath been nearest the Fox in condition. But it isnecessary to understand how to set a good colour upon this disposition,and to be able to fain and dissemble throughly; and men are so simple,and yeeld so much to the present necessities, that he who hath a mind todeceive, shall alwaies find another that will be deceivd. I will notconceal any one of the examples that have been of late. Alexander thesixth, never did any thing else than deceive men, and never meantotherwise, and alwaies found whom to work upon; yet never was there manwould protest more effectually, nor aver any thing with more solemnoaths, and observe them less than he; nevertheless, his cousenages allthriv'd well with him; for he knew how to play this part cunningly.Therefore is there no necessity for a Prince to be endued with all abovewritten qualities, but it behooveth well that he seem to be so; orrather I will boldly say this, that having these qualities, and alwaiesregulating himself by them, they are hurtfull; but seeming to have them,they are advantageous; as to seem pittiful, faithful, mild, religious,and of integrity, and indeed to be so; provided withall thou beest ofsuch a composition, that if need require to use the contrary, thoucanst, and knowest how to apply thy self thereto. And it suffices toconceive this, that a Prince, and especially a new Prince, cannotobserve all those things, for which men are held good; he being oftenforc'd, for the maintenance of his State, to do contrary to his faith,charity, humanity, and religion: and therefore it behooves him to have amind so disposd, as to turne and take the advantage of all winds andfortunes; and as formerly I said, not forsake the good, while he can;but to know how to make use of the evil upon necessity. A Prince thenought to have a special care, that he never let fall any words, but whatare all season'd with the five above written qualities, and let him seemto him that sees and hears him, all pitty, all faith, all integrity, allhumanity, all religion; nor is there any thing more necessary for him toseem to have, than this last quality: for all men in general judgethereof, rather by the sight, than by the touch; for every man may cometo the sight of him, few come to the touch and feeling of him; yvery manmay come to see what thou seemest, few come to perceive and understandwhat thou art; and those few dare not oppose the opinion of many, whohave the majesty of State to protect them: And in all mens actions,especially those of Princes wherein there is no judgement to appealeunto men, forbeare to give their censures, till the events and ends ofthings. Let a Prince therefore take the surest courses he can tomaintain his life and State: the means shall alwaies be thoughthonorable, and commended by every one; for the vulgar is over-taken withthe appearance and event of a thing: and for the most part of people,they are but the vulgar: the others that are but few, take place wherethe vulgar have no subsisteance. A Prince there is in these dayes, whomI shall not do well to name, that preaches nothing else but peace andfaith; but had he kept the one and the other, several times had theytaken from him his state and reputation.    In the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth Chap, our Author    descends to particulars, perswading his Prince in his sixteenth    to such a suppleness of disposition, as that upon occasion he    can make use either of liberality or miserableness, as need    shall require. But that of liberality is to last no longer than    while he is in the way to some designe: which if he well weigh,    is not really a reward of vertue, how ere it seems; but a bait    and lure to bring birds to the net. In the seventeenth Chap, he    treats of clemency and cruelty, neither of which are to be    exercis'd by him as acts of mercy or justice; but as they may    serve to advantage his further purposes. And lest the Prince    should incline too much to clemency, our Author allows rather    the restraint by fear, than by love. The contrary to which all    stories shew us. I will say this only, cruelty may cut of the    power of some, but causes the hatred of all, and gives a will to    most to take the first occasion offerd for revenge. In the    eighteenth Chap, our Author discourses how Princes ought to    govern themselves in keeping their promises made: whereof he    sayes they ought to make such small reckoning, as that rather    they should know by their craft how to turne and wind men about,    whereby to take advantage of all winds and fortunes. To this I    would oppose that in the fifteenth Psal. v. 5. He that sweareth    to his neighbor, and disappointeth him not, though it were to    his own hindrance. It was a King that writ it, and me thinks the    rule he gave, should well befit both King and Subject: and    surely this perswades against all taking of advantages. A man    may reduce all the causes of faith-breaking to three heads. One    may be, because he that promised, had no intention to keep his    word; and this is a wicked and malitious way of dealing. A    second may bee, because hee that promisd, repents of his promise    made; and that is grounded on unconstancy, and lightness in that    he would not be well resolved before he entred into covenant.    The third may be, when it so falls out, that it lyes not in his    power that made the promise to performe it. In which case a man    ought to imitate the good debter, who having not wherewithall to    pay, hides not himself, but presents his person to his creditor,    willingly suffering imprisonment. The first and second are very    vitious and unworthy of a Prince: in the third, men might well    be directed by the examples of those two famous Romans, Regulus    and Posthumius. I shall close this with the answer of Charles    the fifth, when he was pressed to break his word with Luther for    his safe return from Wormes; _Fides rerum promissarum etsi toto    mundo exulet, tamen apud imperatorem cam consistere oportet_.    Though truth be banisht out of the whole world, yet should it    alwaies find harbour in an Emperors breast.[Sidenote: _Gulielmus Xenocarus_ in vit. Car. Quinti.]CHAP. XIXThat Princes should take a care, not to incurre contempt or hatred.But because among the qualities, whereof formerly mention is made, Ihave spoken of those of most importance, I will treat of the others morebriefly under these qualityes that a Prince is to beware, as in part isabove-said, and that he fly those things which cause him to be odious orvile: and when ever he shall avoid this, he shall fully have plaid hispart, and in the other disgraces he shall find no danger at all. Thereis nothing makes him so odious, as I said, as his extortion of hissubjects goods, and abuse of their women, from which he ought toforbear; and so long as he wrongs not his whole people, neither in theirgoods, nor honors, they live content, and he hath only to strive withthe Ambition of some few: which many waies and easily too, isrestrain'd. To be held various, light, effeminate, faint-hearted,unresolv'd, these make him be contemnd and thought base, which a Princeshould shun like rocks, and take a care that in all his actions thereappear magnanimity, courage, gravity, and valor; and that in all theprivate affairs of his subjects, he orders it so, that his word standirrevocable: and maintain himself in such repute, that no man may thinkeither to deceive or wind and turn him about: that Prince that givessuch an opinion of himself, is much esteemed, and against him who is sowell esteemed, hardly are any conspiracies made by his subjects, or byforreiners any invasion, when once notice is taken of his worth, and howmuch he is reverenced by his subjects: For a Prince ought to have twofears, the one from within, in regard of his subjects; the other fromabroad, in regard of his mighty neighbors; from these he defends himselfby good armes and good friends; and alwayes he shall have good friends,if he have good armes; and all things shall alwaies stand sure at home,when those abroad are firme, in case some conspiracy have not disturbedthem; and however the forrein matters stand but ticklishly; yet if hehave taken such courses at home, and liv'd as we have prescribed, heshall never be able (in case he forsake not himself) to resist allpossibility, force and violence, as I said Nabis the Spartan did: buttouching his subjects, even when his affairs abroad are setled, it is tobe fear'd they may conspire privily; from which a Prince sufficientlysecure himself by shunning to be hated or contemned, and keeping himselfin his peoples good opinion, which it is necessary for him to compass,as formerly we treated at large. And one of the powerfullest remedies aPrince can have against conspiracies, is, not to be hated nor dispisedby the universality; for alwaies he that conspires, beleeves the Princesdeath is acceptable to the subject: but when he thinks it displeasesthem, he hath not the heart to venture on such a matter; for thedifficulties that are on the conspirators side, are infinite. Byexperience it is plain, that many times plots have been laid, but few ofthem have succeeded luckily; for he that conspires, cannot be alone, norcan he take the company of any, but of those, who he beleeves aremalecontents; and so soon as thou hast discover'd thy self to amalecontent, thou givest him means to work his own content: for byrevealing thy treason, he may well hope for all manner of favour: sothat seeing his gain certain of one side; and on the other, finding onlydoubt and danger, either he had need be a rare friend, or that he be anexceeding obstinate enemy to the Prince, if he keeps his word with thee.And to reduce this matter into short termes: I say, there is nothing butjealousie, fear, and suspect of punishment on the conspirators part toaffright him; but on the Princes part, there is the majesty of theprincipality, the laws, the defences of his friends and the State, whichdo so guard him, that to all these things the peoples good wills beingadded, it is unpossible any one should be so head-strong as to conspire;for ordinarily where a traytor is to feare before the execution of hismischiefe, in this case he is also to feare afterwards, having thepeople for his enemy when the fact is commited, and therefore for thiscause, not being able to hope for any refuge. Touching this matter, manyexamples might be brought; but I will content my selfe to name one whichfell out in the memory of our Fathers. Annibal Bentivolii, grand Fatherof this Annibal who now lives, that was Prince in Bolonia, being slaineby the Canneschi that conspir'd against him, none of his race beingleft, but this John, who was then in swadling clouts; presently thepeople rose upon this murder, and slew all the Canneschi which proceededfrom the popular affection, which the family of the Bentivolii held thenin Bolonia: which was so great, that being there remain'd not any, nowAnniball was dead, that was able to manage the State; and having noticethat in Florence there was one borne of the Bentivolii, who till thenwas taken for a Smiths sonne: the citizens of Bolonia went to Florencefor him, and gave the government of their City to him, which was rul'dby him, untill John was of fit yeares to governe. I conclude then, thata Prince ought to make small account of treasons, whiles he hath thepeople to friend: but if they be his enemies and hate him, he may wellfeare every thing, and every one. And well ordered States, and discreetPrinces have taken care withall diligence, not to cause their great mento fall into desperation, and to content the people, and so to maintainethem: for this is one of the most important businesses belonging to aPrince. Among the Kingdomes that are well orderd and governd in ourdayes, is that of France, and therein are found exceeding many goodorders, whereupon the Kings liberty and security depends: of which thechiefe is the Parliament, and the authority thereof: for he that foundedthat Kingdome, knowing the great mens ambition and insolence; andjudgeing it necessary there should be a bridle to curbe them; and on theother side knowing the hatred of the Commonalty against the great ones,grounded upon feare, intending to secure them, would not lay this carewholly upon the King, but take this trouble from him, which he mighthave with the great men, in case he favourd the Commonalty; or with theCommonalty, in case he favourd the great men; and thereupon set up athird judge, which was that, to the end it should keep under the greatones, and favour the meaner sort, without any imputation to the King. Itwas not possible to take a better, nor wiser course then this; nor asurer way to secure the King, and the Kingdome. From whence we may drawanother conclusion worthie of note, that Princes ought to cause othersto take upon them the matters of blame and imputation; and uponthemselves to take only those of grace and favour. Here againe Iconclude, that a Prince ought to make good esteeme of his Nobility; butnot thereby to incur the Commons hatred: It would seeme perhaps to many,considering the life and death of many Romane Emperours, that they wereexamples contrary to my opinion, finding that some have liv'd worthily,and shewd many rare vertues of the minde, and yet have lost the Empire,and been put to death by their owne subjects, conspiring against them.Intending then to answer these objections, I shall discourse upon thequalities of some Emperours, declaring the occasions of their ruine, notdisagreeing from that which I have alledgd; and part thereof I willbestow on the consideration of these things, which are worthy to benoted by him that reads the actions of those times: and it shall sufficeme to take all those Emperours that succeeded in the Empire from Marcusthe Philosopher to Maximinus, who were Mercus and Commodus his sonne,Pertinax, Julian, Severus, Antonius, Caracalla his sonne, Macrinus,Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximin. And first it is to be noted, thatwhere in the other Principalities, they are to contend only with theambition of the Nobles, and the insolence of the people; the RomaneEmperours had a third difficulty, having to support the cruelty andcovetousnesse of the souldiers, which was so hard a thing, that itcaused the ruine of many, being hard to satisfy the souldiers, and thepeople; for the people love their quiet, and therefore affect modestPrinces; and the souldiers love a Prince of a warlike courage, that isinsolent, cruell, and plucking from every one: which things they wouldhave them exercise upon the people, whereby they might be able to doubletheir stipends, and satisfie their avarice and cruelty: whence itproceeds, that those Emperours who either by Nature or by Art, had notsuch a reputation, as therewith they could curbe the one and the other,were alwayes ruind: and the most of them, specially those who as new mencame to the principality, finding the difficulty of those two differenthumours, applyed themselves to content the souldiers, making smallaccount of wronging the people, which was a course then necessary; forthe Princes not being able to escape the hatred of every one, oughtfirst endeavour that they incurre not the hatred of any wholeuniversality; and when they cannot attaine thereunto, they are toprovide with all industry, to avoyd the hatred of those universalitiesthat are the most mighty. And therefore those Emperors, who because theywere but newly call'd to the Empire, had need of extraordinary favours,more willingly stuck to the soldiers, than to the people; whichneverthelesse turnd to their advantage, or otherwise, according as thatPrince knew how to maintaine his repute with them. From these causesaforesayd proceeded it, that Marcus Pertinax, and Alexander, though allliving modestly, being lovers of justice, and enemies of cruelty,courteous and bountifull, had all from Marcus on ward, miserable ends;Marcus only liv'd and dy'd exceedingly honoured: for he came to theEmpire by inheritance, and was not to acknowledge it either from thesoldiers, nor from the people: afterwards being accompanyed with manyvertues, which made him venerable, he held alwayes whilst he liv'd theone and the other order within their limits, and was never either hated,or contemnd. But Pertinax was created Emperour against the soldierswills, who being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, couldnot endure that honest course that Pertinax sought to reduce them to:Whereupon having gotten himself hatred, and to this hatred addedcontempt, in that he was old, was ruind in the very beginning of hisgovernment. Whence it ought to be observed, that hatred is gaind as wellby good deeds as bad; and therefore as I formerly said, when a Princewould maintaine the State, he is often forced not to be good: for whenthat generality, whether it be the people, or soldiers, or Nobility,whereof thou thinkst thou standst in need to maintain thee, iscorrupted, it behoves thee to follow their humour, and content them, andthen all good deeds are thy adversaries. But let us come to Alexanderwho was of that goodnesse, that among the prayses given him, had thisfor one, that in fourteen yeers wherein he held the Empire, he never putany man to death, but by course of justice; neverthelesse being heldeffeminate, and a man that suffered himselfe to be ruled by his mother,and thereupon fallen into contempt, the army conspird against him. Nowon the contrary discoursing upon the qualities of Commodus, Severus,Antonius, Caracalla, and Maximinus, you shall find them exceedingcruell, and ravinous, who to satisfie their soldiers, forbeare no kindeof injury that could be done upon the people; and all of them, exceptSeverus, came to evill ends: for in Severus, there was suchextraordinary valour, that while he held the soldiers his freinds,however the people were much burthend by him, he might alwayes reignehappily: for his valour rendred him so admirable in the souldiers andpeoples sights; that these in a manner stood amazd and astonishd, andthose others reverencing and honoring him. And because the actions ofthis man were exceeding great, being in a new Prince, I will brieflyshew how well he knew to act the Foxes and the Lions parts; theconditions of which two, I say, as before, are very necessary for aPrince to imitate. Severus having had experience of Julian the Emperourssloth, perswaded his army (whereof he was commander in Sclavonia) thatthey should doe well to goe to Rome to revenge Pertinax his death, whowas put to death by the Imperiall guard; and under this pretence, notmaking any shew that he aspird unto the Empire, set his army in marchdirectly towards Rome, and was sooner come into Italy, than it wasknowne he had mov'd from his station. Being ariv'd at Rome, he was bythe Senate chosen Emperour for feare, and Julian slaine. After thisbeginning, two difficulties yet remaind to Severus, before he could makehimselfe Lord of the whole State; the one in Asia, where Niger theGenerall of those armies had gotten the title of Emperour, the other inthe West with Albinus, who also aspird to the Empire: and because hethought there might be some danger to discover himselfe enemy to themboth, he purposed to set upon Niger, and cozen Albinus, to whom he writ,that being elected Emperour by the Senate, he would willinglycommunicate it with him; and thereupon sent him the title of Caesar, andby resolution of the Senate, tooke him to him for his Colleague; whichthings were taken by Albinus in true meaning. But afterwards whenSeverus had overcome and slaine Niger, and pacified the affaires and inthe East, being returned to Rome, he complaind in the Senate of Albinus,how little weighing the benefits received from him, he had sought toslay him by treason, and therefore was he forc'd to goe punish hisingratitude: afterwards he went into France, where he bereft him both ofhis State and life, whoever then shall in particular examine hisactions, shall finde he was a very cruell Lion, and as crafty a Fox: andshall see that he was alwayes feard and reverenc'd by every one, and bythe armies not hated; and shall nothing marvell that he being a new man,was able to hold together such a great Empire: for his extraordinaryreputation defended him alwayes from that hatred, which the people forhis extortions might have conceiv'd against him. But Antonius his sonne,was also an exceeding brave man, and endued with most excellentqualities, which causd him to be admird by the people, and acceptable tothe souldiers, because he was a warlike man, enduring all kind oftravell and paines, despising all delicate food, and all kinde ofeffeminacy, which gaind him the love of all the armies: neverthelessehis fiercenesse and cruelty were such, and so hideous, having upon manyparticular occasions put to death a great part of the people of Rome,and all those of Alexandria, that he grew odious to the world, and beganto be feard by those also that were neare about him; so that he wasslaine by a Centurion in the very midst of his army. Where it is to benoted, that these kinde of deaths, which follow upon the deliberation ofa resolv'd and obstinate minde, cannot by a Prince be avoyded: for everyone that feares not to dye, is able to doe it; but a Prince ought to belesse afraid of it because it very seldome falls out. Only should hebeware not to doe any extreame injury to any of those of whom he serveshimself, or that he hath near about him in any imployment of hisPrincipality, as Antonius did: who had reproachfully slaine a brother ofthat Centurion; also threatned him every day, and neverthelesseentertaind him still as one of the guards of his body, which was a rashcourse taken, and the way to destruction, as befell him. But let us cometo Commodus for whom it was very easie to hold the Empire, by reason itdescended upon him by inheritance, being Marcus his sonne, and it hadbeen enough for him to follow his fathers footsteps, and then had hecontented both the people and the soldiers: but being of a cruell andsavage disposition, whereby to exercise his actions upon the people, hegave himselfe to entertaine armies, and those in all licentiousnesse. Onthe other part not maintaining his dignity, but often descending uponthe stages to combate with fencers, and doing such other like basethings, little worthy of the Imperiall majesty, he became contemptiblein the soldiers sight; and being hated of one part, and despisd of theother, he was conspird against, and slaine. It remaines now, that wedeclare Maximinus his conditions, who was a very warlike man; and thearmies loathing Alexanders effeminacy, whereof I spake before, when theyhad slain him, chose this man Emperour, who not long continued so,because two things there were that brought him into hatred and contempt;the one because he was very base, having kept cattell in Thrace, whichwas well knowne to every one, and made them to scorne him; the other,because in the beginning of his Principality having delayd to goe toRome, and enter into possession of the Imperiall throne, he had gaindthe infamy of being thought exceeding cruell, having by his Prefects inRome, and in every place of the Empire, exercisd many cruelties,insomuch that the whole world being provok'd against him to contempt forthe basenesse of his blood; on the other side upon the hatred conceiv'dagainst him for feare of his crulty; first Affrica, afterwards theSenate, with all the people of Rome and all Italy, conspired againsthim, with whom his own army took part; which incamping before Aquileya,and finding some difficulty to take the town, being weary of hiscruelties, and because they saw he had so many enemies, fearing him thelesse, slew him. I purpose not to say any thing either of Heliogabalus,Macrinus, or Julian, who because they were throughly base, were sudenlyextinguished: but I will come to the conclusion of this discourse; and Isay, that the Princes of our times have lesse of this difficulty tosatisfie the Soldiers extraordinarily in their government; fornotwithstanding that there be some considerations to be had of them, yetpresently are those armies dissolved, because none of these Princes douse to maintaine any armies together, which are annex'd and inveteratedwith the governments of the provinces, as were the armies of the RomaneEmpire. And therefore if then it was necessary rather to content thesoldiers than the people, it was because the soldiers were morepowerfull than the people: now is it more necessary for all Princes,(except the Turk and the Souldan) to satisfie their people than theirsoldiers, because the people are more mighty than they; wherein I exceptthe Turk, he alwayes maintaining about his person 12000 foot, and 15000horse, upon which depends the safety and strength of his Kingdome; andit is necessary that laying aside all other regard of his people, hemaintaine these his friends. The Souldans Kingdome is like hereunto,which being wholy in the souldiers power, he must also without respectof his people keep them his friends. And you are to consider, that thisState of the Souldans differs much from all the other Principalities:For it is very like the Papacy, which cannot be termd an hereditaryPrincipality: nor a new Principality: for the sons of the deceasd Princeare not heires and Lords thereof, but he that is chosen receives thatdignity from those who have the authority in them. And this order beingof antiquity, cannot be termd a new Principality, because therein arenone of those difficulties that are in new ones: for though the Princebe new, yet are the orders of that state ancient, and ordaind to receivehim, as if he were their hereditary Prince. But let us returne to ourmatter; whosoever shall consider our discourse before, shall perceivethat either hatred, or contempt have caus'd the ruine of the afore-namedEmperors; and shall know also, from it came that part of them proceedingone way, and part a contrary; yet in any of them the one had a happysuccess, and the others unhappy: for it was of no availe, but ratherhurtful for Pertinax and Alexander, because they were new Princes, todesire to imitate Marcus, who by inheritance came to the Principality:and in like manner it was a wrong to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximus,to imitate Severus, because none of them were endued with so great valoras to follow his steps therein. Wherefore a new Prince in hisPrincipality cannot well imitate Marcus his actions; nor yet is itnecessary to follow those of Severus: but he ought make choyce of thoseparts in Severus which are necessary for the founding of a State; and totake from Marcus those that are fit and glorious to preserve a Statewhich is already established and setled.CHAP. XXWhether the Citadels and many other things which Princes often make useof, are profitable or dammageable.Some Princes, whereby they might safely keep their State, have disarmedtheir subjects; some others have held the towns under their dominion,divided into factions; others have maintain'd enmities againstthemselves; others have appli'd themselves to gain them, where they havesuspected at their entrance into the government; others have builtFortresses; and others again have ruined and demolished them: andhowever that upon all these things, a man cannot well pass a determinatesentence, unless one comes to the particulars of these States, wheresome such like determinations were to be taken; yet I shall speak ofthem in so large a manner, as the matter of it self will bear. It wasnever then that a new Prince would disarme his own subjects; but ratherwhen he hath found them disarmed, he hath alwaies arm'd them. For beingbelov'd, those armes become thine; those become faithful, which thouhadst in suspicion; and those which were faithful, are maintaind so; andthy subjects are made thy partisans; and because all thy subjects cannotbe put in armes, when thou bestowest favors on those thou armest, withthe others thou canst deal more for thy safety; and that difference ofproceeding which they know among them, obliges them to thee; thoseothers excuse thee, judgeing it necessary that they have deservd more,who have undergone more danger, and so have greater obligation: but whenthou disarmst them, thou beginst to offend them, that thou distrustestthem, either for cowardise, or small faith; and the one or the other ofthose two opinions provokes their hatred against thee; and because thoucanst not stand disarmed, thou must then turn thy self to mercenarySoldiery, whereof we have formerly spoken what it is, and when it isgood; it can never be so much as to defend thee from powerful enemies,and suspected subjects; therefore as I have said, a new Prince in a newPrincipality hath alwaies ordaind them armes. Of examples to thispurpose, Histories are full. But when a Prince gains a new State, whichas a member he adds to his ancient dominions, then it is necessary todisarme that State, unless it be those whom thou hast discoverd to haveassisted thee in the conquest thereof; and these also in time and uponoccasions, it is necessary to render delicate and effeminate, and soorder them, that all the arms of thy State be in the hands of thy ownSoldiers, who live in thy ancient State near unto thee. Our ancestorsand they that were accounted Sages, were wont to say that it wasnecessary to hold Pistoya in factions, and Pisa with Fortresses; and forthis cause maintaind some towns subject to them in differences, wherebyto hold it more easily. This, at what time Italy was ballanc'd in acertain manner, might be well done; but mee thinks it cannot now a dayesbe well given for a precept; for I do not beleeve, that divisions madecan do any good; rather it must needs be, that when the enemy approachesthem, Cities divided are presently lost; for alwaies the weaker partwill cleave to the forrein power, and the other not be able to subsist.The Venetians (as I think) mov'd by the aforesaid reasons, maintaind thefactions of the Guelfes and Gibellins, in their townes; and however theynever suffered them to spill one anothers blood, yet they nourish'dthese differences among them, to the end that the citizens imployd inthese quarrels, should not plot any thing against them: which as itproved, never serv'd them to any great purpose: for being defeated atVayla, presently one of those two factions took courage and seizd upontheir whole State. Therefore such like waies argue the Princes weakness;for in a strong principality they never will suffer such divisions; forthey shew them some kind of profit in time of peace, being they are ableby means thereof more easily to mannage their subjects: but war comming,such like orders discover their fallacy. Without doubt, Princes becomegreat, when they overcome the difficulties and oppositions that are madeagainst them; and therefore Fortune especially when she hath to make anynew Prince great, who hath more need to gain reputation than anhereditary Prince, causes enemies to rise against him, and him toundertake against them: to the end he may have occasion to master them,and know that ladder, which his enemies have set him upon, whereby torise yet higher. And therefore many think, that a wise Prince when hehath the occasion, ought cunningly to nourish some enmity, that by thesuppressing thereof, his greatness may grow thereupon. Princes,especially those that are new, have found more faith and profit in thosemen, who in the beginning of their State, have been held suspected, thanin those who at their entrance have been their confidents. PandulphusPetrucci, Prince of Siena, governd his State, more with them that hadbeen suspected by him, than with the others. But of this matter wecannot speak at large, because it varies according to the subject; Iwill only say this, that those men, who in the beginning of aPrincipality were once enemies, if they be of quality so that tomaintain themselves they have need of support, the Prince might alwaieswith the greatest facility gain for his; and they are the rather forcedto serve him faithfully, insomuch as they know it is more necessary forthem by their deeds to cancel that sinister opinion, which was once heldof them; and so the Prince ever draws from these more advantage, thanfrom those, who serving him too supinely, neglect his affairs. And seingthe matter requires it, I will not omit to put a Prince in mind, whohath anew made himself master of a State, by means of the inward helpshe had from thence that he consider well the cause that mov'd them thatfavor'd him to favor him, if it be not a natural affection towards him;for if it be only because they were not content with their formergovernment, with much pains and difficulties shall he be able to keepthem long his friends, because it will be impossible for him to contentthem. By these examples then which are drawn out of ancient and modernaffaires, searching into the cause hereof, we shall find it much moreeasie to gain those men for friends, who formerly were contented withthe State, and therefore were his enemies: than those, who because theywere not contented therewith, became his fiends, and favor'd him ingetting the mastery of it. It hath been the custome of Princes, wherebyto hold their States more securely, to build Citadels, which might bebridles and curbs to those that should purpose any thing against them,and so to have a secure retreat from the first violences. I commend thiscourse, because it hath been used of old; notwithstanding NicholasVitelli in our dayes hath been known to demolish two Citadels in thetown of Castello, the better to keep the State; Guidubaldo Duke of Urbinbeing to return into his State, out of which he was driven by CaesarBorgia, raz'd all the Fortresses of that Countrey, and thought he shouldhardlyer lose that State again without them. The Bentivolii returninginto Bolonia, used the like courses. Citadels then are profitable, ornot, according to the times; and if they advantage thee in one part,they do thee harme in another; and this part may be argued thus. ThatPrince who stands more in fear of his own people than of strangers,ought to build Fortresses: but he that is more afraid of strangers thanof his people, should let them alone. Against the house of Sforza, theCastle of Milan, which Francis Sforza built, hath and will make morewar, than any other disorder in that State: and therefore the bestCitadel that may be, is not to incurre the peoples hatred; for howeverthou holdest a Fortress, and the people hate thee, thou canst hardlyscape them; for people, when once they have taken armes, never want thehelp of strangers at their need to take ther parts. In our dayes wenever saw that they ever profited any Prince, unless it were theCountess of Furli, when Count Hieronymo of Furli her husband was slain;for by means thereof she escap'd the peoples rage, and attended aid fromMilan, and so recover'd her State: and then such were the times that thestranger could not assist the people: but afterwards they serv'd her tolittle purpose, when Caesar Borgia assaild her, and that the people whichwas her enemy, sided with the stranger. Therefore both then, and atfirst, it would have been more for her safety, not to have been odiousto the people, than to have held the Fortresses. These things being wellweigh'd then, I will commend those that shall build up Fortresses, andhim also that shall not; and I will blame him, howsoever he be, thatrelying upon those, shall make small account of being hated by hispeople.CHAP. XXIHow a Prince ought to behave himself to gain reputation.There is nothing gains a Prince such repute as great exploits, and raretryals of himself in Heroick actions. We have now in our dayes FerdinandKing of Arragon the present King of Spain: he in a manner may be termeda new Prince; for from a very weak King, he is now become for fame andglory, the first King of Christendome, and if you shall wel consider hisactions, you shall find them all illustrious, and every one of themextraordinary. He in the beginning of his reign assaild Granada, andthat exploit was the ground of his State. At first he made that war insecurity, and without suspicion he should be any waies hindred, andtherein held the Barons of Castiglias minds busied, who thinking uponthat war, never minded any innovation; in this while he gaind credit andauthority with them, they not being aware of it; was able to maintainwith the Church and the peoples money all his soldiers, and to lay afoundation for his military ordinances with that long war, whichafterwards gaind him exceeding much honor. Besides this, to the end hemight be able hereamong to undertake greater matters, serving himselfalwaies of the colour of religion, he gave himself to a kind ofreligious cruelty, chasing and dispoyling those Jewes out of theKingdome; nor can this example be more admirable and rare: under thesame cloke he invaded Affrick and went through with his exploit inItaly: and last of all hath he assaild France, and so alwaies proceededon forwards contriving of great matters, which alwaies have held hissubjects minds in peace and admiration, and busied in attending theevent, what it should be: and these his actions have thus grown, oneupon another, that they have never given leisure to men so to rest, asthey might ever plot any thing against them. Moreover it much avails aPrince to give extraordinary proofes of himself touching the governmentwithin, such as those we have heard of Bernard of Milan, whensoeveroccasion is given by any one, that may effectuate some great thingeither of good or evil, in the civil government; and to find out someway either to reward or punish it, whereof in the world much notice maybe taken. And above all things a Prince ought to endeavor in all hisactions to spread abroad a fame of his magnificence and worthiness. APrince also is well esteemed, when he is a true friend, or a true enemy;when without any regard he discovers himself in favor of one againstanother; which course shall be alwaies more profit, than to standneuter: for if two mighty ones that are thy neighbors, come to fall out,or are of such quality, that one of them vanquishing, thou art like tobe in fear of the vanquisher, or not; in either of these two cases, itwill ever prove more for thy profit, to discover thy self, and make agood war of it: for in the first case, if thou discoverest not thyselfe, thou shalt alwaies be a prey to him that overcomes, to thecontentment and satisfaction of the vanquisht; neither shalt thou havereason on thy side, nor any thing else to defend or receive thee. For hethat overcomes, will not have any suspected friends that give him noassistance in his necessity: and he that loses, receives thee not,because thou wouldest not with thy armes in hand run the hazzard of hisfortune. Antiochus passed into Greece, thereunto induc'd by theEtolians, to chace the Romans thence: and sent his Ambassadors to theAchayans, who were the Romans friends, to perswade them to standneuters; on the other side the Romans moved them to joyne armes withtheirs: this matter came to be deliberated on in the council of theAchayans, where Antiochus his Ambassador encouraged them to standneuters, whereunto the Romans Ambassador answerd; Touching the course,that is commended to you, as best and profitablest for your State, towit, not to intermeddle in the war between us, nothing can be moreagainst you: because, not taking either part, you shall remain withoutthanks, and without reputation a prey to the conqueror. And it willalwaies come to pass that he who is not thy friend, will requite thyneutrality; and he that is thy friend, will urge thee to discover thyself by taking arms for him: and evil advised Princes; to avoyd thepresent dangers, folow often times that way of neutrality, and mostcommonly go to ruine: but when a Prince discovers himself strongly infavor of a party; if he to whom thou cleavest, overcomes; however thathe be puissant, and thou remainest at his disposing, he is oblig'd tothee, and there is a contract of friendship made; and men are never soopenly dishonest, as with such a notorious example of dishonesty tooppress thee. Besides victories are never so prosperous, that theconqueror is like neglect all respects, and especially of justice. Butif he to whom thou stickst, loses, thou art received by him; and, whilehe is able, he aydes thee, and so thou becomest partner of a fortunethat may arise again; the second case, when they that enter into thelists together, are of such quality, that thou needest not fear him thatvanquisheth, so much the more is it discretion in thee to stick to him;for thou goest to ruine one with his assistance, who ought to do thebest he could to save him, if he were well advised; and he overcomming,is left at thy discretion; and it is unpossible but with thy ayd he mustovercome. And here it is to be noted, that a Prince should be well awarenever to joyn with any one more powerfull than himself, to offendanother, unless upon necessity, as formerly is said. For when heovercomes, thou art left at his discretion, and Princes ought avoid asmuch as they are able, to stand at anothers discretion. The Venetianstook part with France against the Duke of Milan, and yet could haveavoided that partaking, from which proceeded their ruine. But when itcannot be avoyded, as it befel the Florentines when the Pope and theKing of Spain went both with their armies to Lombardy, there the Princeought to side with them for the reasons aforesaid. Nor let any Statethink they are able to make such sure parties, but rather that they areall doubtfull; for in the order of things we find it alwaies, thatwhensoever a man seeks to avoid one inconvenient, he incurs another. Butthe principal point of judgement, is in discerning between the qualitiesof inconvenients, and not taking the bad for the good. Moreover a Princeought to shew himself a lover of vertue, and that he honors those thatexcel in every Art. Afterwards ought he encourage his Citizens, wherebythey may be enabled quickly to exercise their faculties as well inmerchandise, and husbandry, as in any other kind of traffick, to the endthat no man forbear to adorne and cultivate his possessions for fearthat he be despoyled of them; or any other to open the commerce upon thedanger of heavy impositions: but rather to provide rewards for thosethat shall set these matters afoot, or for any one else that shall anyway amplifie his City or State. Besides he ought in the fit times of theyear entertain the people with Feasts and Maskes; and because every Cityis devided into Companies, and arts, and Tribes, he ought to takespecial notice of those bodies, and some times afford them a meeting,and give them some proof of his humanity, and magnificence; yet withallholding firme the majestie of his State; for this must never fail in anycase.CHAP.   XXIITouching Princes Secretaries.It is no small importance to a Prince, the choyce he makes, of servantsbeing ordinarily good or bad, as his wisdome is. And the firstconjecture one gives of a great man, and of his understanding, is, uponthe sight of his followers and servants he hath about him, when theyprove able and faithful, and then may he alwaies be reputed wise becausehe hath known how to discern those that are able, and to keep them trueto him. But when they are otherwise, there can be no good conjecturemade of him; for the first error he commits, is in this choyce. Therewas no man that had any knowledge of Antonio of Vanafro, the servant ofPandulfus Petrucci Prince of Sicily, who did not esteem Pandulfus for avery discreet man, having him for his servant. And because there arethree kinds of understandings; the one that is advised by it self; theother that understands when it is informed by another; the third thatneither is advised by it self nor by the demonstration of another; thefirst is best, the second is good, and the last quite unprofitable.Therefore it was of necessity, that if Pandulfus attaind not the firstdegree, yet he got to the second; for whenever any one hath thejudgement to discerne between the good and the evil, that he does andsayes, however that he hath not his distinction from himself, yet stillcomes he to take notice of the good or evil actions of that servant; andthose he cherishes, and these he suppresses; insomuch that the servantfinding no means to deceive his master, keeps himself upright andhonest. But how a Prince may throughly understand his servant, here isthe way that never fails. When thou seest the servant study more for hisown advantage than thine, and that in all his actions, he searches mostafter his own profit; this man thus qualified, shall never prove goodservant, nor canst thou ever relie upon him: for he that holds theSterne of the State in hand, ought never call home his cares to his ownparticular, but give himself wholly over to his Princes service, norever put him in minde of any thing not appertaining to him. And on theother side the Prince to keep him good to him, ought to take a care forhis servant, honoring him, enriching, and obliging him to him, givinghim part both of dignities and offices, to the end that the many honorsand much wealth bestowed on him, may restrain his desires from otherhonors, and other wealth, and that those many charges cause him to fearchanges that may fall, knowing he is not able to stand without hismaster. And when both the Princes and the servants are thus disposed,they may rely the one upon the other: when otherwise, the end will everprove hurtfull for the one as well as for the other.CHAP. XXIIIThat Flatterers are to be avoyded.I will not omit one principle of great inportance, being an errour fromwhich Princes with much difficulty defend themselves, unlesse they bevery discreet, and make a very good choice; and this is concerningflatterers; whereof all writings are full: and that because men pleasethemselves so much in their own things, and therein cozen themselves,that very hardly can they escape this pestilence; and desiring to escapeit, there is danger of falling into contempt; for there is no other wayto be secure from flattery, but to let men know, that they displeasethee not in telling thee truth: but when every one hath this leave, thoulosest thy reverence. Therefore ought a wise Prince take a third course,making choyce of some understanding men in his State, and give only tothem a free liberty of speaking to him the truth; and touching thosethings only which he inquires of, and nothing else; but he ought to beinquisitive of every thing, and hear their opinions, and then afterwardsadvise himself after his own manner; and in these deliberations, andwith every one of them so carrie himself, that they all know, that themore freely they shall speak, the better they shall be liked of: andbesides those, not give eare to any one; and thus pursue the thingresolved on, and thence continue obstinate in the resolution taken. Hewho does otherwise, either falls upon flatterers, or often changes uponthe varying of opinions, from whence proceeds it that men conceive butslightly of him. To this purpose I will alledge you a moderne example.Peter Lucas a servant of Maximilians the present Emperor, speaking ofhis Majesty, said that he never advised with any body, nor never did anything after his own way: which was because he took a contrary course towhat we have now said: for the Emperor is a close man, who communicateshis secrets to none, nor takes counsel of any one; but as they come tobe put in practise, they begin to be discovered and known, and socontradicted by those that are near about him; and he as being an easyman, is quickly wrought from them. Whence it comes that what he does today, he undoes on the morrow; and that he never understands himself whathe would, nor what he purposes, and that there is no grounding upon anyof his resolutions. A Prince therefore ought alwayes to take counsell,but at his owne pleasure, and not at other mens; or rather should takeaway any mans courage to advise him of any thing, but what he askes: buthe ought well to aske at large, and then touching the things inquird of,be a patient hearer of the truth; and perceiving that for some respectthe truth were conceald from him, be displeased thereat. And becausesome men have thought that a Prince that gaines the opinion to bee wise,may bee held so, not by his owne naturall indowments, but by the goodcounsells he hath about him; without question they are deceivd; for thisis a generall rule and never failes, that a Prince who of himselfe isnot wise, can never be well advised, unlesse he should light upon onealone, wholly to direct and govern him, who himself were a very wiseman. In this case it is possible he may be well governd: but this wouldlast but little: for that governor in a short time would deprive him ofhis State; but a Prince not having any parts of nature, being advised ofmore then one, shall never be able to unite these counsels: of himselfshall he never know how to unite them; and each one of the Counsellers,probably will follow that which is most properly his owne; and he shallnever find the meanes to amend or discerne these things; nor can theyfall out otherwise, because men alwayes prove mischievous, unlesse uponsome necessity they be forc'd to become good: we conclude therefore,that counsells from whencesoever they proceed, must needs take theirbeginning from the Princes wisdome, and not the wisdome of the Princefrom good counsells.    In this Chapter our Authour prescribes some rules how to avoyd    flattery, and not to fall into contempt. The extent of these two    extreames is so large on both sides, that there is left but a    very narrow path for the right temper to walke between them    both: and happy were that Prince, who could light on so good a    Pilote as to bring him to Port between those rocks and those    quicksands. Where Majesty becomes familiar, unlesse endued with    a super-eminent vertue, it loses all awfull regards: as the    light of the Sunne, because so ordinary, because so common, we    should little value, were it not that all Creatures feele    themselves quickned by the rayes thereof. On the other side,    _Omnis insipiens arrogantia et plausibus capitur_, Every foole    is taken with his owne pride and others flatteryes: and this    foole keeps company so much with all great wise men, that hardly    with a candle and lantern can they be discernd betwixt. The    greatest men are more subject to grosse and palpable flatteries;    and especially the greatest of men, who are Kings and Princes:    for many seek the Rulers favour. _Prov._ 28. 26. For there are    divers meanes whereby private men are instructed; Princes have    not that good hap: but they whose instruction is of most    importance, so soone as they have taken the government upon    them, no longer suffer any reproovers: for but few have accesse    unto them, and they who familiary converse with them, doe and    say all for favour. Isocrat, to Nicocles, All are afraid to give    him occasion of displeasure, though by telling him truth. To    this purpose therefore sayes one; a Prince excells in learning    to ride the great horse, rather than in any other exercise,    because his horse being no flatterer, will shew him he makes no    difference between him and another man, and unlesse he keepe his    seate well, will lay him on the ground. This is plaine dealing.    Men are more subtile, more double-hearted, they have a heart and    a heart neither is their tongue their hearts true interpreter.    Counsell in the heart of man is like deepe waters; but a man of    understanding will draw it out. _Prov._ 20. 5. This    understanding is most requisite in a Prince, inasmuch as the    whole Globe is in his hand, and the inferiour Orbes are swayed    by the motion of the highest. And therefore surely it is the    honour of a King to search out such a secret: _Prov._ 25. 2. His    counsellours are his eyes and eares; as they ought to be dear to    him, so they ought to be true to him, and make him the true    report of things without disguise. If they prove false eyes, let    him pluck them out; he may as they use glasse eyes, take them    forth without paine, and see never a whit the worse for it. The    wisdome of a Princes Counsellours is a great argument of the    Princes wisdome. And being the choyce of them imports the    Princes credit and safety, our Authour will make him amends for    his other errours by his good advice in his 22 Chap. whether I    referre him.CHAP. XXIVWherefore the Princes of Italy have lost their States.When these things above said are well observ'd, they make a new Princeseeme as if he had been of old, and presently render him more secure andfirme in the State, than if he had already grown ancient therein: for anew Prince is much more observd in his action, than a Prince byinheritance; and when they are known to bee vertuous, men are much moregaind and oblig'd to them thereby, than by the antiquity of their blood:for men are much more taken by things present, than by things past, andwhen in the present they find good, they content themselves therein, andseeke no further; or rather they undertake the defence of him to theirutmost, when the Prince is not wanting in other matters to himself; andso shall he gaine double glory to have given a beginning to a newPrincipality, adornd, and strengthnd it with good lawes, good arms, goodfriends, and good examples; as he shall have double shame, that is borna Prince, and by reason of his small discretion hath lost it. And if weshall consider those Lords, that in Italy have lost their States in ourdayes, as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and others; first weshall find in them a common defect, touching their armes, for thereasons which have been above discoursd at length. Afterwards we shallsee some of them, that either shall have had the people for theirenemies; or be it they had the people to friend, could never know how toassure themselves of the great ones: for without such defects as these,States are not lost, which have so many nerves, that they are able tomaintaine an army in the feld. Philip of Macedon, not the father ofAlexander the Great, but he that was vanquished by Titus Quintius, hadnot much State in regard of the greatnesse of the Romanes and of Greecethat assail'd him; neverthelesse in that he was a warlike man and knewhow to entertaine the people, and assure himself of the Nobles, for manyyeares he made the warre good against them: and though at last some townperhaps were taken from him, yet the Kingdome remaind in his handsstill. Wherefore these our Princes who for many yeares had continued intheir Principalities, for having afterwards lost them, let them notblame Fortune, but their own sloth; because they never having thoughtduring the time of quiet, that they could suffer a change (which is thecommon fault of men, while faire weather lasts, not to provide for thetempest) when afterwards mischiefes came upon them, thought rather uponflying from them, than upon their defence, and hop'd that the people,weary of the vanquishers insolence, would recall them: which course whenthe others faile, is good: but very ill is it to leave the otherremedies for that: for a man wou'd never go to fall, beleeving anotherwould come to take him up: which may either not come to passe, or if itdoes, it is not for thy security, because that defence of his is vile,and depends not upon thee; but those defences only are good, certaine,and durable, which depend upon thy owne selfe, and thy owne vertues.CHAP. XXVHow great power Fortune hath in humane affaires, and what meanes thereis to resist it.It is not unknown unto me, how that many have held opinion, and stillhold it, that the affaires of the world are so governd by fortune, andby God, that men by their wisdome cannot amend or alter them; or ratherthat there is no remedy for them: and hereupon they would think that itwere of no availe to take much paines in any thing, but leave all to begovernd by chance. This opinion hath gain'd the more credit in ourdayes, by reason of the great alteration of things, which we have oflate seen, and do every day see, beyond all humane conjecture: uponwhich, I sometimes thinking, am in some parte inclind to their opinion:neverthelesse not to extinguish quite our owne free will, I think it maybe true, that Fortune is the mistrisse of one halfe of our actions; butyet that she lets us have rule of the other half, or little lesse. And Iliken her to a precipitous torrent, which when it rages, over-flows theplaines, overthrowes the trees, and buildings, removes the earth fromone side, and laies it on another, every one flyes before it, every oneyeelds to the fury thereof, as unable to withstand it; and yet howeverit be thus, when the times are calmer, men are able to make provisionagainst these excesses, with banks and fences so, that afterwards whenit swels again, it shall all passe smoothly along, within its channell,or else the violence thereof shall not prove so licentious and hurtfull.In like manner befals it us with fortune, which there shewes her powerwhere vertue is not ordeind to resist her, and thither turnes she allher forces, where she perceives that no provisions nor resistances aremade to uphold her. And if you shall consider Italy, which is the seatof these changes, and that which hath given them their motions, youshall see it to be a plaine field, without any trench or bank; which hadit been fenc'd with convenient vertue as was Germany, Spain or France;this inundation would never have causd these great alterations it hath,or else would it not have reach'd to us: and this shall suffice to havesaid, touching the opposing of fortune in generall. But restraining myselfe more to particulars, I say that to day we see a Prince prosper andflourish and to morrow utterly go to ruine; not seeing that he hathalterd any condition or quality; which I beleeve arises first from thecauses which we have long since run over, that is because that Princethat relies wholly upon fortune, runnes as her wheele turnes. I beleevealso, that he proves the fortunate man, whose manner of proceeding meetswith the quality of the time; and so likewise he unfortunate from whosecourse of proceeding the times differ: for we see that men, in thethings that induce them to the end, (which every one propounds tohimselfe, as glory and riches) proceed therein diversly; some withrespects, others more bold, and rashly; one with violence, and th'otherwith cunning; the one with patience, th'other with its contrary; andevery one of severall wayes may attaine thereto; we see also two veryrespective and wary men, the one come to his purpose, and th'other not;and in like maner two equally prosper, taking divers course; the onebeing wary the other head-strong; which proceeds from nothing else, butfrom the quality of the times, which agree, or not, with theirproceedings. From hence arises that which I said, that two workingdiversly, produce the same effect: and two equaly working, the oneattains his end, the other not. Hereupon depends the alteration of thegood; for if to one that behaves himself with warinesse and patience,times and affaires turne so favourably, that the carriage of hisbusinesse prove well, he prospers; but if the times and affaires chance,he is ruind, because he changes not his manner of proceeding: nor isthere any man so wise, that can frame himselfe hereunto; as well becausehe cannot go out of the way, from that whereunto Nature inclines him: asalso, for that one having alwayes prosperd, walking such a way, cannotbe perswaded to leave it; and therefore the respective and wary man,when it is fit time for him to use violence and force, knows not how toput it in practice, whereupon he is ruind: but if he could change hisdisposition with the times and the affaires, he should not change hisfortune. Pope Julius the second proceeded in all his actions with verygreat violence, and found the times and things so conformable to thathis manner of proceeding that in all of them he had happy successe.Consider the first exploit he did at Bolonia, even while John Bentivoliolived: the Venetians were not well contented therewith; the King ofSpaine likewise with the French, had treated of that enterprise; andnotwithstanding al this, he stirrd up by his own rage and fiercenesse,personally undertook that expedition: which action of his put insuspence and stopt Spaine and the Venetians; those for feare, and theothers for desire to recover the Kingdome of Naples; and on the otherpart drew after him the King of France; for that King seeing him alreadyin motion, and desiring to hold him his friend, whereby to humble theVenetians, thought he could no way deny him his souldiers, without doinghim an open injury. Julius then effected that with his violent and headymotion, which no other Pope with all humane wisdome could ever havedone; for if he had expected to part from Rome with his conclusionssettled, and all his affaires ordered before hand, as any other Popewould have done, he had never brought it to passe: For the King ofFrance would have devised a thousand excuses, and others would have puthim in as many feares. I will let passe his other actions, for all ofthem were alike, and all of them prov'd lucky to him; and the brevity ofhis life never sufferd him to feele the contrary: for had he litt uponsuch times afterwards, that it had been necessary for him to proceedwith respects, there had been his utter ruine; for he would never haveleft those wayes, to which he had been naturally inclind. I concludethen, fortune varying, and men continuing still obstinate to their ownwayes, prove happy, while these accord together: and as they disagree,prove unhappy: and I think it true, that it is better to be heady thanwary; because Fortune is a mistresse; and it is necessary, to keep herin obedience to ruffle and force her: and we see, that she suffers herself rather to be masterd by those, than by others that proceed coldly.And therefore, as a mistresse, shee is a friend to young men, becausethey are lesse respective, more rough, and command her with moreboldnesse.    I have considered the 25 Chapter, as representing me a full view    of humane policy and cunning: yet me thinks it cannot satisfie a    Christian in the causes of the good and bad successe of things.    The life of man is like a game at Tables; skill availes much I    grant, but that's not all: play thy game well, but that will not    winne: the chance thou throwest must accord with thy play.    Examine this; play never so surely, play never so probably,    unlesse the chance thou castest, lead thee forward to advantage,    all hazards are losses, and thy sure play leaves thee in the    lurch. The sum of this is set down in Ecclesiastes chap. 9. v.    11. The race is not to the swift, nor the battell to the strong:    neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of    understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and    chance hapeneth to them all. Our cunning Author for all his    exact rules he delivere in his books, could not fence against    the despight of Fortune, as he complaines in his Epistle to this    booke. Nor that great example of policy, Duke Valentine, whome    our Author commends to Princes for his crafts-master, could so    ruffle or force his mistresse Fortune, that he could keep her in    obedience. Man can contribute no more to his actions than vertue    and wisdome: but the successe depends upon a power above. Surely    there is the finger of god; or as Prov. 16. v. 33. 'The lot is    cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the    Lord.' It was not Josephs wisdome made all things thrive under    his hand; but because the Lord was with him; and that which he    did, the Lord made it to prosper, Gen. 39. Surely this is a    blessing proceeding from the divine providence, which beyond    humane capacity so cooperateth with the causes, as that their    effects prove answerable, and sometimes (that we may know there    is something above the ordinary causes) the success returns with    such a supereminency of worth, that it far exceeds the vertue of    the ordinary causes.CHAP. XXVIAn Exhortation to free Italy from the Barbarians.Having then weighed all things above discours'd, and devising with myself, whether at this present in Italy the time might serve to honor anew Prince, and whether there were matter that might minister occasionto a wise and valorous Prince, to introduce such a forme, that might dohonor to him, and good to the whole generality of the people in thecountrey: me thinks so many things concurre in favor of a new Prince,that I know not whether there were ever any time more proper for thispurpose. And if as I said, it was necessary, desiring to see Moses hisvertue, that the children of Israel should be inthrald in AEgypt; and tohave experience of the magnanimity of Cyrus his mind, that the Persiansshould be oppress'd by the Medes; and to set forth the excellency ofTheseus, that the Athenians should be dispersed; so at this present nowwe are desirous to know the valor of an Italian spirit, it werenecessary Italy should be reduc'd to the same termes it is now in, andwere in more slavery than the Hebrews were; more subject than thePersians, more scatterd than the Athenians; without head, without order,battered, pillaged, rent asunder, overrun, and had undergone all kind ofdestruction. And however even in these later dayes, we have had somekind of shew of hope in some one, whereby we might have conjectur'd,that he had been ordained for the deliverance hereof, yet it prov'dafterwards, that in the very height of all his actions he was curb'd byfortune, insomuch that this poore countrey remaining as it were withoutlife, attends still for him that shall heal her wounds, give an end toall those pillagings and sackings of Lombardy, to those robberies andtaxations of the Kingdome, and of Tuscany, and heal them of their soars,now this long time gangren'd. We see how she makes her prayers to God,that he send some one to redeem her from these Barbarous cruelties andinsolencies. We see her also wholly ready and disposed to follow anycolours, provided there be any one take them up. Nor do we see at thispresent, that she can look for other, than your Illustrious Family, tobecome Cheiftain of this deliverance, which hath now by its own vertueand Fortune been so much exalted, and favored by God and the Church,whereof it now holds the Principality: and this shall not be very hardfor you to do, if you shall call to mind the former actions, and livesof those that are above named. And though those men were very rare andadmirable, yet were they men, and every one of them began upon lessoccasion than this; for neither was their enterprize more just thanthis, nor more easie; nor was God more their friend, than yours. Here isvery great justice: for that war is just, that is necessary; and thosearmes are religious, when there is no hope left otherwhere, but in them.Here is an exceeding good disposition thereto: nor can there be, wherethere is a good disposition, a giant difficulty, provided that use bemade of those orders, which I propounded for aim and direction to you.Besides this, here we see extraordinary things without example effectedby God; the sea was opened, a cloud guided the way, devotion pouredforth the waters, and it rain'd down Manna; all these things haveconcurred in your greatness, the rest is left for you to do. God willnot do every thing himself, that he may not take from us our free will,and of that glory that belongs to us. Neither is it a marvel, if any ofthe aforenamed Italians have not been able to compass that, which we mayhope your illustrious family shall: though in so many revolutions ofItaly, and so many feats of war, it may seem that the whole militaryvertue therein be quite extinguisht; for this arises from that theancient orders thereof were not good; and there hath since been nonethat hath known how to invent new ones. Nothing can so much honor a manrising anew, as new laws and new ordinances devised by him: these thingswhen they have a good foundation given them, and contain in them theirdue greatness, gain him reverence and admiration; and in Italy theirwants not the matter wherein to introduce any forme. Here is greatvertue in the members, were it not wanting in the heads. Consider in thesingle fights that have been, and duels, how much the Italians haveexcel'd in their strength, activity and address; but when they come toarmies, they appear not, and all proceeds from the weakness of theChieftaines; for they that understand the managing of these matters, arenot obeyed; and every one presumes to understand; hitherto there havingnot been any one so highly raised either by fortune or vertue, as thatothers would submit unto him. From hence proceeds it, that in so longtime, and in so many battels fought for these last past 20 years, whenthere hath been an army wholly Italian, it alwaies hath had evilsuccess; whereof the river Tarus first was witness, afterwardsAlexandria, Capua, Genua, Vayla, Bolonia, Mestri. Your Illustriousfamily then being desirous to tread the footsteps of these Worthyes whoredeem'd their countreys, must above all things as the very foundationof the whole fabrick, be furnished with soldiers of your own natives:because you cannot have more faithful, true, nor better soldiers; andthough every one of them be good, all together they will become betterwhen they shall find themselves entertained, commanded, and honored bytheir own Prince. Wherefore it is necessary to provide for those armes,whereby to be able with the Italian valor to make a defence againstforreiners. And however the Swisse infantry and Spanish be accountedterrible; yet is there defect in both of them, by which a third ordermight not only oppose them, but may be confident to vanquish them: forthe Spaniards are not able to indure the Horse, and the Swisse are tofeare the foot, when they incounter with them, as resolute in the fightas they; whereupon it hath been seen, and upon experience shall becertain, that the Spaniards are not able to beare up against the FrenchCavalery, and the Swisses have been routed by the Spanish Foot. Andthough touching this last, there hath not been any entire experiencehad, yet was there some proof thereof given in the battel of Ravenna,when the Spanish Foot affronted the Dutch battalions, which keep thesame rank the Swisses do, where the Spaniards with their nimbleness ofbody, and the help of their targets entred in under their Pikes, andthere stood safe to offend them, the Dutch men having no remedy: and hadit not been for the Cavalery that rusht in upon them, they had quitedefeated them. There may then (the defect of the one and other of thesetwo infantries being discoverd) another kind of them be anew ordained,which may be able to make resistance against the Horse, and not fear theFoot, which shall not be a new sort of armes, but change of orders. Andthese are some of those things which ordained a new, gain reputation andgreatness to a new Prince. Therefore this occasion should not be letpass, to the end that Italy after so long a time may see some oneredeemer of hers appear. Nor can I express with what dearness ofaffection he would be received in all those countreys which havesuffered by those forrein scums, with what thirst of revenge, with whatresolution of fidelity, with what piety, with what tears. Would anygates be shut again him? Any people deny him obedience? Any envy opposehim? Would not every Italian fully consent with him? This government ofthe Barbarians stinks in every ones nostrils. Let your IllustriousFamily then undertake this worthy exployt with that courage and thosehopes wherewith such just actions are to be attempted; to the end thatunder your colours, this countrey may be enabled, and under theprotection of your fortune that saying of Petrarch be verifyed.  _Virtu contr' al fuore  Prendera l'arme, e fia il combatter corto:  Che l'antico valore  Ne gli Italici cor non e morto._  Vertue against fury shall advance the fight,  And it i' th' combate soon shall put to flight:  For th' old Roman valor is not dead,  Nor in th' Italians brests extinguished.FINIS***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MACHIAVELLI, VOLUME I********** This file should be named 15772.txt or 15772.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/5/7/7/15772Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

For in those long-moon countrieslife is open and accessible, and romances seem to be furnished realand gratis, in order to save, in a languor-breeding climate, theennui of reading and writing books. Each woman has a different way ofpicking up and relating her stories, as each one selects differentpieces, and has a personal way of playing them on the piano.Each story _is_ different, or appears so to her; each has some uniqueand peculiar pathos in it. And so she dramatizes and inflects it,trying to make the point visible to her apparent also to her hearers.Sometimes the pathos and interest to the hearers lie only inthis--that the relater has observed it, and gathered it, and finds itworth telling. For do we not gather what we have not, and is not ourown lacking our one motive? It may be so, for it often appears so.And if a child inside be wakeful and precocious it is not dreamsalone that take on reflections from the balcony outside: through thehalf-open shutters the still, quiet eyes look across the dim formson the balcony to the star-spangled or the moon-brightened heavensbeyond; while memory makes stores for the future, and germs are sown,out of which the slow, clambering vine of thought issues, one day, todecorate or hide, as it may be, the structures or ruins of life.A DRAMA OF THREEIt was a regular dramatic performance every first of the month in thelittle cottage of the old General and Madame B----.It began with the waking up of the General by his wife, standing atthe bedside with a cup of black coffee."He! Ah! Oh, Honorine! Yes; the first of the month, andaffairs--affairs to be transacted."On those mornings when affairs were to be transacted there was notmuch leisure for the household; and it was Honorine who constitutedthe household. Not the old dressing-gown and slippers, the old, oldtrousers, and the antediluvian neck-foulard of other days! Far fromit. It was a case of warm water (with even a fling of cologne in it),of the trimming of beard and mustache by Honorine, and the blackbroadcloth suit, and the brown satin stock, and that _je ne sais quoide degage_ which no one could possess or assume like the old General.Whether he possessed or assumed it is an uncertainty which hung overthe fine manners of all the gentlemen of his day, who were keptthrough their youth in Paris to cultivate _bon ton_ and an education.It was also something of a gala-day for Madame la Generale too, as itmust be a gala-day for all old wives to see their husbands prankedin the manners and graces that had conquered their maidenhood, andexhaling once more that ambrosial fragrance which once so wellincensed their compelling presence.Ah, to the end a woman loves to celebrate her conquest! It is the lasttouch of misfortune with her to lose in the old, the ugly, and thecommonplace her youthful lord and master. If one could look under thegray hairs and wrinkles with which time thatches old women, one wouldbe surprised to see the flutterings, the quiverings, the thrills, theemotions, the coals of the heart-fires which death alone extinguishes,when he commands the tenant to vacate.Honorine's hands chilled with the ice of sixteen as she approachedscissors to the white mustache and beard. When her finger-tips brushedthose lips, still well formed and roseate, she felt it, strange tosay, on her lips. When she asperged the warm water with cologne,--itwas her secret delight and greatest effort of economy to buy thiscologne,--she always had one little moment of what she calledfaintness--that faintness which had veiled her eyes, and chained herhands, and stilled her throbbing bosom, when as a bride she came fromthe church with him. It was then she noticed the faint fragrance ofthe cologne bath. Her lips would open as they did then, and she wouldstand for a moment and think thoughts to which, it must be confessed,she looked forward from month to month. What a man he had been! Intruth he belonged to a period that would accept nothing less fromNature than physical beauty; and Nature is ever subservient to theperiod. If it is to-day all small men, and to-morrow gnomes anddwarfs, we may know that the period is demanding them from Nature.When the General had completed--let it be called no less than theceremony of--his toilet, he took his chocolate and his _pain deParis_. Honorine could not imagine him breakfasting on anything but_pain de Paris._ Then he sat himself in his large arm-chair before hisescritoire, and began transacting his affairs with the usual--"But where is that idiot, that dolt, that sluggard, that snail, withmy mail?" Honorine, busy in the breakfast-room:[Illustration: "WHERE IS THAT IDIOT, THAT DOLT, THAT SLUGGARD, THATSNAIL, WITH MY MAIL?"]"In a moment, husband. In a moment.""But he should be here now. It is the first of the month, it is nineo'clock, I am ready; he should be here.""It is not yet nine o'clock, husband.""Not yet nine! Not yet nine! Am I not up? Am I not dressed? Have I notbreakfasted before nine?""That is so, husband. That is so." Honorine's voice, prompt incheerful acquiescence, came from the next room, where she was washinghis cup, saucer, and spoon."It is getting worse and worse every day. I tell you, Honorine, Pompeymust be discharged. He is worthless. He is trifling. Discharge him!Discharge him! Do not have him about! Chase him out of the yard! Chasehim as soon as he makes his appearance! Do you hear, Honorine?""You must have a little patience, husband."It was perhaps the only reproach one could make to Madame Honorine,that she never learned by experience."Patience! Patience! Patience is the invention of dullards andsluggards. In a well-regulated world there should be no need of such athing as patience. Patience should be punished as a crime, or atleast as a breach of the peace. Wherever patience is found policeinvestigation should be made as for smallpox. Patience! Patience! Inever heard the word--I assure you, I never heard the word in Paris.What do you think would be said there to the messenger who cravedpatience of you? Oh, they know too well in Paris--a rataplan from thewalking-stick on his back, that would be the answer; and a, 'My goodfellow, we are not hiring professors of patience, but legs.'""But, husband, you must remember we do not hire Pompey. He only doesit to oblige us, out of his kindness.""Oblige us! Oblige me! Kindness! A negro oblige me! Kind to me! Thatis it; that is it. That is the way to talk under the new regime. It isfavor, and oblige, and education, and monsieur, and madame, now. Whatchild's play to call this a country--a government! I would not besurprised"--jumping to his next position on this ever-recurring firstof the month theme--"I would not be surprised if Pompey has failed tofind the letter in the box. How do I know that the mail has notbeen tampered with? From day to day I expect to hear it. What is toprevent? Who is to interpose? The honesty of the officials? Honesty ofthe officials--that is good! What a farce--honesty of officials! Thatis evidently what has happened. The thought has not occurred to me invain. Pompey has gone. He has not found the letter, and--well; that isthe end."But the General had still another theory to account for the delay inthe appearance of his mail which he always posed abruptly after theexhaustion of the arraignment of the post-office."And why not Journel?" Journel was their landlord, a fellow of means,but no extraction, and a favorite aversion of the old gentleman's."Journel himself? You think he is above it, _he_? You think Journelwould not do such a thing? Ha! your simplicity, Honorine--yoursimplicity is incredible. It is miraculous. I tell you, I have knownthe Journels, from father to son, for--yes, for seventy-five years.Was not his grandfather the overseer on my father's plantation? I wasnot five years old when I began to know the Journels. And this fellow,I know him better than he knows himself. I know him as well as Godknows him. I have made up my mind. I have made it up carefully thatthe first time that letter fails on the first of the month Ishall have Journel arrested as a thief. I shall land him in thepenitentiary. What! You think I shall submit to have my mail tamperedwith by a Journel? Their contents appropriated? What! You think therewas no coincidence in Journel's offering me his post-office box justthe month--just the month, before those letters began to arrive? Youthink he did not have some inkling of them? Mark my words, Honorine,he did--by some of his subterranean methods. And all these five yearshe has been arranging his plans--that is all. He was arranging theft,which no doubt has been consummated to-day. Oh, I have regretted it--Iassure you I have regretted it, that I did not promptly reject hisproposition, that, in fact, I ever had anything to do with thefellow."It was almost invariably, so regularly do events run in thisworld,--it was almost invariably that the negro messenger made hisappearance at this point. For five years the General had perhapsnot been interrupted as many times, either above or below the lastsentence. The mail, or rather the letter, was opened, and the usualamount--three ten-dollar bills--was carefully extracted and counted.And as if he scented the bills, even as the General said he did,within ten minutes after their delivery, Journel made his appearanceto collect the rent.It could only have been in Paris, among that old retired nobility, whocounted their names back, as they expressed it, "au de ca du deluge,"that could have been acquired the proper manner of treating a"roturier" landlord: to measure him with the eyes from head to foot;to hand the rent--the ten-dollar bill--with the tips of the fingers;to scorn a look at the humbly tendered receipt; to say: "The cisternneeds repairing, the roof leaks; I must warn you that unless suchnotifications meet with more prompt attention than in the past,you must look for another tenant," etc., in the monotonous tone ofsupremacy, and in the French, not of Journel's dictionary, nor ofthe dictionary of any such as he, but in the French of Racine andCorneille; in the French of the above suggested circle, which inclosedthe General's memory, if it had not inclosed--as he never tired ofrecounting--his star-like personality.A sheet of paper always infolded the bank-notes. It always bore, infine but sexless tracery, "From one who owes you much."There, that was it, that sentence, which, like a locomotive, bore theGeneral and his wife far on these firsts of the month to two oppositepoints of the horizon, in fact, one from the other--"From one who owesyou much."The old gentleman would toss the paper aside with the bill receipt.In the man to whom the bright New Orleans itself almost owed itsbrightness, it was a paltry act to search and pick for a debtor.Friends had betrayed and deserted him; relatives had forgotten him;merchants had failed with his money; bank presidents had stooped todeceive him; for he was an old man, and had about run the gamut ofhuman disappointments--a gamut that had begun with a C major of trust,hope, happiness, and money.His political party had thrown him aside. Neither for ambassador,plenipotentiary, senator, congressman, not even for a clerkship, couldhe be nominated by it. Certes! "From one who owed him much." He hadfitted the cap to a new head, the first of every month, for fiveyears, and still the list was not exhausted. Indeed, it would havebeen hard for the General to look anywhere and not see some one whoseobligations to him far exceeded this thirty dollars a month. Could heavoid being happy with such eyes?But poor Madame Honorine! She who always gathered up the receipts, andthe "From one who owes you much"; who could at an instant's warningproduce the particular ones for any month of the past half-decade.She kept them filed, not only in her armoire, but the scrawledpapers--skewered, as it were, somewhere else--where women from timeimmemorial have skewered such unsigned papers. She was not original inher thoughts--no more, for the matter of that, than the General was.Tapped at any time on the first of the month, when she would pausein her drudgery to reimpale her heart by a sight of the writtencharacters on the scrap of paper, her thoughts would have been foundflowing thus, "One can give everything, and yet be sure of nothing."When Madame Honorine said "everything," she did not, as women in suchcases often do, exaggerate. When she married the General, she inreality gave the youth of sixteen, the beauty (ah, do not trust thedenial of those wrinkles, the thin hair, the faded eyes!) of an angel,the dot of an heiress. Alas! It was too little at the time. Had she inher own person united all the youth, all the beauty, all the wealth,sprinkled parsimoniously so far and wide over all the women in thisland, would she at that time have done aught else with this thanimmolate it on the burning pyre of the General's affection? "And yetbe sure of nothing."It is not necessary, perhaps, to explain that last clause. It is verylittle consolation for wives that their husbands have forgotten, whensome one else remembers. Some one else! Ah! there could be so manysome one Else's in the General's life, for in truth he had beenirresistible to excess. But this was one particular some one else whohad been faithful for five years. Which one?When Madame Honorine solves that enigma she has made up her mind howto act.As for Journel, it amused him more and more. He would go away from thelittle cottage rubbing his hands with pleasure (he never saw MadameHonorine, by the way, only the General). He would have given far morethan thirty dollars a month for this drama; for he was not only rich,but a great _farceur_.LA GRANDE DEMOISELLEThat was what she was called by everybody as soon as she was seen ordescribed. Her name, besides baptismal titles, was Idalie Sainte FoyMortemart des Islets. When she came into society, in the brilliantlittle world of New Orleans, it was the event of the season, and aftershe came in, whatever she did became also events. Whether she went, ordid not go; what she said, or did not say; what she wore, and did notwear--all these became important matters of discussion, quoted as muchor more than what the president said, or the governor thought. Andin those days, the days of '59, New Orleans was not, as it is now, aone-heiress place, but it may be said that one could find heiressesthen as one finds type-writing girls now.Mademoiselle Idalie received her birth, and what education she had, onher parents' plantation, the famed old Reine Sainte Foy place, andit is no secret that, like the ancient kings of France, her birthexceeded her education.It was a plantation, the Reine Sainte Foy, the richness and luxury ofwhich are really well described in those fervid pictures of tropicallife, at one time the passion of philanthropic imaginations, excitedand exciting over the horrors of slavery. Although these pictures werethen often accused of being purposely exaggerated, they seem now tofall short of, instead of surpassing, the truth. Stately walls, acresof roses, miles of oranges, unmeasured fields of cane, colossalsugar-house--they were all there, and all the rest of it, with theslaves, slaves, slaves everywhere, whole villages of negro cabins. Andthere were also, most noticeable to the natural, as well as tothe visionary, eye--there were the ease, idleness, extravagance,self-indulgence, pomp, pride, arrogance, in short the wholeenumeration, the moral _sine qua non_, as some people considered it,of the wealthy slaveholder of aristocratic descent and tastes.What Mademoiselle Idalie cared to learn she studied, what she did notshe ignored; and she followed the same simple rule untrammeled in hereating, drinking, dressing, and comportment generally; and whateverdiscipline may have been exercised on the place, either in fact orfiction, most assuredly none of it, even so much as in a threat,ever attended her sacred person. When she was just turned sixteen,Mademoiselle Idalie made up her mind to go into society. Whether shewas beautiful or not, it is hard to say. It is almost impossibleto appreciate properly the beauty of the rich, the very rich. Theunfettered development, the limitless choice of accessories, theconfidence, the self-esteem, the sureness of expression, thesimplicity of purpose, the ease of execution--all these produce acertain effect of beauty behind which one really cannot get to measurelength of nose, or brilliancy of eye. This much can be said: there wasnothing in her that positively contradicted any assumption of beautyon her part, or credit of it on the part of others. She was very talland very thin with small head, long neck, black eyes, and abundantstraight black hair,--for which her hair-dresser deserved more praisethan she,--good teeth, of course, and a mouth that, even in prayer,talked nothing but commands; that is about all she had _en faitd'ornements_, as the modesties say. It may be added that she walked asif the Reine Sainte Foy plantation extended over the whole earth, andthe soil of it were too vile for her tread. Of course she did not buyher toilets in New Orleans. Everything was ordered from Paris, andcame as regularly through the custom-house as the modes and robes tothe milliners. She was furnished by a certain house there, just as oneof a royal family would be at the present day. As this had lasted fromher layette up to her sixteenth year, it may be imagined what tookplace when she determined to make her debut. Then it was literally,not metaphorically, _carte blanche_, at least so it got to the ears ofsociety. She took a sheet of note-paper, wrote the date at the top,added, "I make my debut in November," signed her name at the extremeend of the sheet, addressed it to her dressmaker in Paris, and sentit.It was said that in her dresses the very handsomest silks wereused for linings, and that real lace was used where others putimitation,--around the bottoms of the skirts, for instance,--and silkribbons of the best quality served the purposes of ordinary tapes; andsometimes the buttons were of real gold and silver, sometimes setwith precious stones. Not that she ordered these particulars, but thedressmakers, when given _carte blanche_ by those who do not condescendto details, so soon exhaust the outside limits of garments thatperforce they take to plastering them inside with gold, so to speak,and, when the bill goes in, they depend upon the furnishings to carryout a certain amount of the contract in justifying the price. And itwas said that these costly dresses, after being worn once or twice,were cast aside, thrown upon the floor, given to the negroes--anythingto get them out of sight. Not an inch of the real lace, not one of thejeweled buttons, not a scrap of ribbon, was ripped off to save. And itwas said that if she wanted to romp with her dogs in all her finery,she did it; she was known to have ridden horseback, one moonlightnight, all around the plantation in a white silk dinner-dress flouncedwith Alencon. And at night, when she came from the balls, tired, tiredto death as only balls can render one, she would throw herself downupon her bed in her tulle skirts,--on top, or not, of the exquisiteflowers, she did not care,--and make her maid undress her in thatposition; often having her bodices cut off her, because she was tootired to turn over and have them unlaced.That she was admired, raved about, loved even, goes without saying.After the first month she held the refusal of half the beaux of NewOrleans. Men did absurd, undignified, preposterous things for her; andshe? Love? Marry? The idea never occurred to her. She treated themost exquisite of her pretenders no better than she treated her Parisgowns, for the matter of that. She could not even bring herself tolisten to a proposal patiently; whistling to her dogs, in the middleof the most ardent protestations, or jumping up and walking away witha shrug of the shoulders, and a "Bah!"[Illustration: "WALKING AWAY WITH A SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS."]Well! Every one knows what happened after '59. There is no need torepeat. The history of one is the history of all. But there was thisdifference--for there is every shade of difference in misfortune, asthere is every shade of resemblance in happiness. Mortemart des Isletswent off to fight. That was natural; his family had been doing that,he thought, or said, ever since Charlemagne. Just as naturally he waskilled in the first engagement. They, his family, were alwaysamong the first killed; so much so that it began to be consideredassassination to fight a duel with any of them. All that was in theordinary course of events. One difference in their misfortunes layin that after the city was captured, their plantation, so near,convenient, and rich in all kinds of provisions, was selected toreceive a contingent of troops--a colored company. If it had been acolored company raised in Louisiana it might have been different; andthese negroes mixed with the negroes in the neighborhood,--and negroesare no better than whites, for the proportion of good and bad amongthem,--and the officers were always off duty when they should havebeen on, and on when they should have been off.One night the dwelling caught fire. There was an immediate rush tosave the ladies. Oh, there was no hesitation about that! They wereseized in their beds, and carried out in the very arms of theirenemies; carried away off to the sugar-house, and deposited there. Nodanger of their doing anything but keep very quiet and still in their_chemises de nuit_, and their one sheet apiece, which was about allthat was saved from the conflagration--that is, for them. But it mustbe remembered that this is all hearsay. When one has not been present,one knows nothing of one's own knowledge; one can only repeat. It hasbeen repeated, however, that although the house was burned tothe ground, and everything in it destroyed, wherever, for a yearafterward, a man of that company or of that neighborhood was found,there could have been found also, without search-warrant, propertythat had belonged to the Des Islets. That is the story; and it isbelieved or not, exactly according to prejudice.How the ladies ever got out of the sugar-house, history does notrelate; nor what they did. It was not a time for sociability, eitherpersonal or epistolary. At one offensive word your letter, and you,very likely, examined; and Ship Island for a hotel, with soldiers forhostesses! Madame Des Islets died very soon after the accident--ofrage, they say; and that was about all the public knew.Indeed, at that time the society of New Orleans had other thingsto think about than the fate of the Des Islets. As for _la grandedemoiselle_, she had prepared for her own oblivion in the hearts ofher female friends. And the gentlemen,--her _preux chevaliers_,--theywere burning with other passions than those which had driven them toher knees, encountering a little more serious response than "bahs" andshrugs. And, after all, a woman seems the quickest thing forgottenwhen once the important affairs of life come to men for consideration.It might have been ten years according to some calculations, or teneternities,--the heart and the almanac never agree about time,--butone morning old Champigny (they used to call him Champignon) waswalking along his levee front, calculating how soon the water wouldcome over, and drown him out, as the Louisianians say. It was before aseven-o'clock breakfast, cold, wet, rainy, and discouraging. The roadwas knee-deep in mud, and so broken up with hauling, that it was likewalking upon waves to get over it. A shower poured down. Old Champignywas hurrying in when he saw a figure approaching. He had to stop tolook at it, for it was worth while. The head was hidden by a greenbarege veil, which the showers had plentifully besprinkled with dew; atall, thin figure. Figure! No; not even could it be called a figure:straight up and down, like a finger or a post; high-shouldered, anda step--a step like a plow-man's. No umbrella; no--nothing more, infact. It does not sound so peculiar as when first related--somethingmust be forgotten. The feet--oh, yes, the feet--they were likewaffle-irons, or frying-pans, or anything of that shape.Old Champigny did not care for women--he never had; they simply didnot exist for him in the order of nature. He had been married once,it is true, about a half century before; but that was not reckonedagainst the existence of his prejudice, because he was _celibataire_to his finger-tips, as any one could see a mile away. But that woman_intrigue'd_ him.He had no servant to inquire from. He performed all of his owndomestic work in the wretched little cabin that replaced his old home.For Champigny also belonged to the great majority of the _nouveauxpauvres_. He went out into the rice-field, where were one or twohands that worked on shares with him, and he asked them. They knewimmediately; there is nothing connected with the parish that afield-hand does not know at once. She was the teacher of the coloredpublic school some three or four miles away. "Ah," thought Champigny,"some Northern lady on a mission." He watched to see her return in theevening, which she did, of course; in a blinding rain. Imagine thegreen barege veil then; for it remained always down over her face.[Illustration: CHAMPIGNY.]Old Champigny could not get over it that he had never seen her before.But he must have seen her, and, with his abstraction and old age, nothave noticed her, for he found out from the negroes that she had beenteaching four or five years there. And he found out also--how, is notimportant--that she was Idalie Sainte Foy Mortemart des Islets. _Lagrande demoiselle_! He had never known her in the old days, owing tohis uncomplimentary attitude toward women, but he knew of her,of course, and of her family. It should have been said that hisplantation was about fifty miles higher up the river, and on theopposite bank to Reine Sainte Foy. It seemed terrible. The oldgentleman had had reverses of his own, which would bear the telling,but nothing was more shocking to him than this--that Idalie SainteFoy Mortemart des Islets should be teaching a public colored schoolfor--it makes one blush to name it--seven dollars and a half a month.For seven dollars and a half a month to teach a set of--well! He foundout where she lived, a little cabin--not so much worse than his own,for that matter--in the corner of a field; no companion, no servant,nothing but food and shelter. Her clothes have been described.Only the good God himself knows what passed in Champigny's mind onthe subject. We know only the results. He went and married _la grandedemoiselle_. How? Only the good God knows that too. Every first of themonth, when he goes to the city to buy provisions, he takes her withhim--in fact, he takes her everywhere with him.Passengers on the railroad know them well, and they always have achance to see her face. When she passes her old plantation _la grandedemoiselle_ always lifts her veil for one instant--the inevitablegreen barege veil. What a face! Thin, long, sallow, petrified! And theneck! If she would only tie something around the neck! And her plain,coarse cottonade gown! The negro women about her were better dressedthan she.Poor old Champignon! It was not an act of charity to himself, nodoubt cross and disagreeable, besides being ugly. And as for love,gratitude!MIMI'S MARRIAGEThis how she told about it, sitting in her little room,--her bridalchamber,--not larger, really not larger than sufficed for the bedthere, the armoire here, the bureau opposite, and the washstand behindthe door, the corners all touching. But a nice set of furniture, quite_comme il faut_,--handsome, in fact,--as a bride of good family shouldhave. And she was dressed very prettily, too, in her long white_negligee_, with plenty of lace and ruffles and blue ribbons,--such asonly the Creole girls can make, and brides, alas! wear,--the prettyhoneymoon costume that suggests, that suggests--well! to proceed. "Thepoor little cat!" as one could not help calling her, so _mignonne_,so blond, with the pretty black eyes, and the rosebud of amouth,--whenever she closed it,--a perfect kiss."But you know, Louise," she said, beginning quite seriously at thebeginning, "papa would never have consented, never, never--poor papa!Indeed, I should never have asked him; it would only have been onehumiliation more for him, poor papa! So it was well he was dead, ifit was God's will for it to be. Of course I had my dreams, likeeverybody. I was so blond, so blond, and so small; it seemed like alaw I should marry a _brun_, a tall, handsome _brun_, with a mustacheand a fine barytone voice. That was how I always arranged it, and--youwill laugh--but a large, large house, and numbers of servants, and agood cook, but a superlatively good cuisine, and wine and all that,and long, trailing silk dresses, and theater every night, and voyagesto Europe, and--well, everything God had to give, in fact. You know, Iget that from papa, wanting everything God has to give! Poor papa! Itseemed to me I was to meet him at any time, my handsome _brun_. I usedto look for him positively on my way to school, and back home again,and whenever I would think of him I would try and walk so prettily,and look so pretty! _Mon Dieu!_ I was not ten years old yet! Andafterward it was only for that that I went into society. What shouldgirls go into society for otherwise but to meet their _brun_ or theirblond? Do you think it is amusing, to economize and economize, and sewand sew, just to go to a party to dance? No! I assure you, I went intosociety only for that; and I do not believe what girls say--they gointo society only for that too."You know at school how we used to _tirer la bonne aventure._[1] Well,every time he was not _brun, riche, avenant_, Jules, or Raoul, or Guy,I simply would not accept it, but would go on drawing until I obtainedwhat I wanted. As I tell you, I thought it was my destiny. And when Iwould try with a flower to see if he loved me,--_Il m'aime, un peu,beaucoup, passionement, pas du tout_,--if it were _pas du tout_, Iwould always throw the flower away, and begin tearing off the leavesfrom another one immediately. _Passionement_ was what I wanted, and Ialways got it in the end.[Footnote 1: _La bonne aventure_ is or was generally a very muchbattered foolscap copy-book, which contained a list of all possibleelements of future (school-girl) happiness. Each item answered aquestion, and had a number affixed to it. To draw one's fortuneconsisted in asking question after question, and guessing a number,a companion volunteering to read the answers. To avoid cheating, thebooks were revised from time to time, and the numbers changed.]"But papa, poor papa, he never knew anything of that, of course. Hewould get furious when any one would come to see me, and sometimes,when he would take me in society, if I danced with a 'nobody,'--as hecalled no matter whom I danced with,--he would come up and take meaway with such an air--such an air! It would seem that papa thoughthimself better than everybody in the world. But it went worse andworse with papa, not only in the affairs of the world, but in health.Always thinner and thinner, always a cough; in fact, you know, I am alittle feeble-chested myself, from papa. And Clementine! Clementinewith her children--just think, Louise, eight! I thank God my mama hadonly me, if papa's second wife had to have so many. And so naughty! Iassure you, they were all devils; and no correction, no punishment, noeducation--but you know Clementine! I tell you, sometimes on accountof those children I used to think myself in 'ell [making the Creole'sattempt and failure to pronounce the h], and Clementine had no prideabout them. If they had shoes, well; if they had not shoes, wellalso.[Illustration]"'But Clementine!' I would expostulate, I would pray--"'But do not be a fool, Mimi,' she would say. 'Am I God? Can I domiracles? Or must I humiliate your papa?'"That was true. Poor papa! It would have humiliated papa. When he hadmoney he gave; only it was a pity he had no money. As for what heobserved, he thought it was Clementine's negligence. For, it is true,Clementine had no order, no industry, in the best of fortune as in theworst. But to do her justice, it was not her fault this time, only shelet him believe it, to save his pride; and Clementine, you know, has agenius for stories. I assure you, Louise, I was desperate. I prayed toGod to help me, to advise me. I could not teach--I had no education; Icould not go into a shop--that would be dishonoring papa--and _enfin_,I was too pretty. 'And proclaim to the world,' Clementine would cry,'that your papa does not make money for his family.' That was true. Theworld is so malicious. You know, Louise, sometimes it seems to methe world is glad to hear that a man cannot support his family; itcompliments those who can. As if papa had not intelligence, and honor,and honesty! But they do not count now as in old times, 'before thewar.'"And so, when I thought of that, I laughed and talked and played thethoughtless like Clementine, and made bills. We made bills--we hadto--for everything; we could do that, you know, on our old name andfamily. But it is too long! I am sure it is too long and tiresome!What egotism on my part! Come, we will take a glass of anisette, andtalk of something else--your trip, your family. No? no? You are onlyasking me out of politeness! You are so _aimable_, so kind. Well, ifyou are not _ennuyee_--in fact, I want to tell you. It was too longto write, and I detest a pen. To me there is no instrument of torturelike a pen."Well, the lady next door, she was an American, and common, verycommon, according to papa. In comparison to us she had no familywhatever. Our little children were forbidden even to associate withher little children. I thought that was ridiculous--not that I am ademocrat, but I thought it ridiculous. But the children cared; theywere so disobedient and they were always next door, and they alwayshad something nice to eat over there. I sometimes thought Clementineused to encourage their disobedience, just for the good things theygot to eat over there. But papa was always making fun of them; youknow what a sharp tongue he had. The gentleman was a clerk; and,according to papa, the only true gentlemen in the world had familyand a profession. We did not dare allow ourselves to think it, butClementine and I knew that they, in fact, were in more comfortablecircumstances than we."The lady, who also had a great number of children, sent one day, withall the discretion and delicacy possible, and asked me if I wouldbe so kind as to--guess what, Louise! But only guess! But you nevercould! Well, to darn some of her children's stockings for her. It wasGod who inspired her, I am sure, on account of my praying so much tohim. You will be shocked, Louise, when I tell you. It sounds like asin, but I was not in despair when papa died. It was a grief,--yes,it seized the heart, but it was not despair. Men ought not to besubjected to the humiliation of life; they are not like women, youknow. We are made to stand things; they have their pride,--their_orgueil_, as we say in French,--and that is the point of honor withsome men. And Clementine and I, we could not have concealed it muchlonger. In fact, the truth was crying out everywhere, in the children,in the house, in our own persons, in our faces. The darning did notprovide a superfluity, I guarantee you!"Poor papa! He caught cold. He was condemned from the first. And soall his fine qualities died; for he had fine qualities--they were toofine for this age, that was all. Yes; it was a kindness of God to takehim before he found out. If it was to be, it was better. Just so withClementine as with me. After the funeral--crack! everything went topieces. We were at the four corners for the necessaries of life, andthe bills came in--my dear, the bills that came in! What memories!what memories! Clementine and I exclaimed; there were some bills thatwe had completely forgotten about. The lady next door sent her brotherover when papa died. He sat up all night, that night, and he assistedus in all our arrangements. And he came in afterward, every evening.If papa had been there, there would have been a fine scene over it; hewould have had to take the door, very likely. But now there was no oneto make objections. And so when, as I say, we were at the four cornersfor the necessaries of life, he asked Clementine's permission to askme to marry him."I give you my word, Louise, I had forgotten there was such a thing asmarriage in the world for me! I had forgotten it as completely as thechronology of the Merovingian dynasty, alas! with all the other schoolthings forgotten. And I do not believe Clementine remembered there wassuch a possibility in the world for me. _Mon Dieu!_ when a girl ispoor she may have all the beauty in the world--not that I had beauty,only a little prettiness. But you should have seen Clementine! Shescreamed for joy when she told me. Oh, there was but one answeraccording to her, and according to everybody she could consult, in herhaste. They all said it was a dispensation of Providence in my favor.He was young, he was strong; he did not make a fortune, it was true,but he made a good living. And what an assistance to have a man inthe family!--an assistance for Clementine and the children. But theprincipal thing, after all, was, he wanted to marry me. Nobody hadever wanted that before, my dear!"Quick, quick, it was all arranged. All my friends did something forme. One made my _peignoirs_ for me, one this, one that--_ma foi!_I did not recognize myself. One made all the toilet of the bureau,another of the bed, and we all sewed on the wedding-dress together.And you should have seen Clementine, going out in all her greatmourning, looking for a house, looking for a servant! But the weddingwas private on account of poor papa. But you know, Loulou, I had nevertime to think, except about Clementine and the children, and when Ithought of all those poor little children, poor papa's children, Isaid 'Quick, quick,' like the rest."It was the next day, the morning after the wedding, I had time tothink. I was sitting here, just as you see me now, in my pretty new_negligee_. I had been looking at all the pretty presents I haveshown you, and my trousseau, and my furniture,--it is not bad, asyou see,--my dress, my veil, my ring, and--I do not know--I do notknow--but, all of a sudden, from everywhere came the thought of my_brun_, my handsome _brun_ with the mustache, and the _bonne aventure,ricke, avenant_, the Jules, Raoul, Guy, and the flower leaves, and'_il m'aime, un pen, beaucoup, pas du tout,' passionnement_, and theway I expected to meet him walking to and from school, walking as ifI were dancing the steps, and oh, my plans, my plans, my plans,--silkdresses, theater, voyages to Europe,--and poor papa, so fine, so tall,so aristocratic. I cannot tell you how it all came; it seized myheart, and, _mon Dieu!_ I cried out, and I wept, I wept, I wept. HowI wept! It pains me here now to remember it. Hours, hours it lasted,until I had no tears in my body, and I had to weep without them, withsobs and moans. But this, I have always observed, is the time forreflection--after the tears are all out. And I am sure God himselfgave me my thoughts. 'Poor little Mimi!' I thought, '_fi done_! Youare going to make a fool of yourself now when it is all over, becausewhy? It is God who manages the world, and not you. You pray to God tohelp you in your despair, and he has helped you. He has sent you agood, kind husband who adores you; who asks only to be a brother toyour sisters and brothers, and son to Clementine; who has given youmore than you ever possessed in your life--but because he did not comeout of the _bonne aventure_--and who gets a husband out of the_bonne aventure?_--and would your _brun_ have come to you in yourmisfortune?' I am sure God inspired those thoughts in me.[Illustration: "I wept, I wept, I wept."]"I tell you, I rose from that bed--naturally I had thrown myself uponit. Quick I washed my face, I brushed my hair, and, you see these bowsof ribbons,--look, here are the marks of the tears,--I turned them._He,_ Loulou, it occurs to me, that if you examined the blue bows ona bride's _negligee_, you might always find tears on the other side;for do they not all have to marry whom God sends? and am I the onlyone who had dreams? It is the end of dreams, marriage; and that is thegood thing about it. God lets us dream to keep us quiet, but he knowswhen to wake us up, I tell you. The blue bows knew! And now, you see,I prefer my husband to my _brun_; in fact, Loulou, I adore him, and Iam furiously jealous about him. And he is so good to Clementine andthe poor little children; and see his photograph--a blond, and notgood-looking, and small!"But poor papa! If he had been alive, I am sure he never would haveagreed with God about my marriage."THE MIRACLE CHAPELEvery heart has a miracle to pray for. Every life holds that whichonly a miracle can cure. To prove that there have never been, thatthere can never be, miracles does not alter the matter. So long asthere is something hoped for,--that does not come in the legitimatechannel of possible events,--so long as something does come not to behoped or expected in the legitimate channel of possible events, justso long will the miracle be prayed for.The rich and the prosperous, it would seem, do not depend upon God somuch, do not need miracles, as the poor do. They do not have to prayfor the extra crust when starvation hovers near; for the softening ofan obdurate landlord's heart; for strength in temptation, light indarkness, salvation from vice; for a friend in friendlessness; forthat miracle of miracles, an opportunity to struggling ambition; forthe ending of a dark night, the breaking of day; and, oh! for God'sown miracle to the bedside-watchers--the change for the better, whendeath is there and the apothecary's skill too far, far away. The poor,the miserable, the unhappy, they can show their miracles by the score;that is why God is called the poor man's friend. He does not mind, sothey say, going in the face of logic and reason to relieve them; foroften the kind and charitable are sadly hampered by the fetters oflogic and reason, which hold them, as it were, away from their ownbenevolence.But the rich have their miracles, no doubt, even in that beautifulempyrean of moneyed ease in which the poor place them. Their moneycannot buy all they enjoy, and God knows how much of their sorrow itassuages. As it is, one hears now and then of accidents among them,conversions to better thoughts, warding off of danger, rescue of life;and heirs are sometimes born, and husbands provided, and fortunessaved, in such surprising ways, that even the rich, feeling theirlimitations in spite of their money, must ascribe it privately if notpublicly to other potencies than their own. These cathedral _toursde force_, however, do not, if the truth be told, convince like themiracles of the obscure little chapel.There is always a more and a most obscure little miracle chapel, andas faith seems ever to lead unhesitatingly to the latter one, there isever rising out of humility and obscurity, as in response to a demand,some new shrine, to replace the wear and tear and loss of othershrines by prosperity. For, alas! it is hard even for a chapel toremain obscure and humble in the face of prosperity and popularity.And how to prevent such popularity and prosperity? As soon as thenoise of a real miracle in it gets abroad, every one is for hurryingthither at once with their needs and their prayers, their candlesand their picayunes; and the little miracle chapel, perhaps despiteitself, becomes with mushroom growth a church, and the church acathedral, from whose resplendent altars the cheap, humble ex-vototablets, the modest beginnings of its ecclesiastical fortunes, arebefore long banished to dimly lighted lateral shrines.The miracle chapel in question lay at the end of a very confusing butstill intelligible route. It is not in truth a chapel at all, but aconsecrated chamber in a very small, very lowly cottage, which stands,or one might appropriately, if not with absolute novelty, say whichkneels, in the center of a large garden, a garden primeval inrusticity and size, its limits being defined by no lesser boundariesthan the four intersecting streets outside, and its culture showingonly the careless, shiftless culture of nature. The streets outsidewere miracles themselves in that, with their liquid contents, theywere streets and not bayous. However, they protected their islandchapel almost as well as a six-foot moat could have done. There was asmall paved space on the sidewalk that served to the pedestrian as anindication of the spot in the tall, long, broad fence where a gatemight be sought. It was a small gate with a strong latch. It requireda strong hand to open it. At the sound of the click it made, thelittle street ragamuffin, who stood near, peeping through the fence,looked up. He had worked quite a hole between the boards with hisfingers. Such an anxious expression passed over his face that evena casual passer-by could not help relieving it by a question--anyquestion:"Is this the miracle chapel, little boy?""Yes, ma'am; yes." Then his expression changed to one of eagerness,yet hardly less anxious."Here. Take this--"He did not hold out his hand, the coin had to seek it. At its touch herefused to take it."I ain't begging.""What are you looking at so through the fence?" He was all sadnessnow."Just looking.""Is there anything to see inside?"He did not answer. The interrogation was repeated."I can't see nothing. I'm blind," putting his eyes again to the hole,first one, then the other."Come, won't you tell me how this came to be a miracle chapel?""Oh, ma'am,"--he turned his face from the fence, and clasped his handsin excitement,--"it was a poor widow woman who come here with her babythat was a-dying, and she prayed to the Virgin Mary, and the VirginMary made the baby live--"He dropped his voice, the words falling slower and slower. As heraised his face, one could see then that he was blind, and theaccident that had happened to him, in fording the street. Whatsightless eyes! What a wet, muddy little skeleton! Ten? No; hardly tenyears of age."The widow woman she picked up her baby, and she run down the walkhere, and out into the street screaming--she was so glad,"--puttinghis eyes to the peep-hole again,--"and the Virgin Mary come down thewalk after her, and come through the gate, too; and that was all sheseed--the widow woman.""Did you know the widow woman?"He shook his head."How do you know it?""That was what they told me. And they told me, the birds all begun tosing at once, and the flowers all lighted up like the sun was shiningon them. They seed her.
