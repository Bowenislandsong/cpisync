tmake it my bargain, that if I come you will not be frighted to see me;you think, I'll warrant, you have courage enough to endure a worsesight. You may be deceived, you never saw me in mourning yet; nobodythat has will e'er desire to do it again, for their own sakes as well asmine. Oh, 'tis a most dismal dress,--I have not dared to look in theglass since I wore it; and certainly if it did so ill with other peopleas it does with me, it would never be worn.You told me of writing to your father, but you did not say whether youhad heard from him, or how he did. May not I ask it? Is it possible thathe saw me? Where were my eyes that I did not see him, for I believe Ishould have guessed at least that 'twas he if I had? They say you arevery like him; but 'tis no wonder neither that I did not see him, for Isaw not you when I met you there. 'Tis a place I look upon nobody in;and it was reproached to me by a kinsman, but a little before you cameto me, that he had followed me to half a dozen shops to see when I wouldtake notice of him, and was at last going away with a belief 'twas notI, because I did not seem to know him. Other people make it so muchtheir business to gape, that I'll swear they put me so out ofcountenance I dare not look up for my life.I am sorry for General Monk's misfortunes, because you say he is yourfriend; but otherwise she will suit well enough with the rest of thegreat ladies of the times, and become Greenwich as well as some othersdo the rest of the King's houses. If I am not mistaken, that Monk has abrother lives in Cornwall; an honest gentleman, I have heard, and onethat was a great acquaintance of a brother of mine who was killed thereduring the war, and so much his friend that upon his death he puthimself and his family into mourning for him, which is not usual, Ithink, where there is no relation of kindred.I will take order that my letters shall be left with Jones, and yourscalled for there. As long as your last was, I read it over thrice inless than an hour, though, to say truth, I had skipped some on't thelast time. I could not read my own confession so often. Love is aterrible word, and I should blush to death if anything but a letteraccused me on't. Pray be merciful, and let it run friendship in my nextcharge. My Lady sends me word she has received those parts of _Cyrus_ Ilent you. Here is another for you which, when you have read, you knowhow to dispose. There are four pretty stories in it, "_L'Amant Absente_,""_L'Amant non Aime_," "_L'Amant Jaloux_," _et_ "_L'Amant dont La Maitresseest mort_." Tell me which you have most compassion for when you haveread what every one says for himself. Perhaps you will not think it soeasy to decide which is the most unhappy, as you may think by the titlestheir stories bear. Only let me desire you not to pity the jealous one,for I remember I could do nothing but laugh at him as one that soughthis own vexation. This, and the little journeys (you say) you are tomake, will entertain you till I come; which, sure, will be as soon aspossible I can, since 'tis equally desired by you and your faithful._Letter 32._--Things being more settled in that part of the world, SirJohn Temple is returning to Ireland, where he intends taking his seat asMaster of the Rolls once again. Temple joins his father soon after this,and stays in Ireland a few months.Lady Ormond was the wife of the first Duke of Ormond. She had obtainedher pass to go over to Ireland on August 24th, 1653. The Ormonds hadindeed been in great straits for want of money, and in August 1652 LadyOrmond had come over from Caen, where they were then living, toendeavour to claim Cromwell's promise of reserving to her that portionof their estate which had been her inheritance. After great delays sheobtained L500, and a grant of L2000 per annum out of their Irish lands"lying most conveniently to Dunmore House." It must have been thismatter that Dorothy had heard of when she questions "whether she willget it when she comes there."Francis Annesley, Lord Valentia, belonged to an ancient Nottinghamshirefamily, though he himself was born in Newport, Buckinghamshire. Of hisdaughter's marriage I can find nothing. Lord Valentia was at this timeSecretary of State at Dublin.Sir Justinian has at length found a second wife. Her name is Vere, andshe is the daughter of Lord Leigh of Stoneleigh. Thus do Dorothy'ssuitors, one by one, recover and cease to lament her obduracy. When shedeclares that she would rather have chosen _a chain to lead her apes in_than marry Sir Justinian, she refers to an old superstition as to theultimate fate of spinsters--          Women, dying maids, lead apes in hell,runs the verse of an old play, and that is the whole superstition, theorigin of which seems somewhat inexplicable. The phrase is thrice usedby Shakespeare, and constantly occurs in the old burlesques andcomedies; in one instance, in a comedy entitled "Love's Convert" (1651),it is altered to "lead an ape in _heaven_." Many will remember the fateof "The young Mary Anne" in the famous Ingoldsby legend, "BloudieJacke:"--          So they say she is now leading apes--                                    Bloudie Jack,          And mends bachelors' smallclothes below.No learned editor that I am acquainted with has been able to suggest anexplanation of this curious expression.SIR,--All my quarrels to you are kind ones, for, sure, 'tis alikeimpossible for me to be angry as for you to give me the occasion;therefore, when I chide (unless it be that you are not careful enough ofyourself, and hazard too much a health that I am more concerned in thanmy own), you need not study much for excuses, I can easily forgive youanything but want of kindness. The judgment you have made of the fourlovers I recommended to you does so perfectly agree with what I think ofthem, that I hope it will not alter when you have read their stories._L'Amant Absente_ has (in my opinion) a mistress so much beyond any ofthe rest, that to be in danger of losing her is more than to have lostthe others; _L'Amant non Aime_ was an ass, under favour (notwithstandingthe _Princesse Cleobuline's_ letter); his mistress had caprices thatwould have suited better with our _Amant Jaloux_ than with anybody else;and the _Prince Artibie_ was much to blame that he outlived his _belleLeontine_. But if you have met with the beginning of the story of_Amestris and Aglatides_, you will find the rest of it in this part Isend you now; and 'tis, to me, one of the prettiest I have read, and themost natural. They say the gentleman that writes this romance has asister that lives with him, a maid, and she furnishes him with all thelittle stories that come between, so that he only contrives the maindesign; and when he wants something to entertain his company withal, hecalls to her for it. She has an excellent fancy, sure, and a great wit;but, I am sorry to tell it you, they say 'tis the most ill-favouredcreature that ever was born. And 'tis often so; how seldom do we see aperson excellent in anything but they have some great defect with itthat pulls them low enough to make them equal with other people; andthere is justice in't. Those that have fortunes have nothing else, andthose that want it deserve to have it. That's but small comfort, though,you'll say; 'tis confessed, but there is no such thing as perfecthappiness in this world, those that have come the nearest it had manythings to wish; and,--bless me, whither am I going? Sure, 'tis thedeath's head I see stand before me puts me into this grave discourse(pray do not think I meant that for a conceit neither); how idly have Ispent two sides of my paper, and am afraid, besides, I shall not havetime to write two more. Therefore I'll make haste to tell you that myfriendship for you makes me concerned in all your relations; that I havea great respect for Sir John, merely as he is your father, and that 'tismuch increased by his kindness to you; that he has all my prayers andwishes for his safety; and that you will oblige me in letting me knowwhen you hear any good news from him. He has met with a great deal ofgood company, I believe. My Lady Ormond, I am told, is waiting for apassage, and divers others; but this wind (if I am not mistaken) is notgood for them. In earnest, 'tis a most sad thing that a person of herquality should be reduced to such a fortune as she has lived upon theselate years, and that she should lose that which she brought, as well asthat which was her husband's. Yet, I hear, she has now got some of herown land in Ireland granted her; but whether she will get it when shecomes there is, I think, a question.We have a lady new come into this country that I pity, too, extremely.She is one of my Lord of Valentia's daughters, and has married an oldfellow that is some threescore and ten, who has a house that is fitterfor the hogs than for her, and a fortune that will not at all recompensethe least of these inconveniences. Ah! 'tis most certain I should havechosen a handsome chain to lead my apes in before such a husband; butmarrying and hanging go by destiny, they say. It was not mine, it seems,to have an emperor; the spiteful man, merely to vex me, has gone andmarried my countrywoman, my Lord Lee's daughter. What a multitude ofwillow garlands I shall weave before I die; I think I had best make theminto faggots this cold weather, the flame they would make in a chimneywould be of more use to me than that which was in the hearts of allthose that gave them me, and would last as long. I did not think Ishould have got thus far. I have been so persecuted with visits all thisweek I have had no time to despatch anything of business, so that now Ihave done this I have forty letters more to write; how much rather wouldI have them all to you than to anybody else; or, rather, how much betterwould it be if there needed none to you, and that I could tell youwithout writing how much I amYours._Letter 33._--Sir Thomas Peyton, we must remember, had married Dorothy'seldest sister; she died many years ago, and Sir Thomas married again, in1648, one Dame Cicely Swan, a widow, whose character Dorothy gives us.Lord Monmouth was the eldest son of the Earl of Monmouth, and was bornin 1596. He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford. His literary workwas, at least, copious, and included some historical writing, as well asthe translations mentioned by Dorothy. He published, among other things,_An Historical Relation of the United Provinces_, a _History of the Warsin Flanders_, and a _History of Venice_.Sir John Suckling, in the following doggerel, hails our noble authorwith a flunkey's enthusiasm,--          It is so rare and new a thing to see          Aught that belongs to young nobility          In print, but their own clothes, that we must praise          You, as we would do those first show the ways                          To arts or to new worlds.In such strain writes the author of _Why so pale and wan, fond lover?_and both the circumstance and the doggerel should be very instructive tothe snobologist.The literary work of Lord Broghill is not unknown to fame, and Mr.Waller's verse is still read by us; but I have never seen a history ofthe Civil Wars from Mr. Waller's pen, and cannot find that he everpublished one._Prazimene_ and _Polexander_ are two romances translated from theFrench,--the former, a neat little duodecimo; the latter, a huge folioof more than three hundred and fifty closely-printed pages. Thetitle-page of _Prazimene_, a very good example of its kind, runs asfollows:--"Two delightful Novels, or the Unlucky Fair One; being theAmours of Milistrate and Prazimene, Illustrated with variety of Chanceand Fortune. Translated from the French by a Person of Quality, London.Sold by Eben Tracy, at the Three Bibles on London Bridge." _Polexander_was "done into English by William Browne, Gent.," for the benefit andbehoof of the Earl of Pembroke.William Fiennes, Lord Say and Sele, was one of the chiefs of theIndependent party, a Republican, and one of the first to bear armsagainst the King. He had, for that day, extravagant notions of civilliberty, and on the disappointment of his hopes, he appears to haveretired to the Isle of Lundy, on the coast of Devon, and continued avoluntary prisoner there until Cromwell's death. After the Restorationhe was made Lord Chamberlain of the Household, and Lord Privy Seal. Hepublished some political tracts, none of which are now in existence; andAnthony Wood mentions having seen other things of his, among which,maybe, was the romance that Dorothy had heard of, but which is lost tous.SIR,--Pray, let not the apprehension that others say fine things to memake your letters at all the shorter; for, if it were so, I should notthink they did, and so long you are safe. My brother Peyton does,indeed, sometimes send me letters that may be excellent for aught Iknow, and the more likely because I do not understand them; but I maysay to you (as to a friend) I do not like them, and have wondered thatmy sister (who, I may tell you too, and you will not think it vanity inme, had a great deal of wit, and was thought to write as well as mostwomen in England) never persuaded him to alter his style, and make it alittle more intelligible. He is an honest gentleman, in earnest, hasunderstanding enough, and was an excellent husband to two very differentwives, as two good ones could be. My sister was a melancholy, retiredwoman, and, besides the company of her husband and her books, neversought any, but could have spent a life much longer than hers was inlooking to her house and her children. This lady is of a free, jollyhumour, loves cards and company, and is never more pleased than when shesees a great many others that are so too. Now, with both these he soperfectly complied that 'tis hard to judge which humour he is moreinclined to in himself; perhaps to neither, which makes it so much themore strange. His kindness to his first wife may give him an esteem forher sister; but he was too much smitten with this lady to think ofmarrying anybody else, and, seriously, I could not blame him, for shehad, and has yet, great loveliness in her; she was very handsome, and isvery good (one may read it in her face at first sight). A woman that ishugely civil to all people, and takes as generally as anybody that Iknow, but not more than my cousin Molle's letters do, but which, yet,you do not like, you say, nor I neither, I'll swear; and if it beignorance in us both we'll forgive it one another. In my opinion thesegreat scholars are not the best writers (of letters, I mean); of books,perhaps they are. I never had, I think, but one letter from SirJustinian, but 'twas worth twenty of anybody's else to make me sport. Itwas the most sublime nonsense that in my life I ever read; and yet, Ibelieve, he descended as low as he could to come near my weakunderstanding. 'Twill be no compliment after this to say I like yourletters in themselves; not as they come from one that is not indifferentto me, but, seriously, I do. All letters, methinks, should be free andeasy as one's discourse; not studied as an oration, nor made up of hardwords like a charm. 'Tis an admirable thing to see how some people willlabour to find out terms that may obscure a plain sense. Like agentleman I know, who would never say "the weather grew cold," but that"winter began to salute us." I have no patience for such coxcombs, andcannot blame an old uncle of mine that threw the standish at his man'shead because he writ a letter for him where, instead of saying (as hismaster bid him), "that he would have writ himself, but he had the goutin his hand," he said, "that the gout in his hand would not permit himto put pen to paper." The fellow thought he had mended it mightily, andthat putting pen to paper was much better than plain writing.I have no patience neither for these translations of romances. I metwith _Polexander_ and _L'illustre Bassa_ both so disguised that I, whoam their old acquaintance, hardly know them; besides that, they werestill so much French in words and phrases that 'twas impossible for onethat understands not French to make anything of them. If poor_Prazimene_ be in the same dress, I would not see her for the world. Shehas suffered enough besides. I never saw but four tomes of her, and wastold the gentleman that writ her story died when those were finished. Iwas very sorry for it, I remember, for I liked so far as I had seen ofit extremely. Is it not my good Lord of Monmouth, or some suchhonourable personage, that presents her to the English ladies? I haveheard many people wonder how he spends his estate. I believe he undoeshimself with printing his translations. Nobody else will undergo thecharge, because they never hope to sell enough of them to pay themselveswithal. I was looking t'other day in a book of his where he translates_Pipero_ as piper, and twenty words more that are as false as this.My Lord Broghill, sure, will give us something worth the reading. MyLord Saye, I am told, has writ a romance since his retirement in theIsle of Lundy, and Mr. Waller, they say, is making one of our wars,which, if he does not mingle with a great deal of pleasing fiction,cannot be very diverting, sure, the subject is so sad.But all this is nothing to my coming to town, you'll say. 'Tis confest;and that I was willing as long as I could to avoid saying anything whenI had nothing to say worth your knowing. I am still obliged to wait mybrother Peyton and his lady coming. I had a letter from him this week,which I will send you, that you may see what hopes he gives. As littleroom as I have left, too, I must tell you what a present I had made meto-day. Two of the finest young Irish greyhounds that e'er I saw; agentleman that serves the General sent them me. They are newly comeover, and sent for by Henry Cromwell, he tells me, but not how he gotthem for me. However, I am glad I have them, and much the more becauseit dispenses with a very unfit employment that your father, out of hiskindness to you and his civility to me, was content to take upon him._Letter 34._SIR,--Jane was so unlucky as to come out of town before your return, butshe tells me she left my letter with Nan Stacy for you. I was in hopeshe would have brought me one from you; and because she did not I wasresolv'd to punish her, and kept her up till one o'clock telling me allher stories. Sure, if there be any truth in the old observation, yourcheeks glowed notably; and 'tis most certain that if I were with you, Ishould chide notably. What do you mean to be so melancholy? By herreport your humour is grown insupportable. I can allow it not to bealtogether what she says, and yet it may be very ill too; but if youloved me you would not give yourself over to that which will infalliblykill you, if it continue. I know too well that our fortunes have givenus occasion enough to complain and to be weary of her tyranny; but,alas! would it be better if I had lost you or you me; unless we weresure to die both together, 'twould but increase our misery, and add tothat which is more already than we can well tell how to bear. You aremore cruel than she regarding a life that's dearer to me than that ofthe whole world besides, and which makes all the happiness I have orever shall be capable of. Therefore, by all our friendship I conjure youand, by the power you have given me, command you, to preserve yourselfwith the same care that you would have me live. 'Tis all the obedience Irequire of you, and will be the greatest testimony you can give me ofyour faith. When you have promised me this, 'tis not impossible that Imay promise you shall see me shortly; though my brother Peyton (who sayshe will come down to fetch his daughter) hinders me from making thejourney in compliment to her. Yet I shall perhaps find business enoughto carry me up to town. 'Tis all the service I expect from two girlswhose friends have given me leave to provide for, that some order I musttake for the disposal of them may serve for my pretence to see you; butthen I must find you pleased and in good humour, merry as you were wontto be when we first met, if you will not have me show that I am nothingakin to my cousin Osborne's lady.But what an age 'tis since we first met, and how great a change it haswrought in both of us; if there had been as great a one in my face, itcould be either very handsome or very ugly. For God's sake, when wemeet, let us design one day to remember old stories in, to ask oneanother by what degrees our friendship grew to this height 'tis at. Inearnest, I am lost sometimes with thinking on't; and though I can neverrepent the share you have in my heart, I know not whether I gave it youwillingly or not at first. No, to speak ingenuously, I think you got aninterest there a good while before I thought you had any, and it grew soinsensibly, and yet so fast, that all the traverses it has met withsince has served rather to discover it to me than at all to hinder it.By this confession you will see I am past all disguise with you, andthat you have reason to be satisfied with knowing as much of my heart asI do myself. Will the kindness of this letter excuse the shortness on't?For I have twenty more, I think, to write, and the hopes I had ofreceiving one from you last night kept me writing this when I had moretime; or if all this will not satisfy, make your own conditions, so youdo not return it me by the shortness of yours. Your servant kisses yourhands, and I amYour faithful._Letter 35._--This is written on the back of a letter of Sir ThomasPeyton to Dorothy, and is probably a postscript to _Letter 34_. SirThomas's letter is a good example of the stilted letter-writing in vogueat that time, which Dorothy tells us was so much admired. The affairsthat are troubling him are legal matters in connection with hisbrother-in-law Henry Oxenden's estate. There is a multitude of lettersin the MSS. in the British Museum referring to this business; but we arenot greatly concerned with Oxenden's financial difficulties. Sir EdwardHales was a gentleman of noble family in Kent. There is one of the samename who in 1688 declares himself openly to be a Papist, and is triedunder the Test Act. He is concerned in the same year in the escape ofKing James, providing him with a fishing-boat to carry him into France.This is in all probability the Sir Edward Hales referred to by SirThomas Peyton, unless it be a son of the same name. Here is theletter:--"Good sister,--I am very sorry to hear the loss of our good brother,whose short time gives us a sad example of our frail condition. But Iwill not say the loss, knowing whom I write to, whose religion andwisdom is a present stay to support in all worldly accidents."'Tis long since we resolved to have given you a visit, and haverelieved you of my daughter. But I have had the following of a mostlaborious affair, which hath cost me the travelling, though in our owncountry style, fifty ...; and I have been less at home than elsewhereever since I came from London; which hath vext me the more in regard Ihave been detained from the desire I had of being with you before thistime. Such entertainment, however, must all those have that have to dowith such a purse-proud and wilful person as Sir Edward Hales. This nextweek being Michaelmas week, we shall end all and I be at liberty, Ihope, to consider my own contentments. In the meantime I know not whatexcuses to make for the trouble I have put you to already, of which Igrow to be ashamed; and I should much more be so if I did not know youto be as good as you are fair. In both which regards I have a greathonour to be esteemed,"My good sister,"Your faithful brother and servant,"THOMAS PEYTON."KNOWLTON, _Sept. 22, 1653_."_On the other side of Sir T. Peyton's Letter._Nothing that is paper can 'scape me when I have time to write, and 'tisto you. But that I am not willing to excite your envy, I would tell youhow many letters I have despatched since I ended yours; and if I couldshow them you 'twould be a certain cure for it, for they are all veryshort ones, and most of them merely compliments, which I am sure youcare not for.I had forgot in my other to tell you what Jane requires for thesatisfaction of what you confess you owe her. You must promise her to bemerry, and not to take cold when you are at the tennis court, for thereshe hears you are found.Because you mention my Lord Broghill and his wit, I have sent you someof his verses. My brother urged them against me one day in a dispute,where he would needs make me confess that no passion could be longlived, and that such as were most in love forgot that ever they had beenso within a twelvemonth after they were married; and, in earnest, thewant of examples to bring for the contrary puzzled me a little, so thatI was fain to bring out those pitiful verses of my Lord Biron to hiswife, which was so poor an argument that I was e'en ashamed on't myself,and he quickly laughed me out of countenance with saying they were justsuch as a married man's flame would produce and a wife inspire. I sendyou a love letter, too; which, simple as you see, it was sent me in verygood earnest, and by a person of quality, as I was told. If you read itwhen you go to bed, 'twill certainly make your sleep approved.I am yours._Letter 36._--My Lady Carlisle was, as Dorothy says, "an extraordinaryperson." She was the daughter of Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland,and at the age of eighteen, against her father's will and under somewhatromantic circumstances, married James Hay, Earl of Carlisle. Her sistermarried the Earl of Leicester, and she is therefore aunt to LadySunderland and Algernon Sydney. She was a favourite attendant of QueenHenrietta, and there are evil rumours connecting her name with that ofStrafford. On Strafford's death, it is asserted that she transferred heraffections to Pym, to whom she is said to have betrayed the secrets ofthe Court. There seems little doubt that it was she who gave notice toPym of the King's coming to the House to seize the five members. In 1648she appears, however, to have assisted the Royalists with money for thepurpose of raising a fleet to attack England, and at the Restoration shewas received at Court, and employed herself in intriguing for the returnof Queen Henrietta to England, which was opposed at the time byClarendon and others. Soon after this, and in the year of theRestoration, she died suddenly. Poets of all grades, from Wallerdownwards, have sung of her beauty, vivacity, and wit; and Sir TobyMatthew speaks of her as "too lofty and dignified to be capable offriendship, and having too great a heart to be susceptible oflove,"--an extravagance of compliment hardly satisfactory in this plainage.My Lord Paget, at whose house at Marlow Mr. Lely was staying, was aprominent loyalist both in camp and council chamber. He married Frances,the eldest daughter of the Earl of Holland, my Lady Diana's sister.Whether or not Dorothy really assisted young Sir Harry Yelverton in hissuit for the hand of fair Lady Ruthin we cannot say, but they wereundoubtedly married. Sir Harry Yelverton seems to have been a man ofsuperior accomplishments and serious learning. He was at this timetwenty years of age, and had been educated at St. Paul's School, London,and afterwards at Wadham College, Oxford, under the tutorship of Dr.Wilkins, Cromwell's brother-in-law, a learned and philosophicalmathematician. He was admitted gentleman commoner in 1650, and it issaid "made great proficiency in several branches of learning, being asexact a Latin and Grecian as any in the university of his age or time."He succeeded to his father's title soon after coming of age, and took aleading part in the politics of the day, becoming Knight of the Shire ofNorthampton in the Restoration Parliament. He was a high Tory, and agreat defender of the Church and its ejected ministers, one of whom, Dr.Thomas Morton, the learned theologian, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield,died in his house in 1659. He wrote a discourse on the "Truth andReasonableness of the Religion delivered by Jesus Christ," a Preface toDr. Morton's work on Episcopacy, and a vindication of the Church ofEngland against the attacks of the famous Edward Bagshawe.In this letter Dorothy describes some husbands whom she could _not_marry. See what she expects in a lover! Have we not here some localsquires hit off to the life? Could George Eliot herself have done morefor us in like space?SIR,--Why are you so sullen, and why am I the cause? Can you believethat I do willingly defer my journey? I know you do not. Why, then,should my absence now be less supportable to you than heretofore? Nay,it shall not be long (if I can help it), and I shall break through allinconveniences rather than deny you anything that lies in my power togrant. But by your own rules, then, may I not expect the same from you?Is it possible that all I have said cannot oblige you to a care ofyourself? What a pleasant distinction you make when you say that 'tisnot melancholy makes you do these things, but a careless forgetfulness.Did ever anybody forget themselves to that degree that was notmelancholy in extremity? Good God! how you are altered; and what is itthat has done it? I have known you when of all the things in the worldyou would not have been taken for a discontent; you were, as I thought,perfectly pleased with your condition; what has made it so much worsesince? I know nothing you have lost, and am sure you have gained afriend that is capable of the highest degree of friendship you canpropound, that has already given an entire heart for that which shereceived, and 'tis no more in her will than in her power ever to recallit or divide it; if this be not enough to satisfy you, tell me what Ican do more?There are a great many ingredients must go to the making me happy in ahusband. First, as my cousin Franklin says, our humours must agree; andto do that he must have that kind of breeding that I have had, and usedthat kind of company. That is, he must not be so much a countrygentleman as to understand nothing but hawks and dogs, and be fonder ofeither than his wife; nor of the next sort of them whose aim reaches nofurther than to be Justice of the Peace, and once in his life HighSheriff, who reads no book but statutes, and studies nothing but how tomake a speech interlarded with Latin that may amaze his disagreeing poorneighbours, and fright them rather than persuade them into quietness. Hemust not be a thing that began the world in a free school, was sent fromthence to the university, and is at his furthest when he reaches theInns of Court, has no acquaintance but those of his form in theseplaces, speaks the French he has picked out of old laws, and admiresnothing but the stories he has heard of the revels that were kept therebefore his time. He must not be a town gallant neither, that lives in atavern and an ordinary, that cannot imagine how an hour should be spentwithout company unless it be in sleeping, that makes court to all thewomen he sees, thinks they believe him, and laughs and is laughed atequally. Nor a travelled Monsieur whose head is all feather inside andoutside, that can talk of nothing but dances and duets, and has courageenough to wear slashes when every one else dies with cold to see him. Hemust not be a fool of no sort, nor peevish, nor ill-natured, nor proud,nor covetous; and to all this must be added, that he must love me and Ihim as much as we are capable of loving. Without all this, his fortune,though never so great, would not satisfy me; and with it, a verymoderate one would keep me from ever repenting my disposal.I have been as large and as particular in my descriptions as my cousinMolle is in his of Moor Park,--but that you know the place so well Iwould send it you,--nothing can come near his patience in writing it,but my reading on't. Would you had sent me your father's letter, itwould not have been less welcome to me than to you; and you may safelybelieve that I am equally concerned with you in anything. I should bepleased to see something of my Lady Carlisle's writing, because she isso extraordinary a person. I have been thinking of sending you mypicture till I could come myself; but a picture is but dull company, andthat you need not; besides, I cannot tell whether it be very like me ornot, though 'tis the best I ever had drawn for me, and Mr. Lilly [Lely]will have it that he never took more pains to make a good one in hislife, and that was it I think that spoiled it. He was condemned formaking the first he drew for me a little worse than I, and in makingthis better he has made it as unlike as t'other. He is now, I think, atmy Lord Pagett's at Marloe [Marlow], where I am promised he shall draw apicture of my Lady for me,--she gives it me, she says, as the greatesttestimony of her friendship to me, for by her own rule she is past thetime of having pictures taken of her. After eighteen, she says, there isno face but decays apparently; I would fain have had her excepted suchas had never been beauties, for my comfort, but she would not.When you see your friend Mr. Heningham, you may tell him in his earthere is a willow garland coming towards him. He might have sped betterin his suit if he had made court to me, as well as to my Lady Ruthin.She has been my wife this seven years, and whosoever pretends there mustask my leave. I have now given my consent that she shall marry a verypretty little gentleman, Sir Christopher Yelverton's son, and I think weshall have a wedding ere it be long. My Lady her mother, in greatkindness, would have recommended Heningham to me, and told me in acompliment that I was fitter for him than her daughter, who was younger,and therefore did not understand the world so well; that she was certainif he knew me he would be extremely taken, for I would make just thatkind of wife he looked for. I humbly thanked her, but said I was certainhe would not make that kind of husband I looked for,--and so it went nofurther.I expect my eldest brother here shortly, whose fortune is well mended bymy other brother's death, so as if he were satisfied himself with whathe has done, I know no reason why he might not be very happy; but I amafraid he is not. I have not seen my sister since I knew she was so;but, sure, she can have lost no beauty, for I never saw any that shehad, but good black eyes, which cannot alter. He loves her, I think, atthe ordinary rate of husbands, but not enough, I believe, to marry herso much to his disadvantage if it were to do again; and that would killme were I as she, for I could be infinitely better satisfied with ahusband that had never loved me in hopes he might, than with one thatbegan to love me less than he had done.I am yours._Letter 37._SIR,--You say I abuse you; and Jane says you abuse me when you say youare not melancholy: which is to be believed? Neither, I think; for Icould not have said so positively (as it seems she did) that I shouldnot be in town till my brother came back: he was not gone when she writ,nor is not yet; and if my brother Peyton had come before his going, Ihad spoiled her prediction. But now it cannot be; he goes on Monday orTuesday at farthest. I hope you did truly with me, too, in saying thatyou are not melancholy (though she does not believe it). I am thoughtso, many times, when I am not at all guilty on't. How often do I sit incompany a whole day, and when they are gone am not able to give anaccount of six words that was said, and many times could be so muchbetter pleased with the entertainment my own thoughts give me, that 'tisall I can do to be so civil as not to let them see they trouble me. Thismay be your disease. However, remember you have promised me to becareful of yourself, and that if I secure what you have entrusted mewith, you will answer for the rest. Be this our bargain then; and lookthat you give me as good an account of one as I shall give you oft'other. In earnest, I was strangely vexed to see myself forced todisappoint you so, and felt your trouble and my own too. How often Ihave wished myself with you, though but for a day, for an hour: I wouldhave given all the time I am to spend here for it with all my heart.You could not but have laughed if you had seen me last night. My brotherand Mr. Gibson were talking by the fire; and I sat by, but as no part ofthe company. Amongst other things (which I did not at all mind), theyfell into a discourse of flying; and both agreed it was very possible tofind out a way that people might fly like birds, and despatch theirjourneys: so I, that had not said a word all night, started up at that,and desired they would say a little more on't, for I had not marked thebeginning; but instead of that, they both fell into so violent alaughing, that I should appear so much concerned in such an art; butthey little knew of what use it might have been to me. Yet I saw youlast night, but 'twas in a dream; and before I could say a word to you,or you to me, the disorder my joy to see you had put me into awakenedme. Just now I was interrupted, too, and called away to entertain twodumb gentlemen;--you may imagine whether I was pleased to leave mywriting to you for their company;--they have made such a tedious visit,too; and I am so tired with making of signs and tokens for everything Ihad to say. Good God! how do those that live with them always? They arebrothers; and the eldest is a baronet, has a good estate, a wife andthree or four children. He was my servant heretofore, and comes to seeme still for old love's sake; but if he could have made me mistress ofthe world I could not have had him; and yet I'll swear he has nothing tobe disliked in him but his want of tongue, which in a woman might havebeen a virtue.I sent you a part of _Cyrus_ last week, where you will meet with oneDoralise in the story of Abradah and Panthee. The whole story is verygood; but the humour makes the best part of it. I am of her opinion inmost things that she says in her character of "_L'honnest homme_" thatshe is in search of, and her resolution of receiving no heart that hadbeen offered to anybody else. Pray, tell me how you like her, and whatfault you find in my Lady Carlisle's letter? Methinks the hand and thestyle both show her a great person, and 'tis writ in the way that's nowaffected by all that pretend to wit and good breeding; only, I am alittle scandalized to confess that she uses that word faithful,--shethat never knew how to be so in her life.I have sent you my picture because you wished for it; but, pray, let itnot presume to disturb my Lady Sunderland's. Put it in some corner whereno eyes may find it out but yours, to whom it is only intended. 'Tis nota very good one, but the best I shall ever have drawn of me; for, as myLady says, my time for pictures is past, and therefore I have alwaysrefused to part with this, because I was sure the next would be a worse.There is a beauty in youth that every one has once in their lives; and Iremember my mother used to say there was never anybody (that was notdeformed) but were handsome, to some reasonable degree, once betweenfourteen and twenty. It must hang with the light on the left hand of it;and you may keep it if you please till I bring you the original. Butthen I must borrow it (for 'tis no more mine, if you like it), becausemy brother is often bringing people into my closet where it hangs, toshow them other pictures that are there; and if he miss this longthence, 'twould trouble his jealous head.You are not the first that has told me I knew better what quality Iwould not have in a husband than what I would; but it was morepardonable in them. I thought you had understood better what kind ofperson I liked than anybody else could possibly have done, and thereforedid not think it necessary to make you that description too. Those thatI reckoned up were only such as I could not be persuaded to have upon noterms, though I had never seen such a person in my life as Mr. Temple:not but that all those may make very good husbands to some women; butthey are so different from my humour that 'tis not possible we shouldever agree; for though it might be reasonably enough expected that Ishould conform mine to theirs (to my shame be it spoken), I could neverdo it. And I have lived so long in the world, and so much at my ownliberty, that whosoever has me must be content to take me as they findme, without hope of ever making me other than I am. I cannot so much asdisguise my humour. When it was designed that I should have had SirJus., my brother used to tell he was confident that, with all hiswisdom, any woman that had wit and discretion might make an ass of him,and govern him as she pleased. I could not deny that possibly it mightbe so, but 'twas that I was sure I could never do; and though 'tislikely I should have forced myself to so much compliance as wasnecessary for a reasonable wife, yet farther than that no design couldever have carried me; and I could not have flattered him into a beliefthat I admired him, to gain more than he and all his generation areworth.'Tis such an ease (as you say) not to be solicitous to please others: inearnest, I am no more concerned whether people think me handsome orill-favoured, whether they think I have wit or that I have none, than Iam whether they think my name Elizabeth or Dorothy. I would do nobody noinjury; but I should never design to please above one; and that one Imust love too, or else I should think it a trouble, and consequently notdo it. I have made a general confession to you; will you give meabsolution? Methinks you should; for you are not much better by your ownrelation; therefore 'tis easiest to forgive one another. When you hearanything from your father, remember that I am his humble servant, andmuch concerned in his good health.I am yours._Letter 38._--Lady Isabella is Lady Isabella Rich, my Lady Diana'seldest sister. She married Sir James Thynne. Many years ago she had anintrigue with the Duke of Ormond, by whom she had a son, but Dorothyspeaks, I think, of some later scandal than this.My Lady Pembroke was the daughter of the Earl of Cumberland. She firstmarried Richard Earl of Dorset, and afterwards the Earl of Pembroke. Sheis described as a woman whose mind was endowed by nature with veryextraordinary attributes. Lord Pembroke, on the other hand, according toClarendon, pretended to no other qualification "than to understandhorses and dogs very well, and to be believed honest and generous." Hisstables vied with palaces, and his falconry was furnished at immenseexpense; but in his private life he was characterized by grossignorance and vice, and his public character was marked by ingratitudeand instability. The life of Lady Pembroke was embittered by this manfor near twenty years, and she was at length compelled to separate fromhim. She lived alone, until her husband's death, which took place inJanuary 1650. One can understand that they were entirely unsuited toeach other, when Lady Pembroke in her Memorials is found to write thusof her husband: "He was no scholar, having passed but three or fourmonths at Oxford, when he was taken thence after his father's death. Hewas of quick apprehension, sharp understanding, very crafty withal; of adiscerning spirit, but a choleric nature, increased by the office heheld of Chamberlain to the King." Why, then, did the accomplished LadyAnne Clifford unite herself to so worthless a person? Does she notanswer this question for us when she writes that he was "the greatestnobleman in England"?It is of some interest to us to remember that Francis Osborne, Dorothy'suncle (her father's youngest brother), was Master of the Horse to thisgreat nobleman.Whether Lord and Lady Leicester were, as Dorothy says, "in greatdisorder" at this time, it is impossible to say. Lady Leicester is saidto have been of a warm and irritable temper, and Lord Leicester isdescribed by Clarendon as "staggering and irresolute in his nature."However, nothing is said of their quarrels; but, on the other hand,there is a very pathetic account in Lord Leicester's journal of hiswife's death in 1659, which shows that, whatever this "disorder" mayhave been, a complete reconciliation was afterwards effected.SIR,--You would have me say something of my coming. Alas! how fain Iwould have something to say, but I know no more than you saw in thatletter I sent you. How willingly would I tell you anything that Ithought would please you; but I confess I do not like to give uncertainhopes, because I do not care to receive them. And I thought there was noneed of saying I would be sure to take the first occasion, and that Iwaited with impatience for it, because I hoped you had believed all thatalready; and so you do, I am sure. Say what you will, you cannot butknow my heart enough to be assured that I wish myself with you, for myown sake as well as yours. 'Tis rather that you love to hear me say itoften, than that you doubt it; for I am no dissembler. I could not cryfor a husband that were indifferent to me (like your cousin); no, norfor a husband that I loved neither. I think 'twould break my heartsooner than make me shed a tear. 'Tis ordinary griefs that make me weep.In earnest, you cannot imagine how often I have been told that I had toomuch _franchise_ in my humour, and that 'twas a point of good breedingto disguise handsomely; but I answered still for myself, that 'twas notto be expected I should be exactly bred, that had never seen a Courtsince I was capable of anything. Yet I know so much,--that my LadyCarlisle would take it very ill if you should not let her get the pointof honour; 'tis all she aims at, to go beyond everybody in compliment.But are you not afraid of giving me a strong vanity with telling me Iwrite better than the most extraordinary person in the world? If I hadnot the sense to understand that the reason why you like my lettersbetter is only because they are kinder than hers, such a word might haveundone me.But my Lady Isabella, that speaks, and looks, and sings, and plays, andall so prettily, why cannot I say that she is free from faults as hersister believes her? No; I am afraid she is not, and sorry that thoseshe has are so generally known. My brother did not bring them for anexample; but I did, and made him confess she had better have married abeggar than that beast with all his estate. She cannot be excused; butcertainly they run a strange hazard that have such husbands as makesthem think they cannot be more undone, whatever course they take. Oh,'tis ten thousand pities! I remember she was the first woman that ever Itook notice of for extremely handsome; and, in earnest, she was then theloveliest lady that could be looked on, I think. But what should she dowith beauty now? Were I as she, I should hide myself from all the world;I should think all people that looked on me read it in my face anddespised me in their hearts; and at the same time they made me a leg, orspoke civilly to me, I should believe they did not think I deservedtheir respect. I'll tell you who he urged for an example though, my LordPembroke and my Lady, who, they say, are upon parting after all hispassion for her, and his marrying her against the consent of all hisfriends; but to that I answered, that though he pretended great kindnesshe had for her, I never heard of much she had for him, and knew shemarried him merely for advantage. Nor is she a woman of that discretionas to do all that might become her, when she must do it rather as thingsfit to be done than as things she inclined to. Besides that, what with aspleenatick side and a chemical head, he is but an odd body himself.But is it possible what they say, that my Lord Leicester and my Lady arein great disorder, and that after forty years' patience he has now takenup the cudgels and resolved to venture for the mastery? Methinks hewakes out of his long sleep like a froward child, that wrangles andfights with all that comes near it. They say he has turned away almostevery servant in the house, and left her at Penshurst to digest it asshe can.What an age do we live in, where 'tis a miracle if in ten couples thatare married, two of them live so as not to publish to the world thatthey cannot agree. I begin to be of your opinion of him that (when theRoman Church first propounded whether it were not convenient for priestsnot to marry) said that it might be convenient enough, but sure it wasnot our Saviour's intention, for He commanded that all should take uptheir cross and follow Him; and for his part, he was confident there wasno such cross as a wife. This is an ill doctrine for me to preach; butto my friends I cannot but confess that I am afraid much of the faultlies in us; for I have observed that formerly, in great families, themen seldom disagree, but the women are always scolding; and 'tis mostcertain, that let the husband be what he will, if the wife have butpatience (which, sure, becomes her best), the disorder cannot be greatenough to make a noise; his anger alone, when it meets with nothing thatresists it, cannot be loud enough to disturb the neighbours. And such awife may be said to do as a kinswoman of ours that had a husband who wasnot always himself; and when he was otherwise, his humour was to rise inthe night, and with two bedstaves labour on the table an hour together.She took care every night to lay a great cushion upon the table for himto strike on, that nobody might hear him, and so discover his madness.But 'tis a sad thing when all one's happiness is only that the worlddoes not know you are miserable.For my part, I think it were very convenient that all such as intend tomarry should live together in the same house some years of probation;and if, in all that time, they never disagreed, they should then bepermitted to marry if they please; but how few would do it then! I donot remember that I ever saw or heard of any couple that were bred up sotogether (as many you know are, that are designed for one another fromchildren), but they always disliked one another extremely; parted, if itwere left in their choice. If people proceeded with this caution, theworld would end sooner than is expected, I believe; and because, withall my wariness, 'tis not impossible but I may be caught, nor likelythat I should be wiser than anybody else, 'twere best, I think, that Isaid no more on this point.What would I give to know that sister of yours that is so good atdiscovering; sure she is excellent company; she has reason to laugh atyou when you would have persuaded her the "moss was sweet." I rememberJane brought some of it to me, to ask me if I thought it had no illsmell, and whether she might venture to put it in the box or not. I toldher as I thought, she could not put a more innocent thing there, for Idid not find it had any smell at all; besides, I was willing it shoulddo me some service in requital for the pains I had taken for it. Myniece and I wandered through some eight hundred acres of wood in searchof it, to make rocks and strange things that her head is full of, andshe admires it more than you did. If she had known I had consented itshould have been used to fill up a box, she would have condemned meextremely. I told Jane that you liked her present, and she, I find, isresolved to spoil your compliment, and make you confess at last thatthey are not worth the eating; she threatens to send you more, but youwould forgive her if you saw how she baits me every day to go to London;all that I can say will not satisfy her. When I urge (as 'tis true) thatthere is a necessity of my stay here, she grows furious, cries you willdie with melancholy, and confounds me so with stories of yourill-humour, that I'll swear I think I should go merely to be at quiet,if it were possible, though there were no other reason for it. But Ihope 'tis not so ill as she would have me believe it, though I know yourhumour is strangely altered from what it was, and am sorry to see it.Melancholy must needs do you more hurt than to another to whom it may benatural, as I think it is to me; therefore if you loved me you wouldtake heed on't. Can you believe that you are dearer to me than the wholeworld beside, and yet neglect yourself? If you do not, you wrong aperfect friendship; and if you do, you must consider my interest in you,and preserve yourself to make me happy. Promise me this, or I shallhaunt you worse than she does me. Scribble how you please, so you makeyour letter long enough; you see I give you good example; besides, I canassure you we do perfectly agree if you receive not satisfaction butfrom my letters, I have none but what yours give me._Letter 39._--Dorothy has been in London since her last letter, butunfortunately she has either not met with Temple, or he has left townsuddenly whilst she was there, on some unexplained errand. This wouldtherefore seem a natural place to begin a new chapter; but as we havevery shortly to come to a series of unhappy letters, quite distinct intheir character from these, I have thought fit to place in this longchapter yet a few more letters after Dorothy's autumn visit to London.Stephen Marshall was, like Hugh Peters, one of those preachers who wasable to exchange the obscurity of a country parish for the public fameof a London pulpit, by reason of a certain gift of rhetorical power,the value of which it is impossible to estimate to-day. Such of hissermons as are still extant are prosy, long-winded, dogmaticabsurdities, overloaded with periphrastic illustrations in scripturallanguage. They are meaningless to a degree, which would make one wonderat the docility and patience of a seventeenth century congregation, ifone had not witnessed a similar spirit in congregations of to-day.There is no honest biography of Stephen Marshall. In the news-books andtracts of the day we find references to sermons preached by him, bycommand, before the Army of the Parliament, and we have reprints of someof these. I have searched in vain to find the sermon which Dorothyheard, but it was probably not a sermon given on any great occasion, andwe may believe it was never printed. There is an amusing scandaloustract, called the _Life and Death of Stephen Marshall_, which is so fullof "evil speaking, lying, and slandering," as to be quite unworthy ofquotation. From this we may take it, however, that he was born atGormanchester, in Cromwell's county, was educated at Emmanuel College,Cambridge, and that before he came to London his chief cure of souls wasat Finchingfield in Essex. These, and the records of his Londonpreaching, are the only facts in his life's history which have come tomy notice.My Lord Whitelocke did go to Sweden, as Dorothy surmises; setting sailfrom Plymouth with one hundred honest men, on October 26, 1653, or verysoon afterwards, as one may read in his journal of the progress of theEmbassy. That he should fill this office, appears to have been proposedto him by Cromwell in September of this year.An Act of Parliament to abolish the Chancery was indeed passed in theAugust of this year. Well may Lord Keble sore lament, and the rest ofthe world rejoice, at such news. Joseph Keble was a well-known lawreporter, a son of Serjeant Richard Keble. He was a Fellow of All Souls,and a Bencher of Gray's Inn; and, furthermore, was one of the LordsCommissioners of the Great Seal from 1648-1654. There was "some debate,"says Whitelocke, "whether they should be styled 'Commissioners' or'Lords Commissioners,'" and though the word _Lords_ was far lessacceptable at this time than formerly, yet that they might not seem tolessen their own authority, nor the honour of their office constitutedby them, they voted the title to be "Lords Commissioners."SIR,--If want of kindness were the only crime I exempted from pardon,'twas not that I had the least apprehension you could be guilty of it;but to show you (by excepting only an impossible thing) that I exceptednothing. No, in earnest, I can fancy no such thing of you, or if Icould, the quarrel would be to myself; I should never forgive my ownfolly that let me to choose a friend that could be false. But I'll leavethis (which is not much to the purpose) and tell you how, with my usualimpatience, I expected your letter, and how cold it went to my heart tosee it so short a one. 'Twas so great a pain to me that I am resolv'dyou shall not feel it; nor can I in justice punish you for a faultunwillingly committed. If I were your enemy, I could not use you illwhen I saw Fortune do it too, and in gallantry and good nature both, Ishould think myself rather obliged to protect you from her injury (if itlay in my power) than double them upon you. These things considered, Ibelieve this letter will be longer than ordinary,--kinder I think itcannot be. I always speak my heart to you; and that is so much yourfriend, it never furnishes me with anything to your disadvantage. I amglad you are an admirer of Telesile as well as I; in my opinion 'tis afine Lady, but I know you will pity poor Amestris strongly when you haveread her story. I'll swear I cried for her when I read it first, thoughshe were but an imaginary person; and, sure, if anything of that kindcan deserve it, her misfortunes may.God forgive me, I was as near laughing yesterday where I should not.Would you believe that I had the grace to go hear a sermon upon a weekday? In earnest, 'tis true; a Mr. Marshall was the man that preached,but never anybody was so defeated. He is so famed that I expected rarethings of him, and seriously I listened to him as if he had been St.Paul; and what do you think he told us? Why, that if there were nokings, no queens, no lords, no ladies, nor gentlemen, nor gentlewomen,in the world, 'twould be no loss to God Almighty at all. This we hadover some forty times, which made me remember it whether I would or not.The rest was much at this rate, interlarded with the prettiest oddphrases, that I had the most ado to look soberly enough for the place Iwas in that ever I had in my life. He does not preach so always, sure?If he does, I cannot believe his sermons will do much towards bringinganybody to heaven more than by exercising their patience. Yet, I'll saythat for him, he stood stoutly for tithes, though, in my opinion, fewdeserve them less than he; and it may be he would be better withoutthem.Yet you are not convinced, you say, that to be miserable is the way tobe good; to some natures I think it is not, but there are many of socareless and vain a temper, that the least breath of good fortune swellsthem with so much pride, that if they were not put in mind sometimes bya sound cross or two that they are mortal, they would hardly think itpossible; and though 'tis a sign of a servile nature when fear producesmore of reverence in us than love, yet there is more danger offorgetting oneself in a prosperous fortune than in the contrary, andaffliction may be the surest (though not the pleasantest) guide toheaven. What think you, might not I preach with Mr. Marshall for awager? But you could fancy a perfect happiness here, you say; that isnot much, many people do so; but I never heard of anybody that ever hadit more than in fancy, so that will not be strange if you should misson't. One may be happy to a good degree, I think, in a faithful friend,a moderate fortune, and a retired life; further than this I know nothingto wish; but if there be anything beyond it, I wish it you.You did not tell me what carried you out of town in such haste. I hopethe occasion was good, you must account to me for all that I lost by it.I shall expect a whole packet next week. Oh, me! I have forgot this onceor twice to tell you, that if it be no inconvenience to you, I couldwish you would change the place of direction for my letters. Certainlythat Jones knows my name, I bespoke a saddle of him once, and though itbe a good while agone, yet I was so often with him about it,--havingmuch ado to make him understand how I would have it, it being of afashion he had never seen, though, sure, it be common,--that I amconfident he has not forgot me. Besides that, upon it he got mybrother's custom; and I cannot tell whether he does not use the shopstill. Jane presents her humble service to you, and has sent yousomething in a box; 'tis hard to imagine what she can find here topresent you withal, and I am much in doubt whether you will not pay toodear for it if you discharge the carriage. 'Tis a pretty freedom shetakes, but you may thank yourself; she thinks because you call herfellow-servant, she may use you accordingly. I bred her better, but youhave spoiled her.Is it true that my Lord Whitlocke goes Ambassador where my Lord Lisleshould have gone? I know not how he may appear in a Swedish Court, buthe was never meant for a courtier at home, I believe. Yet 'tis agracious Prince; he is often in this country, and always does us thefavour to send for his fruit hither. He was making a purchase of one ofthe best houses in the county. I know not whether he goes on with it;but 'tis such a one as will not become anything less than a lord. Andthere is a talk as if the Chancery were going down; if so, his titlegoes with it, I think. 'Twill be sad news for my Lord Keble's son; hewill have nothing left to say when "my Lord, my father," is taken fromhim. Were it not better that I had nothing to say neither, than that Ishould entertain you with such senseless things. I hope I am halfasleep, nothing else can excuse me; if I were quite asleep, I should sayfine things to you; I often dream I do; but perhaps if I could rememberthem they are no wiser than my wakening discourses. Good-night._Letter 40._--A letter has been lost; whether Harrold or Collins, thetwo carriers, were either or both of them guilty of carelessness in thedelivery of these letters, it is quite impossible to say now. Dorothyseems to think Harrold delivered the letter, and it was mislaid inLondon. Perhaps it was this letter, and what was written about it, thatcaused all those latent feelings of despair and discontent to awaken inthe breasts of the two lovers. Was this the spark that loneliness andabsence fanned into flame? You shall judge for yourself, reader, in thenext chapter.SIR,--That you may be at more certainty hereafter what to think, let metell you that nothing could hinder me from writing to you (as well formy own satisfaction as yours) but an impossibility of doing it; nothingbut death or a dead palsy in my hands, or something that had the sameeffect. I did write it, and gave it Harrold, but by an accident hishorse fell lame, so that he could not set out on Monday; but on Tuesdayhe did come to town; on Wednesday, carried the letter himself (as hetells me) where 'twas directed, which was to Mr. Copyn in Fleet Street.'Twas the first time I made use of that direction; no matter and I hadnot done it then, since it proves no better. Harrold came late home onThursday night with such an account as your boy gave you: that comingout of town the same day he came in, he had been at Fleet Street again,but there was no letter for him. I was sorry, but I did not much wonderat it because he gave so little time, and resolved to make my best ofthat I had by Collins. I read it over often enough to make it equal withthe longest letter that ever was writ, and pleased myself, in earnest(as much as it was possible for me in the humour I was in), to think howby that time you had asked me pardon for the little reproaches you hadmade me, and that the kindness and length of my letter had made youamends for the trouble it had given you in expecting it. But I am not alittle annoyed to find you had it not. I am very confident it wasdelivered, and therefore you must search where the fault lies.Were it not that you had suffered too much already, I would complain alittle of you. Why should you think me so careless of anything that youwere concerned in, as to doubt that I had writ? Though I had receivednone from you, I should not have taken that occasion to revenge myself.Nay, I should have concluded you innocent, and have imagined a thousandways how it might happen, rather than have suspected your want ofkindness. Why should not you be as just to me? But I will not chide, itmay be (as long as we have been friends) you do not know me so well yetas to make an absolute judgment of me; but if I know myself at all, if Iam capable of being anything, 'tis a perfect friend. Yet I must chidetoo. Why did you get such a cold? Good God! how careless you are of alife that (by your own confession) I have told you makes all thehappiness of mine. 'Tis unkindly done. What is left for me to say, whenthat will not prevail with you; or how can you persuade me to a cure ofmyself, when you refuse to give me the example? I have nothing in theworld that gives me the least desire of preserving myself, but theopinion I have you would not be willing to lose me; and yet, if you sawwith what caution I live (at least to what I did before), you wouldreproach it to yourself sometimes, and might grant, perhaps, that youhave not got the advantage of me in friendship so much as you imagine.What (besides your consideration) could oblige me to live and lose allthe rest of my friends thus one after another? Sure I am not insensiblenor very ill-natured, and yet I'll swear I think I do not afflict myselfhalf so much as another would do that had my losses. I pay nothing ofsadness to the memory of my poor brother, but I presently disperse itwith thinking what I owe in thankfulness that 'tis not you I mourn for.Well, give me no more occasions to complain of you, you know not whatmay follow. Here was Mr. Freeman yesterday that made me a very kindvisit, and said so many fine things to me, that I was confounded withhis civilities, and had nothing to say for myself. I could have wishedthen that he had considered me less and my niece more; but if youcontinue to use me thus, in earnest, I'll not be so much her friendhereafter. Methinks I see you laugh at all my threatenings; and notwithout reason. Mr. Freeman, you believe, is designed for somebody thatdeserves him better. I think so too, and am not sorry for it; and youhave reason to believe I never can be other thanYour faithful friend.CHAPTER IVDESPONDENCY. CHRISTMAS 1653This chapter of letters is a sad note, sounding out from among itsfellows with mournful clearness. There had seemed a doubt whether allthese letters must be regarded as of one series, or whether, morecorrectly, it was to be assumed that Dorothy and Temple had theirlovers' quarrels, for the well-understood pleasure of kissing friendsagain. But you will agree that these lovers were not altogether as otherlovers are, that their troubles were too real and too many for theirlove to need the stimulus of constant April shower quarrels; and theseletters are very serious in their sadness, imprinting themselves in themind after constant reading as landmarks clearly defining the course andprogress of an unusual event in these lovers' history--amisunderstanding.The letters are written at Christmastide, 1653. Dorothy had returnedfrom London to Chicksands, and either had not seen Temple or he had leftLondon hurriedly whilst she was there. There is a letter lost. Dorothy'syoungest brother is lately dead; her niece has left her; her companionJane is sick; her father, growing daily weaker and weaker, was sinkinginto his grave before her eyes. No bright chance seemed to open beforeher, and their marriage seemed an impossibility. For a moment she losesfaith, not in Temple, but in fortune; faith once gone, hope, missing hercomrade, flies away in search of her. She is alone in the old house withher dying father, and with her brother pouring his unkind gossip intoher unwilling ear, whilst the sad long year draws slowly to its close,and there is no sign of better fortune for the lovers; can we wonder,then, that Dorothy, lonely and unaided, pacing in the damp gardenbeneath the bare trees, with all the bright summer changed into decay,lost faith and hope?Temple, when Dorothy's thoughts reach him, must have replied with someimpatience. There are stories, too, set about concerning her good nameby one Mr. B., to disturb Temple. Temple can hardly have given credenceto these, but he may have complained of them to Dorothy, who is led todeclare, "I am the most unfortunate woman breathing, but I was neverfalse," though she forgives her lover "all those strange thoughts he hashad" of her. Whatever were the causes of the quarrel, or rather thedespondency, we shall never know accurately. Dorothy was not the womanto vapour for months about "an early and a quiet grave." When she writesthis it is written in the deepest earnest of despair; when this mood isover it is over for ever, and we emerge into a clear atmosphere of hopeand content. The despondency has been agonizing, but the agony is sharpand rapid, and gives place to the wisdom of hope.Temple now comes to Chicksands at an early date. There is a newinterchange of vows. Never again will their faith be shaken by frettingand despair; and these vows are never broken, but remain with the loversuntil they are set aside by others, taken under the solemn sanction ofthe law, and the old troubles vanish in new responsibilities and a newlife._Letter 41._--Lady Anne Blunt was a daughter of the Earl of Newport. Hermother had turned Catholic in 1637, which had led to an estrangementbetween her and her husband, and we may conclude poor Lady Anne had byno means a happy home. There are two scandals connected with her name.She appears to have run away with one William Blunt,--the "Mr. Blunt"mentioned by Dorothy in her next letter; and on April 18, 1654, shepetitioned the Protector to issue a special commission upon her wholecase. Mr. Blunt pretended that she was contracted to him for the sake,it is said, of gaining money thereby. There being no Bishop's Court atthis time, there are legal difficulties in the way, and we never hearthe result of the petition. Again, in February 1655, one Mr. Porterfinds himself committed to Lambeth House for carrying away the Lady AnneBlunt, and endeavouring to marry her without her father's consent.SIR,--Having tired myself with thinking, I mean to weary you withreading, and revenge myself that way for all the unquiet thoughts youhave given me. But I intended this a sober letter, and therefore, _sansraillerie_, let me tell you, I have seriously considered all ourmisfortunes, and can see no end of them but by submitting to that whichwe cannot avoid, and by yielding to it break the force of a blow whichif resisted brings a certain ruin. I think I need not tell you how dearyou have been to me, nor that in your kindness I placed all thesatisfaction of my life; 'twas the only happiness I proposed to myself,and had set my heart so much upon it that it was therefore made mypunishment, to let me see that, how innocent soever I thought myaffection, it was guilty in being greater than is allowable for thingsof this world. 'Tis not a melancholy humour gives me these apprehensionsand inclinations, nor the persuasions of others; 'tis the result of along strife with myself, before my reason could overcome my passion, orbring me to a perfect resignation to whatsoever is allotted for me. 'Tisnow done, I hope, and I have nothing left but to persuade you to that,which I assure myself your own judgment will approve in the end, andyour reason has often prevailed with you to offer; that which you wouldhave done then out of kindness to me and point of honour, I would haveyou do now out of wisdom and kindness to yourself. Not that I woulddisclaim my part in it or lessen my obligation to you, no, I am yourfriend as much as ever I was in my life, I think more, and I am sure Ishall never be less. I have known you long enough to discern that youhave all the qualities that make an excellent friend, and I shallendeavour to deserve that you may be so to me; but I would have you dothis upon the justest grounds, and such as may conduce most to yourquiet and future satisfaction. When we have tried all ways to happiness,there is no such thing to be found but in a mind conformed to one'scondition, whatever it be, and in not aiming at anything that is eitherimpossible or improbable; all the rest is but vanity and vexation ofspirit, and I durst pronounce it so from that little knowledge I havehad of the world, though I had not Scripture for my warrant. Theshepherd that bragged to the traveller, who asked him, "What weather itwas like to be?" that it should be what weather pleased him, and made itgood by saying it should be what weather pleased God, and what pleasedGod should please him, said an excellent thing in such language, andknew enough to make him the happiest person in the world if he made aright use on't. There can be no pleasure in a struggling life, and thatfolly which we condemn in an ambitious man, that's ever labouring forthat which is hardly got and more uncertainly kept, is seen in allaccording to their several humours; in some 'tis covetousness, in otherspride, in some stubbornness of nature that chooses always to go againstthe tide, and in others an unfortunate fancy to things that are inthemselves innocent till we make them otherwise by desiring them toomuch. Of this sort you and I are, I think; we have lived hitherto uponhopes so airy that I have often wondered how they could support theweight of our misfortunes; but passion gives a strength above nature, wesee it in mad people; and, not to flatter ourselves, ours is but arefined degree of madness. What can it be else to be lost to all thingsin the world but that single object that takes up one's fancy, to loseall the quiet and repose of one's life in hunting after it, when thereis so little likelihood of ever gaining it, and so many more probableaccidents that will infallibly make us miss on't? And which is more thanall, 'tis being mastered by that which reason and religion teaches us togovern, and in that only gives us a pre-eminence over beasts. This,soberly consider'd, is enough to let us see our error, and consequentlyto persuade us to redeem it. To another person, I should justify myselfthat 'tis not a lightness in my nature, nor any interest that is notcommon to us both, that has wrought this change in me. To you that knowmy heart, and from whom I shall never hide it, to whom a thousandtestimonies of my kindness can witness the reality of it, and whosefriendship is not built upon common grounds, I have no more to say butthat I impose not my opinions upon you, and that I had rather you tookthem up as your own choice than upon my entreaty. But if, as we have notdiffered in anything else, we could agree in this too, and resolve upona friendship that will be much the perfecter for having nothing ofpassion in it, how happy might we be without so much as a fear of thechange that any accident could bring. We might defy all that fortunecould do, and putting off all disguise and constraint, with that whichonly made it necessary, make our lives as easy to us as the condition ofthis world will permit. I may own you as a person that I extremely valueand esteem, and for whom I have a particular friendship, and you mayconsider me as one that will always beYour faithful.This was written when I expected a letter from you, how came I to missit? I thought at first it might be the carrier's fault in changing histime without giving notice, but he assures me he did, to Nan. Mybrother's groom came down to-day, too, and saw her, he tells me, butbrings me nothing from her; if nothing of ill be the cause, I amcontented. You hear the noise my Lady Anne Blunt has made with hermarrying? I am so weary with meeting it in all places where I go; fromwhat is she fallen! they talked but the week before that she should havemy Lord of Strafford. Did you not intend to write to me when you writ toJane? That bit of paper did me great service; without it I should havehad strange apprehension, and my sad dreams, and the several frights Ihave waked in, would have run so in my head that I should have concludedsomething of very ill from your silence. Poor Jane is sick, but she willwrite, she says, if she can. Did you send the last part of _Cyrus_ toMr. Hollingsworth?_Letter 42._SIR,--I am extremely sorry that your letter miscarried, but I amconfident my brother has it not. As cunning as he is, he could not hidefrom me, but that I should discover it some way or other. No; he washere, and both his men, when this letter should have come, and not oneof them stirred out that day; indeed, the next day they went all toLondon. The note you writ to Jane came in one of Nan's, by Collins, butnothing else; it must be lost by the porter that was sent with it, and'twas very unhappy that there should be anything in it of moreconsequence than ordinary; it may be numbered amongst the rest of ourmisfortunes, all which an inconsiderate passion has occasioned. You mustpardon me I cannot be reconciled to it, it has been the ruin of us both.'Tis true that nobody must imagine to themselves ever to be absolutemaster on't, but there is great difference betwixt that and yielding toit, between striving with it and soothing it up till it grows too strongfor one. Can I remember how ignorantly and innocently I suffered it tosteal upon me by degrees; how under a mask of friendship I cozenedmyself into that which, had it appeared to me at first in its trueshape, I had feared and shunned? Can I discern that it has made thetrouble of your life, and cast a cloud upon mine, that will help tocover me in my grave? Can I know that it wrought so upon us both as tomake neither of us friends to one another, but agree in running wildlyto our own destruction, and that perhaps of some innocent persons whomight live to curse our folly that gave them so miserable a being? Ah!if you love yourself or me, you must confess that I have reason tocondemn this senseless passion; that wheresoe'er it comes destroys allthat entertain it; nothing of judgment or discretion can live with it,and it puts everything else out of order before it can find a place foritself. What has it brought my poor Lady Anne Blunt to? She is the talkof all the footmen and boys in the street, and will be company for themshortly, and yet is so blinded by her passion as not at all to perceivethe misery she has brought herself to; and this fond love of hers has sorooted all sense of nature out of her heart, that, they say, she is nomore moved than a statue with the affliction of a father and mother thatdoted on her, and had placed the comfort of their lives in herpreferment. With all this is it not manifest to the whole world that Mr.Blunt could not consider anything in this action but his own interest,and that he makes her a very ill return for all her kindness; if he hadloved her truly he would have died rather than have been the occasion ofthis misfortune to her. My cousin Franklin (as you observe very well)may say fine things now she is warm in Moor Park, but she is very muchaltered in her opinions since her marriage, if these be her own. Sheleft a gentleman, that I could name, whom she had much more of kindnessfor than ever she had for Mr. Franklin, because his estate was less; andupon the discovery of some letters that her mother intercepted, sufferedherself to be persuaded that twenty-three hundred pound a year wasbetter than twelve hundred, though with a person she loved; and hasrecovered it so well, that you see she confesses there is nothing in hercondition she desires to alter at the charge of a wish. She's happier bymuch than I shall ever be, but I do not envy her; may she long enjoy it,and I an early and a quiet grave, free from the trouble of this busyworld, where all with passion pursue their own interests at theirneighbour's charges; where nobody is pleased but somebody complainson't; and where 'tis impossible to be without giving and receivinginjuries.You would know what I would be at, and how I intend to dispose ofmyself. Alas! were I in my own disposal, you should come to my grave tobe resolved; but grief alone will not kill. All that I can say, then, isthat I resolve on nothing but to arm myself with patience, to resistnothing that is laid upon me, nor struggle for what I have no hope toget. I have no ends nor no designs, nor will my heart ever be capable ofany; but like a country wasted by a civil war, where two opposingparties have disputed their right so long till they have made it worthneither of their conquests, 'tis ruined and desolated by the long strifewithin it to that degree as 'twill be useful to none,--nobody that knowsthe condition 'tis in will think it worth the gaining, and I shall nottrouble anybody with it. No, really, if I may be permitted to desireanything, it shall be only that I may injure nobody but myself,--I canbear anything that reflects only upon me; or, if I cannot, I can die;but I would fain die innocent, that I might hope to be happy in the nextworld, though never in this. I take it a little ill that you shouldconjure me by anything, with a belief that 'tis more powerful with methan your kindness. No, assure yourself what that alone cannot gain willbe denied to all the world. You would see me, you say? You may do so ifyou please, though I know not to what end. You deceive yourself if youthink it would prevail upon me to alter my intentions; besides, I canmake no contrivances; it must be here, and I must endure the noise itwill make, and undergo the censures of a people that choose ever to givethe worst interpretation that anything will bear. Yet if it can be anyease to you to make me more miserable than I am, never spare me;consider yourself only, and not me at all,--'tis no more than I deservefor not accepting what you offered me whilst 'twas in your power to makeit good, as you say it then was. You were prepared, it seems, but I wassurprised, I confess. 'Twas a kind fault though; and you may pardon itwith more reason than I have to forgive it myself. And let me tell youthis, too, as lost and as wretched as I am, I have still some sense ofmy reputation left in me,--I find that to my cost,--I shall attempt topreserve it as clear as I can; and to do that, I must, if you see methus, make it the last of our interviews. What can excuse me if I shouldentertain any person that is known to pretend to me, when I can have nohope of ever marrying him? And what hope can I have of that when thefortune that can only make it possible to me depends upon a thousandaccidents and contingencies, the uncertainty of the place 'tis in, andthe government it may fall under, your father's life or his success, hisdisposal of himself and of his fortune, besides the time that mustnecessarily be required to produce all this, and the changes that mayprobably bring with it, which 'tis impossible for us to foresee? Allthis considered, what have I to say for myself when people shall ask,what 'tis I expect? Can there be anything vainer than such a hope uponsuch grounds? You must needs see the folly on't yourself, and thereforeexamine your own heart what 'tis fit for me to do, and what you can dofor a person you love, and that deserves your compassion if nothingelse,--a person that will always have an inviolable friendship for you,a friendship that shall take up all the room my passion held in myheart, and govern there as master, till death come and take possessionand turn it out.Why should you make an impossibility where there is none? A thousandaccidents might have taken me from you, and you must have borne it. Whywould not your own resolution work as much upon you as necessity andtime does infallibly upon people? Your father would take it very ill, Ibelieve, if you should pretend to love me better than he did my Lady,yet she is dead and he lives, and perhaps may do to love again. There isa gentlewoman in this country that loved so passionately for six orseven years that her friends, who kept her from marrying, fearing herdeath, consented to it; and within half a year her husband died, whichafflicted her so strongly nobody thought she would have lived. She sawno light but candles in three years, nor came abroad in five; and nowthat 'tis some nine years past, she is passionately taken again withanother, and how long she has been so nobody knows but herself. This isto let you see 'tis not impossible what I ask, nor unreasonable. Thinkon't, and attempt it at least; but do it sincerely, and do not help yourpassion to master you. As you have ever loved me do this.The carrier shall bring your letters to Suffolk House to Jones. I shalllong to hear from you; but if you should deny the only hope that's leftme, I must beg you will defer it till Christmas Day be past; for, todeal freely with you, I have some devotions to perform then, which mustnot be disturbed with anything, and nothing is like to do it as sosensible an affliction. Adieu._Letter 43._SIR,--I can say little more than I did,--I am convinced of the vilenessof the world and all that's in it, and that I deceived myself extremelywhen I expected anything of comfort from it. No, I have no more to doin't but to grow every day more and more weary of it, if it be possiblethat I have not yet reached the highest degree of hatred for it. But Ithank God I hate nothing else but the base world, and the vices thatmake a part of it. I am in perfect charity with my enemies, and havecompassion for all people's misfortunes as well as for my own,especially for those I may have caused; and I may truly say I bear myshare of such. But as nothing obliges me to relieve a person that is inextreme want till I change conditions with him and come to be where hebegan, and that I may be thought compassionate if I do all that I canwithout prejudicing myself too much, so let me tell you, that if I couldhelp it, I would not love you, and that as long as I live I shall striveagainst it as against that which had been my ruin, and was certainlysent me as a punishment for my sin. But I shall always have a sense ofyour misfortunes, equal, if not above, my own. I shall pray that you mayobtain a quiet I never hope for but in my grave, and I shall neverchange my condition but with my life. Yet let not this give you a hope.Nothing ever can persuade me to enter the world again. I shall, in ashort time, have disengaged myself of all my little affairs in it, andsettled myself in a condition to apprehend nothing but too long a life,therefore I wish you would forget me; and to induce you to it, let metell you freely that I deserve you should. If I remember anybody, 'tisagainst my will. I am possessed with that strange insensibility that mynearest relations have no tie upon me, and I find myself no moreconcerned in those that I have heretofore had great tenderness ofaffection for, than in my kindred that died long before I was born.Leave me to this, and seek a better fortune. I beg it of you as heartilyas I forgive you all those strange thoughts you have had of me. Think meso still if that will do anything towards it. For God's sake do take anycourse that may make you happy; or, if that cannot be, less unfortunateat least thanYour friend and humble servant,D. OSBORNE.I can hear nothing of that letter, but I hear from all people that Iknow, part of my unhappy story, and from some that I do not know. Alady, whose face I never saw, sent it me as news she had out of Ireland._Letter 44._SIR,--If you have ever loved me, do not refuse the last request I shallever make you; 'tis to preserve yourself from the violence of yourpassion. Vent it all upon me; call me and think me what you please; makeme, if it be possible, more wretched than I am. I'll bear it all withoutthe least murmur. Nay, I deserve it all, for had you never seen me youhad certainly been happy. 'Tis my misfortunes only that have thatinfectious quality as to strike at the same time me and all that's dearto me. I am the most unfortunate woman breathing, but I was never false.No; I call heaven to witness that if my life could satisfy for the leastinjury my fortune has done you (I cannot say 'twas I that did them you),I would lay it down with greater joy than any person ever received acrown; and if I ever forget what I owe you, or ever entertained athought of kindness for any person in the world besides, may I live along and miserable life. 'Tis the greatest curse I can invent; if therebe a greater, may I feel it. This is all I can say. Tell me if it bepossible I can do anything for you, and tell me how I may deserve yourpardon for all the trouble I have given you. I would not die without it.[Directed.] For Mr. Temple._Letter 45._SIR,--'Tis most true what you say, that few have what they merit; if itwere otherwise, you would be happy, I think, but then I should be sotoo, and that must not be,--a false and an inconstant person cannotmerit it, I am sure. You are kind in your good wishes, but I aim at nofriends nor no princes, the honour would be lost upon me; I shouldbecome a crown so ill, there would be no striving for it after me, and,sure, I should not wear it long. Your letter was a much greater loss tome than that of Henry Cromwell, and, therefore, 'tis that with all mycare and diligence I cannot inquire it out. You will not complain, Ibelieve, of the shortness of my last, whatever else you dislike in it,and if I spare you at any time 'tis because I cannot but imagine, sinceI am so wearisome to myself, that I must needs be so to everybody else,though, at present, I have other occasions that will not permit this tobe a long one. I am sorry it should be only in my power to make a friendmiserable, and that where I have so great a kindness I should do sogreat injuries; but 'tis my fortune, and I must bear it; 'twill be noneto you, I hope, to pray for you, nor to desire that you would (allpassion laid aside) freely tell me my faults, that I may, at least, askyour forgiveness where 'tis not in my power to make you bettersatisfaction. I would fain make even with all the world, and be out ofdanger of dying in anybody's debt; then I have nothing more to do in itbut to expect when I shall be so happy as to leave it, and always toremember that my misfortune makes all my faults towards you, and that myfaults to God make all my misfortunes.Your unhappy._Letter 46._SIR,--That which I writ by your boy was in so much haste and distractionas I cannot be satisfied with it, nor believe it has expressed mythoughts as I meant them. No, I find it is not easily done at moreleisure, and I am yet to seek what to say that is not too little nor toomuch. I would fain let you see that I am extremely sensible of youraffliction, that I would lay down my life to redeem you from it, butthat's a mean expression; my life is of so little value that I will notmention it. No, let it be rather what, in earnest, if I can tellanything I have left that is considerable enough to expose for it, itmust be that small reputation I have amongst my friends, that's all mywealth, and that I could part with to restore you to that quiet youlived in when I first knew you. But, on the other side, I would not giveyou hopes of that I cannot do. If I loved you less I would allow you tobe the same person to me, and I would be the same to you as heretofore.But to deal freely with you, that were to betray myself, and I find thatmy passion would quickly be my master again if I gave it any liberty. Iam not secure that it would not make me do the most extravagant thingsin the world, and I shall be forced to keep a continual war alive withit as long as there are any remainders of it left;--I think I might aswell have said as long as I lived. Why should you give yourself over sounreasonably to it? Good God! no woman breathing can deserve half thetrouble you give yourself. If I were yours from this minute I could notrecompense what you have suffered from the violence of your passion,though I were all that you can imagine me, when, God knows, I am aninconsiderable person, born to a thousand misfortunes, which have takenaway all sense of anything else from me, and left me a walking miseryonly. I do from my soul forgive you all the injuries your passion hasdone me, though, let me tell you, I was much more at my ease whilst Iwas angry. Scorn and despite would have cured me in some reasonabletime, which I despair of now. However, I am not displeased with it, and,if it may be of any advantage to you, I shall not consider myself in it;but let me beg, then, that you will leave off those dismal thoughts. Itremble at the desperate things you say in your letter; for the love ofGod, consider seriously with yourself what can enter into comparisonwith the safety of your soul. Are a thousand women, or ten thousandworlds, worth it? No, you cannot have so little reason left as youpretend, nor so little religion. For God's sake let us not neglect whatcan only make us happy for trifles. If God had seen it fit to havesatisfied our desires we should have had them, and everything would nothave conspired thus to have crossed them. Since He has decreed itotherwise (at least as far as we are able to judge by events), we mustsubmit, and not by striving make an innocent passion a sin, and show achildish stubbornness.I could say a thousand things more to this purpose if I were not inhaste to send this away,--that it may come to you, at least, as soon asthe other. Adieu.I cannot imagine who this should be that Mr. Dr. meant, and am inclinedto believe 'twas a story meant to disturb you, though perhaps not byhim._Letter 47._SIR,--'Tis never my humour to do injuries, nor was this meant as any toyou. No, in earnest, if I could have persuaded you to have quitted apassion that injures you, I had done an act of real friendship, and youmight have lived to thank me for it; but since it cannot be, I willattempt it no more. I have laid before you the inconveniences it bringsalong, how certain the trouble is, and how uncertain the reward; howmany accidents may hinder us from ever being happy, and how few thereare (and those so unlikely) to make up our desire. All this makes noimpression on you; you are still resolved to follow your blind guide,and I to pity where I cannot help. It will not be amiss though to letyou see that what I did was merely in consideration of your interest,and not at all of my own, that you may judge of me accordingly; and, todo that, I must tell you that, unless it were after the receipt of thoseletters that made me angry, I never had the least hope of wearing out mypassion, nor, to say truth, much desire. For to what purpose should Ihave strived against it? 'Twas innocent enough in me that resolved neverto marry, and would have kept me company in this solitary place as longas I lived, without being a trouble to myself or anybody else. Nay, inearnest, if I could have hoped you would be so much your own friend asto seek out a happiness in some other person, nothing under heaven couldhave satisfied me like entertaining myself with the thought of havingdone you service in diverting you from a troublesome pursuit of what isso uncertain, and by that giving you the occasion of a better fortune.Otherwise, whether you loved me still, or whether you did not, wasequally the same to me, your interest set aside. I will not reproach youhow ill an interpretation you made of this, because we will have no morequarrels. On the contrary, because I see 'tis in vain to think of curingyou, I'll study only to give you what ease I can, and leave the rest tobetter physicians,--to time and fortune. Here, then, I declare that youhave still the same power in my heart that I gave you at our lastparting; that I will never marry any other; and that if ever ourfortunes will allow us to marry, you shall dispose of me as you please;but this, to deal freely with you, I do not hope for. No; 'tis too greata happiness, and I, that know myself best, must acknowledge I deservecrosses and afflictions, but can never merit such a blessing. You know'tis not a fear of want that frights me. I thank God I never distrustedHis providence, nor I hope never shall, and without attributing anythingto myself, I may acknowledge He has given me a mind that can besatisfied with as narrow a compass as that of any person living of myrank. But I confess that I have an humour will not suffer me to exposemyself to people's scorn. The name of love is grown so contemptible bythe folly of such as have falsely pretended to it, and so many giddypeople have married upon that score and repented so shamefullyafterwards, that nobody can do anything that tends towards it withoutbeing esteemed a ridiculous person. Now, as my young Lady Holland says,I never pretended to wit in my life, but I cannot be satisfied that theworld should think me a fool, so that all I can do for you will be topreserve a constant kindness for you, which nothing shall ever alter ordiminish; I'll never give you any more alarms, by going about topersuade you against that you have for me; but from this hour we'll livequietly, no more fears, no more jealousies; the wealth of the wholeworld, by the grace of God, shall not tempt me to break my word withyou, nor the importunity of all my friends I have. Keep this as atestimony against me if ever I do, and make me a reproach to them by it;therefore be secure, and rest satisfied with what I can do for you.You should come hither but that I expect my brother every day; not butthat he designed a longer stay when he went, but since he keeps hishorses with him 'tis an infallible token that he is coming. We cannotmiss fitter times than this twenty in a year, and I shall be as ready togive you notice of such as you can be to desire it, only you would do mea great pleasure if you could forbear writing, unless it were sometimeson great occasions. This is a strange request for me to make, that havebeen fonder of your letters than my Lady Protector is of her new honour,and, in earnest, would be so still but there are a thousandinconveniences in't that I could tell you. Tell me what you can do; inthe meantime think of some employment for yourself this summer. Whoknows what a year may produce? If nothing, we are but where we were, andnothing can hinder us from being, at least, perfect friends. Adieu.There's nothing so terrible in my other letter but you may venture toread it. Have not you forgot my Lady's book?CHAPTER VTHE LAST OF CHICKSANDS. FEBRUARY AND MARCH 1654The quarrel is over, happily over, and Dorothy and Temple are more thanreconciled again. Temple has been down to Chicksands to see her, andsome more definite arrangement has been come to between them. Dorothyhas urged Temple to go to Ireland and join his father, who has onceagain taken possession of his office of Master of the Rolls. As soon asan appointment can be found for Temple they are to be married--that is,as far as one can gather, the state of affairs between them; but itwould seem as if nothing of this was as yet to be known to the outerworld, not even to Dorothy's brother._Letter 48._SIR,--'Tis but an hour since you went, and I am writing to you already;is not this kind? How do you after your journey; are you not weary; doyou not repent that you took it to so little purpose? Well, God forgiveme, and you too, you made me tell a great lie. I was fain to say youcame only to take your leave before you went abroad; and all this notonly to keep quiet, but to keep him from playing the madman; for when hehas the least suspicion, he carries it so strangely that all the worldtakes notice on't, and so often guess at the reason, or else he tellsit. Now, do but you judge whether if by mischance he should discover thetruth, whether he would not rail most sweetly at me (and with somereason) for abusing him. Yet you helped to do it; a sadness that hediscovered at your going away inclined him to believe you were illsatisfied, and made him credit what I said. He is kind now in extremity,and I would be glad to keep him so till a discovery is absolutelynecessary. Your going abroad will confirm him much in his belief, and Ishall have nothing to torment me in this place but my own doubts andfears. Here I shall find all the repose I am capable of, and nothingwill disturb my prayers and wishes for your happiness which only canmake mine. Your journey cannot be to your disadvantage neither; you mustneeds be pleased to visit a place you are so much concerned in, and tobe a witness yourself of your hopes, though I will believe you need noother inducements to this voyage than my desiring it. I know you loveme, and you have no reason to doubt my kindness. Let us both havepatience to wait what time and fortune will do for us; they cannothinder our being perfect friends.Lord, there were a thousand things I remembered after you were gone thatI should have said, and now I am to write not one of them will come intomy head. Sure as I live it is not settled yet! Good God! the fears andsurprises, the crosses and disorders of that day, 'twas confused enoughto be a dream, and I am apt to think sometimes it was no more. But no, Isaw you; when I shall do it again, God only knows! Can there be aromancer story than ours would make if the conclusion prove happy? Ah! Idare not hope it; something that I cannot describe draws a cloud overall the light my fancy discovers sometimes, and leaves me so in the darkwith all my fears about me that I tremble to think on't. But no more ofthis sad talk.Who was that, Mr. Dr. told you I should marry? I cannot imagine for mylife; tell me, or I shall think you made it to excuse yourself. Did notyou say once you knew where good French tweezers were to be had? Praysend me a pair; they shall cut no love. Before you go I must have a ringfrom you, too, a plain gold one; if I ever marry it shall be my weddingring; when I die I'll give it you again. What a dismal story this is yousent me; but who could expect better from a love begun upon suchgrounds? I cannot pity neither of them, they were both so guilty. Yes,they are the more to be pitied for that.Here is a note comes to me just now, will you do this service for a finelady that is my friend; have not I taught her well, she writes betterthan her mistress? How merry and pleased she is with her marryingbecause there is a plentiful fortune; otherwise she would not value theman at all. This is the world; would you and I were out of it: for,sure, we were not made to live in it. Do you remember Arme and thelittle house there? Shall we go thither? that's next to being out of theworld. There we might live like Baucis and Philemon, grow old togetherin our little cottage, and for our charity to some shipwrecked strangersobtain the blessing of dying both at the same time. How idly I talk;'tis because the story pleases me--none in Ovid so much. I remember Icried when I read it. Methought they were the perfectest characters of acontented marriage, where piety and love were all their wealth, and intheir poverty feasted the gods when rich men shut them out. I am calledaway,--farewell!Your faithful._Letter 49._--The beginning of this letter is lost, and with it,perhaps, the name of Dorothy's lover who had written some verses on herbeauty. However, we have the "tag" of them, with which we must restcontent.... 'Tis pity I cannot show you what his wit could do upon so ill asubject, but my Lady Ruthin keeps them to abuse me withal, and has put atune to them that I may hear them all manner of ways; and yet I doprotest I remember nothing more of them than this lame piece,--          A stately and majestic brow,          Of force to make Protectors bow.Indeed, if I have any stately looks I think he has seen them, but yet itseems they could not keep him from playing the fool. My Lady Grey toldme that one day talking of me to her (as he would find ways to bring inthat discourse by the head and shoulders, whatsoever anybody else couldinterpose), he said he wondered I did not marry. She (that understoodhim well enough, but would not seem to do so) said she knew not, unlessit were that I liked my present condition so well that I did not care tochange it; which she was apt to believe, because to her knowledge I hadrefused very good fortunes, and named some so far beyond his reach, thatshe thought she had dashed all his hopes. But he, confident still, said'twas perhaps that I had no fancy to their persons (as if his own wereso taking), that I was to be looked upon as one that had it in my powerto please myself, and that perhaps in a person I liked would batesomething of fortune. To this my Lady answered again for me, that 'twasnot impossible but I might do so, but in that point she thought me niceand curious enough. And still to dishearten him the more, she tookoccasion (upon his naming some gentlemen of the county that had beentalked of heretofore as of my servants, and are since disposed of) tosay (very plainly) that 'twas true they had some of them pretended, butthere was an end of my Bedfordshire servants she was sure there were nomore that could be admitted into the number. After all this (which wouldhave satisfied an ordinary young man) did I this last Thursday receive aletter from him by Collins, which he sent first to London that it mightcome thence to me. I threw it into the fire; and do you but keep mycounsel, nobody shall ever know that I had it; and my gentleman shall bekept at such a distance as I hope to hear no more of him. Yet I'll swearof late I have used him so near to rudely that there is little left forme to do. Fye! what a deal of paper I have spent upon this idle fellow;if I had thought his story would have proved so long you should havemissed on't, and the loss would not have been great.I have not thanked you yet for my tweezers and essences; they are bothvery good. I kept one of the little glasses myself; remember my ring,and in return, if I go to London whilst you are in Ireland, I'll have mypicture taken in little and send it you. The sooner you despatch awaywill be the better, I think, since I have no hopes of seeing you beforeyou go; there lies all your business, your father and fortune must doall the rest. I cannot be more yours than I am. You are mistaken if youthink I stand in awe of my brother. No, I fear nobody's anger. I amproof against all violence; but when people haunt me with reasoning andentreaties, when they look sadly and pretend kindness, when they begupon that score, 'tis a strange pain to me to deny. When he rants andrenounces me, I can despise him; but when he asks my pardon, with tearspleads to me the long and constant friendship between us, and callsheaven to witness that nothing upon earth is dear to him in comparisonof me, then, I confess, I feel a stronger unquietness within me, and Iwould do anything to evade his importunity. Nothing is so great aviolence to me as that which moves my compassion. I can resist with easeany sort of people but beggars. If this be a fault in me, 'tis at leasta well-natured one; and therefore I hope you will forgive it me, youthat can forgive me anything, you say, and be displeased with nothingwhilst I love you; may I never be pleased with anything when I do not.Yet I could beat you for writing this last strange letter; was thereever anything said like? If I had but a vanity that the world shouldadmire me, I would not care what they talked of me. In earnest, Ibelieve there is nobody displeased that people speak well of them, andreputation is esteemed by all of much greater value than life itself.Yet let me tell you soberly, that with all my vanity I could be verywell contented nobody should blame me or any action of mine, to quit allmy part of the praises and admiration of the world; and if I might beallowed to choose, my happiest part of it should consist in concealment,there should not be above two persons in the world know that there wassuch a one in it as your faithful.Stay! I have not done yet. Here's another good side, I find; here, then,I'll tell you that I am not angry for all this. No, I allow it to yourill-humour, and that to the crosses that have been common to us; but nowthat is cleared up, I should expect you should say finer things to me.Yet take heed of being like my neighbour's servant, he is so transportedto find no rubs in his way that he knows not whether he stands on hishead or his feet. 'Tis the most troublesome, busy talking little thingthat ever was born; his tongue goes like the clack of a mill, but tomuch less purpose, though if it were all oracle, my head would ache tohear that perpetual noise. I admire at her patience and her resolutionthat can laugh at his fooleries and love his fortune. You would wonderto see how tired she is with his impertinences, and yet how pleased tothink she shall have a great estate with him. But this is the world, andshe makes a part of it betimes. Two or three great glistening jewelshave bribed her to wink at all his faults, and she hears him as unmovedand unconcerned as if another were to marry him.What think you, have I not done fair for once, would you wish a longerletter? See how kind I grow at parting; who would not go into Ireland tohave such another? In earnest now, go as soon as you can, 'twill be thebetter, I think, who am your faithful friend._Letter 50._--Wrest, in Bedfordshire, where Dorothy met her importunatelover, was the seat of Anthony Grey, Earl of Kent. There is said to be apicture there of Sir William Temple,--a copy of Lely's picture. WrestPark is only a few miles from Chicksands.SIR,--Who would be kind to one that reproaches one so cruelly? Do youthink, in earnest, I could be satisfied the world should think me adissembler, full of avarice or ambition? No, you are mistaken; but I'lltell you what I could suffer, that they should say I married where I hadno inclination, because my friends thought it fit, rather than that Ihad run wilfully to my own ruin in pursuit of a fond passion of my own.To marry for love were no reproachful thing if we did not see that ofthe thousand couples that do it, hardly one can be brought for anexample that it may be done and not repented afterwards. Is thereanything thought so indiscreet, or that makes one more contemptible?'Tis true that I do firmly believe we should be, as you say, _toujoursles mesmes_; but if (as you confess) 'tis that which hardly happens oncein two ages, we are not to expect the world should discern we were notlike the rest. I'll tell you stories another time, you return them sohandsomely upon me. Well, the next servant I tell you of shall not becalled a whelp, if 'twere not to give you a stick to beat myself with. Iwould confess that I looked upon the impudence of this fellow as apunishment upon me for my over care in avoiding the talk of the world;yet the case is very different, and no woman shall ever be blamed thatan inconsolable person pretends to her when she gives no allowance toit, whereas none shall 'scape that owns a passion, though in return of aperson much above her. The little tailor that loved Queen Elizabeth wassuffered to talk out, and none of her Council thought it necessary tostop his mouth; but the Queen of Sweden's kind letter to the King ofScots was intercepted by her own ambassador, because he thought it wasnot for his mistress's honour (at least that was his pretended reason),and thought justifiable enough. But to come to my Beagle again. I haveheard no more of him, though I have seen him since; we met at Wrestagain. I do not doubt but I shall be better able to resist hisimportunity than his tutor was; but what do you think it is that giveshim his encouragement? He was told I had thought of marrying a gentlemanthat had not above two hundred pound a year, only out of my liking tohis person. And upon that score his vanity allows him to think he maypretend as far as another. Thus you see 'tis not altogether withoutreason that I apprehend the noise of the world, since 'tis so much to mydisadvantage.Is it in earnest that you say your being there keeps me from the town?If so, 'tis very unkind. No, if I had gone, it had been to have waitedon my neighbour, who has now altered her resolution and goes notherself. I have no business there, and am so little taken with the placethat I could sit here seven years without so much as thinking once ofgoing to it. 'Tis not likely, as you say, that you should much persuadeyour father to what you do not desire he should do; but it is hard ifall the testimonies of my kindness are not enough to satisfy without mypublishing to the world that I can forget my friends and all my interestto follow my passion; though, perhaps, it will admit of a good sense,'tis that which nobody but you or I will give it, and we that areconcerned in't can only say 'twas an act of great kindness and somethingromance, but must confess it had nothing of prudence, discretion, norsober counsel in't. 'Tis not that I expect, by all your father's offers,to bring my friends to approve it. I don't deceive myself thus far, butI would not give them occasion to say that I hid myself from them in thedoing it; nor of making my action appear more indiscreet than it is. Itwill concern me that all the world should know what fortune you have,and upon what terms I marry you, that both may not be made to appear tentimes worse than they are. 'Tis the general custom of all people to makethose that are rich to have more mines of gold than are in the Indies,and such as have small fortunes to be beggars. If an action take alittle in the world, it shall be magnified and brought into comparisonwith what the heroes or senators of Rome performed; but, on thecontrary, if it be once condemned, nothing can be found ill enough tocompare it with; and people are in pain till they find out someextravagant expression to represent the folly on't. Only there is thisdifference, that as all are more forcibly inclined to ill than good,they are much apter to exceed in detraction than in praises. Have I notreason then to desire this from you; and may not my friendship havedeserved it? I know not; 'tis as you think; but if I be denied it, youwill teach me to consider myself. 'Tis well the side ended here. If Ihad not had occasion to stop there, I might have gone too far, andshowed that I had more passions than one. Yet 'tis fit you should knowall my faults, lest you should repent your bargain when 'twill not be inyour power to release yourself; besides, I may own my ill-humour to youthat cause it; 'tis the discontent my crosses in this business havegiven me makes me thus peevish. Though I say it myself, before I knewyou I was thought as well an humoured young person as most in England;nothing displeased, nothing troubled me. When I came out of France,nobody knew me again. I was so altered, from a cheerful humour that wasalways alike, never over merry but always pleased, I was grown heavy andsullen, froward and discomposed; and that country which usually givespeople a jolliness and gaiety that is natural to the climate, hadwrought in me so contrary effects that I was as new a thing to them asmy clothes. If you find all this to be sad truth hereafter, rememberthat I gave you fair warning.Here is a ring: it must not be at all wider than this, which is rathertoo big for me than otherwise; but that is a good fault, and countedlucky by superstitious people. I am not so, though: 'tis indifferentwhether there be any word in't or not; only 'tis as well without, andwill make my wearing it the less observed. You must give Nan leave tocut a lock of your hair for me, too. Oh, my heart! what a sigh wasthere! I will not tell you how many this journey causes; nor the fearand apprehensions I have for you. No, I long to be rid of you, am afraidyou will not go soon enough: do not you believe this? No, my dearest, Iknow you do not, whate'er you say, you cannot doubt that I am yours._Letter 51._--Lady Newport was the wife of the Earl of Newport, andmother of Lady Anne Blunt of whom we heard something in former letters.She is mentioned as a prominent leader of London society. In March 1652she is granted a pass to leave the country, on condition that she givessecurity to do nothing prejudicial to the State; from which we may drawthe inference that she was a political notability.My Lady Devonshire was Christian, daughter of Lord Bruce of Kinloss. Shemarried William Cavendish, second Earl of Devonshire. Her daughter Annemarried Lord Rich, and died suddenly in 1638. Pomfret, Godolphin, andFalkland celebrated her virtues in verse, and Waller wrote her funeralhymn, which is still known to some of us,--                                 The Lady Rich is dead.          Heartrending news! and dreadful to those few          Who her resemble and her steps pursue,          That Death should license have to range among          The fair, the wise, the virtuous, and the young.It was the only son of Lady Rich who married Frances Cromwell.Lord Warwick was the father of Robert, Lord Rich, and we may gather fromthis letter that, at Lady Devonshire's instigation, he had interfered ina proposed second marriage between his son and some fair unknown._Parthenissa_ is only just out. It is the latest thing in literarycircles. We find it advertised in _Mercurius Politicus_, 19th January1654:--"_Parthenissa_, that most famous romance, composed by the LordBroghill, and dedicated to the Lady Northumberland." It is a romance ofthe style of _Cleopatre_ and _Cyrus_, to enjoy which in the nineteenthcentury would require a curious and acquired taste. _L'illustre Bassa_was a romance of Scuderi; and the passage in the epistle to whichDorothy refers,--we quote it from a translation by one Henry Cogan,1652,--runs as follows: "And if you see not my hero persecuted with loveby women, it is not because he was not amiable, and that he could not beloved, but because it would clash with civility in the persons ofladies, and with true resemblance in that of men, who rarely showthemselves cruel unto them, nor in doing it could have any good grace."SIR,--The lady was in the right. You are a very pretty gentleman and amodest; were there ever such stories as these you tell? The best on'tis, I believe none of them unless it be that of my Lady Newport, which Imust confess is so like her that if it be not true 'twas at leastexcellently well fancied. But my Lord Rich was not caught, tho' he wasnear it. My Lady Devonshire, whose daughter his first wife was, hasengaged my Lord Warwick to put a stop to the business. Otherwise, Ithink his present want of fortune, and the little sense of honour hehas, might have been prevailed on to marry her.'Tis strange to see the folly that possesses the young people of thisage, and the liberty they take to themselves. I have the charity tobelieve they appear very much worse than they are, and that the want ofa Court to govern themselves by is in great part the cause of theirruin; though that was no perfect school of virtue, yet Vice there woreher mask, and appeared so unlike herself that she gave no scandal. Suchas were really discreet as they seemed to be gave good example, and theeminency of their condition made others strive to imitate them, or atleast they durst not own a contrary course. All who had good principlesand inclinations were encouraged in them, and such as had neither wereforced to put on a handsome disguise that they might not be out ofcountenance at themselves. 'Tis certain (what you say) that where divineor human laws are not positive we may be our own judges; nobody canhinder us, nor is it in itself to be blamed. But, sure, it is not safeto take all liberty that is allowed us,--there are not many that aresober enough to be trusted with the government of themselves; andbecause others judge us with more severity than our indulgence toourselves will permit, it must necessarily follow that 'tis safer beingruled by their opinions than by our own. I am disputing again, thoughyou told me my fault so plainly.I'll give it over, and tell you that _Parthenissa_ is now my company. Mybrother sent it down, and I have almost read it. 'Tis handsome language;you would know it to be writ by a person of good quality though you werenot told it; but, on the whole, I am not very much taken with it. Allthe stories have too near a resemblance with those of other romances,there is nothing new or _surprenant_ in them; the ladies are all so kindthey make no sport, and I meet only with one that took me by doing ahandsome thing of the kind. She was in a besieged town, and persuadedall those of her sex to go out with her to the enemy (which were abarbarous people) and die by their swords, that the provisions of thetown might last the longer for such as were able to do service indefending it. But how angry was I to see him spoil this again bybringing out a letter this woman left behind her for the governor of thetown, where she discovers a passion for him, and makes _that_ the reasonwhy she did it. I confess I have no patience for our _faiseurs deRomance_ when they make a woman court. It will never enter into my headthat 'tis possible any woman can love where she is not first loved, andmuch less that if they should do that, they could have the face to ownit. Methinks he that writes _L'illustre Bassa_ says well in his epistlethat we are not to imagine his hero to be less taking than those ofother romances because the ladies do not fall in love with him whetherhe will or not. 'Twould be an injury to the ladies to suppose they coulddo so, and a greater to his hero's civility if he should put him uponbeing cruel to them, since he was to love but one. Another fault I find,too, in the style--'tis affected. _Ambitioned_ is a great word with him,and _ignore_; _my concern_, or of _great concern_, is, it seems, propererthan _concernment_: and though he makes his people say fine handsomethings to one another, yet they are not easy and _naive_ like theFrench, and there is a little harshness in most of the discourse thatone would take to be the fault of a translator rather than of an author.But perhaps I like it the worse for having a piece of _Cyrus_ by me thatI am hugely pleased with, and that I would fain have you read: I'll sendit you. At least read one story that I'll mark you down, if you havetime for no more. I am glad you stay to wait on your sister. I wouldhave my gallant civil to all, much more when it is so due, and kindnesstoo.I have the cabinet, and 'tis in earnest a pretty one; though you willnot own it for a present, I'll keep it as one, and 'tis like to be yoursno more but as 'tis mine. I'll warrant you would ne'er have thought ofmaking me a present of charcoal as my servant James would have done, towarm my heart I think he meant it. But the truth is, I had beeninquiring for some (as 'tis a commodity scarce enough in this country),and he hearing it, told the baily [bailiff?] he would give him some if'twere for me. But this is not all. I cannot forbear telling you theother day he made me a visit, and I, to prevent his making discourse tome, made Mrs. Goldsmith and Jane sit by all the while. But he camebetter provided than I could have imagined. He brought a letter withhim, and gave it me as one he had met with directed to me, he thought itcame out of Northamptonshire. I was upon my guard, and suspecting all hesaid, examined him so strictly where he had it before I would open it,that he was hugely confounded, and I confirmed that 'twas his. I laid itby and wished that they would have left us, that I might have takennotice on't to him. But I had forbid it them so strictly before, thatthey offered not to stir farther than to look out of window, as notthinking there was any necessity of giving us their eyes as well astheir ears; but he that saw himself discovered took that time to confessto me (in a whispering voice that I could hardly hear myself) that theletter (as my Lord Broghill says) was of _great concern_ to him, andbegged I would read it, and give him my answer. I took it up presently,as if I had meant it, but threw it, sealed as it was, into the fire, andtold him (as softly as he had spoke to me) I thought that the quickestand best way of answering it. He sat awhile in great disorder, withoutspeaking a word, and so ris and took his leave. Now what think you,shall I ever hear of him more?You do not thank me for using your rival so scurvily nor are not jealousof him, though your father thinks my intentions were not handsometowards you, which methinks is another argument that one is not to beone's own judge; for I am very confident they were, and with his favourshall never believe otherwise. I am sure I have no ends to serve of myown in what I did,--it could be no advantage to me that had firmlyresolved not to marry; but I thought it might be an injury to you tokeep you in expectation of what was never likely to be, as Iapprehended. Why do I enter into this wrangling discourse? Let yourfather think me what he pleases, if he ever comes to know me, the restof my actions shall justify me in this; if he does not, I'll begin topractise on him (what you so often preached to me) to neglect the reportof the world, and satisfy myself in my own innocency.'Twill be pleasinger to you, I am sure, to tell you how fond I am ofyour lock. Well, in earnest now, and setting aside all compliments, Inever saw finer hair, nor of a better colour; but cut no more on't, Iwould not have it spoiled for the world. If you love me, be carefulon't. I am combing, and curling, and kissing this lock all day, anddreaming on't all night. The ring, too, is very well, only a little ofthe biggest. Send me a tortoise one that is a little less than that Isent for a pattern. I would not have the rule so absolutely true withoutexception that hard hairs be ill-natured, for then I should be so. But Ican allow that all soft hairs are good, and so are you, or I am deceivedas much as you are if you think I do not love you enough. Tell me, mydearest, am I? You will not be if you think I amYours._Letter 52._--It is interesting to find Dorothy reading the good JeremyTaylor's _Holy Living_, a book too little known in this day. For amidstits old-fashioned piety there are many sentiments of practical goodness,expressed with clear insistence, combined with a quaint grace ofliterary style which we have long ago cast aside in the pursuit of otherthings. Dorothy loved this book, and knew it well. Compare the followingextract from the chapter on Christian Justice with what Dorothy haswritten in this letter. Has she been recently reading this passage?Perhaps she has; but more probably it is the recollection of what iswell known that she is reproducing from a memory not unstored with suchlearning. Thus writes Dr. Taylor: "There is very great peace andimmunity from sin in resigning our wills up to the command of others:for, provided our duty to God be secured, their commands are warrants tous in all things else; and the case of conscience is determined, if thecommand be evident and pressing: and it is certain, the action that isbut indifferent and without reward, if done only upon our own choice, isan action of duty and of religion, and rewardable by the grace andfavour of God, if done in obedience to the command of our superiors."Little and Great Brickhill, where Temple is to receive a letter fromDorothy, kindly favoured by Mr. Gibson, stand due west of Chicksandssome seventeen miles, and about forty-six miles along the high-road fromLondon to Chester. Temple would probably arrange to stay there, receiveDorothy's letter, and send one in return.Dorothy has apparently tired of Calprenede and Scuderi, of _Cleopatre_and _Cyrus_, and has turned to travels to amuse her. Fernando MendezPinto did, I believe, actually visit China, and is said to have landedin the Gulf of Pekin. What he writes of China seems to bear someresemblance to what later writers have said. It is hard to say how andwhere his conversations with the Chinese were carried on, as he himselfadmits that he did not understand one word of the language.Lady Grey's sister, Mrs. Pooley, is unknown to history. Of Mr. Fish weknow, as has already been said, nothing more than that he was Dorothy'slover, and a native of Bedfordshire, probably her near neighbour. JamesB---- must be another lover, and he is altogether untraceable. Mrs.Goldsmith is, as you will remember, wife of the Vicar of Campton. TheValentine stories will date this letter for us as written in the latterhalf of February.SIR,--They say you gave order for this waste-paper; how do you think Icould ever fill it, or with what? I am not always in the humour towrangle and dispute. For example now, I had rather agree to what yousay, than tell you that Dr. Taylor (whose devote you must know I am)says there is a great advantage to be gained in resigning up one's willto the command of another, because the same action which in itself iswholly indifferent, if done upon our own choice, becomes an act of dutyand religion if done in obedience to the command of any person whomnature, the laws, or ourselves have given a power over us; so thatthough in an action already done we can only be our own judges, becausewe only know with what intentions it was done, yet in any we intend,'tis safest, sure, to take the advice of another. Let me practise thistowards you as well as preach it to you, and I'll lay a wager you willapprove on't. But I am chiefly of your opinion that contentment (whichthe Spanish proverb says is the best paint) gives the lustre to allone's enjoyment, puts a beauty upon things which without it would havenone, increases it extremely where 'tis already in some degree, andwithout it, all that we call happiness besides loses its property. Whatis contentment, must be left to every particular person to judge forthemselves, since they only know what is so to them which differs in allaccording to their several humours. Only you and I agree 'tis to befound by us in a true friend, a moderate fortune, and a retired life;the last I thank God I have in perfection. My cell is almost finished,and when you come back you'll find me in it, and bring me both the restI hope.I find it much easier to talk of your coming back than your going. Youshall never persuade me I send you this journey. No, pray let it be yourfather's commands, or a necessity your fortune puts upon you. 'Twasunkindly said to tell me I banish you; your heart never told it you, Idare swear; nor mine ne'er thought it. No, my dear, this is our lastmisfortune, let's bear it nobly. Nothing shows we deserve a punishmentso much as our murmuring at it; and the way to lessen those we feel, andto 'scape those we fear, is to suffer patiently what is imposed, makinga virtue of necessity. 'Tis not that I have less kindness or morecourage than you, but that mistrusting myself more (as I have morereason), I have armed myself all that is possible against this occasion.I have thought that there is not much difference between your being atDublin or at London, as our affairs stand. You can write and hear fromthe first, and I should not see you sooner if you continued still at thelast.Besides, I hope this journey will be of advantage to us; when yourfather pressed your coming over he told you, you needed not doubt eitherhis power or his will. Have I done anything since that deserves heshould alter his intentions towards us? Or has any accident lessened hispower? If neither, we may hope to be happy, and the sooner for thisjourney. I dare not send my boy to meet you at Brickhill nor any otherof the servants, they are all too talkative. But I can get Mr. Gibson,if you will, to bring you a letter. 'Tis a civil, well-natured man ascan be, of excellent principles and exact honesty. I durst make him myconfessor, though he is not obliged by his orders to conceal anythingthat is told him. But you must tell me then which Brickhill it is youstop at, Little or Great; they are neither of them far from us. If youstay there you will write back by him, will you not, a long letter? Ishall need it; besides that, you owe it me for the last being so short.Would you saw what letters my brother writes me; you are not half sokind. Well, he is always in the extremes; since our last quarrel he hascourted me more than ever he did in his life, and made me more presents,which, considering his humour, is as great a testimony of his kindnessas 'twas of Mr. Smith's to my Lady Sunderland when he presented Mrs.Camilla. He sent me one this week which, in earnest, is as pretty athing as I have seen, a China trunk, and the finest of the kind thate'er I saw. By the way (this puts me in mind on't), have you read thestory of China written by a Portuguese, Fernando Mendez Pinto, I thinkhis name is? If you have not, take it with you, 'tis as diverting a bookof the kind as ever I read, and is as handsomely written. You must allowhim the privilege of a traveller, and he does not abuse it. His lies areas pleasant harmless ones, as lies can be, and in no great numberconsidering the scope he has for them. There is one in Dublin now, thatne'er saw much farther, has told me twice as many (I dare swear) ofIreland. If I should ever live to see that country and be in't, I shouldmake excellent sport with them. 'Tis a sister of my Lady Grey's, hername is Pooley; her husband lives there too, but I am afraid in no verygood condition. They were but poor, and she lived here with her sisterswhen I knew her; 'tis not half a year since she went, I think. If youhear of her, send me word how she makes a shift there.And hark you, can you tell me whether the gentleman that lost a crystalbox the 1st of February in St. James' Park or Old Spring Gardens hasfound it again or not, I have strong curiosity to know? Tell me, andI'll tell you something that you don't know, which is, that I am yourValentine and you are mine. I did not think of drawing any, but Mrs.Goldsmith and Jane would need make me some for them and myself; so Iwrit down our three names, and for men Mr. Fish, James B., and you. Icut them all equal and made them up myself before them, and because Iwould owe it wholly to my good fortune if I were pleased. I made boththem choose first that had never seen what was in them, and they left meyou. Then I made them choose again for theirs, and my name was left. Youcannot imagine how I was delighted with this little accident, but bytaking notice that I cannot forbear telling you it. I was not half sopleased with my encounter next morning. I was up early, but with nodesign of getting another Valentine, and going out to walk in mynight-cloak and night-gown, I met Mr. Fish going a hunting, I think hewas; but he stayed to tell me I was his Valentine; and I should not havebeen rid on him quickly, if he had not thought himself a little too_negligee_; his hair was not powdered, and his clothes were butordinary; to say truth, he looked then methought like other mortalpeople. Yet he was as handsome as your Valentine. I'll swear you wantedone when you took her, and had very ill fortune that nobody met youbefore her. Oh, if I had not terrified my little gentleman when hebrought me his own letter, now sure I had had him for my Valentine!On my conscience, I shall follow your counsel if e'er he comes again,but I am persuaded he will not. I writ my brother that story for want ofsomething else, and he says I did very well, there was no other way tobe rid on him; and he makes a remark upon't that I can be severe enoughwhen I please, and wishes I would practise it somewhere else as well asthere. Can you tell where that is? I never understand anybody that doesnot speak plain English, and he never uses that to me of late, but tellsme the finest stories (I may apply them how I please) of people thathave married when they thought there was great kindness, and howmiserably they have found themselves deceived; how despicable they havemade themselves by it, and how sadly they have repented on't. He reckonsmore inconveniency than you do that follows good nature, says it makesone credulous, apt to be abused, betrays one to the cunning of peoplethat make advantage on't, and a thousand such things which I hear halfasleep and half awake, and take little notice of, unless it be sometimesto say that with all these faults I would not be without it. No, inearnest, nor I could not love any person that I thought had it not to agood degree. 'Twas the first thing I liked in you, and without it Ishould never have liked anything. I know 'tis counted simple, but Icannot imagine why. 'Tis true some people have it that have not wit, butthere are at least as many foolish people I have ever observed to befullest of tricks, little ugly plots and designs, unnecessary disguises,and mean cunnings, which are the basest qualities in the world, andmakes one the most contemptible, I think; when I once discover them theylose their credit with me for ever. Some will say they are cunning onlyin their own defence, and that there is no living in this world withoutit; but I cannot understand how anything more is necessary to one's ownsafety besides a prudent caution; that I now think is, though I canremember when nobody could have persuaded me that anybody meant ill whenit did not appear by their words and actions. I remember my mother (who,if it may be allowed me to say it) was counted as wise a woman as mostin England,--when she seemed to distrust anybody, and saw I took noticeon't, would ask if I did not think her too jealous and a littleill-natured. "Come, I know you do," says she, "if you would confess it,and I cannot blame you. When I was young as you are, I thought myfather-in-law (who was a wise man) the most unreasonably suspicious manthat ever was, and disliked him for it hugely; but I have lived to seeit is almost impossible to think people worse than they are, and so willyou." I did not believe her, and less, that I should have more to say toyou than this paper would hold. It shall never be said I began anotherat this time of night, though I have spent this idly, that should havetold you with a little more circumstance how perfectlyI am yours._Letter 53._--Dorothy's brother seems to have got hold of a new weaponof attack in Temple's religious opinions, which might have led to astrategic success in more skilful hands. He only manages to exasperateDorothy with himself, not with Temple. As for Temple, he has notaltogether escaped the censure of the orthodox. Gossiping Bishop Burnet,in one of his more ill-natured passages, tells us that Temple was anEpicurean, thinking religion to be fit only for the mob, and a corrupterof all that came near him. Unkind words these, with just, perhaps, thosedregs of truth in them which make gossip so hard to bear patiently. Wasit true, as Courtenay thinks, that jealousy of King William's attachmentto Temple disturbed the episcopal equipoise of soul, rendering hisLordship slanderous, even a backbiter?Robin C. is probably one of the Cheeke family.Bagshawe is Edward Bagshawe the Elder, B.A. of Brasenose, Oxford, and ofthe Middle Temple, barrister-at-law. In the early part of the century hehad been a Puritan among Puritans, and in the old hall of the MiddleTemple had delivered two lectures to show that bishops may not meddle incivil affairs, and that a Parliament may be held without bishops;questions still unsettled. Laud appears to have prohibited theselectures. Bagshawe in after life joined the King at Oxford, and sufferedimprisonment at the hands of his former friends in the King's BenchPrison from 1644 to 1646. Young Sir Harry Yelverton, Lady Ruthin'shusband, broke a theological lance with his son, the younger EdwardBagshawe, to vindicate the cause of the Church of England. The elderBagshawe died in 1662, and was buried at Morton Pinckney, inNorthamptonshire. How and why he railed at love and marriage it isimpossible now to know. Edward Bagshawe the younger published in 1671 an_Antidote against Mr. Baxter's Treatise of Love and Marriage_.The preaching woman at Somerset House was, in all probability, Mrs.Hannah Trupnel. She, that in April of this year is spoken of, in an oldnews-book, as having "lately acted her part in a trance so many days atWhitehall." She appears to have been full of mystical, anti-Puritanprophecies, and was indicted in Cornwall as a rogue and vagabond,convicted and bound over in recognizances to behave herself in future.After this she abandoned her design of passing from county to countydisaffecting the people with her prophecies, and we hear no more of her.SIR,--'Tis well you have given over your reproaches; I can allow you totell me of my faults kindly and like a friend. Possibly it is a weaknessin me to aim at the world's esteem, as if I could not be happy withoutit; but there are certain things that custom has made almost of absolutenecessity, and reputation I take to be one of these. If one could beinvisible I should choose that; but since all people are seen or known,and shall be talked of in spite of their teeth, who is it that does notdesire, at least, that nothing of ill may be said of them, whetherjustly or otherwise? I never knew any so satisfied with their owninnocence as to be content that the world should think them guilty. Someout of pride have seemed to contemn ill reports when they have foundthey could not avoid them, but none out of strength of reason, thoughmany have pretended to it. No, not my Lady Newcastle with all herphilosophy, therefore you must not expect it from me. I shall never beashamed to own that I have a particular value for you above any other,but 'tis not the greatest merit of person will excuse a want of fortune;in some degree I think it will, at least with the most rational part ofthe world, and, as far as that will read, I desire it should. I wouldnot have the world believe I married out of interest and to please myfriends; I had much rather they should know I chose the person, and tookhis fortune, because 'twas necessary, and that I prefer a competencywith one I esteem infinitely before a vast estate in other hands. 'Tismuch easier, sure, to get a good fortune than a good husband; butwhosoever marries without any consideration of fortune shall never beallowed to do it, but of so reasonable an apprehension the whole world(without any reserve) shall pronounce they did it merely to satisfytheir giddy humour.Besides, though you imagine 'twere a great argument of my kindness toconsider nothing but you, in earnest I believe 'twould be an injury toyou. I do not see that it puts any value upon men when women marry themfor love (as they term it); 'tis not their merit, but our folly that isalways presumed to cause it; and would it be any advantage to you tohave your wife thought an indiscreet person? All this I can say to you;but when my brother disputes it with me I have other arguments for him,and I drove him up so close t'other night that for want of a better gapto get out at he was fain to say that he feared as much your having afortune as your having none, for he saw you held my Lord L't's [?Lieutenant's] principles. That religion and honour were things you didnot consider at all, and that he was confident you would take anyengagement, serve in employment, or do anything to advance yourself. Ihad no patience for this. To say you were a beggar, your father notworth L4000 in the whole world, was nothing in comparison of having noreligion nor no honour. I forgot all my disguise, and we talkedourselves weary; he renounced me, and I defied him, but both in as civillanguage as it would permit, and parted in great anger with the usualceremony of a leg and a courtesy, that you would have died with laughingto have seen us.The next day I, not being at dinner, saw him not till night; then hecame into my chamber, where I supped but he did not. Afterwards Mr.Gibson and he and I talked of indifferent things till all but we twowent to bed. Then he sat half-an-hour and said not one word, nor I tohim. At last, in a pitiful tone, "Sister," says he, "I have heard yousay that when anything troubles you, of all things you apprehend goingto bed, because there it increases upon you, and you lie at the mercy ofall your sad thought, which the silence and darkness of the night adds ahorror to; I am at that pass now. I vow to God I would not endureanother night like the last to gain a crown." I, who resolved to take nonotice what ailed him, said 'twas a knowledge I had raised from myspleen only, and so fell into a discourse of melancholy and the causes,and from that (I know not how) into religion; and we talked so long ofit, and so devoutly, that it laid all our anger. We grew to a calm andpeace with all the world. Two hermits conversing in a cell they equallyinhabit, ne'er expressed more humble, charitable kindness, one towardsanother, than we. He asked my pardon and I his, and he has promised menever to speak of it to me whilst he lives, but leave the event to GodAlmighty; until he sees it done, he will always be the same to me thathe is; then he shall leave me, he says, not out of want of kindness tome, but because he cannot see the ruin of a person that he loves sopassionately, and in whose happiness he has laid up all his. These arethe terms we are at, and I am confident he will keep his word with me,so that you have no reason to fear him in any respect; for though heshould break his promise, he should never make me break mine. No, let meassure you this rival, nor any other, shall ever alter me, thereforespare your jealousy, or turn it all into kindness.I will write every week, and no miss of letters shall give us any doubtsof one another. Time nor accidents shall not prevail upon our hearts,and, if God Almighty please to bless us, we will meet the same we are,or happier. I will do all you bid me. I will pray, and wish, and hope,but you must do so too, then, and be so careful of yourself that I mayhave nothing to reproach you with when you come back.That vile wench lets you see all my scribbles, I believe; how do youknow I took care your hair should not be spoiled? 'Tis more than e'eryou did, I think, you are so negligent on't, and keep it so ill, 'tispity you should have it. May you have better luck in the cutting it thanI had with mine. I cut it two or three years agone, and it never grewsince. Look to it; if I keep the lock you give me better than you do allthe rest, I shall not spare you; expect to be soundly chidden. What doyou mean to do with all my letters? Leave them behind you? If you do, itmust be in safe hands, some of them concern you, and me, and otherpeople besides us very much, and they will almost load a horse to carry.Does not my cousin at Moor Park mistrust us a little? I have a greatbelief they do. I am sure Robin C---- told my brother of it since I waslast in town. Of all things, I admire my cousin Molle has not got it bythe end, he that frequents that family so much, and is at this instantat Kimbolton. If he has, and conceals it, he is very discreet; I couldnever discern by anything that he knew it. I shall endeavour to accustommyself to the noise on't, and make it as easy to me as I can, though Ihad much rather it were not talked of till there were an absolutenecessity of discovering it, and you can oblige me in nothing more thanin concealing it. I take it very kindly that you promise to use all yourinterest in your father to persuade him to endeavour our happiness, andhe appears so confident of his power that it gives me great hopes.Dear! shall we ever be so happy, think you? Ah! I dare not hope it. Yet'tis not want of love gives me these fears. No, in earnest, I think(nay, I'm sure) I love you more than ever, and 'tis that only gives methese despairing thoughts; when I consider how small a proportion ofhappiness is allowed in this world, and how great mine would be in aperson for whom I have a passionate kindness, and who has the same forme. As it is infinitely above what I can deserve, and more than GodAlmighty usually allots to the best people, I can find nothing in reasonbut seems to be against me; and, methinks, 'tis as vain in me to expectit as 'twould be to hope I might be a queen (if that were really asdesirable a thing as 'tis thought to be); and it is just it should beso.We complain of this world, and the variety of crosses and afflictions itabounds in, and yet for all this who is weary on't (more than indiscourse), who thinks with pleasure of leaving it, or preparing for thenext? We see old folks, who have outlived all the comforts of life,desire to continue in it, and nothing can wean us from the folly ofpreferring a mortal being, subject to great infirmity and unavoidabledecays, before an immortal one, and all the glories that are promisedwith it. Is this not very like preaching? Well, 'tis too good for you;you shall have no more on't. I am afraid you are not mortified enoughfor such discourse to work upon (though I am not of my brother'sopinion, neither, that you have no religion in you). In earnest, I nevertook anything he ever said half so ill, as nothing, sure, is so great aninjury. It must suppose one to be a devil in human shape. Oh, me! now Iam speaking of religion, let me ask you is not his name Bagshawe thatyou say rails on love and women? Because I heard one t'other dayspeaking of him, and commending his wit, but withal, said he was aperfect atheist. If so, I can allow him to hate us, and love, which,sure, has something of divine in it, since God requires it of us. I amcoming into my preaching vein again. What think you, were it not a goodway of preferment as the times are? If you'll advise me to it I'llventure. The woman at Somerset House was cried up mightily. Think on't.Dear, I am yours._Letter 54._--Temple has really started on his journey, and is now pastBrickhill, far away in the north of England. The journey to Ireland wasmade _via_ Holyhead in those days as it is now. It was a four days'journey to Chester, and no good road after. The great route throughWales to Holyhead was in such a state that in 1685 the Viceroy going toIreland was five hours in travelling the fourteen miles from St. Asaphto Conway; between Conway and Beaumaris he walked; and his lady wascarried in a litter. A carriage was often taken to pieces at Conway, andcarried to the Menai Straits on the peasants' shoulders round thedangerous cliff of Penmaenmawr. Mr. B. and Mr. D. remain mysterioussymbolic initials of gossip and scandalmongering. St. Gregory's near St.Paul's, was a church entirely destroyed by the great fire.Sir John Tufton of "The Mote," near Maidstone, married Mary, the thirddaughter and co-heiress of Thomas Lord Wotton.    For your Master [seal with coat-of-arms],        when your Mistress pleases.SIR,--You bid me write every week, and I am doing it without consideringhow it will come to you. Let Nan look to that, with whom, I suppose, youhave left the orders of conveyance. I have your last letter; but Jane,to whom you refer me, is not yet come down. On Tuesday I expect her; andif she be not engaged, I shall give her no cause hereafter to believethat she is a burden to me, though I have no employment for her but thatof talking to me when I am in the humour of saying nothing. Your dog iscome too, and I have received him with all the kindness that is due toanything you send. I have defended him from the envy and malice of atroop of greyhounds that used to be in favour with me; and he is sosensible of my care over him, that he is pleased with nobody else, andfollows me as if we had been of long acquaintance. 'Tis well you aregone past my recovery. My heart has failed me twenty times since youwent, and, had you been within my call, I had brought you back as often,though I know thirty miles' distance and three hundred are the samething. You will be so kind, I am sure, as to write back by the coach andtell me what the success of your journey so far has been. After that, Iexpect no more (unless you stay for a wind) till you arrive at Dublin. Ipity your sister in earnest; a sea voyage is welcome to no lady; but youare beaten to it, and 'twill become you, now you are a conductor, toshow your valour and keep your company in heart. When do you think ofcoming back again? I am asking that before you are at your journey'send. You will not take it ill that I desire it should be soon. In themeantime, I'll practise all the rules you give me. Who told you I go tobed late? In earnest, they do me wrong: I have been faulty in that pointheretofore, I confess, but 'tis a good while since I gave it over withmy reading o' nights; but in the daytime I cannot live without it, and'tis all my diversion, and infinitely more pleasing to me than anycompany but yours. And yet I am not given to it in any excess now; Ihave been very much more. 'Tis Jane, I know, tells all these tales ofme. I shall be even with her some time or other, but for the present Ilong for her with some impatience, that she may tell me all you havetold her.Never trust me if I had not a suspicion from the first that 'twas thatill-looked fellow B---- who made that story Mr. D---- told you. Thatwhich gave me the first inclination to that belief was the circumstanceyou told me of their seeing me at St. Gregory's. For I remembered tohave seen B---- there, and had occasion to look up into the gallerywhere he sat, to answer a very civil salute given me from thence by Mr.Freeman, and saw B---- in a great whisper with another that sat nexthim, and pointing to me. If Mr. D---- had not been so nice indiscovering his name, you would quickly have been cured of yourjealousy. Never believe I have a servant that I do not tell you of assoon as I know it myself. As, for example, my brother Peyton has sent tome, for a countryman of his, Sir John Tufton,--he married one of my LadyWotton's heirs, who is lately dead,--and to invite me to think of it.Besides his person and his fortune, without exception, he tells me whatan excellent husband he was to this lady that's dead, who was but acrooked, ill-favoured woman, only she brought him L1500 a year. I tellhim I believe, Sir John Tufton could be content, I were so too upon thesame terms. But his loving his first wife can be no argument to persuademe; for if he had loved her as he ought to do, I cannot hope he shouldlove another so well as I expect anybody should that has me; and if hedid not love her, I have less to expect he should me. I do not care fora divided heart; I must have all or none, at least the first place init. Poor James, I have broke his. He says 'twould pity you to hear whatsad complaints he makes; and, but that he has not the heart to hanghimself, he would be very well contented to be out of the world.That house of your cousin R---- is fatal to physicians. Dr. Smith thattook it is dead already; but maybe this was before you went, and so isno news to you. I shall be sending you all I hear; which, though itcannot be much, living as I do, yet it may be more than ventures intoIreland. I would have you diverted, whilst you are there, as much aspossible; but not enough to tempt you to stay one minute longer thanyour father and your business obliges you. Alas! I have already repentedall my share in your journey, and begin to find I am not half so valiantas I sometimes take myself to be. The knowledge that our interests arethe same, and that I shall be happy or unfortunate in your person asmuch or more than in my own, does not give me that confidence you speakof. It rather increases my doubts, and I durst trust your fortune alone,rather than now that mine is joined with it. Yet I will hope yours maybe so good as to overcome the ill of mine, and shall endeavour to mendmy own all I can by striving to deserve it, maybe, better. My dearest,will you pardon me that I am forced to leave you so soon? The next shallbe longer, though I can never be more than I amYours._Letter 55._--This sad letter, fully dated 18th March 1654, was writtenafter Sir Peter Osborne was buried in Campton Church. Even as Dorothywrote this, the stone-mason might be slowly carving words that may beread to this day: "The maintainer of divine exercises, the friend to thepoor." Her father is no longer living, and she is now even more lonelythan before. To depend upon kindred that are not friends, to be underthe protection of a brother who is her lover's avowed enemy, this is herlot in life, unless Temple can release her from it. Alas! poor Dorothy,who will now forbear to pity you?_March the 18th, 1654._How true it is that a misfortune never comes single; we live inexpectation of some one happiness that we propose to ourselves, an agealmost, and perhaps miss it at the last; but sad accidents have wings toovertake us, and come in flocks like ill-boding ravens. You were nosooner gone but (as if that had not been enough) I lost the best fatherin the world; and though, as to himself, it was an infinite mercy in GodAlmighty to take him out of a world that can be pleasing to none, andwas made more uneasy to him by many infirmities that were upon him, yetto me it is an affliction much greater than people judge it. Besides allthat is due to nature and the memory of many (more than ordinary)kindnesses received from him, besides what he was to all that knew him,and what he was to me in particular, I am left by his death in thecondition (which of all others) is the most unsupportable to my nature,to depend upon kindred that are not friends, and that, though I pay asmuch as I should do to a stranger, yet think they do me a courtesy. Iexpect my eldest brother to-day; if he comes, I shall be able to tellyou before I seal this up where you are likely to find me. If he offersme to stay here, this hole will be more agreeable to my humour than anyplace that is more in the world. I take it kindly that you used art toconceal our story and satisfy my nice apprehensions, but I'll not imposethat constraint upon you any longer, for I find my kind brotherpublishes it with more earnestness than ever I strove to conceal it; andwith more disadvantage than anybody else would. Now he has tried allways to do what he desires, and finds it is in vain, he resolves torevenge himself upon me, by representing this action in such colours aswill amaze all people that know me, and do not know him enough todiscern his malice to me; he is not able to forbear showing it now, whenmy condition deserves pity from all the world, I think, and that hehimself has newly lost a father, as well as I; but takes this time totorment me, which appears (at least to me) so barbarous a cruelty, thatthough I thank God I have charity enough perfectly to forgive all theinjury he can do me, yet I am afraid I shall never look upon him as abrother more. And now do you judge whether I am not very unhappy, andwhether that sadness in my face you used to complain of was not suitedto my fortune. You must confess it; and that my kindness for you isbeyond example, all these troubles are persecutions that make me wearyof the world before my time, and lessen the concernment I have for you,and instead of being persuaded as they would have me by their maliciousstories, methinks I am obliged to love you more in recompense of all theinjuries they have done you upon my score. I shall need nothing but myown heart to fortify me in this resolution, and desire nothing in returnof it but that your care of yourself may answer to that which I shallalways have for your interests.I received your letter of the 10th of this month; and I hope this willfind you at your journey's end. In earnest, I have pitied your sisterextremely, and can easily apprehend how troublesome this voyage mustneeds be to her, by knowing what others have been to me; yet, prayassure her I would not scruple at undertaking it myself to gain such anacquaintance, and would go much farther than where (I hope) she now isto serve her. I am afraid she will not think me a fit person to choosefor a friend, that cannot agree with my own brother; but I must trustyou to tell my story for me, and will hope for a better character fromyou than he gives me; who, lest I should complain, resolves to preventme, and possess my friends first that he is the injured party. I nevermagnified my patience to you, but I begin to have a good opinion on'tsince this trial; yet, perhaps, I have no reason, and it may be as wella want of sense in me as of passion; however, you will not be displeasedto know that I can endure all that he or anybody else can say, and thatsetting aside my father's death and your absence, I make nothing anaffliction to me, though I am sorry, I confess, to see myself forc'd tokeep such distances with one of his relations, because religion andnature and the custom of world teaches otherwise. I see I shall not beable to satisfy you in this how I shall dispose of myself, for mybrother is not come; the next will certainly tell you. In the meantime,I expect with great impatience to hear of your safe arrival. 'Twas adisappointment that you missed those fair winds. I pleased myselfextremely with a belief that they had made your voyage rather adiversion than a trouble, either to you or your company, but I hope yourpassage was as happy, if not as sudden, as you expected it; let me hearoften from you, and long letters. I do not count this so. Have noapprehensions from me, but all the care of yourself that you please. Mymelancholy has no anger in it; and I believe the accidents of my lifewould work more upon any other than they do upon me, whose humour isalways more prepared for them than that of gayer persons. I hear nothingthat is worth your knowing; when I do, you shall know it. Tell me ifthere's anything I can do for you, and assure yourself I am perfectlyYours._Letter 56._--Temple has reached Dublin at last, and begins to writefrom there. This letter also is dated, and from this time forth there isless trouble in arranging the letters in order of date, as many of themhave, at least, the day of the month, if nothing more.The Marquis of Hertford was the Duke of Somerset's great-grandson. Hemarried Lady Arabella Stuart, daughter of Charles Stuart, Earl ofLennox, uncle of King James I, for which matrimonial adventure he wasimprisoned in the Tower. His second wife was Frances, daughter ofRobert, Earl of Essex, and sister to the great general of theParliamentary Army. She was the mother of young Lord Beauchamp, whosedeath Dorothy deplores. He was twenty-eight years of age when he died.He married Mary, daughter of Lord Capel of Hadham, who afterwardsmarried the Duke of Beaufort.Baptist Noel, Viscount Camden, was a noted loyalist. After theRestoration we find him appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Rutland. Of hisduel with Mr. Stafford there seems to be no account. It did not carryhim into the King's Bench Court, like Lord Chandos' duel, so history issilent about it._April the 2nd, 1654._SIR,--There was never any lady more surprised than I was with your last.I read it so coldly, and was so troubled to find that you were soforward on your journey; but when I came to the last, and saw Dublin atthe date, I could scarce believe my eyes. In earnest, it transported meso that I could not forbear expressing my joy in such a manner as hadanybody been by to have observed me they would have suspected me no verysober person.You are safe arrived, you say, and pleased with the place already, onlybecause you meet with a letter of mine there. In your next I expect someother commendation on't, or else I shall hardly make such haste to it aspeople here believe I will.All the servants have been to take their leaves on me, and say how sorrythey are to hear I am going out of the land; some beggar at the door hasmade so ill a report of Ireland to them that they pity me extremely, butyou are pleased, I hope, to hear I am coming to you; the next fair windexpect me. 'Tis not to be imagined the ridiculous stories they havemade, nor how J.B. cries out on me for refusing him and choosing hischamber-fellow; yet he pities me too, and swears I am condemned to bethe miserablest person upon earth. With all his quarrel to me, he doesnot wish me so ill as to be married to the proudest, imperious,insulting, ill-natured man that ever was; one that before he has had mea week shall use me with contempt, and believe that the favour was ofhis side. Is not this very comfortable? But, pray, make it no quarrel; Imake it none, I assure you. And though he knew you before I did, I donot think he knows you so well; besides that, his testimony is not ofmuch value.I am to spend this next week in taking leave of this country, and allthe company in't, perhaps never to see it more. From hence I must gointo Northamptonshire to my Lady Ruthin, and so to London, where I shallfind my aunt and my brother Peyton, betwixt whom I think to divide thissummer.Nothing has happened since you went worth your knowledge. My LordMarquis Hertford has lost his son, my Lord Beauchamp, who has left afine young widow. In earnest, 'tis great pity; at the rate of our youngnobility he was an extraordinary person, and remarkable for an excellenthusband. My Lord Cambden, too, has fought with Mr. Stafford, but there'sno harm done. You may discern the haste I'm in by my writing. There willcome a time for a long letter again, but there will never come anywherein I shall not beYours.[Sealed with black wax, and directed]     For Mr. William Temple,         at Sir John Temple's home              in Damask Street,                  Dublin.Thus Dorothy leaves Chicksands, her last words from her old home toTemple breathing her love and affection for him. It is no great sorrowat the moment to leave Chicksands, for its latest memories are scenesof sickness, grief, and death. And now the only home on earth forDorothy lies in the future; it is not a particular spot on earth, but tobe by his side, wherever that may be.CHAPTER VIVISITING. SUMMER 1654This chapter opens with a portion of a letter written by Sir WilliamTemple to his mistress, dated Ireland, May 18, 1654. It is the onlyletter, or rather scrap of letter which we have of his, and by some goodchance it has survived with the rest of Dorothy's letters. It will, Ithink, throw great light on his character as a lover, showing him tohave been ardent and ecstatic in his suit, making quite clear Dorothy'swisdom in insisting, as she often does, on the necessity of some morematerial marriage portion than mere love and hope. His reference to the"unhappy differences" strengthens my view that the letters of the formerchapter belong all to one date._Letter 57._--Letter of Sir William Temple._May 18th, 1654._... I am called upon for my letter, but must have leave first toremember you of yours. For God's sake write constantly while I am here,or I am undone past all recovery. I have lived upon them ever since Icame, but had thrived much better had they been longer. Unless you useto give me better measure, I shall not be in case to undertake a journeyto England. The despair I was in at not hearing from you last week, andthe belief that all my letters had miscarried (by some treachery amongmy good friends who, I am sorry, have the name of yours), made me pressmy father by all means imaginable to give me leave to go presently if Iheard not from you this post. But he would never yield to that, because,he said, upon your silence he should suspect all was not likely to bewell between us, and then he was sure I should not be in condition to bealone. He remembered too well the letters I writ upon our last unhappydifferences, and would not trust me from him in such another occasion.But, withal, he told me he would never give me occasion of anydiscontent which he could remedy; that if you desired my coming over,and I could not be content without, he would not hinder me, though hevery much desired my company a month or two longer, and that in thattime 'twas very likely I might have his as well.Now, in very good earnest, do you think 'tis time for me to come or no?Would you be very glad to see me there, and could you do it in lessdisorder, and with less surprise, than you did at Chicksands?I ask you these questions very seriously; but yet how willingly would Iventure all to be with you. I know you love me still; you promised me,and that's all the security I can have in this world. 'Tis that whichmakes all things else seem nothing to it, so high it sets me; and sohigh, indeed, that should I ever fall 'twould dash me all to pieces.Methinks your very charity should make you love me more now than ever,by seeing me so much more unhappy than I used, by being so much fartherfrom you, for that is all the measure can be taken of my good or illcondition. Justice, I am sure, will oblige you to it, since you have noother means left in the world of rewarding such a passion as mine,which, sure, is of a much richer value than anything in the worldbesides. Should you save my life again, should you make me absolutemaster of your fortune and your person too, I should accept none of allthis in any part of payment, but look upon you as one behindhand with mestill. 'Tis no vanity this, but a true sense of how pure and how refineda nature my passion is, which none can ever know except my own heart,unless you find it out by being there.How hard it is to think of ending when I am writing to you; but it mustbe so, and I must ever be subject to other people's occasions, and sonever, I think, master of my own. This is too true, both in respect ofthis fellow's post that is bawling at me for my letter, and of myfather's delays. They kill me; but patience,--would anybody but I werehere! Yet you may command me ever at one minute's warning. Had I notheard from you by this last, in earnest I had resolved to have gone withthis, and given my father the slip for all his caution. He tells mestill of a little time; but, alas! who knows not what mischances and howgreat changes have often happened in a little time?For God's sake let me hear of all your motions, when and where I mayhope to see you. Let us but hope this cloud, this absence that hasovercast all my contentment, may pass away, and I am confident there's aclear sky attends us. My dearest dear, adieu.Yours.Pray, where is your lodging? Have a care of all the despatch andsecurity that can be in our intelligence. Remember my fellow-servant;sure, by the next I shall write some learned epistle to her, I have beenso long about it._Letter 58._--Dorothy is now in London, staying probably with that auntwhom she mentioned before as one who was always ready to find her ahusband other than Temple. Of the plot against the Protector in which myLord of Dorchester is said to be engaged, an account is given inconnection with _Letter 59_; that is, presuming it to be the same plot,and that Lord Dorchester is one of the many persons arrested undersuspicion of being concerned in it. I cannot find anything whichidentifies him with a special plot.Lady Sandis [Sandys], who seems so fond of race meetings and other lessharmless amusements, was the wife of William Lord Sandys, and daughterof the Earl of Salisbury. Lord Sandys' country house was Motesfont orMottisfont Priory, in Hampshire, "which the King had given him inexchange for Chelsea, in Westminster." So says Leland, the antiquary andscholar, in his _Itinerary_; but it is a little puzzling to the modernmind with preconceived notions of Chelsea, to hear it spoken of as aseat or estate in Westminster. Colonel Tom Paunton is to me merely aname; and J. Morton is nothing more, unless we may believe him to be SirJohn Morton, Bart. of Milbourne, St. Andrew, in Nottinghamshire. Thisaddition of a local habitation and a name gives us no further knowledge,however, of the scandal to which Dorothy alludes.Mistress Stanley and Mistress Witherington have left no trace of theiridentity that I can find, but Mistress Philadelphia Carey is not whollyunknown. She was the second daughter of Thomas Carey, one of the Earl ofMonmouth's sons, and readers may be pleased to know that she did marrySir Henry Littleton.Of the scandal concerning Lord Rich I am not sorry to know nothing._May 25th_ [1654].This world is composed of nothing but contrarieties and suddenaccidents, only the proportions are not at all equal; for to a greatmeasure of trouble it allows so small a quantity of joy, that one maysee 'tis merely intended to keep us alive withal. This is a formalpreface, and looks as if there were something of very useful to follow;but I would not wish you to expect it. I was only considering my ownill-humour last night, I had not heard from you in a week or more, mybrother had been with me and we had talked ourselves both out of breathand patience too, I was not very well, and rose this morning onlybecause I was weary of lying in bed. When I had dined I took a coach andwent to see whether there was ever a letter for me, and was this once solucky as to find one. I am not partial to myself I know, and amcontented that the pleasure I have received with this, shall serve tosweeten many sad thoughts that have interposed since your last, and morethat I may reasonably expect before I have another; and I think I may(without vanity) say, that nobody is more sensible of the least goodfortune nor murmurs less at an ill than I do, since I owe it merely tocustom and not to any constancy in my humour, or something that isbetter. No, in earnest, anything of good comes to me like the sun to theinhabitants of Greenland, it raises them to life when they see it, andwhen they miss it, it is not strange they expect a night of half a yearlong.You cannot imagine how kindly I take it that you forgive my brother, andlet me assure you I shall never press you to anything unreasonable. Iwill not oblige you to court a person that has injured you. I only begthat whatsoever he does in that kind may be excused by his relation tome, and that whenever you are moved to think he does you wrong, you willat the same time remember that his sister loves you passionately andnobly; that if he values nothing but fortune, she despises it, and couldlove you as much a beggar as she could do a prince; and shall withoutquestion love you eternally, but whether with any satisfaction toherself or you is a sad doubt. I am not apt to hope, and whether it bethe better or the worse I know not. All sorts of differences are naturalto me, and that which (if your kindness would give you leave) you wouldterm a weakness in me is nothing but a reasonable distrust of my ownjudgment, which makes me desire the approbation of my friends. I neverhad the confidence in my life to presume anything well done that I hadnobody's opinion in but my own; and as you very well observe, there areso many that think themselves wise when nothing equals their folly buttheir pride, that I dread nothing so much as discovering such a thoughtin myself because of the consequences of it.Whenever you come you must not doubt your welcome, but I can promise younothing for the manner on't. I am afraid my surprise and disorder willbe more than ever. I have good reason to think so, and none that you cantake ill. But I would not have you attempt it till your father is readyfor the journey too. No, really he deserves that all your occasionsshould wait for his; and if you have not much more than an ordinaryobedience for him, I shall never believe you have more than an ordinarykindness for me; since (if you will pardon me the comparison) I believewe both merit it from you upon the same score, he as a very indulgentfather, and I as a very kind mistress. Don't laugh at me for commendingmyself, you will never do it for me, and so I am forced to it.I am still here in town, but had no hand, I can assure you, in the newdiscovered plot against the Protector. But my Lord of Dorchester, theysay, has, and so might I have had if I were as rich as he, and then youmight have been sure of me at the Tower;--now a worse lodging must servemy turn. 'Tis over against Salisbury House where I have the honour ofseeing my Lady M. Sandis every day unless some race or other carry herout of town. The last week she went to one as far as Winchester withCol. Paunton (if you know such a one), and there her husband met her,and because he did so (though it 'twere by accident) thought himselfobliged to invite her to his house but seven miles off, and verymodestly said no more for it, but that he thought it better than an Inn,or at least a crowded one as all in the town were now because of therace. But she was so good a companion that she would not forsake hercompany. So he invited them too, but could prevail with neither. Only myLady grew kind at parting and said, indeed if Tom Paunton and J. Mortonand the rest would have gone she could have been contented to have takenhis offer. Thus much for the married people, now for those that aretowards it.There is Mr. Stanley and Mrs. Witherington; Sir H. Littleton and Mrs.Philadelphia Carey, who in earnest is a fine woman, such a one as willmake an excellent wife; and some say my Lord Rich and my Lady BettyHoward, but others that pretend to know more say his court to her is butto countenance a more serious one to Mrs. Howard, her sister-in-law, henot having courage to pretend so openly (as some do) to another's wife.Oh, but your old acquaintance, poor Mr. Heningham, has no luck! He wasso near (as he thought at least) marrying Mrs. Gerherd that anybodymight have got his whole estate in wagers upon't that would haveventured but a reasonable proportion of their own. And now he looks morelike an ass than ever he did. She has cast him off most unhandsomely,that's the truth on't, and would have tied him to such conditions as hemight have been her slave withal, but could never be her husband. Is notthis a great deal of news for me that never stir abroad? Nay, I hadbrought me to-day more than all this: that I am marrying myself! And thepleasantness on't is that it should be to my Lord St. John. Would helook on me, think you, that had pretty Mrs. Fretcheville? My comfort is,I have not seen him since he was a widower, and never spoke to him in mylife. I found myself so innocent that I never blushed when they told itme. What would I give I could avoid it when people speak of you? Inearnest, I do prepare myself all that is possible to hear it spoken of,yet for my life I cannot hear your name without discovering that I ammore than ordinarily concerned in't. A blush is the foolishest thingthat can be, and betrays one more than a red nose does a drunkard; andyet I would not so wholly have lost them as some women that I know has,as much injury as they do me. I can assure you now that I shall be herea fortnight longer (they tell me no lodger, upon pain of his Highness'sdispleasure, must remove sooner); but when I have his leave I go intoSuffolk for a month, and then come hither again to go into Kent, where Iintend to bury myself alive again as I did in Bedfordshire, unless youcall me out and tell me I may be happy. Alas! how fain I would hope it,but I cannot, and should it ever happen, 'twould be long before I shouldbelieve 'twas meant for me in earnest, or that 'twas other than a dream.To say truth, I do not love to think on't, I find so many things to fearand so few to hope.'Tis better telling you that I will send my letters where you direct,that they shall be as long ones as possibly my time will permit, andwhen at any time you miss of one, I give you leave to imagine as manykind things as you please, and to believe I mean them all to you.Farewell._Letter 59._--It is a little astonishing to read, as one does in thisand the last letter, of race meetings, and Dorothy, habited in a mask,disporting herself at New Spring Gardens or in the Park. It opens one'seyes to the exaggerated gloom that has been thrown over England duringthe Puritan reign by those historians who have derived their informationsolely from State papers and proclamations. It is one thing to proclaimamusements, another to abolish them. The first was undoubtedly done,but we doubt if there was ever any long-continued effort to do the last;and in the latter part of Cromwell's reign the gloom, and thestrait-laced regulations that caused it, must have almost entirelydisappeared.Spring Gardens seems at one time to have had no very good reputation.Lady Alice Halkett, writing in 1644, tells us that "so scrupulous was Iof giving any occasion to speak of me as I know they did of others, thatthough I loved well to see plays, and to walk in the Spring Gardenssometimes (before it grew something scandalous by the abuses of some),yet I cannot remember three times that ever I went with any man besidesmy brother." However, fashions change in ten years, and Spring Gardensis, doubtless, now quite demure and respectable, or we should not findDorothy there. Spring Gardens was enclosed and laid out towards the endof the reign of James I. The clump of houses which still bears its nameis supposed to indicate its position with tolerable exactness. Evelyntells us that Cromwell shut up the Spring Gardens in 1600, and Knightthinks they were closed until the Restoration, in which small matter wemay allow Dorothy to correct him. The fact of the old gardens havingbeen closed may account for Dorothy referring to the place as "NewSpring Gardens." Knight also quotes at second hand from an account ofSpring Gardens, complaining that the author is unknown to him. Thisquotation is, however, from one of Somers' Tracts entitled "A Characterof England as it was lately represented in a Letter to a Nobleman ofFrance, 1659." The Frenchman by whom the letter is written--probably anEnglish satirist in disguise--gives us such a graphic account of theParks before the Restoration, that as the matter is fresh and bears uponthe subject, I have no hesitation in quoting it at length:--"I did frequently in the spring accompany my Lord N. into a field nearthe town which they call Hyde Park,--the place not unpleasant, and whichthey use as our '_Course_,' but with nothing that order, equipage, andsplendour; being such an assembly of wretched jades and hackney coaches,as, next to a regiment of car-men, there is nothing approaches theresemblance. The Park was, it seems, used by the late King and nobilityfor the freshness of the air and the goodly prospect, but it is thatwhich now (besides all other exercises) they pay for here in England,though it be free in all the world beside; every coach and horse whichenters buying his mouthful and permission of the publican who haspurchased it, for which the entrance is guarded with porters and longstaves."The manner is, as the company returns, to stop at the Spring Gardens socalled, in order to the Park as our _Thuilleries_ is to the _Course_;the inclosure not disagreeable for the solemnness of the groves, thewarbling of the birds, and as it opens into the spacious walks of St.James. But the company walk in it at such a rate as you would think allthe ladies were so many Atalantas contending with their wooers, and, myLord, there was no appearance that I should prove the Hippomenes, whocould with very much ado keep pace with them. But, as fast as they run,they stay there so long, as if they wanted not to finish the race, forit is usual here to find some of the young company till midnight, andthe thickets of the garden seem to be contrived to all the advantages ofgallantry after they have refreshed with the collation, which is hereseldom omitted, at a certain cabaret in the middle of this paradise,where the forbidden fruits are certain trifling tarts, neats' tongues,salacious meats, and bad Rhenish, for which the gallants pay sauce, asindeed they do at all such houses throughout England; for they think ita piece of frugality beneath them to bargain or account for what theyeat in any place, however unreasonably imposed upon."Dorothy is quite right in her correction concerning Will Spencer. He wasthe first Earl of Sunderland, and married Elizabeth, daughter of LordGerard._June the 6th, 1654._I see you know how to punish me. In earnest, I was so frightened withyour short letter as you cannot imagine, and as much troubled at thecause on't. What is it your father ails, and how long has he been ill?If my prayers are heard, he will not be so long. Why do you say I failedyou? Indeed, I did not. Jane is my witness. She carried my letter to theWhite Hart, by St. James's, and 'twas a very long one too. I carried onethither since, myself, and the woman of the house was so very angry,because I desired her to have a care on't, that I made the coachmandrive away with all possible speed, lest she should have beaten me. Tosay truth, I pressed her too much, considering how little the letterdeserved it. 'Twas writ in such disorder, the company prating about me,and some of them so bent on doing me little mischiefs, that I know notwhat I did, and believe it was the most senseless, disjointed thing thatever was read.I remember now that I writ Robin Spencer instead of Will. 'Tis he thathas married Mrs. Gerherd, and I admire their courage. She will haveeight hundred pounds a year, 'tis true, after her mother's death; buthow they will live till then I cannot imagine. I shall be even with youfor your short letter. I'll swear they will not allow me time foranything, and to show how absolutely I am governed I need but tell youthat I am every night in the Park and at New Spring Gardens, where,though I come with a mask, I cannot escape being known, nor myconversion being admired. Are you not in some fear what will become onme? These are dangerous courses. I do not find, though, that they havealtered me yet. I am much the same person at heart I was in beingYours._Letter 60.__June 13th_ [1654].You have satisfied me very much with this last long letter, and madesome amends for the short one I received before. I am convinced, too,happiness is much such a kind of thing as you describe, or rather such anothing. For there is no one thing can properly be called so, but everyone is left to create it to themselves in something which they eitherhave or would have; and so far it's well enough. But I do not like thatone's happiness should depend upon a persuasion that this is happiness,because nobody knows how long they shall continue in a belief built uponno grounds, only to bring it to what you say, and to make it absolutelyof the same nature with faith. We must conclude that nobody can eithercreate or continue such a belief in themselves; but where it is there ishappiness. And for my part at this present, I verily believe I couldfind it in the long walk at Dublin.You say nothing of your father's sickness, therefore I hope he is wellagain; for though I have a quarrel to him, it does not extend so far asto wish him ill. But he made no good return for the counsel I gave you,to say that there might come a time when my kindness might fail. Do notbelieve him, I charge you, unless you doubt yourself that you may giveme occasion to change; and when he tells you so again, engage what youplease upon't, and put it upon my account. I shall go out of town thisweek, and so cannot possibly get a picture drawn for you till I come upagain, which will be within these six weeks, but not to make any stay atall. I should be glad to find you here then. I would have had one drawnsince I came, and consulted my glass every morning when to begin; and tospeak freely to you that are my friend, I could never find my face in acondition to admit on't, and when I was not satisfied with it myself, Ihad no reason to hope that anybody else should. But I am afraid, as yousay, that time will not mend it, and therefore you shall have it as itis as soon as Mr. Cooper will vouchsafe to take the pains to draw it foryou.I am in great trouble to think how I shall write out of Suffolk to you,or receive yours. However, do not fail to write, though they lie awhile.I shall have them at last, and they will not be the less welcome; and,though you should miss of some of mine, let it not trouble you; but ifit be by my fault, I'll give you leave to demand satisfaction for itwhen you come. Jane kisses your hands, and says she will be ready in allplaces to do you service; but I'll prevent her, now you have put me intoa jealous humour. I'll keep her in chains before she shall quit scoreswith me. Do not believe, sir, I beseech you, that the young heirs arefor you; content yourself with your old mistress. You are not sohandsome as Will Spencer, nor I have not so much courage nor wealth ashis mistress, nor she has not so much as her aunt says by all the money.I shall not have called her his mistress now they have been marriedalmost this fortnight.I'll write again before I leave the town, and should have writ more now,but company is come in. Adieu, my dearest._Letter 61._--Lady Talmash was the eldest daughter of Mr. Murray,Charles I.'s page and whipping boy. She married Sir Lionel Talmash ofSuffolk, a gentleman of noble family. After her father's death, she tookthe title of Countess of Dysart, although there was some dispute aboutthe right of her father to any title. Bishop Burnet says: "She was awoman of great beauty, but of far greater parts. She had a wonderfulquickness of apprehension, and an amazing vivacity in conversation. Shehad studied not only divinity and history, but mathematics andphilosophy. She was violent in everything she set about,--a violentfriend, but a much more violent enemy. She had a restless ambition,lived at a vast expense, and was ravenously covetous; and would havestuck at nothing by which she might compass her ends. She had been earlyin a correspondence with Lord Lauderdale, that had given occasion tocensure. When he was a prisoner after Worcester fight, she made himbelieve he was in great danger of his life, and that she saved it by herintrigues with Cromwell, which was not a little taken notice of.Cromwell was certainly fond of her, and she took care to entertain himin it; till he, finding what was said upon it, broke it off. Upon theKing's Restoration she thought that Lord Lauderdale made not thosereturns she expected. They lived for some years at a distance. But uponher husband's death she made up all quarrels; so that Lord Lauderdaleand she lived so much together that his Lady was offended at it and wentto Paris, where she died about three years after." This was in 1672, andsoon afterwards Lady Dysart and Lord Lauderdale were married. She hadgreat power over him, and employed it in trafficking with such Statepatronage as was in Lord Lauderdale's power to bestow.Cousin Hammond, who was going to take Ludlow's place in Ireland, wouldbe the Colonel Robert Hammond who commanded Carisbrooke when the Kingwas imprisoned there. He was one of a new council formed in August andsent into Ireland about the end of that month.Lady Vavasour was Ursula, daughter of Walter Gifford of Chillington,Staffordshire. Her husband was Sir Thomas Vavasour, Bart. The Vavasourswere a Roman Catholic family, and claimed descent from those who heldthe ancient office of King's Valvasour; and we need not therefore besurprised to find Lady Vavasour engaged in one of the numerous plotsthat surrounded and endangered the Protector's power. The plot itselfseems to have created intense excitement in the capital, and resulted inthree persons being tried for high treason, and two executed,--JohnGerard, gentleman, Peter Vowel, schoolmaster of Islington, and oneSummerset Fox, who pleaded guilty, and whose life was spared. "Some wisemen," writes one Thomas Gower in a contemporary letter (stillunprinted), "believe that a couple of coy-ducks drew in the rest, thenrevealed all, and were employed to that purpose that the execution of afew mean persons might deter wiser and more considerable persons." Thisseems not improbable. On June 6th the official _Mercurius Politicus_speaks of this plot as follows:--"The traitorous conspiracy mentionedheretofore it appears every day more desperate and bloody. It isdiscovered that their design was to have destroyed his Highness'sperson, and all others at the helm of Government that they could havelaid hands on. Immediately upon the villainous assassination, theyintended to have proclaimed Charles Stuart by the assistance of atumult," etc. etc. This with constant accounts of further arreststroubles the public mind at this time.The passage of Cowley which Dorothy refers to is in the second book ofCowley's _Davideis_. It opens with a description of the friendshipbetween David and Jonathan, and, upon that occasion, a digressionconcerning the nature of love. The poem was written by Cowley when ayoung man at Cambridge. One can picture Dorothy reading and musing overlines like these with sympathy and admiration:          What art thou, love, thou great mysterious thing?          From what hid stock does thy strange nature spring?          'Tis thou that mov'st the world through ev'ry part,          And hold'st the vast frame close that nothing start          From the due place and office first ordained,          By thee were all things made and are sustained.          Sometimes we see thee fully and can say          From hence thou took'st thy rise and went'st that way,          But oft'ner the short beams of reason's eye          See only there thou art, not how, nor why.His lines on love, though overcharged with quaint conceits, are oftennoble and true, and end at least with one fine couplet:          Thus dost thou sit (like men e'er sin had framed          A guilty blush), naked but not ashamed.I promised in my last to write again before I went out of town, and nowI'll be as good as my word. They are all gone this morning, and haveleft me much more at liberty than I have been of late, therefore Ibelieve this will be a long letter; perhaps too long, at least if myletters are as little entertaining as my company is. I was carriedyesterday abroad to a dinner that was designed for mirth, but it seemsone ill-humoured person in the company is enough to put all the rest outof tune; for I never saw people perform what they intended worse, andcould not forbear telling them so: but to excuse themselves and silencemy reproaches, they all agreed to say that I spoiled their jollity bywearing the most unreasonable looks that could be put on for such anoccasion. I told them I knew no remedy but leaving me behind next time,and could have told them that my looks were suitable to my fortune,though not to a feast. Fye! I am got into my complaining humour thattires myself as well as everybody else, and which (as you observe) helpsnot at all. Would it would leave me, and then I could believe I shallnot always have occasion for it. But that's in nobody's power, and myLady Talmash, that says she can do whatsoever she will, cannot believewhatsoever she pleases. 'Tis not unpleasant, methinks, to hear her talk,how at such a time she was sick and the physicians told her she wouldhave the small-pox, and showed her where they were coming out upon her;but she bethought herself that it was not at all convenient for her tohave them at that time; some business she had that required her goingabroad, and so she resolved she would not be sick; nor was not. Twentysuch stories as these she tells; and then falls into discoveries ofstrength of reason and the power of philosophy, till she confoundsherself and all that hear her. You have no such ladies in Ireland?Oh me, but I heard to-day your cousin Hammond is going thither to be inLudlow's place. Is it true? You tell me nothing what is done there, but'tis no matter. The less one knows of State affairs I find it is thebetter. My poor Lady Vavasour is carried to the Tower, and her greatbelly could not excuse her, because she was acquainted by somebody thatthere was a plot against the Protector, and did not discover it. She hastold now all that was told her, but vows she will never say from whenceshe had it: we shall see whether her resolutions are as unalterable asthose of my Lady Talmash. I wonder how she behaved herself when she wasmarried. I never saw any one yet that did not look simply and out ofcountenance, nor ever knew a wedding well designed but one; and that wasof two persons who had time enough I confess to contrive it, and nobodyto please in't but themselves. He came down into the country where shewas upon a visit, and one morning married her. As soon as they came outof the church they took coach and came for the town, dined at an inn bythe way, and at night came into lodgings that were provided for themwhere nobody knew them, and where they passed for married people ofseven years' standing.The truth is I could not endure to be Mrs. Bride in a public wedding, tobe made the happiest person on earth. Do not take it ill, for I wouldendure it if I could, rather than fail; but in earnest I do not think itwere possible for me. You cannot apprehend the formalities of a treatymore than I do, nor so much the success on't. Yet in earnest, yourfather will not find my brother Peyton wanting in civility (though he isnot a man of much compliment, unless it be in his letters to me), nor anunreasonable person in anything, so he will allow him out of hiskindness to his wife to set a higher value upon her sister than shedeserves. I know not how he may be prejudiced as to the business, but heis not deaf to reason when 'tis civilly delivered, and is as easilygained with compliance and good usage as anybody I know, but by no otherway. When he is roughly dealt with, he is like me, ten times the worsefor't.I make it a case of conscience to discover my faults to you as fast as Iknow them, that you may consider what you have to do. My aunt told me nolonger agone than yesterday that I was the most wilful woman that evershe knew, and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome. Takeheed! you see I give you fair warning.I have missed a letter this Monday: What is the reason? By the next, Ishall be gone into Kent, and my other journey is laid aside, which I amnot displeased at, because it would have broken our intercourse verymuch.Here are some verses of Cowley's. Tell me how you like them. 'Tis only apiece taken out of a new thing of his; the whole is very long, and is adescription of, or rather a paraphrase upon the friendship of David andJonathan. 'Tis, I think, the best I have seen of his, and I like thesubject because 'tis that I would be perfect in. Adieu._Je suis vostre.__Letter 62.__June the 26th_ [1654].I told you in my last that my Suffolk journey was laid aside, and thatinto Kent hastened. I am beginning it to-day; and have chosen to go asfar as Gravesend by water, though it be very gloomy weather. If I drownby the way, this will be my last letter; and, like a will, I bequeathall my kindness to you in it, with a charge never to bestow it all uponanother mistress, lest my ghost rise again and haunt you. I am in suchhaste that I can say little else to you now. When you are come over,we'l' think where to meet, for at this distance I can design nothing;only I should be as little pleased with the constraint of my brother'shouse as you. Pray let me know whether your man leaves you, and how youstand inclined to him I offer you. Indeed, I like him extremely, and heis commended to me, by people that know him very well and are able tojudge, for a most excellent servant, and faithful as possible. I'll keephim unengaged till I hear from you. Adieu.My next shall make amends for this short one.[_P.S._]--I received your last of June 22nd since I sealed up my letter,and I durst not but make an excuse for another short one, after you havechid me so for those you have received already; indeed, I could not helpit, nor cannot now, but if that will satisfy I can assure you I shallmake a much better wife than I do a husband, if I ever am one. _Pardon,mon Cher Coeur, on m'attend. Adieu, mon Ame. Je vous souhait tout ce quevous desire.__Letter 63.__July the 4th_ [1654].Because you find fault with my other letters, this is like to be shorterthan they; I did not intend it so though, I can assure you. But lastnight my brother told me he did not send his till ten o'clock thismorning, and now he calls for mine at seven, before I am up; and I canonly be allowed time to tell you that I am in Kent, and in a house sostrangely crowded with company that I am weary as a dog already, thoughI have been here but three or four days; that all their mirth has notmended my humour, and that I am here the same I was in other places;that I hope, merely because you bid me, and lose that hope as often as Iconsider anything but yours. Would I were easy of belief! they say oneis so to all that one desires. I do not find it, though I am told I wasso extremely when I believed you loved me. That I would not find, andyou have only power to make me think it. But I am called upon. How fainI would say more; yet 'tis all but the saying with more circumstancethan I amYours.[Directed.] For your master._Letter 64._I see you can chide when you please, and with authority; but I deserveit, I confess, and all I can say for myself is, that my fault proceededfrom a very good principle in me. I am apt to speak what I think; and toyou have so accustomed myself to discover all my heart that I do notbelieve it will ever be in my power to conceal a thought from you.Therefore I am afraid you must resolve to be vexed with all my senselessapprehensions as my brother Peyton is with some of his wife's, who isthought a very good woman, but the most troublesome one in a coach thatever was. We dare not let our tongues lie more on one side of our mouthsthan t'other for fear of overturning it. You are satisfied, I hope, erethis that I 'scaped drowning. However, 'tis not amiss that my will madeyou know now how to dispose of all my wealth whensoever I die. But I amtroubled much you should make so ill a journey to so little purpose;indeed, I writ by the first post after my arrival here, and cannotimagine how you came to miss of my letters. Is your father returned yet,and do you think of coming over immediately? How welcome you will be.But, alas! I cannot talk on't at the rate that you do. I am sensiblethat such an absence is misfortune enough, but I dare not promise myselfthat it will conclude ours; and 'tis more my belief that you yourselfspeak it rather to encourage me, and to your wishes than your hopes.My humour is so ill at present, that I dare say no more lest you chideme again. I find myself fit for nothing but to converse with a ladybelow, that is fallen out with all the world because her husband and shecannot agree. 'Tis the pleasantest thing that can be to hear usdiscourse. She takes great pains to dissuade me from ever marrying, andsays I am the veriest fool that ever lived if I do not take her counsel.Now we do not absolutely agree in that point, but I promise her never tomarry unless I can find such a husband as I describe to her, and shebelieves is never to be found; so that, upon the matter, we differ verylittle. Whensoever she is accused of maintaining opinions verydestructive of society, and absolutely prejudicial to all the youngpeople of both sexes that live in the house, she calls out me to be hersecond, and by it has lost me the favour of all our young gallants, whohave got a custom of expressing anything that is nowhere but in fictionby the name of "Mrs. O----'s husband." For my life I cannot beat intotheir heads a passion that must be subject to no decay, an even perfectkindness that must last perpetually, without the least intermission.They laugh to hear me say that one unkind word would destroy all thesatisfaction of my life, and that I should expect our kindness shouldincrease every day, if it were possible, but never lessen. All this isperfect nonsense in their opinion; but I should not doubt the convincingthem if I could hope to be so happy as to beYours._Letter 65._--Of William Lilly, a noted and extraordinary character ofthat day, the following account is taken from his own _Life and Times_,a lively book, full of amusing lies and astrological gossip, in whichthe author describes himself as a student of the Black Art. He was bornin 1602 at Diseworth, an obscure town in the north of Leicestershire.His family appear to have been yeomen in this town for many generations.Passing over the measles of his infancy, and other trivial details ofchildhood, which he describes minutely, we find him as a boy atAshby-de-la-Zouche, where he is the pupil of one Mr. John Brinsley. Herehe learned Latin and Greek, and began to study Hebrew. In the sixteenthyear of his age he was greatly troubled with dreams concerning hisdamnation or salvation; and at the age of eighteen he returned to hisfather's house, and there kept a school in great penury. He then appearsto have come up to London, leaving his father in a debtor's prison, andproceeded in pursuit of fortune with a new suit of clothes and sevenshillings and sixpence in his pocket. In London he entered the serviceof one Gilbert Wright, an independent citizen of small means and smallereducation. To him Lilly was both man-servant and secretary. The secondMrs. Wright seems to have had a taste for astrology, and consulted someof the quacks who then preyed on the silly women of the city. She wasvery fond of young Lilly, who attended her in her last illness, and, inreturn for his care and attention, she bequeathed to him several"sigils" or talismanic seals. Probably it was the foolishness of thispoor woman that first suggested to Lilly the advantages to be gainedfrom the profession of astrology. Mr. Wright married a third wife, andsoon afterwards died, leaving his widow comfortably off. She fell inlove with Lilly, who married her in 1627, and for five years, until herdeath, they lived happily together. Lilly was now a man of means, andwas enabled to study that science which he afterwards practised with somuch success. There were a good many professors of the black art atthis date, and Lilly studied under one Evans, a scoundrelly ex-parsonfrom Wales, until, according to Lilly's own account, he discovered Evansto be the cheat he undoubtedly was. Lilly, when he set up for himself,wrote many astrological works, which seem to have been very successful.He was known and visited by all the great men of the day, and probablyhad brains enough only to prophesy when he knew. His description of hispolitical creed is beautifully characteristic of the man: "I was moreCavalier than Round-head, and so taken notice of; but afterwards Iengaged body and soul in the cause of the Parliament, but still withmuch affection to his Majesty's person and unto Monarchy, which I everloved and approved beyond any government whatsoever." Lilly was, in aword, a self-seeking but successful knave. People who had been robbed,women in love, men in debt, all in trouble and doubt, from the Kingdownwards, sought his aid. He pretended to be a man of science, not aman gifted with supernatural powers. Whether he succeeded in believingin astrology and deceiving himself, it is impossible to say; he wasprobably too clever for that, but he deceived others admirably, and wasone of the noted and most successful of the old astrologers.How long this letter will be I cannot tell. You shall have all the timethat is allowed me, but upon condition that you shall not examine thesense on't too strictly, for you must know I want sleep extremely. Thesun was up an hour before I went to bed to-day, and this is not thefirst time I have done this since I came hither. 'Twill not be for youradvantage that I should stay here long; for, in earnest, I shall be goodfor nothing if I do. We go abroad all day and play all night, and sayour prayers when we have time. Well, in sober earnest now, I would notlive thus a twelvemonth to gain all that the King has lost, unless itwere to give it him again. 'Tis a miracle to me how my brother enduresit. 'Tis as contrary to his humour as darkness is to light, and onlyshows the power he lets his wife have over him. Will you be sogood-natured? He has certainly as great a kindness for her as can be,and, to say truth, not without reason; but all the people that ever Isaw, I do not like his carriage towards her. He is perpetually wranglingand finding fault, and to a person that did not know him would appearthe worst husband and the most imperious in the world. He is so amongsthis children too, though he loves them passionately. He has one son, and'tis the finest boy that e'er you saw, and has a noble spirit, but yetstands in that awe of his father that one word from him is as much astwenty whippings.You must give me leave to entertain you thus with discourses of thefamily, for I can tell you nothing else from hence. Yet, now I remember.I have another story for you. You little think I have been with Lilly,and, in earnest, I was, the day before I came out of town; and what doyou think I went for? Not to know when you would come home, I can assureyou, nor for any other occasion of my own; but with a cousin of minethat had long designed to make herself sport with him, and did not missof her aim. I confess I always thought him an impostor, but I couldnever have imagined him so simple a one as we found him. In my life Inever heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us, and no old womanwho passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to sayto reasonable people than he was. He asked us more questions than we didhim, and caught at everything we said without discerning that we abusedhim and said things purposely to confound him; which we did so perfectlythat we made him contradict himself the strangest that ever you saw.Ever since this adventure, I have had so great a belief in all things ofthis nature, that I could not forbear laying a peas-cod with nine peasin't under my door yesterday, and was informed by it that my husband'sname should be Thomas. How do you like that? But what Thomas, I cannotimagine, for all the servants I have got since I came hither I know noneof that name.Here is a new song,--I do not send it to you but to your sister; thetune is not worth the sending so far. If she pleases to put any to it, Iam sure it will be a better than it has here. Adieu._Letter 66._--"The Lost Lady" is a tragi-comedy by Sir William Berkely,and is advertised to be sold at the shop of the Holy Lamb in the year1639, which we may take as the probable date of its publication. Dorothywould play Hermione, the heroine. We can imagine her speaking withsympathetic accent lines such as these:          With what harsh fate does Heaven afflict me          That all the blessings which make others happy,          Must be my ruin?The five Portugals to whom Dorothy refers as being hanged were thePortuguese ambassador's brother, Don Pantaleon Sa, and four of his men.The _Mercurius Politicus_ of November 1653 gives the following accountof the matters that led to the execution; and as it is illustrative ofthe manners of the day, the account is here quoted at length:--"NEW EXCHANGE IN THE STRAND. _November 21._--In the evening therehappened a quarrel between the Portugal ambassador's brother and two orthree others of that nation with one Mr. Gerard, an English gentleman,whom they all fell upon; but he being rescued out of their hands by oneMr. Anstruther, they retired home, and within an hour after returnedwith about twelve more of their nation, armed with breastplates andheadpieces; but after two or three hours taken there, not findingAnstruther, they went home again for that night."_November 22._--At night the ambassador's brother and the rest returnedagain, and walking the upper Exchange, they met with one Col. Mayo, who,being a proper man, they supposed him to have been the same Anstrutherthat repelled them the night before; and so shooting off a pistol (whichwas as the watchword), the rest of the Portugals (supposed about fifty)came in with drawn swords, and leaving a sufficient number to keep thestairs, the rest went up with the ambassador's brother, and there theyfell upon Col. Mayo, who, very gallantly defending himself, receivedseven dangerous wounds, and lies in a mortal condition. They fell alsoupon one Mr. Greenway, of Lincoln's Inn, as he was walking with hissister in one hand and his mistress in the other (to whom, as I aminformed, he was to have been married on Tuesday next), and pistoled himin the head, whereof he died immediately. They brought with them severalearthen jars stuffed with gunpowder, stopped with wax, and fitted withmatches, intending, it seems, to have done some mischief to the Exchangethat they might complete their revenge, but they were prevented."There is an account of their trial in the _State Trials_, of someinterest to lawyers; it resulted in the execution of Don Pantaleon Saand four of his servants. By one of those curious fateful coincidences,with which fact often outbids fiction, Mr. Gerard, who was the firstEnglishman attacked by the Portuguese, suffers on the same scaffold ashis would-be murderers, his offence being high treason. Vowel, the otherplotter, is also executed, but the third saves himself, as we know, byconfession._July 20th_ [1654 in pencil].I am very sorry I spoke too late, for I am confident this was anexcellent servant. He was in the same house where I lay, and I had takena great fancy to him, upon what was told me of him and what I saw. Thepoor fellow, too, was so pleased that I undertook to inquire out a placefor him, that, though mine was, as I told him, uncertain, yet upon thebare hopes on't he refused two or three good conditions; but I shall sethim now at liberty, and not think at all the worse of him for hisgood-nature. Sure you go a little too far in your condemnation on't. Iknow it may be abused, as the best things are most subject to be, but initself 'tis so absolutely necessary that where it is wanting nothing canrecompense the miss on't. The most contemptible person in the world, ifhe has that, cannot be justly hated, and the most considerable withoutit cannot deserve to be loved. Would to God I had all that good-natureyou complain you have too much of, I could find ways enough to disposeon't amongst myself and my friends; but 'tis well where it is, and Ishould sooner wish you more on't than less.I wonder with what confidence you can complain of my short letters thatare so guilty yourself in the same kind. I have not seen a letter thismonth which has been above half a sheet. Never trust me if I write morethan you that live in a desolated country where you might finish aromance of ten tomes before anybody interrupted you--I that live in ahouse the most filled of any since the Ark, and where, I can assure[you], one has hardly time for the most necessary occasions. Well, therewas never any one thing so much desired and apprehended at the same timeas your return is by me; it will certainly, I think, conclude me a veryhappy or a most unfortunate person. Sometimes, methinks, I would fainknow my doom whatever it be; and at others, I dread it so extremely,that I am confident the five Portugals and the three plotters which weret'other day condemned by the High Court of Justice had not half my fearsupon them. I leave you to judge the constraint I live in, what alarms mythoughts give me, and yet how unconcerned this company requires I shouldbe; they will have me at my part in a play, "The Lost Lady" it is, and Iam she. Pray God it be not an ill omen!I shall lose my eyes and you this letter if I make it longer. Farewell.I am, yours._Letter 67._--Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, was the daughter of James I.She married the Elector Frederick, who was driven from his throne owingto his own misconduct and folly, when his wife was forced to return andlive as a pensioner in her native country. She is said to have beengifted in a superlative degree with all that is considered most lovelyin a woman's character. On her husband's death in 1632 she went to liveat the Hague, where she remained until the Restoration. There is areport that she married William, Earl of Craven, but there is no proofof this. He was, however, her friend and adviser through her years ofwidowhood, and it was to his house in Drury Lane that she returned tolive in 1661. She is said to have been a lover of literature, andFrancis Quarles and Sir Henry Wotton were her intimate friends. Thelatter has written some quaint and elegant verses to his mistress; thelast verse, in which he apostrophizes her as the sun, is peculiarlygraceful. It runs thus:          You meaner beauties of the night,            That poorly satisfy our eyes,          More by your number than your light,--            You common people of the skies,            What are you when the sun shall rise?But the sun is set, and the beautiful Queen's sad, romantic story almostforgotten.Sir John Grenvile was a son of the valiant and loyal cavalier, Sir BevilGrenvile, of Kelkhampton, Cornwall. He served the King successfully inthe west of England, and was dangerously wounded at Newbury. He wasentrusted by Charles II. to negotiate with General Monk. Monk's brotherwas vicar of Kelkhampton, so that Grenvile and Monk would in allprobability be well acquainted before the time of the negotiation. Wemay remember, too, that Dorothy's younger brother was on intimate termswith General Monk's relations in Cornwall.There must be letters missing here, for we cannot believe more than amonth passed without Dorothy writing a single letter.I wonder you did not come before your last letter. 'Twas dated the 24thof August, but I received it not till the 1st of September. Would to Godyour journey were over! Every little storm of wind frights me so, that Ipass here for the greatest coward that ever was born, though, inearnest, I think I am as little so as most women, yet I may be deceived,too, for now I remember me you have often told me I was one, and, sure,you know what kind of heart mine is better than anybody else.I am glad you are pleased with that description I made you of my humour,for, though you had disliked it, I am afraid 'tis past my power to help.You need not make excuses neither for yours; no other would please mehalf so well. That gaiety which you say is only esteemed would beinsupportable to me, and I can as little endure a tongue that's alwaysin motion as I could the click of a mill. Of all the company this placeis stored with, there is but two persons whose conversation is at alleasy; one is my eldest niece, who, sure, was sent into the world to show'tis possible for a woman to be silent; the other, a gentleman whosemistress died just when they should have married; and though 'tis manyyears since, one may read it in his face still. His humour was verygood, I believe, before that accident, for he will yet say thingspleasant enough, but 'tis so seldom that he speaks at all, and when hedoes 'tis with so sober a look, that one may see he is not moved at allhimself when he diverts the company most. You will not be jealous thoughI say I like him very much. If you were not secure in me, you might beso in him. He would expect his mistress should rise again to reproachhis inconstancy if he made court to anything but her memory. Methinks wethree (that is, my niece, and he and I) do become this house the worstthat can be, unless I should take into the number my brother Peytonhimself too; for to say truth his, for another sort of melancholy, isnot less than ours. What can you imagine we did this last week, when toour constant company there was added a colonel and his lady, a son ofhis and two daughters, a maid of honour to the Queen of Bohemia, andanother colonel or a major, I know not which, besides all the tonguethey brought with them; the men the greatest drinkers that ever I saw,which did not at all agree with my brother, who would not be drawn to itto save a kingdom if it lay at stake and no other way to redeem it? But,in earnest, there was one more to be pitied besides us, and that wasColonel Thornhill's wife, as pretty a young woman as I have seen. She isSir John Greenvil's sister, and has all his good-nature, with a greatdeal of beauty and modesty, and wit enough. This innocent creature issacrificed to the veriest beast that ever was. The first day she camehither he intended, it seems, to have come with her, but by the waycalled in to see an old acquaintance, and bid her go on, he wouldovertake her, but did not come till next night, and then so drunk he wasled immediately to bed, whither she was to follow him when she hadsupped. I blest myself at her patience, as you may do that I could findanything to fill up this paper withal. Adieu._Letter 68._--In this scrap of writing we find that Temple is again inEngland with certain proposals from his father, and ready to discuss the"treaty," as Dorothy calls it, with her brother Peyton. The fewremaining letters deal with the treaty. Temple would probably return toLondon when he left Ireland, and letters would pass frequently betweenthem. There seems to have been some hitch as to who should appear inthe treaty. Dorothy's brother had spoken of and behaved to Temple withall disrespect, but, now that he is reconciled to the marriage, Dorothywould have him appear, at least formally, in the negotiations. The lastletter of this chapter, which is dated October 2nd, calls on Temple tocome down to Kent, to Peyton's house; and it is reasonable to supposethat at this interview all was practically settled to the satisfactionof those two who were most deeply concerned in the negotiation.I did so promise myself a letter on Friday that I am very angry I had itnot, though I know you were not come to town when it should have beenwrit. But did not you tell me you should not stay above a day or two?What is it that has kept you longer? I am pleased, though, that you areout of the power of so uncertain things as the winds and the sea, whichI never feared for myself, but did extremely apprehend for you. You willfind a packet of letters to read, and maybe have met with them already.If you have, you are so tired that 'tis but reasonable I should spareyou in this. For, [to] say truth, I have not time to make this longer;besides that if I had, my pen is so very good that it writes aninvisible hand, I think; I am sure I cannot read it myself. If your eyesare better, you will find that I intended to assure you I amYours._Letter 69._I am but newly waked out of an unquiet sleep, and I find it so late thatif I write at all it must be now. Some company that was here last nightkept us up till three o'clock, and then we lay three in a bed, which wasall the same to me as if we had not gone to bed at all. Since dinnerthey are all gone, and our company with them part of the way, and withmuch ado I got to be excused, that I might recover a little sleep, butam so moped yet that, sure, this letter will be nonsense.I would fain tell you, though, that your father is mistaken, and thatyou are not, if you believe that I have all the kindness and tendernessfor you my heart is capable of. Let me assure you (whatever your fatherthinks) that had you L20,000 a year I could love you no more than I do,and should be far from showing it so much lest it should look like adesire of your fortune, which, as to myself, I value as little asanybody in the world, and in this age of changes; but certainly I knowwhat an estate is. I have seen my father's reduced, better than L4000,to not L400 a year, and I thank God I never felt the change in anythingthat I thought necessary. I never wanted, nor am confident I nevershall. But yet, I would not be thought so inconsiderate a person as notto remember that it is expected from all people that have sense thatthey should act with reason, that to all persons some proportion offortune is necessary, according to their several qualities, and thoughit is not required that one should tie oneself to just so much, andsomething is left for one's inclination, and the difference in thepersons to make, yet still within such a compass,--and such as lay moreupon these considerations than they will bear, shall infallibly becondemned by all sober persons. If any accident out of my power shouldbring me to necessity though never so great, I should not doubt withGod's assistance but to bear it as well as anybody, and I should neverbe ashamed on't if He pleased to send it me; but if by my own folly Ihad put it upon myself, the case would be extremely altered. If everthis comes to a treaty, I shall declare that in my own choice I preferyou much before any other person in the world, and all that thisinclination in me (in the judgment of any persons of honour anddiscretion) will bear, I shall desire may be laid upon it to theuttermost of what they can allow. And if your father please to make upthe rest, I know nothing that is like to hinder me from being yours. Butif your father, out of humour, shall refuse to treat with such friendsas I have, let them be what they will, it must end here; for though Iwas content, for your sake, to lose them, and all the respect they hadfor me, yet, now I have done that, I'll never let them see that I haveso little interest in you and yours as not to prevail that my brothermay be admitted to treat for me. Sure, when a thing of course and somuch reason as that (unless I did disclose to all the world he were myenemy), it must be expected whensoever I dispose of myself he should bemade no stranger to it. When that shall be refused me, I may be justlyreproached that I deceived myself when I expected to be at all valued ina family that I am a stranger to, or that I should be considered withany respect because I had a kindness for you, that made me not value myown interests.I doubt much whether all this be sense or not; I find my head so heavy.But that which I would say is, in short, this: if I did say once that mybrother should have nothing to do in't, 'twas when his carriage towardsme gave me such an occasion as could justify the keeping that distancewith him; but now it would look extremely unhandsome in me, and, sure, Ihope your father would not require it of me. If he does, I must concludehe has no value for me, and, sure, I never disobliged him to myknowledge, and should, with all the willingness imaginable, serve him ifit lay in my power.Good God! what an unhappy person am I. All the world is so almost. Justnow they are telling me of a gentleman near us that is the most wretchedcreature made (by the loss of a wife that he passionately loved) thatcan be. If your father would but in some measure satisfy my friends thatI might but do it in any justifiable manner, you should dispose me asyou pleased, carry me whither you would, all places of the world wouldbe alike to me where you were, and I should not despair of carryingmyself so towards him as might deserve a better opinion from him.I am yours._Letter 70._My doubts and fears were not at all increased by that which gives you somany, nor did I apprehend that your father might not have been prevailedwith to have allowed my brother's being seen in the treaty; for as tothe thing itself, whether he appears in't or not, 'twill be the same. Hecannot but conclude my brother Peyton would not do anything in itwithout the others' consent.I do not pretend to any share in your father's kindness, as havingnothing in me to merit it; but as much a stranger as I am to him, Ishould have taken it very ill if I had desired it of him, and he hadrefused it me. I do not believe my brother has said anything to hisprejudice, unless it were in his persuasions to me, and there it did notinjure him at all. If he takes it ill that my brother appears so veryaverse to the match, I may do so too, that he was the same; and nothingless than my kindness for you could have made me take so patiently as Idid his saying to some that knew me at York that he was forced to bringyou thither and afterwards to send you over lest you should have marriedme. This was not much to my advantage, nor hardly civil, I think, to anywoman; yet I never so much as took the least notice on't, nor had notnow, but for this occasion; yet, sure, it concerns me to be at least asnice as he in point of honour. I think 'tis best for me to end here lestmy anger should make me lose that respect I would always have for yourfather, and 'twere not amiss, I think, that I devoted it all towards youfor being so idle as to run out of your bed to catch such a cold.If you come hither you must expect to be chidden so much that you willwish that you had stayed till we came up, when perhaps I might havealmost forgot half my quarrel to you. At this present I can assure you Iam pleased with nobody but your sister, and her I love extremely, andwill call her pretty; say what you will, I know she must be so, though Inever saw more of her than what her letters show. She shall have two"spots" [carriage dogs] if she please (for I had just such another givenme after you were gone), or anything else that is in the power ofYours._Letter 71.__Monday, October the 2nd_ [1654].After a long debate with myself how to satisfy you and remove that rock(as you call it), which in your apprehensions is of so great danger, Iam at last resolved to let you see that I value your affections for meat as high a rate as you yourself can set it, and that you cannot havemore of tenderness for me and my interests than I shall ever have foryours. The particulars how I intend to make this good you shall knowwhen I see you; which since I find them here more irresolute in point oftime (though not as to the journey itself) than I hoped they would havebeen, notwithstanding your quarrel to me, and the apprehension you wouldmake me believe you had that I do not care to see you, pray come hitherand try whether you shall be welcome or not! In sober earnest now I mustspeak with you; and to that end if your occasions will [serve] come downto Canterbury. Send some one when you are there, and you shall havefurther directions.You must be contented not to stay here above two or three hours. I shalltell you my reason when you come. And pray inform yourself of all thatyour father will do on this occasion, that you may tell it me only;therefore let it be plainly and sincerely what he intends and all.I will not hinder your coming away so much as the making this letter alittle longer might take away from your time in reading it. 'Tis enoughto tell you I am everYours.CHAPTER VIITHE END OF THE THIRD VOLUMEThis short series of notes was written, I think, during a visit toLondon after the formal betrothal and before the marriage. These noteswere evidently written upon the trivial occasions of the day, moreperhaps for the sake of writing something than for any more seriousreason. The note in French is somewhat of a curiosity on account of itsquaint orthography, which is purposely left uncorrected. Was Dorothy inLondon to purchase her _trousseau_? Where did she and Jane spend theirdays, if that was the case, when Regent Street was green fields? Thesequestions cannot be satisfactorily answered; but the notes themselves,without any history or explanation, are so full of interest, so freshand vivacious, even for Dorothy, that they place themselves from thefreedom and joy of their style and manner at the end of the thirdvolume.You are like to have an excellent housewife of me; I am abed still, andslept so soundly, nothing but your letter could have waked me. You shallhear from me as soon as we have dined. Farewell; can you endure thatword? No, out upon't. I'll see you anon.Fye upon't I shall grow too good now, I am taking care to know how yourworship slept to-night; better I hope than you did the last. Send me wordhow you do, and don't put me off with a bit of a note now; you couldwrite me a fine long letter when I did not deserve it half so well.You are mistaken if you think I am in debt for both these days. SaturdayI confess was devoted to my Lady; but yesterday, though I ris with goodintentions of going to church, my cold would not suffer me, but kept meprisoner all the day. I went to your lodging to tell you that visitingthe sick was part of the work of the day, but you were gone, and so Iwent to bed again, where your letter found me this morning. But now Iwill rise and despatch some visits that I owe, that to-morrow may beentirely yours.I find my conscience a little troubled till I have asked your pardon formy ill-humour last night. Will you forgive it me; in earnest, I couldnot help it, but I met with a cure for it; my brother kept me up to hearhis learned lecture till after two o'clock, and I spent all myill-humour upon him, and yet we parted very quietly, and look'd as if alittle good fortune might make us good friends; but your special friend,my elder brother, I have a story to tell you of him. Will my cousin F.come, think you? Send me word, it maybe 'twas a compliment; if I can seeyou this morning I will, but I dare not promise it.SIR,--This is to tell you that you will be expected to-morrow morningabout nine o'clock at a lodging over against the place where CharingeCrosse stood, and two doors above Ye Goate Taverne; if with thesedirections you can find it out, you will there find one that is verymuchYour servant.Now I have got the trick of breaking my word, I shall do it every day. Imust go to Roehampton to-day, but 'tis all one, you do not care much forseeing me. Well, my master, remember last night you swaggered like ayoung lord. I'll make your stomach come down; rise quickly, you hadbetter, and come hither that I may give you a lesson this morning beforeI go.Je n'ay guere plus dormie que vous et mes songes n'ont pas estres moinsconfuse, au rest une bande de violons que sont venu jouer sous mafennestre, m'out tourmentes de tel facon que je doubt fort si jepourrois jamais les souffrire encore, je ne suis pourtant pas en fortmauvaise humeur et je m'en-voy ausi tost que je serai habillee voire cequ'il est posible de faire pour vostre sattisfaction, apres je viendrevous rendre conte de nos affairs et quoy qu'il en sera vous ne scauroisjamais doubte que je ne vous ayme plus que toutes les choses du monde.I have slept as little as you, and may be allowed to talk asunreasonably, yet I find I am not quite senseless; I have a heart stillthat cannot resolve to refuse you anything within its power to grant.But, Lord, when shall I see you? People will think me mad if I go abroadthis morning after having seen me in the condition I was in last night,and they will think it strange to see you here. Could you not stay tillthey are all gone to Roehampton? they go this morning. I do but ask,though do what you please, only believe you do a great injustice if youthink me false. I never resolv'd to give you an eternal farewell, but Iresolv'd at the same time to part with all the comfort of my life, andwhether I told it you or not I shall die yours.Tell me what you will have me do.Here comes the note again to tell you I cannot call on you to-night; Icannot help it, and you must take it as patiently as you can, but I amengaged to-night at the Three Rings to sup and play. Poor man, I amsorry for you; in earnest, I shall be quite spoiled. I see no remedy;think whether it were not best to leave me and begin a new adventure.And now we have finished. Dorothy Osborne is passing away, will soon betranslated into Dorothy Temple; with the romance of her life all pasthistory, and fast becoming as much a romance to herself, as it seems tous, looking back at it after more than two centuries. Something it isbecoming to her over which she can muse and dream and weave into talesfor the children who will gather round her. Something the reality ofwhich will grow doubtful to her, if she find idle hours for dreaming anddoubting in her new name. Her last lover's letter is written. We areready for the marriage ceremony, and listen for the wedding march andhappy jingle of village bells; or if we may not have these in Puritandays, at least we may hear the pompous magistrate pronounce the blessingof the State over its two happy subjects. But no! There is yet a momentof suspense, a last trial to the lover's constancy. The bride is takendangerously ill, so dangerously ill that the doctors rejoice when thedisease pronounces itself to be small-pox. Alas! who shall now say whatare the inmost thoughts of our Dorothy? Does she not need all her faithin her lover, in herself, ay, and in God, to uphold her in this newaffliction? She rises from her bed, her beauty of face destroyed; herfair looks living only on the painter's canvas, unless we may believethat they were etched in deeply bitten lines on Temple's heart. But theskin beauty is not the firmest hold she has on Temple's affections; thiswas not the beauty that had attracted her lover and held him enchainedin her service for seven years of waiting and suspense; this was not theonly light leading him through dark days of doubt, almost of despair,constant, unwavering in his troth to her. Other beauty not outward, ofwhich we, too, may have seen something, mirrowed darkly in theseletters; which we, too, as well as Temple, may know existed in Dorothy.For it is not beauty of face and form, but of what men call the soul,that made Dorothy to Temple, in fact as she was in name,--the gift ofGod.AppendixLADY TEMPLEOf Lady Temple there is very little to be known, and what there is canbe best understood by following the career of her husband, which hasbeen written at some length, and with laboured care, by Mr. Courtenay.After her marriage, which took place in London, January 31st, 1655, theylived for a year at the home of a friend in the country. They thenremoved to Ireland, where they lived for five years with Temple'sfather; Lady Giffard, Temple's widowed sister, joining them. In 1663they were living in England. Lady Giffard continued to live with themthrough the rest of their lives, and survived them both. In 1665 Templewas sent to Brussels as English representative, and his family joinedhim in the following year. In 1668 he was removed from Brussels to theHague, where the successful negotiations which led to the TripleAlliance took place, and these have given him an honourable place inhistory. There is a letter of Lady Temple's, written to her husband in1670, which shows how interested she was in the part he took inpolitical life, and how he must have consulted her in all Statematters. It is taken from Courtenay's _Life of Sir William Temple_,vol. i. p. 345. He quotes it as the only letter written after LadyTemple's marriage which has come into his hands.THE HAGUE, _October 31st, 1670_.My Dearest Heart,--I received yours from Yarmouth, and was very glad youmade so happy a passage. 'Tis a comfortable thing, when one is on thisside, to know that such a thing can be done in spite of contrary winds.I have a letter from P., who says in character that you may take it fromhim that the Duke of Buckingham has begun a negotiation there, but whatsuccess in England he may have he knows not; that it were to be wishedour politicians at home would consider well that there is no trust to beput in alliances with ambitious kings, especially such as make it theirfundamental maxim to be base. These are bold words, but they are hisown. Besides this, there is nothing but that the French King grows verythrifty, that all his buildings, except fortifications, are ceased, andthat his payments are not so regular as they used to be. The people hereare of another mind; they will not spare their money, but areresolved--at least the States of Holland--if the rest will consent, toraise fourteen regiments of foot and six of horse; that all thecompanies, both old and new, shall be of 120 men that used to be of 50,and every troop 80 that used to be of 45. Nothing is talked of but thesenew levies, and the young men are much pleased. Downton says they havestrong suspicions here you will come back no more, and that they shallbe left in the lurch; that something is striking up with France, andthat you are sent away because you are too well inclined to thesecountries; and my cousin Temple, he says, told him that a nephew of SirRobert Long's, who is lately come to Utrecht, told my cousin Temple,three weeks since, you were not to stay long here, because you were toogreat a friend to these people, and that he had it from Mr. Williamson,who knew very well what he said. My cousin Temple says he told it toMajor Scott as soon as he heard it, and so 'tis like you knew it before;but there is such a want of something to say that I catch at everything.I am my best dear's most affectionateD.T.In the summer of 1671 there occurred an incident that reminds usconsiderably of the Dorothy Osborne of former days. The Triple Alliancehad lost some of its freshness, and was not so much in vogue asheretofore. Charles II. had been coquetting with the French King, and atlength the Government, throwing off its mask, formally displaced Templefrom his post in Holland. "The critical position of affairs," saysCourtenay, "induced the Dutch to keep a fleet at sea, and the EnglishGovernment hoped to draw from that circumstance an occasion of quarrel.A yacht was sent for Lady Temple; the captain had orders to sail throughthe Dutch fleet if he should meet it, and to fire into the nearest shipsuntil they should either strike sail to the flag which he bore, orreturn his shot so as to make a quarrel!"He saw nothing of the Dutch Fleet in going over, but on his return hefell in with it, and fired, without warning and ceremony, into the shipsthat were next him."The Dutch admiral, Van Ghent, was puzzled; he seemed not to know, andprobably did not know, what the English captain meant; he therefore senta boat, thinking it possible that the yacht might be in distress; whenthe captain told his orders, mentioning also that he had theambassadress on board. Van Ghent himself then came on board, with ahandsome compliment to Lady Temple, and, making his personal inquiriesof the captain, received the same answer as before. The Dutchman said hehad no orders upon the point, which he rightly believed to be stillunsettled, and could not believe that the fleet, commanded by anadmiral, was to strike to the King's pleasure-boat."When the Admiral returned to his ship, the captain also, 'perplexedenough,' applied to Lady Temple, who soon saw that he desired to get outof his difficulty by her help; but the wife of Sir William Temple calledforth the spirit of Dorothy Osborne. 'He knew,' she told the captain,'his orders best, and what he was to do upon them, which she left tohim to follow as he thought fit, without any regard to her or herchildren.' The Dutch and English commanders then proceeded each upon hisown course, and Lady Temple was safely landed in England."There is an account of this incident in a letter of Sir CharlesLyttelton to Viscount Hatton, in the Hatton Correspondence. He tells usthat the poor captain, Captain Crow of _The Monmouth_, "found himself inthe Tower about it;" but he does not add any further information as tothe part which Dorothy played in the matter.After their retirement to Sheen and Moor Park, Surrey, we know nothingdistinctively of Lady Temple, and little is known of their family life.They had only two children living, having lost as many as seven in theirinfancy. In 1684 one of these children, their only daughter, died ofsmall-pox; she was buried in Westminster Abbey. There is a letter ofhers written to her father which shows some signs of her mother'saffectionate teaching, and which we cannot forbear to quote. It iscopied from Courtenay, vol. ii. p. 113.SIR,--I deferred writing to you till I could tell you that I hadreceived all my fine things, which I have just now done; but I thoughtnever to have done giving you thanks for them. They have made me so veryhappy in my new clothes, and everybody that comes does admire them aboveall things, but yet not so much as I think they deserve; and now, ifpapa was near, I should think myself a perfect pope, though I hope Ishould not be burned as there was one at Nell Gwyn's door the 5th ofNovember, who was set in a great chair, with a red nose half a yardlong, with some hundreds of boys throwing squibs at it. Monsieur Goreand I agree mighty well, and he makes me believe I shall come tosomething at last; that is if he stays, which I don't doubt but he will,because all the fine ladies will petition for him. We are got rid of theworkmen now, and our house is ready to entertain you. Come when youplease, and you will meet nobody more glad to see you than your mostobedient and dutiful daughter,D. TEMPLE.Temple's son, John Temple, married in 1685 a rich heiress in France, thedaughter of Monsieur Duplessis Rambouillet, a French Protestant; hebrought his wife to live at his father's house at Sheen. After KingWilliam and Queen Mary were actually placed on the throne, Sir WilliamTemple, in 1689, permitted his son to accept the office of Secretary atWar. For reasons now obscure and unknowable, he drowned himself in theThames within a week of his acceptance of office, leaving this writingbehind him:--"My folly in undertaking what I was not able to perform has done theKing and kingdom a great deal of prejudice. I wish him all happiness andabler servants than John Temple."The following letter was written on that occasion by Lady Temple toher nephew, Sir John Osborne. The original of it is at Chicksands:--_To Sir John Osborne, thanking him for hisconsolation on the death of her son._SHEEN, _May 6th, 1689_.Dear Nephew,--I give you many thanks for your kind letter and the senseyou have of my affliction, which truly is very great. But since it islaid upon me by the hand of an Almighty and Gracious God, that alwaysproportions His punishments to the support He gives with them, I mayhope to bear it as a Christian ought to do, and more especially one thatis conscious to herself of having many ways deserved it. The strangerevolution we have seen might well have taught me what this world is,yet it seems it was necessary that I should have a near example of theuncertainty of all human blessings, that so having no tie to the world Imay the better prepare myself to leave it; and that this correction maysuffice to teach me my duty must be the prayer of your affectionate auntand humble servant,D. TEMPLE.During the remaining years of her life, Lady Temple was honoured, to usethe conventional phrase, by the friendship of Queen Mary, and there issaid to have been a continuous correspondence between them, though I canfind on inquiry no trace of its existence at the present day.Early in the year 1695, after forty years of married life, and in thesixty-seventh year of her age, she died. She lies, with her husband andchildren, on the north side of the nave of Westminster Abbey, close tothe little door that leads to the organ gallery.          Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,          And her immortal part with angels lives.***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LOVE LETTERS OF DOROTHY OSBORNETO SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE, 1652-54********** This file should be named 12544.txt or 12544.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.net/1/2/5/4/12544Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

The primary function of all fiction is to furnishentertainment to the reader, and this fact has not been lost sight of.But the interest of so-called "detective" fiction is, I believe, greatlyenhanced by a careful adherence to the probable, and a strict avoidanceof physical impossibilities; and, in accordance with this belief, I havebeen scrupulous in confining myself to authentic facts and practicablemethods. The stories have, for the most part, a medico-legal motive, andthe methods of solution described in them are similar to those employedin actual practice by medical jurists. The stories illustrate, in fact,the application to the detection of crime of the ordinary methods ofscientific research. I may add that the experiments described have inall cases been performed by me, and that the micro-photographs are, ofcourse, from the actual specimens.I take this opportunity of thanking those of my friends who have invarious ways assisted me, and especially the friend to whom I havededicated this book; by whom I have been relieved of the veryconsiderable labour of making the micro-photographs, and greatlyassisted in procuring and preparing specimens. I must also thank Messrs.Pearson for kindly allowing me the use of Mr. H. M. Brock's admirableand sympathetic drawings, and the artist himself for the care with whichhe has maintained strict fidelity to the text.R. A. F.Gravesend,_September 21, 1909_.CONTENTSI.

Far from any railway, and some miles distant from anyconsiderable town, it remains an outpost of civilization, in whichprimitive manners and customs and old-world tradition linger on into anage that has elsewhere forgotten them. In the summer, it is true, asmall contingent of visitors, adventurous in spirit, though mostly ofsedate and solitary habits, make their appearance to swell its meagrepopulation, and impart to the wide stretches of smooth sand that fringeits shores a fleeting air of life and sober gaiety; but in lateSeptember--the season of the year in which I made its acquaintance--itspasture-lands lie desolate, the rugged paths along the cliffs are seldomtrodden by human foot, and the sands are a desert waste on which, fordays together, no footprint appears save that left by some passingsea-bird.I had been assured by my medical agent, Mr. Turcival, that I should findthe practice of which I was now taking charge "an exceedingly softbillet, and suitable for a studious man;" and certainly he had notmisled me, for the patients were, in fact, so few that I was quiteconcerned for my principal, and rather dull for want of work. Hence,when my friend John Thorndyke, the well-known medico-legal expert,proposed to come down and stay with me for a weekend and perhaps a fewdays beyond, I hailed the proposal with delight, and welcomed him withopen arms."You certainly don't seem to be overworked, Jervis," he remarked, as weturned out of the gate after tea, on the day of his arrival, for astroll on the shore. "Is this a new practice, or an old one in a stateof senile decay?""Why, the fact is," I answered, "there is virtually no practice.Cooper--my principal--has been here about six years, and as he hasprivate means he has never made any serious effort to build one up; andthe other man, Dr. Burrows, being uncommonly keen, and the people veryconservative, Cooper has never really got his foot in. However, itdoesn't seem to trouble him.""Well, if he is satisfied, I suppose you are," said Thorndyke, with asmile. "You are getting a seaside holiday, and being paid for it. But Ididn't know you were as near to the sea as this."We were entering, as he spoke, an artificial gap-way cut through the lowcliff, forming a steep cart-track down to the shore. It was locallyknown as Sundersley Gap, and was used principally, when used at all, bythe farmers' carts which came down to gather seaweed after a gale."What a magnificent stretch of sand!" continued Thorndyke, as we reachedthe bottom, and stood looking out seaward across the deserted beach."There is something very majestic and solemn in a great expanse ofsandy shore when the tide is out, and I know of nothing which is capableof conveying the impression of solitude so completely. The smooth,unbroken surface not only displays itself untenanted for the moment, butit offers convincing testimony that it has lain thus undisturbed througha considerable lapse of time. Here, for instance, we have clear evidencethat for several days only two pairs of feet besides our own havetrodden this gap.""How do you arrive at the 'several days'?" I asked."In the simplest manner possible," he replied. "The moon is now in thethird quarter, and the tides are consequently neap-tides. You can seequite plainly the two lines of seaweed and jetsam which indicate thehigh-water marks of the spring-tides and the neap-tides respectively.The strip of comparatively dry sand between them, over which the waterhas not risen for several days, is, as you see, marked by only two setsof footprints, and those footprints will not be completely obliteratedby the sea until the next spring-tide--nearly a week from to-day.""Yes, I see now, and the thing appears obvious enough when one has heardthe explanation. But it is really rather odd that no one should havepassed through this gap for days, and then that four persons should havecome here within quite a short interval of one another.""What makes you think they have done so?" Thorndyke asked."Well," I replied, "both of these sets of footprints appear to be quitefresh, and to have been made about the same time.""Not at the same time, Jervis," rejoined Thorndyke. "There is certainlyan interval of several hours between them, though precisely how manyhours we cannot judge, since there has been so little wind lately todisturb them; but the fisherman unquestionably passed here not more thanthree hours ago, and I should say probably within an hour; whereas theother man--who seems to have come up from a boat to fetch something ofconsiderable weight--returned through the gap certainly not less, andprobably more, than four hours ago."I gazed at my friend in blank astonishment, for these events befell inthe days before I had joined him as his assistant, and his specialknowledge and powers of inference were not then fully appreciated by me."It is clear, Thorndyke," I said, "that footprints have a very differentmeaning to you from what they have for me. I don't see in the least howyou have reached any of these conclusions.""I suppose not," was the reply; "but, you see, special knowledge of thiskind is the stock-in-trade of the medical jurist, and has to be acquiredby special study, though the present example is one of the greatestsimplicity. But let us consider it point by point; and first we willtake this set of footprints which I have inferred to be a fisherman's.Note their enormous size. They should be the footprints of a giant. Butthe length of the stride shows that they were made by a rather shortman. Then observe the massiveness of the soles, and the fact that thereare no nails in them. Note also the peculiar clumsy tread--the deep toeand heel marks, as if the walker had wooden legs, or fixed ankles andknees. From that character we can safely infer high boots of thick,rigid leather, so that we can diagnose high boots, massive and stiff,with nailless soles, and many sizes too large for the wearer. But theonly boot that answers this description is the fisherman'sthigh-boot--made of enormous size to enable him to wear in the wintertwo or three pairs of thick knitted stockings, one over the other. Nowlook at the other footprints; there is a double track, you see, one setcoming from the sea and one going towards it. As the man (who wasbow-legged and turned his toes in) has trodden in his own footprints, itis obvious that he came from the sea, and returned to it. But observethe difference in the two sets of prints; the returning ones are muchdeeper than the others, and the stride much shorter. Evidently he wascarrying something when he returned, and that something was very heavy.Moreover, we can see, by the greater depth of the toe impressions, thathe was stooping forward as he walked, and so probably carried the weighton his back. Is that quite clear?""Perfectly," I replied. "But how do you arrive at the interval of timebetween the visits of the two men?""That also is quite simple. The tide is now about halfway out; it isthus about three hours since high water. Now, the fisherman walked justabout the neap-tide, high-water mark, sometimes above it and sometimesbelow. But none of his footprints have been obliterated; therefore hepassed after high water--that is, less than three hours ago; and sincehis footprints are all equally distinct, he could not have passed whenthe sand was very wet. Therefore he probably passed less than an hourago. The other man's footprints, on the other hand, reach only to theneap-tide, high-water mark, where they end abruptly. The sea has washedover the remainder of the tracks and obliterated them. Therefore hepassed not less than three hours and not more than four daysago--probably within twenty-four hours."As Thorndyke concluded his demonstration the sound of voices was borneto us from above, mingled with the tramping of feet, and immediatelyafterwards a very singular party appeared at the head of the gapdescending towards the shore. First came a short burly fisherman clad inoilskins and sou'-wester, clumping along awkwardly in his greatsea-boots, then the local police-sergeant in company with myprofessional rival Dr. Burrows, while the rear of the procession wasbrought up by two constables carrying a stretcher. As he reached thebottom of the gap the fisherman, who was evidently acting as guide,turned along the shore, retracing his own tracks, and the processionfollowed in his wake."A surgeon, a stretcher, two constables, and a police-sergeant,"observed Thorndyke. "What does that suggest to your mind, Jervis?""A fall from the cliff," I replied, "or a body washed up on the shore.""Probably," he rejoined; "but we may as well walk in that direction."We turned to follow the retreating procession, and as we strode alongthe smooth surface left by the retiring tide Thorndyke resumed:"The subject of footprints has always interested me deeply for tworeasons. First, the evidence furnished by footprints is constantly beingbrought forward, and is often of cardinal importance; and, secondly, thewhole subject is capable of really systematic and scientific treatment.In the main the data are anatomical, but age, sex, occupation, health,and disease all give their various indications. Clearly, for instance,the footprints of an old man will differ from those of a young man ofthe same height, and I need not point out to you that those of a personsuffering from locomotor ataxia or paralysis agitans would be quiteunmistakable.""Yes, I see that plainly enough," I said."Here, now," he continued, "is a case in point." He halted to point withhis stick at a row of footprints that appeared suddenly above high-watermark, and having proceeded a short distance, crossed the line again, andvanished where the waves had washed over them. They were easilydistinguished from any of the others by the clear impressions ofcircular rubber heels."Do you see anything remarkable about them?" he asked."I notice that they are considerably deeper than our own," I answered."Yes, and the boots are about the same size as ours, whereas the strideis considerably shorter--quite a short stride, in fact. Now there is apretty constant ratio between the length of the foot and the length ofthe leg, between the length of leg and the height of the person, andbetween the stature and the length of stride. A long foot means a longleg, a tall man, and a long stride. But here we have a long foot and ashort stride. What do you make of that?" He laid down his stick--asmooth partridge cane, one side of which was marked by small lines intoinches and feet--beside the footprints to demonstrate the discrepancy."The depth of the footprints shows that he was a much heavier man thaneither of us," I suggested; "perhaps he was unusually fat.""Yes," said Thorndyke, "that seems to be the explanation. The carryingof a dead weight shortens the stride, and fat is practically a deadweight. The conclusion is that he was about five feet ten inches high,and excessively fat." He picked up his cane, and we resumed our walk,keeping an eye on the procession ahead until it had disappeared round acurve in the coast-line, when we mended our pace somewhat. Presently wereached a small headland, and, turning the shoulder of cliff, came fullupon the party which had preceded us. The men had halted in a narrowbay, and now stood looking down at a prostrate figure beside which thesurgeon was kneeling."We were wrong, you see," observed Thorndyke. "He has not fallen overthe cliff, nor has he been washed up by the sea. He is lying abovehigh-water mark, and those footprints that we have been examining appearto be his."As we approached, the sergeant turned and held up his hand."I'll ask you not to walk round the body just now, gentlemen," he said."There seems to have been foul play here, and I want to be clear aboutthe tracks before anyone crosses them."Acknowledging this caution, we advanced to where the constables werestanding, and looked down with some curiosity at the dead man. He was atall, frail-looking man, thin to the point of emaciation, and appearedto be about thirty-five years of age. He lay in an easy posture, withhalf-closed eyes and a placid expression that contrasted strangelyenough with the tragic circumstances of his death."It is a clear case of murder," said Dr. Burrows, dusting the sand fromhis knees as he stood up. "There is a deep knife-wound above the heart,which must have caused death almost instantaneously.""How long should you say he has been dead, Doctor?" asked the sergeant."Twelve hours at least," was the reply. "He is quite cold and stiff."[Illustration: PLAN OF ST. BRIDGET'S BAY.+ Position of body.         D D D, Tracks of Hearn's shoes.A, Top of Shepherd's Path.  E, Tracks of the nailed shoes.B, Overhanging cliff.       F, Shepherd's Path ascending shelving cliff.C, Footpath along edge of cliff.]"Twelve hours, eh?" repeated the officer. "That would bring it to aboutsix o'clock this morning.""I won't commit myself to a definite time," said Dr. Burrows hastily. "Ionly say not _less_ than twelve hours. It might have been considerablymore.""Ah!" said the sergeant. "Well, he made a pretty good fight for hislife, to all appearances." He nodded at the sand, which for some feetaround the body bore the deeply indented marks of feet, as though afurious struggle had taken place. "It's a mighty queer affair," pursuedthe sergeant, addressing Dr. Burrows. "There seems to have been only oneman in it--there is only one set of footprints besides those of thedeceased--and we've got to find out who he is; and I reckon there won'tbe much trouble about that, seeing the kind of trade-marks he has leftbehind him.""No," agreed the surgeon; "there ought not to be much trouble inidentifying those boots. He would seem to be a labourer, judging by thehob-nails.""No, sir; not a labourer," dissented the sergeant. "The foot is toosmall, for one thing; and then the nails are not regular hob-nails.They're a good deal smaller; and a labourer's boots would have the nailsall round the edges, and there would be iron tips on the heels, andprobably on the toes too. Now these have got no tips, and the nails arearranged in a pattern on the soles and heels. They are probablyshooting-boots or sporting shoes of some kind." He strode to and frowith his notebook in his hand, writing down hasty memoranda, andstooping to scrutinize the impressions in the sand. The surgeon alsobusied himself in noting down the facts concerning which he would haveto give evidence, while Thorndyke regarded in silence and with an air ofintense preoccupation the footprints around the body which remained totestify to the circumstances of the crime."It is pretty clear, up to a certain point," the sergeant observed, ashe concluded his investigations, "how the affair happened, and it ispretty clear, too, that the murder was premeditated. You see, Doctor,the deceased gentleman, Mr. Hearn, was apparently walking home from PortMarston; we saw his footprints along the shore--those rubber heels makethem easy to identify--and he didn't go down Sundersley Gap. Heprobably meant to climb up the cliff by that little track that you seethere, which the people about here call the Shepherd's Path. Now themurderer must have known that he was coming, and waited upon the cliffto keep a lookout. When he saw Mr. Hearn enter the bay, he came down thepath and attacked him, and, after a tough struggle, succeeded instabbing him. Then he turned and went back up the path. You can see thedouble track between the path and the place where the struggle tookplace, and the footprints going to the path are on top of those comingfrom it.""If you follow the tracks," said Dr. Burrows, "you ought to be able tosee where the murderer went to.""I'm afraid not," replied the sergeant. "There are no marks on the pathitself--the rock is too hard, and so is the ground above, I fear. ButI'll go over it carefully all the same."The investigations being so far concluded, the body was lifted on to thestretcher, and the cortege, consisting of the bearers, the Doctor, andthe fisherman, moved off towards the Gap, while the sergeant, havingcivilly wished us "Good-evening," scrambled up the Shepherd's Path, andvanished above."A very smart officer that," said Thorndyke. "I should like to know whathe wrote in his notebook.""His account of the circumstances of the murder seemed a very reasonableone," I said."Very. He noted the plain and essential facts, and drew the naturalconclusions from them. But there are some very singular features in thiscase; so singular that I am disposed to make a few notes for my owninformation."He stooped over the place where the body had lain, and having narrowlyexamined the sand there and in the place where the dead man's feet hadrested, drew out his notebook and made a memorandum. He next made arapid sketch-plan of the bay, marking the position of the body and thevarious impressions in the sand, and then, following the double trackleading from and to the Shepherd's Path, scrutinized the footprints withthe deepest attention, making copious notes and sketches in his book."We may as well go up by the Shepherd's Path," said Thorndyke. "I thinkwe are equal to the climb, and there may be visible traces of themurderer after all. The rock is only a sandstone, and not a very hardone either."We approached the foot of the little rugged track which zigzagged up theface of the cliff, and, stooping down among the stiff, dry herbage,examined the surface. Here, at the bottom of the path, where the rockwas softened by the weather, there were several distinct impressions onthe crumbling surface of the murderer's nailed boots, though they weresomewhat confused by the tracks of the sergeant, whose boots wereheavily nailed. But as we ascended the marks became rather lessdistinct, and at quite a short distance from the foot of the cliff welost them altogether, though we had no difficulty in following the morerecent traces of the sergeant's passage up the path.When we reached the top of the cliff we paused to scan the path that ranalong its edge, but here, too, although the sergeant's heavy boots hadleft quite visible impressions on the ground, there were no signs of anyother feet. At a little distance the sagacious officer himself waspursuing his investigations, walking backwards and forwards with hisbody bent double, and his eyes fixed on the ground."Not a trace of him anywhere," said he, straightening himself up as weapproached. "I was afraid there wouldn't be after all this dry weather.I shall have to try a different tack. This is a small place, and ifthose boots belong to anyone living here they'll be sure to be known.""The deceased gentleman--Mr. Hearn, I think you called him," saidThorndyke as we turned towards the village--"is he a native of thelocality?""Oh no, sir," replied the officer. "He is almost a stranger. He has onlybeen here about three weeks; but, you know, in a little place like thisa man soon gets to be known--and his business, too, for that matter," headded, with a smile."What was his business, then?" asked Thorndyke."Pleasure, I believe. He was down here for a holiday, though it's a goodway past the season; but, then, he had a friend living here, and thatmakes a difference. Mr. Draper up at the Poplars was an old friend ofhis, I understand. I am going to call on him now."We walked on along the footpath that led towards the village, but hadonly proceeded two or three hundred yards when a loud hail drew ourattention to a man running across a field towards us from the directionof the cliff."Why, here is Mr. Draper himself," exclaimed the sergeant, stoppingshort and waving his hand. "I expect he has heard the news already."Thorndyke and I also halted, and with some curiosity watched theapproach of this new party to the tragedy. As the stranger drew near wesaw that he was a tall, athletic-looking man of about forty, dressed ina Norfolk knickerbocker suit, and having the appearance of an ordinarycountry gentleman, excepting that he carried in his hand, in place of awalking-stick, the staff of a butterfly-net, the folding ring and bag ofwhich partly projected from his pocket."Is it true, Sergeant?" he exclaimed as he came up to us, panting fromhis exertions. "About Mr. Hearn, I mean. There is a rumour that he hasbeen found dead on the beach.""It's quite true, sir, I am sorry to say; and, what is worse, he hasbeen murdered.""My God! you don't say so!"He turned towards us a face that must ordinarily have been jovialenough, but was now white and scared and, after a brief pause, heexclaimed:"Murdered! Good God! Poor old Hearn! How did it happen, Sergeant? andwhen? and is there any clue to the murderer?""We can't say for certain when it happened," replied the sergeant, "andas to the question of clues, I was just coming up to call on you.""On me!" exclaimed Draper, with a startled glance at the officer. "Whatfor?""Well, we should like to know something about Mr. Hearn--who he was, andwhether he had any enemies, and so forth; anything, in fact, that wouldgive as a hint where to look for the murderer. And you are the onlyperson in the place who knew him at all intimately."Mr Draper's pallid face turned a shade paler, and he glanced about himwith an obviously embarrassed air."I'm afraid," he began in a hesitating manner, "I'm afraid I shan't beable to help you much. I didn't know much about his affairs. You see hewas--well--only a casual acquaintance--""Well," interrupted the sergeant, "you can tell us who and what he was,and where he lived, and so forth. We'll find out the rest if you give usthe start.""I see," said Draper. "Yes, I expect you will." His eyes glancedrestlessly to and fro, and he added presently: "You must come upto-morrow, and have a talk with me about him, and I'll see what I canremember.""I'd rather come this evening," said the sergeant firmly."Not this evening," pleaded Draper. "I'm feeling rather--this affair,you know, has upset me. I couldn't give proper attention--"His sentence petered out into a hesitating mumble, and the officerlooked at him in evident surprise at his nervous, embarrassed manner.His own attitude, however, was perfectly firm, though polite."I don't like pressing you, sir," said he, "but time is precious--we'llhave to go single file here; this pond is a public nuisance. They oughtto bank it up at this end. After you, sir."The pond to which the sergeant alluded had evidently extended at onetime right across the path, but now, thanks to the dry weather, a narrowisthmus of half-dried mud traversed the morass, and along this Mr.Draper proceeded to pick his way. The sergeant was about to follow, whensuddenly he stopped short with his eyes riveted upon the muddy track. Asingle glance showed me the cause of his surprise, for on the stiff,putty-like surface, standing out with the sharp distinctness of a waxmould, were the fresh footprints of the man who had just passed, eachfootprint displaying on its sole the impression of stud-nails arrangedin a diamond-shaped pattern, and on its heel a group of similar nailsarranged in a cross.The sergeant hesitated for only a moment, in which he turned a quickstartled glance upon us; then he followed, walking gingerly along theedge of the path as if to avoid treading in his predecessor'sfootprints. Instinctively we did the same, following closely, andanxiously awaiting the next development of the tragedy. For a minute ortwo we all proceeded in silence, the sergeant being evidently at a losshow to act, and Mr. Draper busy with his own thoughts. At length theformer spoke."You think, Mr. Draper, you would rather that I looked in on youto-morrow about this affair?""Much rather, if you wouldn't mind," was the eager reply."Then, in that case," said the sergeant, looking at his watch, "as I'vegot a good deal to see to this evening, I'll leave you here, and make myway to the station."With a farewell flourish of his hand he climbed over a stile, and when,a few moments later, I caught a glimpse of him through an opening in thehedge, he was running across the meadow like a hare.The departure of the police-officer was apparently a great relief to Mr.Draper, who at once fell back and began to talk with us."You are Dr. Jervis, I think," said he. "I saw you coming out of Dr.Cooper's house yesterday. We know everything that is happening in thevillage, you see." He laughed nervously, and added: "But I don't knowyour friend."I introduced Thorndyke, at the mention of whose name our newacquaintance knitted his brows, and glanced inquisitively at my friend."Thorndyke," he repeated; "the name seems familiar to me. Are you in theLaw, sir?"Thorndyke admitted the impeachment, and our companion, having againbestowed on him a look full of curiosity, continued: "This horribleaffair will interest you, no doubt, from a professional point of view.You were present when my poor friend's body was found, I think?""No," replied Thorndyke; "we came up afterwards, when they were removingit."Our companion then proceeded to question us about the murder, butreceived from Thorndyke only the most general and ambiguous replies. Norwas there time to go into the matter at length, for the footpathpresently emerged on to the road close to Mr. Draper's house."You will excuse my not asking you in to-night," said he, "but you willunderstand that I am not in much form for visitors just now."We assured him that we fully understood, and, having wished him"Good-evening," pursued our way towards the village."The sergeant is off to get a warrant, I suppose," I observed."Yes; and mighty anxious lest his man should be off before he canexecute it. But he is fishing in deeper waters than he thinks, Jervis.This is a very singular and complicated case; one of the strangest, infact, that I have ever met. I shall follow its development with deepinterest.""The sergeant seems pretty cocksure, all the same," I said."He is not to blame for that," replied Thorndyke. "He is acting on theobvious appearances, which is the proper thing to do in the first place.Perhaps his notebook contains more than I think it does. But we shallsee."When we entered the village I stopped to settle some business with thechemist, who acted as Dr. Cooper's dispenser, suggesting to Thorndykethat he should walk on to the house; but when I emerged from the shopsome ten minutes later he was waiting outside, with a smallishbrown-paper parcel under each arm. Of one of these parcels I insisted onrelieving him, in spite of his protests, but when he at length handed itto me its weight completely took me by surprise."I should have let them send this home on a barrow," I remarked."So I should have done," he replied, "only I did not wish to drawattention to my purchase, or give my address."Accepting this hint I refrained from making any inquiries as to thenature of the contents (although I must confess to considerablecuriosity on the subject), and on arriving home I assisted him todeposit the two mysterious parcels in his room.When I came downstairs a disagreeable surprise awaited me. Hitherto thelong evenings had been spent by me in solitary and undisturbed enjoymentof Dr. Cooper's excellent library, but to-night a perverse fate decreedthat I must wander abroad, because, forsooth, a preposterous farmer, whoresided in a hamlet five miles distant, had chosen the evening of myguest's arrival to dislocate his bucolic elbow. I half hoped thatThorndyke would offer to accompany me, but he made no such suggestion,and in fact seemed by no means afflicted at the prospect of my absence."I have plenty to occupy me while you are away," he said cheerfully; andwith this assurance to comfort me I mounted my bicycle and rode offsomewhat sulkily along the dark road.My visit occupied in all a trifle under two hours, and when I reachedhome, ravenously hungry and heated by my ride, half-past nine hadstruck, and the village had begun to settle down for the night."Sergeant Payne is a-waiting in the surgery, sir," the housemaidannounced as I entered the hall."Confound Sergeant Payne!" I exclaimed. "Is Dr. Thorndyke with him?""No, sir," replied the grinning damsel. "Dr. Thorndyke is hout.""Hout!" I repeated (my surprise leading to unintentional mimicry)."Yes, sir. He went hout soon after you, sir, on his bicycle. He had abasket strapped on to it--leastways a hamper--and he borrowed a basinand a kitchen-spoon from the cook."I stared at the girl in astonishment. The ways of John Thorndyke were,indeed, beyond all understanding."Well, let me have some dinner or supper at once," I said, "and I willsee what the sergeant wants."The officer rose as I entered the surgery, and, laying his helmet on thetable, approached me with an air of secrecy and importance."Well, sir," said he, "the fat's in the fire. I've arrested Mr. Draper,and I've got him locked up in the court-house. But I wish it had beensomeone else.""So does he, I expect," I remarked."You see, sir," continued the sergeant, "we all like Mr. Draper. He'sbeen among us a matter of seven years, and he's like one of ourselves.However, what I've come about is this; it seems the gentleman who waswith you this evening is Dr. Thorndyke, the great expert. Now Mr. Draperseems to have heard about him, as most of us have, and he is veryanxious for him to take up the defence. Do you think he would consent?""I expect so," I answered, remembering Thorndyke's keen interest in thecase; "but I will ask him when he comes in.""Thank you, sir," said the sergeant. "And perhaps you wouldn't mindstepping round to the court-house presently yourself. He looks uncommonqueer, does Mr. Draper, and no wonder, so I'd like you to take a look athim, and if you could bring Dr. Thorndyke with you, he'd like it, and soshould I, for, I assure you, sir, that although a conviction would meana step up the ladder for me, I'd be glad enough to find that I'd made amistake."I was just showing my visitor out when a bicycle swept in through theopen gate, and Thorndyke dismounted at the door, revealing a squarehamper--evidently abstracted from the surgery--strapped on to a carrierat the back. I conveyed the sergeant's request to him at once, and askedif he was willing to take up the case."As to taking up the defence," he replied, "I will consider the matter;but in any case I will come up and see the prisoner."With this the sergeant departed, and Thorndyke, having unstrapped thehamper with as much care as if it contained a collection of pricelessporcelain, bore it tenderly up to his bedroom; whence he appeared, aftera considerable interval, smilingly apologetic for the delay."I thought you were dressing for dinner," I grumbled as he took his seatat the table."No," he replied. "I have been considering this murder. Really it is amost singular case, and promises to be uncommonly complicated, too.""Then I assume that you will undertake the defence?""I shall if Draper gives a reasonably straightforward account ofhimself."It appeared that this condition was likely to be fulfilled, for when wearrived at the court-house (where the prisoner was accommodated in aspare office, under rather free-and-easy conditions considering thenature of the charge) we found Mr. Draper in an eminently communicativeframe of mind."I want you, Dr. Thorndyke, to undertake my defence in this terribleaffair, because I feel confident that you will be able to clear me. AndI promise you that there shall be no reservation or concealment on mypart of anything that you ought to know.""Very well," said Thorndyke. "By the way, I see you have changed yourshoes.""Yes, the sergeant took possession of those I was wearing. He saidsomething about comparing them with some footprints, but there can't beany footprints like those shoes here in Sundersley. The nails are fixedin the soles in quite a peculiar pattern. I had them made in Edinburgh.""Have you more than one pair?""No. I have no other nailed boots.""That is important," said Thorndyke. "And now I judge that you havesomething to tell us that bears on this crime. Am I right?""Yes. There is something that I am afraid it is necessary for you toknow, although it is very painful to me to revive memories of my pastthat I had hoped were buried for ever. But perhaps, after all, it maynot be necessary for these confidences to be revealed to anyone butyourself.""I hope not," said Thorndyke; "and if it is not necessary you may relyupon me not to allow any of your secrets to leak out. But you are wiseto tell me everything that may in any way bear upon the case."At this juncture, seeing that confidential matters were about to bediscussed, I rose and prepared to withdraw; but Draper waved me backinto my chair."You need not go away, Dr. Jervis," he said. "It is through you that Ihave the benefit of Dr. Thorndyke's help, and I know that you doctorscan be trusted to keep your own counsel and your clients' secrets. Andnow for some confessions of mine. In the first place, it is my painfulduty to tell you that I am a discharged convict--an 'old lag,' as thecant phrase has it."He coloured a dusky red as he made this statement, and glanced furtivelyat Thorndyke to observe its effect. But he might as well have looked ata wooden figure-head or a stone mask as at my friend's immovable visage;and when his communication had been acknowledged by a slight nod, heproceeded:"The history of my wrong-doing is the history of hundreds of others. Iwas a clerk in a bank, and getting on as well as I could expect in thatnot very progressive avocation, when I had the misfortune to make fourvery undesirable acquaintances. They were all young men, though ratherolder than myself, and were close friends, forming a sort of littlecommunity or club. They were not what is usually described as 'fast.'They were quite sober and decently-behaved young follows, but they werevery decidedly addicted to gambling in a small way, and they sooninfected me. Before long I was the keenest gambler of them all. Cards,billiards, pool, and various forms of betting began to be the chiefpleasures of my life, and not only was the bulk of my scanty salaryoften consumed in the inevitable losses, but presently I found myselfconsiderably in debt, without any visible means of discharging myliabilities. It is true that my four friends were my chief--in fact,almost my only--creditors, but still, the debts existed, and had to bepaid."Now these four friends of mine--named respectively Leach, Pitford,Hearn, and Jezzard--were uncommonly clever men, though the full extentof their cleverness was not appreciated by me until too late. And I,too, was clever in my way, and a most undesirable way it was, for Ipossessed the fatal gift of imitating handwriting and signatures withthe most remarkable accuracy. So perfect were my copies that the writersthemselves were frequently unable to distinguish their own signaturesfrom my imitations, and many a time was my skill invoked by some of mycompanions to play off practical jokes upon the others. But these jestswere strictly confined to our own little set, for my four friends weremost careful and anxious that my dangerous accomplishment should notbecome known to outsiders."And now follows the consequence which you have no doubt foreseen. Mydebts, though small, were accumulating, and I saw no prospect of beingable to pay them. Then, one night, Jezzard made a proposition. We hadbeen playing bridge at his rooms, and once more my ill luck had causedme to increase my debt. I scribbled out an IOU, and pushed it across thetable to Jezzard, who picked it up with a very wry face, and pocketedit."'Look here, Ted,' he said presently, 'this paper is all very well, but,you know, I can't pay my debts with it. My creditors demand hard cash.'"'I'm very sorry,' I replied, 'but I can't help it.'"'Yes, you can,' said he, 'and I'll tell you how.' He then propounded ascheme which I at first rejected with indignation, but which, when theothers backed him up, I at last allowed myself to be talked into, andactually put into execution. I contrived, by taking advantage of thecarelessness of some of my superiors at the bank, to get possession ofsome blank cheque forms, which I filled up with small amounts--not morethan two or three pounds--and signed with careful imitations of thesignatures of some of our clients. Jezzard got some stamps made forstamping on the account numbers, and when this had been done I handedover to him the whole collection of forged cheques in settlement of mydebts to all of my four companions."The cheques were duly presented--by whom I do not know; and although,to my dismay, the modest sums for which I had drawn them had beenskilfully altered into quite considerable amounts, they were all paidwithout demur excepting one. That one, which had been altered from threepounds to thirty-nine, was drawn upon an account which was alreadyslightly overdrawn. The cashier became suspicious; the cheque wasimpounded, and the client communicated with. Then, of course, the mineexploded. Not only was this particular forgery detected, but inquirieswere set afoot which soon brought to light the others. Presentlycircumstances, which I need not describe, threw some suspicion on me. Iat once lost my nerve, and finally made a full confession."The inevitable prosecution followed. It was not conducted vindictively.Still, I had actually committed the forgeries, and though I endeavouredto cast a part of the blame on to the shoulders of my treacherousconfederates, I did not succeed. Jezzard, it is true, was arrested, butwas discharged for lack of evidence, and, consequently, the whole burdenof the forgery fell upon me. The jury, of course, convicted me, and Iwas sentenced to seven years' penal servitude."During the time that I was in prison an uncle of mine died in Canada,and by the provisions of his will I inherited the whole of his veryconsiderable property, so that when the time arrived for my release, Icame out of prison, not only free, but comparatively rich. I at oncedropped my own name, and, assuming that of Alfred Draper, began to lookabout for some quiet spot in which I might spend the rest of my days inpeace, and with little chance of my identity being discovered. Such aplace I found in Sundersley, and here I have lived for the last sevenyears, liked and respected, I think, by my neighbours, who have littlesuspected that they were harbouring in their midst a convicted felon."All this time I had neither seen nor heard anything of my fourconfederates, and I hoped and believed that they had passed completelyout of my life. But they had not. Only a month ago I met them once more,to my sorrow, and from the day of that meeting all the peace andsecurity of my quiet existence at Sundersley have vanished. Like evilspirits they have stolen into my life, changing my happiness into bittermisery, filling my days with dark forebodings and my nights withterror."Here Mr. Draper paused, and seemed to sink into a gloomy reverie."Under what circumstances did you meet these men?" Thorndyke asked."Ah!" exclaimed Draper, arousing with sudden excitement, "thecircumstances were very singular and suspicious. I had gone over toEastwich for the day to do some shopping. About eleven o'clock in theforenoon I was making some purchases in a shop when I noticed two menlooking in the window, or rather pretending to do so, whilst theyconversed earnestly. They were smartly dressed, in a horsy fashion, andlooked like well-to-do farmers, as they might very naturally have beensince it was market-day. But it seemed to me that their faces werefamiliar to me. I looked at them more attentively, and then it suddenlydawned upon me, most unpleasantly, that they resembled Leach andJezzard. And yet they were not quite like. The resemblance was there,but the differences were greater than the lapse of time would accountfor. Moreover, the man who resembled Jezzard had a rather large mole onthe left cheek just under the eye, while the other man had an eyeglassstuck in one eye, and wore a waxed moustache, whereas Leach had alwaysbeen clean-shaven, and had never used an eyeglass."As I was speculating upon the resemblance they looked up, and caught myintent and inquisitive eye, whereupon they moved away from the window;and when, having completed my purchases, I came out into the street,they were nowhere to be seen."That evening, as I was walking by the river outside the town beforereturning to the station, I overtook a yacht which was being toweddown-stream. Three men were walking ahead on the bank with a longtow-line, and one man stood in the cockpit steering. As I approached,and was reading the name _Otter_ on the stern, the man at the helmlooked round, and with a start of surprise I recognized my oldacquaintance Hearn. The recognition, however, was not mutual, for I hadgrown a beard in the interval, and I passed on without appearing tonotice him; but when I overtook the other three men, and recognized, asI had feared, the other three members of the gang, I must have lookedrather hard at Jezzard, for he suddenly halted, and exclaimed: 'Why,it's our old friend Ted! Our long-lost and lamented brother!' He heldout his hand with effusive cordiality, and began to make inquiries as tomy welfare; but I cut him short with the remark that I was not proposingto renew the acquaintance, and, turning off on to a footpath that ledaway from the river, strode off without looking back."Naturally this meeting exercised my mind a good deal, and when Ithought of the two men whom I had seen in the town, I could hardlybelieve that their likeness to my quondam friends was a merecoincidence. And yet when I had met Leach and Jezzard by the river, Ihad found them little altered, and had particularly noticed thatJezzard had no mole on his face, and that Leach was clean-shaven as ofold."But a day or two later all my doubts were resolved by a paragraph inthe local paper. It appeared that on the day of my visit to Eastwich anumber of forged cheques had been cashed at the three banks. They hadbeen presented by three well-dressed, horsy-looking men who looked likewell-to-do farmers. One of them had a mole on the left cheek, anotherwas distinguished by a waxed moustache and a single eyeglass, while thedescription of the third I did not recognize. None of the cheques hadbeen drawn for large amounts, though the total sum obtained by theforgers was nearly four hundred pounds; but the most interesting pointwas that the cheque-forms had been manufactured by photographic process,and the water-mark skilfully, though not quite perfectly, imitated.Evidently the swindlers were clever and careful men, and willing to takea good deal of trouble for the sake of security, and the result of theirprecautions was that the police could make no guess as to theiridentity."The very next day, happening to walk over to Port Marston, I came uponthe _Otter_ lying moored alongside the quay in the harbour. As soon as Irecognized the yacht, I turned quickly and walked away, but a minutelater I ran into Leach and Jezzard, who were returning to their craft.Jezzard greeted me with an air of surprise. 'What! Still hanging abouthere, Ted?' he exclaimed. 'That is not discreet of you, dear boy. Ishould earnestly advise you to clear out.'"'What do you mean?' I asked."'Tut, tut!' said he. 'We read the papers like other people, and we knownow what business took you to Eastwich. But it's foolish of you to hangabout the neighbourhood where you might be spotted at any moment.'"The implied accusation took me aback so completely that I stood staringat him in speechless astonishment, and at that unlucky moment atradesman, from whom I had ordered some house-linen, passed along thequay. Seeing me, he stopped and touched his hat."'Beg pardon, Mr. Draper,' said he, 'but I shall be sending my cart upto Sundersley to-morrow morning if that will do for you.'"I said that it would, and as the man turned away, Jezzard's face brokeout into a cunning smile."So you are Mr. Draper, of Sundersley, now, are you?' said he. 'Well, Ihope you won't be too proud to come and look in on your old friends. Weshall be staying here for some time.'"That same night Hearn made his appearance at my house. He had come asan emissary from the gang, to ask me to do some work for them--toexecute some forgeries, in fact. Of course I refused, and prettybluntly, too, whereupon Hearn began to throw out vague hints as to whatmight happen if I made enemies of the gang, and to utter veiled, butquite intelligible, threats. You will say that I was an idiot not tosend him packing, and threaten to hand over the whole gang to thepolice; but I was never a man of strong nerve, and I don't mindadmitting that I was mortally afraid of that cunning devil, Jezzard."The next thing that happened was that Hearn came and took lodgings inSundersley, and, in spite of my efforts to avoid him, he haunted mecontinually. The yacht, too, had evidently settled down for some time ata berth in the harbour, for I heard that a local smack-boy had beenengaged as a deck-hand; and I frequently encountered Jezzard and theother members of the gang, who all professed to believe that I hadcommitted the Eastwich forgeries. One day I was foolish enough to allowmyself to be lured on to the yacht for a few minutes, and when I wouldhave gone ashore, I found that the shore ropes had been cast off, andthat the vessel was already moving out of the harbour. At first I wasfurious, but the three scoundrels were so jovial and good-natured, andso delighted with the joke of taking me for a sail against my will, thatI presently cooled down, and having changed into a pair of rubber-soledshoes (so that I should not make dents in the smooth deck with myhobnails), bore a hand at sailing the yacht, and spent quite a pleasantday."From that time I found myself gradually drifting back into a state ofintimacy with these agreeable scoundrels, and daily becoming more andmore afraid of them. In a moment of imbecility I mentioned what I hadseen from the shop-window at Eastwich, and, though they passed thematter off with a joke, I could see that they were mightily disturbed byit. Their efforts to induce me to join them were redoubled, and Hearntook to calling almost daily at my house--usually with documents andsignatures which he tried to persuade me to copy."A few evenings ago he made a new and startling proposition. We werewalking in my garden, and he had been urging me once more to rejoin thegang--unsuccessfully, I need not say. Presently he sat down on a seatagainst a yew-hedge at the bottom of the garden, and, after an intervalof silence, said suddenly:"'Then you absolutely refuse to go in with us?'"'Of course I do,' I replied. 'Why should I mix myself up with a gang ofcrooks when I have ample means and a decent position?'"'Of course,' he agreed, 'you'd be a fool if you did. But, you see, youknow all about this Eastwich job, to say nothing of our other littleexploits, and you gave us away once before. Consequently, you can takeit from me that, now Jezzard has run you to earth, he won't leave you inpeace until you have given us some kind of a hold on you. You know toomuch, you see, and as long as you have a clean sheet you are a standingmenace to us. That is the position. You know it, and Jezzard knows it,and he is a desperate man, and as cunning as the devil.'"'I know that,' I said gloomily."'Very well,' continued Hearn. 'Now I'm going to make you an offer.Promise me a small annuity--you can easily afford it--or pay me asubstantial sum down, and I will set you free for ever from Jezzard andthe others.'"'How will you do that?' I asked."'Very simply,' he replied. 'I am sick of them all, and sick of thisrisky, uncertain mode of life. Now I am ready to clean off my own slateand set you free at the same time; but I must have some means oflivelihood in view.'"'You mean that you will turn King's evidence?' I asked."'Yes, if you will pay me a couple of hundred a year, or, say, twothousand down on the conviction of the gang.'"I was so taken aback that for some time I made no reply, and as I satconsidering this amazing proposition, the silence was suddenly brokenby a suppressed sneeze from the other side of the hedge."Hearn and I started to our feet. Immediately hurried footsteps wereheard in the lane outside the hedge. We raced up the garden to the gateand out through a side alley, but when we reached the lane there was nota soul in sight. We made a brief and fruitless search in the immediateneighbourhood, and then turned back to the house. Hearn was deathly paleand very agitated, and I must confess that I was a good deal upset bythe incident."'This is devilish awkward,' said Hearn."'It is rather,' I admitted; 'but I expect it was only some inquisitiveyokel.'"'I don't feel so sure of that,' said he. 'At any rate, we were starklunatics to sit up against a hedge to talk secrets.'"He paced the garden with me for some time in gloomy silence, andpresently, after a brief request that I would think over his proposal,took himself off."I did not see him again until I met him last night on the yacht.Pitford called on me in the morning, and invited me to come and dinewith them. I at first declined, for my housekeeper was going to spendthe evening with her sister at Eastwich, and stay there for the night,and I did not much like leaving the house empty. However, I agreedeventually, stipulating that I should be allowed to come home early, andI accordingly went. Hearn and Pitford were waiting in the boat by thesteps--for the yacht had been moved out to a buoy--and we went on boardand spent a very pleasant and lively evening. Pitford put me ashore atten o'clock, and I walked straight home, and went to bed. Hearn wouldhave come with me, but the others insisted on his remaining, sayingthat they had some matters of business to discuss.""Which way did you walk home?" asked Thorndyke."I came through the town, and along the main road.""And that is all you know about this affair?""Absolutely all," replied Draper. "I have now admitted you to secrets ofmy past life that I had hoped never to have to reveal to any humancreature, and I still have some faint hope that it may not be necessaryfor you to divulge what I have told you.""Your secrets shall not be revealed unless it is absolutelyindispensable that they should be," said Thorndyke; "but you are placingyour life in my hands, and you must leave me perfectly free to act as Ithink best."With this he gathered his notes together, and we took our departure."A very singular history, this, Jervis," he said, when, having wishedthe sergeant "Good-night," we stepped out on to the dark road. "What doyou think of it?""I hardly know what to think," I answered, "but, on the whole, it seemsrather against Draper than otherwise. He admits that he is an oldcriminal, and it appears that he was being persecuted and blackmailed bythe man Hearn. It is true that he represents Jezzard as being theleading spirit and prime mover in the persecution, but we have only hisword for that. Hearn was in lodgings near him, and was undoubtedlytaking the most active part in the business, and it is quite possible,and indeed probable, that Hearn was the actual _deus ex machina_."Thorndyke nodded. "Yes," he said, "that is certainly the line theprosecution will take if we allow the story to become known. Ha! whatis this? We are going to have some rain.""Yes, and wind too. We are in for an autumn gale, I think.""And that," said Thorndyke, "may turn out to be an important factor inour case.""How can the weather affect your case?" I asked in some surprise. But,as the rain suddenly descended in a pelting shower, my companion brokeinto a run, leaving my question unanswered.On the following morning, which was fair and sunny after the stormynight, Dr. Burrows called for my friend. He was on his way to theextemporized mortuary to make the _post-mortem_ examination of themurdered man's body. Thorndyke, having notified the coroner that he waswatching the case on behalf of the accused, had been authorized to bepresent at the autopsy; but the authorization did not include me, and,as Dr. Burrows did not issue any invitation, I was not able to bepresent. I met them, however, as they were returning, and it seemed tome that Dr. Burrows appeared a little huffy."Your friend," said he, in a rather injured tone, "is really the mostoutrageous stickler for forms and ceremonies that I have ever met."Thorndyke looked at him with an amused twinkle, and chuckledindulgently."Here was a body," Dr. Burrows continued irritably, "found undercircumstances clearly indicative of murder, and bearing a knife-woundthat nearly divided the arch of the aorta; in spite of which, I assureyou that Dr. Thorndyke insisted on weighing the body, and examiningevery organ--lungs, liver, stomach, and brain--yes, actually thebrain!--as if there had been no clue whatever to the cause of death.And then, as a climax, he insisted on sending the contents of thestomach in a jar, sealed with our respective seals, in charge of aspecial messenger, to Professor Copland, for analysis and report. Ithought he was going to demand an examination for the tubercle bacillus,but he didn't; which," concluded Dr. Burrows, suddenly becoming sourlyfacetious, "was an oversight, for, after all, the fellow may have diedof consumption."Thorndyke chuckled again, and I murmured that the precautions appearedto have been somewhat excessive."Not at all," was the smiling response. "You are losing sight of ourfunction. We are the expert and impartial umpires, and it is ourbusiness to ascertain, with scientific accuracy, the cause of death. The_prima facie_ appearances in this case suggest that the deceased wasmurdered by Draper, and that is the hypothesis advanced. But that is noconcern of ours. It is not our function to confirm an hypothesissuggested by outside circumstances, but rather, on the contrary, to makecertain that no other explanation is possible. And that is my invariablepractice. No matter how glaringly obvious the appearances may be, Irefuse to take anything for granted."Dr. Burrows received this statement with a grunt of dissent, but thearrival of his dogcart put a stop to further discussion.Thorndyke was not subpoenaed for the inquest. Dr. Burrows and thesergeant having been present immediately after the finding of the body,his evidence was not considered necessary, and, moreover, he was knownto be watching the case in the interests of the accused. Like myself,therefore, he was present as a spectator, but as a highly interestedone, for he took very complete shorthand notes of the whole of theevidence and the coroner's comments.I shall not describe the proceedings in detail. The jury, having beentaken to view the body, trooped into the room on tiptoe, looking paleand awe-stricken, and took their seats; and thereafter, from time totime, directed glances of furtive curiosity at Draper as he stood,pallid and haggard, confronting the court, with a burly rural constableon either side.The medical evidence was taken first. Dr. Burrows, having been sworn,began, with sarcastic emphasis, to describe the condition of the lungsand liver, until he was interrupted by the coroner."Is all this necessary?" the latter inquired. "I mean, is it material tothe subject of the inquiry?""I should say not," replied Dr. Burrows. "It appears to me to be quiteirrelevant, but Dr. Thorndyke, who is watching the case for the defence,thought it necessary.""I think," said the coroner, "you had better give us only the facts thatare material. The jury want you to tell them what you consider to havebeen the cause of death. They don't want a lecture on pathology.""The cause of death," said Dr. Burrows, "was a penetrating wound of thechest, apparently inflicted with a large knife. The weapon enteredbetween the second and third ribs on the left side close to the sternumor breast-bone. It wounded the left lung, and partially divided both thepulmonary artery and the aorta--the two principal arteries of the body.""Was this injury alone sufficient to cause death?" the coroner asked."Yes," was the reply; "and death from injury to these great vesselswould be practically instantaneous.""Could the injury have been self-inflicted?""So far as the position and nature of the wound are concerned," repliedthe witness, "self-infliction would be quite possible. But since deathwould follow in a few seconds at the most, the weapon would be foundeither in the wound, or grasped in the hand, or, at least, quite closeto the body. But in this case no weapon was found at all, and the woundmust therefore certainly have been homicidal.""Did you see the body before it was moved?""Yes. It was lying on its back, with the arms extended and the legsnearly straight; and the sand in the neighbourhood of the body wastrampled as if a furious struggle had taken place.""Did you notice anything remarkable about the footprints in the sand?""I did," replied Dr. Burrows. "They were the footprints of two personsonly. One of these was evidently the deceased, whose footmarks could beeasily identified by the circular rubber heels. The other footprintswere those of a person--apparently a man--who wore shoes, or boots, thesoles of which were studded with nails; and these nails were arranged ina very peculiar and unusual manner, for those on the soles formed alozenge or diamond shape, and those on the heel were set out in the formof a cross.""Have you ever seen shoes or boots with the nails arranged in thismanner?""Yes. I have seen a pair of shoes which I am informed belong to theaccused; the nails in them are arranged as I have described.""Would you say that the footprints of which you have spoken were madeby those shoes?""No; I could not say that. I can only say that, to the best of mybelief, the pattern on the shoes is similar to that in the footprints."This was the sum of Dr. Burrows' evidence, and to all of it Thorndykelistened with an immovable countenance, though with the closestattention. Equally attentive was the accused man, though not equallyimpassive; indeed, so great was his agitation that presently one of theconstables asked permission to get him a chair.The next witness was Arthur Jezzard. He testified that he had viewed thebody, and identified it as that of Charles Hearn; that he had beenacquainted with deceased for some years, but knew practically nothing ofhis affairs. At the time of his death deceased was lodging in thevillage."Why did he leave the yacht?" the coroner inquired. "Was there any kindof disagreement!""Not in the least," replied Jezzard. "He grew tired of the confinementof the yacht, and came to live ashore for a change. But we were the bestof friends, and he intended to come with us when we sailed.""When did you see him last?""On the night before the body was found--that is, last Monday. He hadbeen dining on the yacht, and we put him ashore about midnight. He saidas we were rowing him ashore that he intended to walk home along thesands ss the tide was out. He went up the stone steps by thewatch-house, and turned at the top to wish us good-night. That was thelast time I saw him alive.""Do you know anything of the relations between the accused and thedeceased?" the coroner asked."Very little," replied Jezzard. "Mr. Draper was introduced to us by thedeceased about a month ago. I believe they had been acquainted someyears, and they appeared to be on excellent terms. There was noindication of any quarrel or disagreement between them.""What time did the accused leave the yacht on the night of the murder?""About ten o'clock. He said that he wanted to get home early, as hishousekeeper was away and he did not like the house to be left with noone in it."This was the whole of Jezzard's evidence, and was confirmed by that ofLeach and Pitford. Then, when the fisherman had deposed to the discoveryof the body, the sergeant was called, and stepped forward, grasping acarpet-bag, and looking as uncomfortable as if he had been the accusedinstead of a witness. He described the circumstances under which he sawthe body, giving the exact time and place with official precision."You have heard Dr. Burrows' description of the footprints?" the coronerinquired."Yes. There were two sets. One set were evidently made by deceased. Theyshowed that he entered St. Bridget's Bay from the direction of PortMarston. He had been walking along the shore just about high-water mark,sometimes above and sometimes below. Where he had walked belowhigh-water mark the footprints had of course been washed away by thesea.""How far back did you trace the footprints of deceased?""About two-thirds of the way to Sundersley Gap. Then they disappearedbelow high-water mark. Later in the evening I walked from the Gap intoPort Marston, but could not find any further traces of deceased. Hemust have walked between the tide-marks all the way from Port Marston tobeyond Sundersley. When these footprints entered St. Bridget's Bay theybecame mixed up with the footprints of another man, and the shore wastrampled for a space of a dozen yards as if a furious struggle had takenplace. The strange man's tracks came down from the Shepherd's Path, andwent up it again; but, owing to the hardness of the ground from the dryweather, the tracks disappeared a short distance up the path, and Icould not find them again.""What were these strange footprints like?" inquired the coroner."They were very peculiar," replied the sergeant. "They were made byshoes armed with smallish hob-nails, which were arranged in adiamond-shaped pattern on the holes and in a cross on the heels. Imeasured the footprints carefully, and made a drawing of each foot atthe time." Here the sergeant produced a long notebook of funerealaspect, and, having opened it at a marked place, handed it to thecoroner, who examined it attentively, and then passed it on to the jury.From the jury it was presently transferred to Thorndyke, and, lookingover his shoulder, I saw a very workmanlike sketch of a pair offootprints with the principal dimensions inserted.Thorndyke surveyed the drawing critically, jotted down a few briefnotes, and returned the sergeant's notebook to the coroner, who, as hetook it, turned once more to the officer."Have you any clue, sergeant, to the person who made these footprints?"he asked.By way of reply the sergeant opened his carpet-bag, and, extractingtherefrom a pair of smart but stoutly made shoes, laid them on thetable."Those shoes," he said, "are the property of the accused; he was wearingthem when I arrested him. They appear to correspond exactly to thefootprints of the murderer. The measurements are the same, and the nailswith which they are studded are arranged in a similar pattern."[Illustration: The Sergeant's SketchExtreme length, 113/4 inches.Width at A, 41/2 inches.Length of heel, 31/4 inchesWidth of heel at cross, 3 inches.]"Would you swear that the footprints were made with these shoes?" askedthe coroner."No, sir, I would not," was the decided answer. "I would only swear tothe similarity of size and pattern.""Had you ever seen these shoes before you made the drawing?""No, sir," replied the sergeant; and he then related the incident of thefootprints in the soft earth by the pond which led him to make thearrest.The coroner gazed reflectively at the shoes which he held in his hand,and from them to the drawing; then, passing them to the foreman of thejury, he remarked:"Well, gentlemen, it is not for me to tell you whether these shoesanswer to the description given by Dr. Burrows and the sergeant, orwhether they resemble the drawing which, as you have heard, was made bythe officer on the spot and before he had seen the shoes; that is amatter for you to decide. Meanwhile, there is another question that wemust consider." He turned to the sergeant and asked: "Have you made anyinquiries as to the movements of the accused on the night of themurder?""I have," replied the sergeant, "and I find that, on that night, theaccused was alone in the house, his housekeeper having gone over toEastwich. Two men saw him in the town about ten o'clock, apparentlywalking in the direction of Sundersley."This concluded the sergeant's evidence, and when one or two morewitnesses had been examined without eliciting any fresh facts, thecoroner briefly recapitulated the evidence, and requested the jury toconsider their verdict. Thereupon a solemn hush fell upon the court,broken only by the whispers of the jurymen, as they consulted together;and the spectators gazed in awed expectancy from the accused to thewhispering jury. I glanced at Draper, sitting huddled in his chair, hisclammy face as pale as that of the corpse in the mortuary hard by, hishands tremulous and restless; and, scoundrel as I believed him to be, Icould not but pity the abject misery that was written large all overhim, from his damp hair to his incessantly shifting feet.The jury took but a short time to consider their verdict. At the end offive minutes the foreman announced that they were agreed, and, in answerto the coroner's formal inquiry, stood up and replied:"We find that the deceased met his death by being stabbed in the chestby the accused man, Alfred Draper.""That is a verdict of wilful murder," said the coroner, and he enteredit accordingly in his notes. The Court now rose. The spectatorsreluctantly trooped out, the jurymen stood up and stretched themselves,and the two constables, under the guidance of the sergeant, carried thewretched Draper in a fainting condition to a closed fly that was waitingoutside."I was not greatly impressed by the activity of the defence," I remarkedmaliciously as we walked home.Thorndyke smiled. "You surely did not expect me to cast my pearls offorensic learning before a coroner's jury," said he."I expected that you would have something to say on behalf of yourclient," I replied. "As it was, his accusers had it all their own way.""And why not?" he asked. "Of what concern to us is the verdict of thecoroner's jury?""It would have seemed more decent to make some sort of defence," Ireplied."My dear Jervis," he rejoined, "you do not seem to appreciate the greatvirtue of what Lord Beaconsfield so felicitously called 'a policy ofmasterly inactivity'; and yet that is one of the great lessons that amedical training impresses on the student.""That may be so," said I. "But the result, up to the present, of yourmasterly policy is that a verdict of wilful murder stands against yourclient, and I don't see what other verdict the jury could have found.""Neither do I," said Thorndyke.I had written to my principal, Dr. Cooper, describing the stirringevents that were taking place in the village, and had received a replyfrom him instructing me to place the house at Thorndyke's disposal, andto give him every facility for his work. In accordance with which edictmy colleague took possession of a well-lighted, disused stable-loft, andannounced his intention of moving his things into it. Now, as these"things" included the mysterious contents of the hamper that thehousemaid had seen, I was possessed with a consuming desire to bepresent at the "flitting," and I do not mind confessing that I purposelylurked about the stairs in the hopes of thus picking up a few crumbs ofinformation.But Thorndyke was one too many for me. A misbegotten infant in thevillage having been seized with inopportune convulsions, I wascompelled, most reluctantly, to hasten to its relief; and I returnedonly in time to find Thorndyke in the act of locking the door of theloft."A nice light, roomy place to work in," he remarked, as he descended thesteps, slipping the key into his pocket."Yes," I replied, and added boldly: "What do you intend to do up there?""Work up the case for the defence," he replied, "and, as I have nowheard all that the prosecution have to say, I shall be able to forgeahead."This was vague enough, but I consoled myself with the reflection thatin a very few days I should, in common with the rest of the world, be inpossession of the results of his mysterious proceedings. For, in view ofthe approaching assizes, preparations were being made to push the casethrough the magistrate's court as quickly as possible in order to obtaina committal in time for the ensuing sessions. Draper had, of course,been already charged before a justice of the peace and evidence ofarrest taken, and it was expected that the adjourned hearing wouldcommence before the local magistrates on the fifth day after theinquest.The events of these five days kept me in a positive ferment ofcuriosity. In the first place an inspector of the Criminal InvestigationDepartment came down and browsed about the place in company with thesergeant. Then Mr. Bashfield, who was to conduct the prosecution, cameand took up his abode at the "Cat and Chicken." But the most surprisingvisitor was Thorndyke's laboratory assistant, Polton, who appeared oneevening with a large trunk and a sailor's hammock, and announced that hewas going to take up his quarters in the loft.As to Thorndyke himself, his proceedings were beyond speculation. Fromtime to time he made mysterious appearances at the windows of the loft,usually arrayed in what looked suspiciously like a nightshirt. SometimesI would see him holding a negative up to the light, at othersmanipulating a photographic printing-frame; and once I observed him witha paintbrush and a large gallipot; on which I turned away in despair,and nearly collided with the inspector."Dr. Thorndyke is staying with you, I hear," said the latter, gazingearnestly at my colleague's back, which was presented for his inspectionat the window."Yes," I answered. "Those are his temporary premises.""That is where he does his bedevilments, I suppose?" the officersuggested."He conducts his experiments there," I corrected haughtily."That's what I mean," said the inspector; and, as Thorndyke at thismoment turned and opened the window, our visitor began to ascend thesteps."I've just called to ask if I could have a few words with you, Doctor,"said the inspector, as he reached the door."Certainly," Thorndyke replied blandly. "If you will go down and waitwith Dr. Jervis, I will be with you in five minutes."The officer came down the steps grinning, and I thought I heard himmurmur "Sold!" But this may have been an illusion. However, Thorndykepresently emerged, and he and the officer strode away into theshrubbery. What the inspector's business was, or whether he had anybusiness at all, I never learned; but the incident seemed to throw somelight on the presence of Polton and the sailor's hammock. And thisreference to Polton reminds me of a very singular change that took placeabout this time in the habits of this usually staid and sedate littleman; who, abandoning the somewhat clerical style of dress that heordinarily affected, broke out into a semi-nautical costume, in which hewould sally forth every morning in the direction of Port Marston. Andthere, on more than one occasion, I saw him leaning against a post bythe harbour, or lounging outside a waterside tavern in earnest andamicable conversation with sundry nautical characters.On the afternoon of the day before the opening of the proceedings wehad two new visitors. One of them, a grey-haired spectacled man, was astranger to me, and for some reason I failed to recall his name,Copland, though I was sure I had heard it before. The other was Anstey,the barrister who usually worked with Thorndyke in cases that went intoCourt. I saw very little of either of them, however, for they retiredalmost immediately to the loft, where, with short intervals for meals,they remained for the rest of the day, and, I believe, far into thenight. Thorndyke requested me not to mention the names of his visitorsto anyone, and at the same time apologized for the secrecy of hisproceedings."But you are a doctor, Jervis," he concluded, "and you know whatprofessional confidences are; and you will understand how greatly it isin our favour that we know exactly what the prosecution can do, whilethey are absolutely in the dark as to our line of defence."I assured him that I fully understood his position, and with thisassurance he retired, evidently relieved, to the council chamber.The proceedings, which opened on the following day, and at which I waspresent throughout, need not be described in detail. The evidence forthe prosecution was, of course, mainly a repetition of that given at theinquest. Mr. Bashfield's opening statement, however, I shall give atlength, inasmuch as it summarized very clearly the whole of the caseagainst the prisoner."The case that is now before the Court," said the counsel, "involves acharge of wilful murder against the prisoner Alfred Draper, and thefacts, in so far as they are known, are briefly these: On the night ofMonday, the 27th of September, the deceased, Charles Hearn, dined withsome friends on board the yacht _Otter_. About midnight he came ashore,and proceeded to walk towards Sundersley along the beach. As he enteredSt. Bridget's Bay, a man, who appears to have been lying in wait, andwho came down the Shepherd's Path, met him, and a deadly struggle seemsto have taken place. The deceased received a wound of a kind calculatedto cause almost instantaneous death, and apparently fell down dead."And now, what was the motive of this terrible crime? It was notrobbery, for nothing appears to have been taken from the corpse. Moneyand valuables were found, as far as is known, intact. Nor, clearly, wasit a case of a casual affray. We are, consequently, driven to theconclusion that the motive was a personal one, a motive of interest orrevenge, and with this view the time, the place, and the evidentdeliberateness of the murder are in full agreement."So much for the motive. The next question is, Who was the perpetratorof this shocking crime? And the answer to that question is given in avery singular and dramatic circumstance, a circumstance that illustratesonce more the amazing lack of precaution shown by persons who commitsuch crimes. The murderer was wearing a very remarkable pair of shoes,and those shoes left very remarkable footprints in the smooth sand, andthose footprints were seen and examined by a very acute and painstakingpolice-officer, Sergeant Payne, whose evidence you will hear presently.The sergeant not only examined the footprints, he made careful drawingsof them on the spot--on the spot, mind you, not from memory--and he madevery exact measurements of them, which he duly noted down. And fromthose drawings and those measurements, those tell-tale shoes have beenidentified, and are here for your inspection."And now, who is the owner of those very singular, those almost uniqueshoes? I have said that the motive of this murder must have been apersonal one, and, behold! the owner of those shoes happens to be theone person in the whole of this district who could have had a motive forcompassing the murdered man's death. Those shoes belong to, and weretaken from the foot of, the prisoner, Alfred Draper, and the prisoner,Alfred Draper, is the only person living in this neighbourhood who wasacquainted with the deceased."It has been stated in evidence at the inquest that the relations ofthese two men, the prisoner and the deceased, were entirely friendly;but I shall prove to you that they were not so friendly as has beensupposed. I shall prove to you, by the evidence of the prisoner'shousekeeper, that the deceased was often an unwelcome visitor at thehouse, that the prisoner often denied himself when he was really at homeand disengaged, and, in short, that he appeared constantly to shun andavoid the deceased."One more question and I have finished. Where was the prisoner on thenight of the murder? The answer is that he was in a house little morethan half a mile from the scene of the crime. And who was with him inthat house? Who was there to observe and testify to his going forth andhis coming home? No one. He was alone in the house. On that night, ofall nights, he was alone. Not a soul was there to rouse at the creak ofa door or the tread of a shoe--to tell as whether he slept or whether hestole forth in the dead of the night."Such are the facts of this case. I believe that they are not disputed,and I assert that, taken together, they are susceptible of only oneexplanation, which is that the prisoner, Alfred Draper, is the man whomurdered the deceased, Charles Hearn."Immediately on the conclusion of this address, the witnesses werecalled, and the evidence given was identical with that at the inquest.The only new witness for the prosecution was Draper's housekeeper, andher evidence fully bore out Mr. Bashfield's statement. The sergeant'saccount of the footprints was listened to with breathless interest, andat its conclusion the presiding magistrate--a retired solicitor, oncewell known in criminal practice--put a question which interested me asshowing how clearly Thorndyke had foreseen the course of events,recalling, as it did, his remark on the night when we were caught in therain."Did you," the magistrate asked, "take these shoes down to the beach andcompare them with the actual footprints?""I obtained the shoes at night," replied the sergeant, "and I took themdown to the shore at daybreak the next morning. But, unfortunately,there had been a storm in the night, and the footprints were almostobliterated by the wind and rain."When the sergeant had stepped down, Mr. Bashfield announced that thatwas the case for the prosecution. He then resumed his seat, turning aninquisitive eye on Anstey and Thorndyke.The former immediately rose and opened the case for the defence with abrief statement."The learned counsel for the prosecution," said he, "has told us thatthe facts now in the possession of the Court admit of but oneexplanation--that of the guilt of the accused. That may or may not be;but I shall now proceed to lay before the Court certain freshfacts--facts, I may say, of the most singular and startling character,which will, I think, lead to a very different conclusion. I shall say nomore, but call the witnesses forthwith, and let the evidence speak foritself."The first witness for the defence was Thorndyke; and as he entered thebox I observed Polton take up a position close behind him with a largewicker trunk. Having been sworn, and requested by Anstey to tell theCourt what he knew about the case, he commenced without preamble:"About half-past four in the afternoon of the 28th of September I walkeddown Sundersley Gap with Dr. Jervis. Our attention was attracted bycertain footprints in the sand, particularly those of a man who hadlanded from a boat, had walked up the Gap, and presently returned,apparently to the boat."As we were standing there Sergeant Payne and Dr. Burrows passed downthe Gap with two constables carrying a stretcher. We followed at adistance, and as we walked along the shore we encountered another set offootprints--those which the sergeant has described as the footprints ofthe deceased. We examined these carefully, and endeavoured to frame adescription of the person by whom they had been made.""And did your description agree with the characters of the deceased?"the magistrate asked."Not in the least," replied Thorndyke, whereupon the magistrate, theinspector, and Mr. Bashfield laughed long and heartily."When we turned into St. Bridget's Bay, I saw the body of deceased lyingon the sand close to the cliff. The sand all round was covered withfootprints, as if a prolonged, fierce struggle had taken place. Therewere two sets of footprints, one set being apparently those of thedeceased and the other those of a man with nailed shoes of a verypeculiar and conspicuous pattern. The incredible folly that the wearingof such shoes indicated caused me to look more closely at thefootprints, and then I made the surprising discovery that there had inreality been no struggle; that, in fact, the two sets of footprints hadbeen made at different times.""At different times!" the magistrate exclaimed in astonishment."Yes. The interval between them may have been one of hours or one onlyof seconds, but the undoubted fact is that the two sets of footprintswere made, not simultaneously, but in succession.""But how did you arrive at that fact?" the magistrate asked."It was very obvious when one looked," said Thorndyke. "The marks of thedeceased man's shoes showed that he repeatedly trod in his ownfootprints; but never in a single instance did he tread in thefootprints of the other man, although they covered the same area. Theman with the nailed shoes, on the contrary, not only trod in his ownfootprints, but with equal frequency in those of the deceased. Moreover,when the body was removed, I observed that the footprints in the sand onwhich it was lying were exclusively those of the deceased. There was nota sign of any nail-marked footprint under the corpse, although therewere many close around it. It was evident, therefore, that thefootprints of the deceased were made first and those of the nailed shoesafterwards."As Thorndyke paused the magistrate rubbed his nose thoughtfully, andthe inspector gazed at the witness with a puzzled frown."The singularity of this fact," my colleague resumed, "made me look atthe footprints yet more critically, and then I made another discovery.There was a double track of the nailed shoes, leading apparently fromand back to the Shepherd's Path. But on examining these tracks moreclosely, I was astonished to find that the man who had made them hadbeen walking backwards; that, in fact, he had walked backwards from thebody to the Shepherd's Path, had ascended it for a short distance, hadturned round, and returned, still walking backwards, to the face of thecliff near the corpse, and there the tracks vanished altogether. On thesand at this spot were some small, inconspicuous marks which might havebeen made by the end of a rope, and there were also a few smallfragments which had fallen from the cliff above. Observing these, Iexamined the surface of the cliff, and at one spot, about six feet abovethe beach, I found a freshly rubbed spot on which were parallelscratches such as might have been made by the nailed sole of a boot. Ithen ascended the Shepherd's Path, and examined the cliff from above,and here I found on the extreme edge a rather deep indentation, such aswould be made by a taut rope, and, on lying down and looking over, Icould see, some five feet from the top, another rubbed spot with verydistinct parallel scratches.""You appear to infer," said the chairman, "that this man performed theseastonishing evolutions and was then hauled up the cliff?""That is what the appearances suggested," replied Thorndyke.The chairman pursed up his lips, raised his eyebrows, and glanceddoubtfully at his brother magistrates. Then, with a resigned air, hebowed to the witness to indicate that he was listening."That same night," Thorndyke resumed, "I cycled down to the shore,through the Gap, with a supply of plaster of Paris, and proceeded totake plaster moulds of the more important of the footprints." (Here themagistrates, the inspector, and Mr. Bashfield with one accord sat up atattention; Sergeant Payne swore quite audibly; and I experienced asudden illumination respecting a certain basin and kitchen spoon whichhad so puzzled me on the night of Thorndyke's arrival.) "As I thoughtthat liquid plaster might confuse or even obliterate the prints in sand,I filled up the respective footprints with dry plaster, pressed it downlightly, and then cautiously poured water on to it. The moulds, whichare excellent impressions, of course show the appearance of the bootswhich made the footprints, and from these moulds I have prepared castswhich reproduce the footprints themselves."The first mould that I made was that of one of the tracks from the boatup to the Gap, and of this I shall speak presently. I next made a mouldof one of the footprints which have been described as those of thedeceased.""Have been described!" exclaimed the chairman. "The deceased wascertainly there, and there were no other footprints, so, if they werenot his, he must have flown to where he was found.""I will call them the footprints of the deceased," replied Thorndykeimperturbably. "I took a mould of one of them, and with it, on the samemould, one of my own footprints. Here is the mould, and here is a castfrom it." (He turned and took them from the triumphant Polton, who hadtenderly lifted them out of the trunk in readiness.) "On looking at thecast, it will be seen that the appearances are not such as would beexpected. The deceased was five feet nine inches high, but was very thinand light, weighing only nine stone six pounds, as I ascertained byweighing the body, whereas I am five feet eleven and weigh nearlythirteen stone. But yet the footprint of the deceased is nearly twice asdeep as mine--that is to say, the lighter man has sunk into the sandnearly twice as deeply as the heavier man."The magistrates were now deeply attentive. They were no longer simplylistening to the despised utterances of a mere scientific expert. Thecast lay before them with the two footprints side by side; the evidenceappealed to their own senses and was proportionately convincing."This is very singular," said the chairman; "but perhaps you can explainthe discrepancy?""I think I can," replied Thorndyke; "but I should prefer to place allthe facts before you first.""Undoubtedly that would be better," the chairman agreed. "Pray proceed.""There was another remarkable peculiarity about these footprints,"Thorndyke continued, "and that was their distance apart--the length ofthe stride, in fact. I measured the steps carefully from heel to heel,and found them only nineteen and a half inches. But a man of Hearn'sheight would have an ordinary stride of about thirty-six inches--more ifhe was walking fast. Walking with a stride of nineteen and a half incheshe would look as if his legs were tied together."I next proceeded to the Bay, and took two moulds from the footprintsof the man with the nailed shoes, a right and a left. Here is a castfrom the mould, and it shows very clearly that the man was walkingbackwards.""How does it show that?" asked the magistrate."There are several distinctive points. For instance, the absence of theusual 'kick off' at the toe, the slight drag behind the heel, showingthe direction in which the foot was lifted, and the undisturbedimpression of the sole.""You have spoken of moulds and casts. What is the difference betweenthem?""A mould is a direct, and therefore reversed, impression. A cast is theimpression of a mould, and therefore a facsimile of the object. If Ipour liquid plaster on a coin, when it sets I have a mould, a sunkimpression, of the coin. If I pour melted wax into the mould I obtain acast, a facsimile of the coin. A footprint is a mould of the foot. Amould of the footprint is a cast of the foot, and a cast from the mouldreproduces the footprint.""Thank you," said the magistrate. "Then your moulds from these twofootprints are really facsimiles of the murderer's shoes, and can becompared with these shoes which have been put in evidence?""Yes, and when we compare them they demonstrate a very important fact.""What is that?""It is that the prisoner's shoes were not the shoes that made thosefootprints." A buzz of astonishment ran through the court, but Thorndykecontinued stolidly: "The prisoner's shoes were not in my possession, soI went on to Barker's pond, on the clay margin of which I had seenfootprints actually made by the prisoner. I took moulds of thosefootprints, and compared them with these from the sand. There areseveral important differences, which you will see if you compare them.To facilitate the comparison I have made transparent photographs of bothsets of moulds to the same scale. Now, if we put the photograph of themould of the prisoner's right shoe over that of the murderer's rightshoe, and hold the two superposed photographs up to the light, we cannotmake the two pictures coincide. They are exactly of the same length, butthe shoes are of different shape. Moreover, if we put one of the nailsin one photograph over the corresponding nail in the other photograph,we cannot make the rest of the nails coincide. But the most conclusivefact of all--from which there is no possible escape--is that the numberof nails in the two shoes is not the same. In the sole of the prisoner'sright shoe there are forty nails; in that of the murderer there areforty-one. The murderer has one nail too many."There was a deathly silence in the court as the magistrates and Mr.Bashfield pored over the moulds and the prisoner's shoes, and examinedthe photographs against the light. Then the chairman asked: "Are theseall the facts, or have you something more to tell us?" He was evidentlyanxious to get the key to this riddle."There is more evidence, your Worship," said Anstey. "The witnessexamined the body of deceased." Then, turning to Thorndyke, he asked:"You were present at the _post-mortem_ examination?""I was.""Did you form any opinion as to the cause of death?""Yes. I came to the conclusion that death was occasioned by an overdoseof morphia."A universal gasp of amazement greeted this statement. Then the presidingmagistrate protested breathlessly:"But there was a wound, which we have been told was capable of causinginstantaneous death. Was that not the case?""There was undoubtedly such a wound," replied Thorndyke. "But when thatwound was inflicted the deceased had already been dead from a quarter tohalf an hour.""This is incredible!" exclaimed the magistrate. "But, no doubt, you cangive us your reasons for this amazing conclusion?""My opinion," said Thorndyke, "was based on several facts. In the firstplace, a wound inflicted on a living body gapes rather widely, owing tothe retraction of the living skin. The skin of a dead body does notretract, and the wound, consequently, does not gape. This wound gapedvery slightly, showing that death was recent, I should say, within halfan hour. Then a wound on the living body becomes filled with blood, andblood is shed freely on the clothing. But the wound on the deceasedcontained only a little blood-clot. There was hardly any blood on theclothing, and I had already noticed that there was none on the sandwhere the body had lain.""And you consider this quite conclusive?" the magistrate askeddoubtfully."I do," answered Thorndyke. "But there was other evidence which wasbeyond all question. The weapon had partially divided both the aorta andthe pulmonary artery--the main arteries of the body. Now, during life,these great vessels are full of blood at a high internal pressure,whereas after death they become almost empty. It follows that, if thiswound had been inflicted during life, the cavity in which those vesselslie would have become filled with blood. As a matter of fact, itcontained practically no blood, only the merest oozing from some smallveins, so that it is certain that the wound was inflicted after death.The presence and nature of the poison I ascertained by analyzing certainsecretions from the body, and the analysis enabled me to judge that thequantity of the poison was large; but the contents of the stomach weresent to Professor Copland for more exact examination.""Is the result of Professor Copland's analysis known?" the magistrateasked Anstey."The professor is here, your Worship," replied Anstey, "and is preparedto swear to having obtained over one grain of morphia from the contentsof the stomach; and as this, which is in itself a poisonous dose, isonly the unabsorbed residue of what was actually swallowed, the totalquantity taken must have been very large indeed.""Thank you," said the magistrate. "And now, Dr. Thorndyke, if you havegiven us all the facts, perhaps you will tell us what conclusions youhave drawn from them.""The facts which I have stated," said Thorndyke, "appear to me toindicate the following sequence of events. The deceased died aboutmidnight on September 27, from the effects of a poisonous dose ofmorphia, how or by whom administered I offer no opinion. I think thathis body was conveyed in a boat to Sundersley Gap. The boat probablycontained three men, of whom one remained in charge of it, one walkedup the Gap and along the cliff towards St. Bridget's Bay, and the third,having put on the shoes of the deceased, carried the body along theshore to the Bay. This would account for the great depth and shortstride of the tracks that have been spoken of as those of the deceased.Having reached the Bay, I believe that this man laid the corpse down onhis tracks, and then trampled the sand in the neighbourhood. He nexttook off deceased's shoes and put them on the corpse; then he put on apair of boots or shoes which he had been carrying--perhaps hung roundhis neck--and which had been prepared with nails to imitate Draper'sshoes. In these shoes he again trampled over the area near the corpse.Then he walked backwards to the Shepherd's Path, and from it again,still backwards, to the face of the cliff. Here his accomplice hadlowered a rope, by which he climbed up to the top. At the top he tookoff the nailed shoes, and the two men walked back to the Gap, where theman who had carried the rope took his confederate on his back, andcarried him down to the boat to avoid leaving the tracks of stockingedfeet. The tracks that I saw at the Gap certainly indicated that the manwas carrying something very heavy when he returned to the boat.""But why should the man have climbed a rope up the cliff when he couldhave walked up the Shepherd's Path?" the magistrate asked."Because," replied Thorndyke, "there would then have been a set oftracks leading out of the Bay without a corresponding set leading intoit; and this would have instantly suggested to a smartpolice-officer--such as Sergeant Payne--a landing from a boat.""Your explanation is highly ingenious," said the magistrate, "andappears to cover all the very remarkable facts. Have you anything moreto tell us?""No, your Worship," was the reply, "excepting" (here he took from Poltonthe last pair of moulds and passed them up to the magistrate) "that youwill probably find these moulds of importance presently."As Thorndyke stepped from the box--for there was nocross-examination--the magistrates scrutinized the moulds with an air ofperplexity; but they were too discreet to make any remark.When the evidence of Professor Copland (which showed that anunquestionably lethal dose of morphia must have been swallowed) had beentaken, the clerk called out the--to me--unfamiliar name of Jacob Gummer.Thereupon an enormous pair of brown dreadnought trousers, from the upperend of which a smack-boy's head and shoulders protruded, walked into thewitness-box.Jacob admitted at the outset that he was a smack-master's apprentice,and that he had been "hired out" by his master to one Mr. Jezzard asdeck-hand and cabin-boy of the yacht _Otter_."Now, Gummer," said Anstey, "do you remember the prisoner coming onboard the yacht?""Yes. He has been on board twice. The first time was about a month ago.He went for a sail with us then. The second time was on the night whenMr. Hearn was murdered.""Do you remember what sort of boots the prisoner was wearing the firsttime he came?""Yes. They were shoes with a lot of nails in the soles. I remember thembecause Mr. Jezzard made him take them off and put on a canvas pair.""What was done with the nailed shoes?""Mr. Jezzard took 'em below to the cabin.""And did Mr. Jezzard come up on deck again directly?""No. He stayed down in the cabin about ten minutes.""Do you remember a parcel being delivered on board from a Londonboot-maker?""Yes. The postman brought it about four or five days after Mr. Draperhad been on board. It was labelled 'Walker Bros., Boot and Shoe Makers,London.' Mr. Jezzard took a pair of shoes from it, for I saw them on thelocker in the cabin the same day.""Did you ever see him wear them?""No. I never see 'em again.""Have you ever heard sounds of hammering on the yacht?""Yes. The night after the parcel came I was on the quay alongside, and Iheard someone a-hammering in the cabin.""What did the hammering sound like?""It sounded like a cobbler a-hammering in nails.""Have you over seen any boot-nails on the yacht?""Yes. When I was a-clearin' up the cabin the next mornin', I found ahobnail on the floor in a corner by the locker.""Were you on board on the night when Mr. Hearn died?""Yes. I'd been ashore, but I came aboard about half-past nine.""Did you see Mr. Hearn go ashore?""I see him leave the yacht. I had turned into my bunk and gone to sleep,when Mr. Jezzard calls down to me: 'We're putting Mr. Hearn ashore,'says he; 'and then,' he says, 'we're a-going for an hour's fishing. Youneedn't sit up,' he says, and with that he shuts the scuttle. Then I gotup and slid back the scuttle and put my head out, and I see Mr. Jezzardand Mr. Leach a-helpin' Mr. Hearn acrost the deck. Mr. Hearn he lookedas if he was drunk. They got him into the boat--and a rare job theyhad--and Mr. Pitford, what was in the boat already, he pushed off. Andthen I popped my head in again, 'cause I didn't want them to see me.""Did they row to the steps?""No. I put my head out again when they were gone, and I heard 'em rowround the yacht, and then pull out towards the mouth of the harbour. Icouldn't see the boat, 'cause it was a very dark night.""Very well. Now I am going to ask you about another matter. Do you knowanyone of the name of Polton?""Yes," replied Gummer, turning a dusky red. "I've just found out hisreal name. I thought he was called Simmons.""Tell us what you know about him," said Anstey, with a mischievoussmile."Well," said the boy, with a ferocious scowl at the bland and smilingPolton, "one day he come down to the yacht when the gentlemen had goneashore. I believe he'd seen 'em go. And he offers me ten shillin' to lethim see all the boots and shoes we'd got on board. I didn't see no harm,so I turns out the whole lot in the cabin for him to look at. While hewas lookin' at 'em he asks me to fetch a pair of mine from the fo'c'sle,so I fetches 'em. When I come back he was pitchin' the boots and shoesback into the locker. Then, presently, he nips off, and when he wasgone I looked over the shoes, and then I found there was a pair missing.They was an old pair of Mr. Jezzard's, and what made him nick 'em ismore than I can understand.""Would you know those shoes if you saw them!""Yes, I should," replied the lad."Are these the pair?" Anstey handed the boy a pair of dilapidated canvasshoes, which he seized eagerly."Yes, these is the ones what he stole!" he exclaimed.Anstey took them back from the boy's reluctant hands, and passed them upto the magistrate's desk. "I think," said he, "that if your Worship willcompare these shoes with the last pair of moulds, you will have no doubtthat these are the shoes which made the footprints from the sea toSundersley Gap and back again."The magistrates together compared the shoes and the moulds amidst abreathless silence. At length the chairman laid them down on the desk."It is impossible to doubt it," said he. "The broken heel and the tearin the rubber sole, with the remains of the chequered pattern, make theidentity practically certain."As the chairman made this statement I involuntarily glanced round to theplace where Jezzard was sitting. But he was not there; neither he, norPitford, nor Leach. Taking advantage of the preoccupation of the Court,they had quietly slipped out of the door. But I was not the only personwho had noted their absence. The inspector and the sergeant were alreadyin earnest consultation, and a minute later they, too, hurriedlydeparted.The proceedings now speedily came to an end. After a brief discussionwith his brother-magistrates, the chairman addressed the Court."The remarkable and I may say startling evidence, which has been heardin this court to-day, if it has not fixed the guilt of this crime on anyindividual, has, at any rate, made it clear to our satisfaction that theprisoner is not the guilty person, and he is accordingly discharged. Mr.Draper, I have great pleasure in informing you that you are at libertyto leave the court, and that you do so entirely clear of all suspicion;and I congratulate you very heartily on the skill and ingenuity of yourlegal advisers, but for which the decision of the Court would, I amafraid, have been very different."That evening, lawyers, witnesses, and the jubilant and grateful clientgathered round a truly festive board to dine, and fight over again thebattle of the day. But we were scarcely halfway through our meal when,to the indignation of the servants, Sergeant Payne burst breathlesslyinto the room."They've gone, sir!" he exclaimed, addressing Thorndyke. "They've givenus the slip for good.""Why, how can that be?" asked Thorndyke."They're dead, sir! All three of them!""Dead!" we all exclaimed."Yes. They made a burst for the yacht when they left the court, and theygot on board and put out to sea at once, hoping, no doubt, to get clearas the light was just failing. But they were in such a hurry that theydid not see a steam trawler that was entering, and was hidden by thepier. Then, just at the entrance, as the yacht was creeping out, thetrawler hit her amidships, and fairly cut her in two. The three men werein the water in an instant, and were swept away in the eddy behind thenorth pier; and before any boat could put out to them they had all goneunder. Jezzard's body came up on the beach just as I was coming away."We were all silent and a little awed, but if any of us felt regret atthe catastrophe, it was at the thought that three such cold-bloodedvillains should have made so easy an exit; and to one of us, at least,the news came as a blessed relief.IITHE STRANGER'S LATCHKEYThe contrariety of human nature is a subject that has given a surprisingamount of occupation to makers of proverbs and to those moralphilosophers who make it their province to discover and expound theglaringly obvious; and especially have they been concerned to enlargeupon that form of perverseness which engenders dislike of things offeredunder compulsion, and arouses desire of them as soon as their attainmentbecomes difficult or impossible. They assure us that a man who has had agiven thing within his reach and put it by, will, as soon as it isbeyond his reach, find it the one thing necessary and desirable; even asthe domestic cat which has turned disdainfully from the preferredsaucer, may presently be seen with her head jammed hard in the milk-jug,or, secretly and with horrible relish, slaking her thirst at thescullery sink.To this peculiarity of the human mind was due, no doubt, the fact thatno sooner had I abandoned the clinical side of my profession in favourof the legal, and taken up my abode in the chambers of my friendThorndyke, the famous medico-legal expert, to act as his assistant orjunior, than my former mode of life--that of a locum tenens, or minderof other men's practices--which had, when I was following it, seemedintolerably irksome, now appeared to possess many desirable features;and I found myself occasionally hankering to sit once more by thebedside, to puzzle out the perplexing train of symptoms, and to wieldthat power--the greatest, after all, possessed by man--the power tobanish suffering and ward off the approach of death itself.Hence it was that on a certain morning of the long vacation I foundmyself installed at The Larches, Burling, in full charge of the practiceof my old friend Dr. Hanshaw, who was taking a fishing holiday inNorway. I was not left desolate, however, for Mrs. Hanshaw remained ather post, and the roomy, old-fashioned house accommodated three visitorsin addition. One of these was Dr. Hanshaw's sister, a Mrs. Haldean, thewidow of a wealthy Manchester cotton factor; the second was her niece bymarriage, Miss Lucy Haldean, a very handsome and charming girl oftwenty-three; while the third was no less a person than Master Fred, theonly child of Mrs. Haldean, and a strapping boy of six."It is quite like old times--and very pleasant old times, too--to seeyou sitting at our breakfast-table, Dr. Jervis." With these graciouswords and a friendly smile, Mrs. Hanshaw handed me my tea-cup.I bowed. "The highest pleasure of the altruist," I replied, "is incontemplating the good fortune of others."Mrs. Haldean laughed. "Thank you," she said. "You are quite unchanged, Iperceive. Still as suave and as--shall I say oleaginous?""No, please don't!" I exclaimed in a tone of alarm."Then I won't. But what does Dr. Thorndyke say to this backsliding onyour part? How does he regard this relapse from medical jurisprudence tocommon general practice?""Thorndyke," said I, "is unmoved by any catastrophe; and he not onlyregards the 'Decline and Fall-off of the Medical Jurist' withphilosophic calm, but he even favours the relapse, as you call it. Hethinks it may be useful to me to study the application of medico-legalmethods to general practice.""That sounds rather unpleasant--for the patients, I mean," remarked MissHaldean."Very," agreed her aunt. "Most cold-blooded. What sort of man is Dr.Thorndyke? I feel quite curious about him. Is he at all human, forinstance?""He is entirely human," I replied; "the accepted tests of humanitybeing, as I understand, the habitual adoption of the erect posture inlocomotion, and the relative position of the end of the thumb--""I don't mean that," interrupted Mrs. Haldean. "I mean human in thingsthat matter.""I think those things matter," I rejoined. "Consider, Mrs. Haldean, whatwould happen if my learned colleague were to be seen in wig and gown,walking towards the Law Courts in any posture other than the erect. Itwould be a public scandal.""Don't talk to him, Mabel," said Mrs. Hanshaw; "he is incorrigible. Whatare you doing with yourself this morning, Lucy?"Miss Haldean (who had hastily set down her cup to laugh at my imaginarypicture of Dr. Thorndyke in the character of a quadruped) considered amoment."I think I shall sketch that group of birches at the edge of BradhamWood," she said."Then, in that case," said I, "I can carry your traps for you, for Ihave to see a patient in Bradham.""He is making the most of his time," remarked Mrs. Haldean maliciouslyto my hostess. "He knows that when Mr. Winter arrives he will retireinto the extreme background."Douglas Winter, whose arrival was expected in the course of the week,was Miss Haldean's fiance. Their engagement had been somewhatprotracted, and was likely to be more so, unless one of them receivedsome unexpected accession of means; for Douglas was a subaltern in theRoyal Engineers, living, with great difficulty, on his pay, while LucyHaldean subsisted on an almost invisible allowance left her by an uncle.I was about to reply to Mrs. Haldean when a patient was announced, and,as I had finished my breakfast, I made my excuses and left the table.Half an hour later, when I started along the road to the village ofBradham, I had two companions. Master Freddy had joined the party, andhe disputed with me the privilege of carrying the "traps," with theresult that a compromise was effected, by which he carried thecamp-stool, leaving me in possession of the easel, the bag, and a largebound sketching-block."Where are you going to work this morning?" I asked, when we had trudgedon some distance."Just off the road to the left there, at the edge of the wood. Not veryfar from the house of the mysterious stranger." She glanced at memischievously as she made this reply, and chuckled with delight when Irose at the bait."What house do you mean?" I inquired."Ha!" she exclaimed, "the investigator of mysteries is aroused. Hesaith, 'Ha! ha!' amidst the trumpets; he smelleth the battle afar off.""Explain instantly," I commanded, "or I drop your sketch-block into thevery next puddle.""You terrify me," said she. "But I will explain, only there isn't anymystery except to the bucolic mind. The house is called LavenderCottage, and it stands alone in the fields behind the wood. A fortnightago it was let furnished to a stranger named Whitelock, who has taken itfor the purpose of studying the botany of the district; and the onlyreally mysterious thing about him is that no one has seen him. Allarrangements with the house-agent were made by letter, and, as far as Ican make out, none of the local tradespeople supply him, so he must gethis things from a distance--even his bread, which really is rather odd.Now say I am an inquisitive, gossiping country bumpkin.""I was going to," I answered, "but it is no use now."She relieved me of her sketching appliances with pretended indignation,and crossed into the meadow, leaving me to pursue my way alone; and whenI presently looked back, she was setting up her easel and stool, gravelyassisted by Freddy.My "round," though not a long one, took up more time than I hadanticipated, and it was already past the luncheon hour when I passed theplace where I had left Miss Haldean. She was gone, as I had expected,and I hurried homewards, anxious to be as nearly punctual as possible.When I entered the dining-room, I found Mrs. Haldean and our hostessseated at the table, and both looked up at me expectantly."Have you seen Lucy?" the former inquired."No," I answered. "Hasn't she come back? I expected to find her here.She had left the wood when I passed just now."Mrs. Haldean knitted her brows anxiously. "It is very strange," shesaid, "and very thoughtless of her. Freddy will be famished."I hurried over my lunch, for two fresh messages had come in fromoutlying hamlets, effectually dispelling my visions of a quietafternoon; and as the minutes passed without bringing any signs of theabsentees, Mrs. Haldean became more and more restless and anxious. Atlength her suspense became unbearable; she rose suddenly, announcing herintention of cycling up the road to look for the defaulters, but as shewas moving towards the door, it burst open, and Lucy Haldean staggeredinto the room.Her appearance filled us with alarm. She was deadly pale, breathless,and wild-eyed; her dress was draggled and torn, and she trembled fromhead to foot."Good God, Lucy!" gasped Mrs. Haldean. "What has happened? And where isFreddy?" she added in a sterner tone."He is lost!" replied Miss Haldean in a faint voice, and with a catch inher breath. "He strayed away while I was painting. I have searched thewood through, and called to him, and looked in all the meadows. Oh!where can he have gone?" Her sketching "kit," with which she was loaded,slipped from her grasp and rattled on to the floor, and she buried herface in her hands and sobbed hysterically."And you have dared to come back without him?" exclaimed Mrs. Haldean."I was getting exhausted. I came back for help," was the faint reply."Of course she was exhausted," said Mrs. Hanshaw. "Come, Lucy: come,Mabel; don't make mountains out of molehills. The little man is safeenough. We shall find him presently, or he will come home by himself.Come and have some food, Lucy."Miss Haldean shook her head. "I can't, Mrs. Hanshaw--really I can't,"she said; and, seeing that she was in a state of utter exhaustion, Ipoured out a glass of wine and made her drink it.Mrs. Haldean darted from the room, and returned immediately, putting onher hat. "You have got to come with me and show me whore you lost him,"she said."She can't do that, you know," I said rather brusquely. "She will haveto lie down for the present. But I know the place, and will cycle upwith you.""Very well," replied Mrs. Haldean, "that will do. What time was it," sheasked, turning to her niece, "when you lost the child? and which way--"She paused abruptly, and I looked at her in surprise. She had suddenlyturned ashen and ghastly; her face had set like a mask of stone, withparted lips and staring eyes that were fixed in horror on her niece.There was a deathly silence for a few seconds. Then, in a terriblevoice, she demanded: "What is that on your dress, Lucy?" And, after apause, her voice rose into a shriek. "What have you done to my boy?"I glanced in astonishment at the dazed and terrified girl, and then Isaw what her aunt had seen--a good-sized blood-stain halfway down thefront of her skirt, and another smaller one on her right sleeve. Thegirl herself looked down at the sinister patch of red and then up at heraunt. "It looks like--like blood," she stammered. "Yes, it is--Ithink--of course it is. He struck his nose--and it bled--""Come," interrupted Mrs. Haldean, "let us go," and she rushed from theroom, leaving me to follow.I lifted Miss Haldean, who was half fainting with fatigue and agitation,on to the sofa, and, whispering a few words of encouragement into herear, turned to Mrs. Hanshaw."I can't stay with Mrs. Haldean," I said. "There are two visits to bemade at Rebworth. Will you send the dogcart up the road with somebody totake my place?""Yes," she answered. "I will send Giles, or come myself if Lucy is fitto be left."I ran to the stables for my bicycle, and as I pedalled out into the roadI could see Mrs. Haldean already far ahead, driving her machine atfrantic speed. I followed at a rapid pace, but it was not until weapproached the commencement of the wood, when she slowed down somewhat,that I overtook her."This is the place," I said, as we reached the spot where I had partedfrom Miss Haldean. We dismounted and wheeled our bicycles through thegate, and laying them down beside the hedge, crossed the meadow andentered the wood.It was a terrible experience, and one that I shall never forget--thewhite-faced, distracted woman, tramping in her flimsy house-shoes overthe rough ground, bursting through the bushes, regardless of the thornybranches that dragged at skin and hair and dainty clothing, and sendingforth from time to time a tremulous cry, so dreadfully pathetic in itsmingling of terror and coaxing softness, that a lump rose in my throat,and I could barely keep my self-control."Freddy! Freddy-boy! Mummy's here, darling!" The wailing cry soundedthrough the leafy solitude; but no answer came save the whirr of wingsor the chatter of startled birds. But even more shocking than thatterrible cry--more disturbing and eloquent with dreadful suggestion--wasthe way in which she peered, furtively, but with fearful expectation,among the roots of the bushes, or halted to gaze upon every molehill andhummock, every depression or disturbance of the ground.So we stumbled on for a while, with never a word spoken, until we cameto a beaten track or footpath leading across the wood. Here I paused toexamine the footprints, of which several were visible in the soft earth,though none seemed very recent; but, proceeding a little way down thetrack, I perceived, crossing it, a set of fresh imprints, which Irecognized at once as Miss Haldean's. She was wearing, as I knew, a pairof brown golf-boots, with rubber pads in the leather soles, and theprints made by them were unmistakable."Miss Haldean crossed the path here," I said, pointing to thefootprints."Don't speak of her before me!" exclaimed Mrs. Haldean; but she gazedeagerly at the footprints, nevertheless, and immediately plunged intothe wood to follow the tracks."You are very unjust to your niece, Mrs. Haldean," I ventured toprotest.She halted, and faced me with an angry frown."You don't understand!" she exclaimed. "You don't know, perhaps, thatif my poor child is really dead, Lucy Haldean will be a rich woman, andmay marry to-morrow if she chooses?""I did not know that," I answered, "but if I had, I should have said thesame.""Of course you would," she retorted bitterly. "A pretty face can muddleany man's judgment."She turned away abruptly to resume her pursuit, and I followed insilence. The trail which we were following zigzagged through thethickest part of the wood, but its devious windings eventually broughtus out on to an open space on the farther side. Here we at onceperceived traces of another kind. A litter of dirty rags, pieces ofpaper, scraps of stale bread, bones and feathers, with hoof-marks, wheelruts, and the ashes of a large wood fire, pointed clearly to a gipsyencampment recently broken up. I laid my hand on the heap of ashes, andfound it still warm, and on scattering it with my foot a layer ofglowing cinders appeared at the bottom."These people have only been gone an hour or two," I said. "It would bewell to have them followed without delay."A gleam of hope shone on the drawn, white face as the bereaved mothercaught eagerly at my suggestion."Yes," she exclaimed breathlessly; "she may have bribed them to take himaway. Let us see which way they went."We followed the wheel tracks down to the road, and found that theyturned towards London. At the same time I perceived the dogcart in thedistance, with Mrs. Hanshaw standing beside it; and, as the coachmanobserved me, he whipped up his horse and approached."I shall have to go," I said, "but Mrs. Hanshaw will help you tocontinue the search.""And you will make inquiries about the gipsies, won't you?" she said.I promised to do so, and as the dogcart now came up, I climbed to theseat, and drove off briskly up the London Road.The extent of a country doctor's round is always an unknown quantity. Onthe present occasion I picked up three additional patients, and as oneof them was a case of incipient pleurisy, which required to have thechest strapped, and another was a neglected dislocation of the shoulder,a great deal of time was taken up. Moreover, the gipsies, whom I ran toearth on Rebworth Common, delayed me considerably, though I had to leavethe rural constable to carry out the actual search, and, as a result,the clock of Burling Church was striking six as I drove through thevillage on my way home.I got down at the front gate, leaving the coachman to take the dogcartround, and walked up the drive; and my astonishment may be imaginedwhen, on turning the corner, I came suddenly upon the inspector of thelocal police in earnest conversation with no less a person than JohnThorndyke."What on earth has brought you here?" I exclaimed, my surprise gettingthe better of my manners."The ultimate motive-force," he replied, "was an impulsive lady namedMrs. Haldean. She telegraphed for me--in your name.""She oughtn't to have done that," I said."Perhaps not. But the ethics of an agitated woman are not worthdiscussing, and she has done something much worse--she has applied tothe local J.P. (a retired Major-General), and our gallant and unlearnedfriend has issued a warrant for the arrest of Lucy Haldean on the chargeof murder.""But there has been no murder!" I exclaimed."That," said Thorndyke, "is a legal subtlety that he does notappreciate. He has learned his law in the orderly-room, where thequalifications to practise are an irritable temper and a loud voice.However, the practical point is, inspector, that the warrant isirregular. You can't arrest people for hypothetical crimes."The officer drew a deep breath of relief. He knew all about theirregularity, and now joyfully took refuge behind Thorndyke's greatreputation.When he had departed--with a brief note from my colleague to theGeneral--Thorndyke slipped his arm through mine, and we strolled towardsthe house."This is a grim business, Jervis," said he. "That boy has got to befound for everybody's sake. Can you come with me when you have had somefood?""Of course I can. I have been saving myself all the afternoon with aview to continuing the search.""Good," said Thorndyke. "Then come in and feed."A nondescript meal, half tea and half dinner, was already prepared, andMrs. Hanshaw, grave but self-possessed, presided at the table."Mabel is still out with Giles, searching for the boy," she said. "Youhave heard what she has done!"I nodded."It was dreadful of her," continued Mrs. Hanshaw, "but she is half mad,poor thing. You might run up and say a few kind words to poor Lucy whileI make the tea."I went up at once and knocked at Miss Haldean's door, and, being biddento enter, found her lying on the sofa, red-eyed and pale, the very ghostof the merry, laughing girl who had gone out with me in the morning. Idrew up a chair, and sat down by her side, and as I took the hand sheheld out to me, she said:"It is good of you to come and see a miserable wretch like me. And Janehas been so sweet to me, Dr. Jervis; but Aunt Mabel thinks I have killedFreddy--you know she does--and it was really my fault that he was lost.I shall never forgive myself!"She burst into a passion of sobbing, and I proceeded to chide hergently."You are a silly little woman," I said, "to take this nonsense to heartas you are doing. Your aunt is not responsible just now, as you mustknow; but when we bring the boy home she shall make you a handsomeapology. I will see to that."She pressed my hand gratefully, and as the bell now rang for tea, I badeher have courage and went downstairs."You need not trouble about the practice," said Mrs. Hanshaw, as Iconcluded my lightning repast, and Thorndyke went off to get ourbicycles. "Dr. Symons has heard of our trouble, and has called to saythat he will take anything that turns up; so we shall expect you when wesee you.""How do you like Thorndyke?" I asked."He is quite charming," she replied enthusiastically; "so tactful andkind, and so handsome, too. You didn't tell us that. But here he is.Good-bye, and good luck."She pressed my hand, and I went out into the drive, where Thorndyke andthe coachman were standing with three bicycles."I see you have brought your outfit," I said as we turned into the road;for Thorndyke's machine bore a large canvas-covered case strapped on toa strong bracket."Yes; there are many things that we may want on a quest of this kind.How did you find Miss Haldean?""Very miserable, poor girl. By the way, have you heard anything abouther pecuniary interest in the child's death?""Yes," said Thorndyke. "It appears that the late Mr. Haldean used up allhis brains on his business, and had none left for the making of hiswill--as often happens. He left almost the whole of his property--abouteighty thousand pounds--to his son, the widow to have a life-interest init. He also left to his late brother's daughter, Lucy, fifty pounds ayear, and to his surviving brother Percy, who seems to have been agood-for-nothing, a hundred a year for life. But--and here is the utterfolly of the thing--if the son should die, the property was to beequally divided between the brother and the niece, with the exception offive hundred a year for life to the widow. It was an insanearrangement.""Quite," I agreed, "and a very dangerous one for Lucy Haldean, as thingsare at present.""Very; especially if anything should have happened to the child.""What are you going to do now?" I inquired, seeing that Thorndyke rodeon as if with a definite purpose."There is a footpath through the wood," he replied. "I want to examinethat. And there is a house behind the wood which I should like to see.""The house of the mysterious stranger," I suggested."Precisely. Mysterious and solitary strangers invite inquiry."We drew up at the entrance to the footpath, leaving Willett the coachmanin charge of the three machines, and proceeded up the narrow track. Aswe went, Thorndyke looked back at the prints of our feet, and noddedapprovingly."This soft loam," he remarked, "yields beautifully clear impressions,and yesterday's rain has made it perfect."We had not gone far when we perceived a set of footprints which Irecognized, as did Thorndyke also, for he remarked: "MissHaldean--running, and alone." Presently we met them again, crossing inthe opposite direction, together with the prints of small shoes withvery high heels. "Mrs. Haldean on the track of her niece," wasThorndyke's comment; and a minute later we encountered them both again,accompanied by my own footprints."The boy does not seem to have crossed the path at all," I remarked aswe walked on, keeping off the track itself to avoid confusing thefootprints."We shall know when we have examined the whole length," repliedThorndyke, plodding on with his eyes on the ground. "Ha! here issomething new," he added, stopping short and stooping down eagerly--"aman with a thick stick--a smallish man, rather lame. Notice thedifference between the two feet, and the peculiar way in which he useshis stick. Yes, Jervis, there is a great deal to interest us in thesefootprints. Do you notice anything very suggestive about them?""Nothing but what you have mentioned," I replied. "What do you mean?""Well, first there is the very singular character of the printsthemselves, which we will consider presently. You observe that this mancame down the path, and at this point turned off into the wood; then hereturned from the wood and went up the path again. The imposition of theprints makes that clear. But now look at the two sets of prints, andcompare them. Do you notice any difference?""The returning footprints seem more distinct--better impressions.""Yes; they are noticeably deeper. But there is something else." Heproduced a spring tape from his pocket, and took half a dozenmeasurements. "You see," he said, "the first set of footprints have astride of twenty-one inches from heel to heel--a short stride; but he isa smallish man, and lame; the returning ones have a stride of onlynineteen and a half inches; hence the returning footprints are deeperthan the others, and the steps are shorter. What do you make of that?""It would suggest that he was carrying a burden when he returned," Ireplied."Yes; and a heavy one, to make that difference in the depth. I think Iwill get you to go and fetch Willett and the bicycles."I strode off down the path to the entrance, and, taking possession ofThorndyke's machine, with its precious case of instruments, bade Willettfollow with the other two.When I returned, my colleague was standing with his hands behind him,gazing with intense preoccupation at the footprints. He looked upsharply as we approached, and called out to us to keep off the path ifpossible."Stay here with the machines, Willett," said he. "You and I, Jervis,must go and see where our friend went to when he left the path, and whatwas the burden that he picked up."We struck off into the wood, where last year's dead leaves made thefootprints almost indistinguishable, and followed the faint double trackfor a long distance between the dense clumps of bushes. Suddenly my eyecaught, beside the double trail, a third row of tracks, smaller in sizeand closer together. Thorndyke had seen them, too, and already hismeasuring-tape was in his hand."Eleven and a half inches to the stride," said he. "That will be theboy, Jervis. But the light is getting weak. We must press on quickly, orwe shall lose it."Some fifty yards farther on, the man's tracks ceased abruptly, but thesmall ones continued alone; and we followed them as rapidly as we couldin the fading light."There can be no reasonable doubt that these are the child's tracks,"said Thorndyke; "but I should like to find a definite footprint to makethe identification absolutely certain."A few seconds later he halted with an exclamation, and stooped on oneknee. A little heap of fresh earth from the surface-burrow of a mole hadbeen thrown up over the dead leaves; and fairly planted on it was theclean and sharp impression of a diminutive foot, with a rubber heelshowing a central star. Thorndyke drew from his pocket a tiny shoe, andpressed it on the soft earth beside the footprint; and when he raised itthe second impression was identical with the first."The boy had two pairs of shoes exactly alike," he said, "so I borrowedone of the duplicate pair."He turned, and began to retrace his steps rapidly, following our ownfresh tracks, and stopping only once to point out the place where theunknown man had picked the child up. When we regained the path weproceeded without delay until we emerged from the wood within a hundredyards of the cottage."I see Mrs. Haldean has been here with Giles," remarked Thorndyke, as hepushed open the garden-gate. "I wonder if they saw anybody."He advanced to the door, and having first rapped with his knuckles andthen kicked at it vigorously, tried the handle."Locked," he observed, "but I see the key is in the lock, so we can getin if we want to. Let us try the back."The back door was locked, too, but the key had been removed."He came out this way, evidently," said Thorndyke, "though he went in atthe front, as I suppose you noticed. Let us see where he went."The back garden was a small, fenced patch of ground, with an earth pathleading down to the back gate. A little way beyond the gate was a smallbarn or outhouse."We are in luck," Thorndyke remarked, with a glance at the path."Yesterday's rain has cleared away all old footprints, and prepared thesurface for new ones. You see there are three sets of excellentimpressions--two leading away from the house, and one set towards it.Now, you notice that both of the sets leading _from_ the house arecharacterized by deep impressions and short steps, while the set leading_to_ the house has lighter impressions and longer steps. The obviousinference is that he went down the path with a heavy burden, came backempty-handed, and went down again--and finally--with another heavyburden. You observe, too, that he walked with his stick on eachoccasion."By this time we had reached the bottom of the garden. Opening the gate,we followed the tracks towards the outhouse, which stood beside acart-track; but as we came round the corner we both stopped short andlooked at one another. On the soft earth were the very distinctimpressions of the tyres of a motor-car leading from the wide door ofthe outhouse. Finding that the door was unfastened, Thorndyke opened it,and looked in, to satisfy himself that the place was empty. Then he fellto studying the tracks."The course of events is pretty plain," he observed. "First the fellowbrought down his luggage, started the engine, and got the car out--youcan see where it stood, both by the little pool of oil, and by thewidening and blurring of the wheel-tracks from the vibration of the freeengine; then he went back and fetched the boy--carried him pick-a-back,I should say, judging by the depth of the toe-marks in the last set offootprints. That was a tactical mistake. He should have taken the boystraight into the shed."He pointed as he spoke to one of the footprints beside the wheel-tracks,from the toe of which projected a small segment of the print of a littlerubber heel.We now made our way back to the house, where we found Willett pensivelyrapping at the front door with a cycle-spanner. Thorndyke took a lastglance, with his hand in his pocket, at an open window above, and then,to the coachman's intense delight, brought forth what looked uncommonlylike a small bunch of skeleton keys. One of these he inserted into thekeyhole, and as he gave it a turn, the lock clicked, and the door stoodopen.The little sitting-room, which we now entered, was furnished with thebarest necessaries. Its centre was occupied by an oilcloth-coveredtable, on which I observed with surprise a dismembered "Bee" clock (theworks of which had been taken apart with a tin-opener that lay besidethem) and a box-wood bird-call. At these objects Thorndyke glanced andnodded, as though they fitted into some theory that he had formed;examined carefully the oilcloth around the litter of wheels and pinions,and then proceeded on a tour of inspection round the room, peeringinquisitively into the kitchen and store-cupboard."Nothing very distinctive or personal here," he remarked. "Let us goupstairs."There were three bedrooms on the upper floor, of which two wereevidently disused, though the windows were wide open. The third bedroomshowed manifest traces of occupation, though it was as bare as theothers, for the water still stood in the wash-hand basin, and the bedwas unmade. To the latter Thorndyke advanced, and, having turned backthe bedclothes, examined the interior attentively, especially at thefoot and the pillow. The latter was soiled--not to say grimy--though therest of the bed-linen was quite clean."Hair-dye," remarked Thorndyke, noting my glance at it; then he turnedand looked out of the open window. "Can you see the place where MissHaldean was sitting to sketch?" he asked."Yes," I replied; "there is the place well in view, and you can seeright up the road. I had no idea this house stood so high. From thethree upper windows you can see all over the country excepting throughthe wood.""Yes," Thorndyke rejoined, "and he has probably been in the habit ofkeeping watch up here with a telescope or a pair of field-glasses. Well,there is not much of interest in this room. He kept his effects in acabin trunk which stood there under the window. He shaved this morning.He has a white beard, to judge by the stubble on the shaving-paper, andthat is all. Wait, though. There is a key hanging on that nail. He musthave overlooked that, for it evidently does not belong to this house. Itis an ordinary town latchkey."He took the key down, and having laid a sheet of notepaper, from hispocket, on the dressing-table, produced a pin, with which he begancarefully to probe the interior of the key-barrel. Presently there cameforth, with much coaxing, a large ball of grey fluff, which Thorndykefolded up in the paper with infinite care."I suppose we mustn't take away the key," he said, "but I think we willtake a wax mould of it."He hurried downstairs, and, unstrapping the case from his bicycle,brought it in and placed it on the table. As it was now getting dark, hedetached the powerful acetylene lamp from his machine, and, havinglighted it, proceeded to open the mysterious case. First he took from ita small insufflator, or powder-blower, with which he blew a cloud oflight yellow powder over the table around the remains of the clock. Thepowder settled on the table in an even coating, but when he blew at itsmartly with his breath, it cleared off, leaving, however, a number ofsmeary impressions which stood out in strong yellow against the blackoilcloth. To one of these impressions he pointed significantly. It wasthe print of a child's hand.He next produced a small, portable microscope and some glass slides andcover-slips, and having opened the paper and tipped the ball of flufffrom the key-barrel on to a slide, set to work with a pair of mountedneedles to tease it out into its component parts. Then he turned thelight of the lamp on to the microscope mirror and proceeded to examinethe specimen."A curious and instructive assortment this, Jervis," he remarked, withhis eye at the microscope: "woollen fibres--no cotton or linen; he iscareful of his health to have woollen pockets--and two hairs; verycurious ones, too. Just look at them, and observe the root bulbs."I applied my eye to the microscope, and saw, among other things, twohairs--originally white, but encrusted with a black, opaque, glisteningstain. The root bulbs, I noticed, were shrivelled and atrophied."But how on earth," I exclaimed, "did the hairs get into his pocket?""I think the hairs themselves answer that question," he replied, "whenconsidered with the other curios. The stain is obviously lead sulphide;but what else do you see?""I see some particles of metal--a white metal apparently--and a numberof fragments of woody fibre and starch granules, but I don't recognizethe starch. It is not wheat-starch, nor rice, nor potato. Do you makeout what it is?"[Illustration: FLUFF FROM KEY-BARREL, MAGNIFIED 77 DIAMETERS.]Thorndyke chuckled. "Experientia does it," said he. "You will have,Jervis, to study the minute properties of dust and dirt. Theirevidential value is immense. Let us have another look at that starch; itis all alike, I suppose."It was; and Thorndyke had just ascertained the fact when the door burstopen and Mrs. Haldean entered the room, followed by Mrs. Hanshaw and thepolice inspector. The former lady regarded my colleague with a glance ofextreme disfavour."We heard that you had come here, sir," said she, "and we supposed youwere engaged in searching for my poor child. But it seems we weremistaken, since we find you here amusing yourselves fiddling with thesenonsensical instruments.""Perhaps, Mabel," said Mrs. Hanshaw stiffly, "it would be wiser, andinfinitely more polite, to ask if Dr. Thorndyke has any news for us.""That is undoubtedly so, madam," agreed the inspector, who hadapparently suffered also from Mrs. Haldean's impulsiveness."Then perhaps," the latter lady suggested, "you will inform us if youhave discovered anything.""I will tell you." replied Thorndyke, "all that we know. The child wasabducted by the man who occupied this house, and who appears to havewatched him from an upper window, probably through a glass. This manlured the child into the wood by blowing this bird-call; he met him inthe wood, and induced him--by some promises, no doubt--to come with him.He picked the child up and carried him--on his back, I think--up to thehouse, and brought him in through the front door, which he locked afterhim. He gave the boy this clock and the bird-call to amuse him while hewent upstairs and packed his trunk. He took the trunk out through theback door and down the garden to the shed there, in which he had amotor-car. He got the car out and came back for the boy, whom he carrieddown to the car, locking the back door after him. Then he drove away.""You know he has gone," cried Mrs. Haldean, "and yet you stay hereplaying with these ridiculous toys. Why are you not following him?""We have just finished ascertaining the facts," Thorndyke repliedcalmly, "and should by now be on the road if you had not come."Here the inspector interposed anxiously. "Of course, sir, you can't giveany description of the man. You have no clue to his identity, Isuppose?""We have only his footprints," Thorndyke answered, "and this fluff whichI raked out of the barrel of his latchkey, and have just been examining.From these data I conclude that he is a rather short and thin man, andsomewhat lame. He walks with the aid of a thick stick, which has a knob,not a crook, at the top, and which he carries in his left hand. I thinkthat his left leg has been amputated above the knee, and that he wearsan artificial limb. He is elderly, he shaves his beard, has white hairdyed a greyish black, is partly bald, and probably combs a wisp of hairover the bald place; he takes snuff, and carries a leaden comb in hispocket."As Thorndyke's description proceeded, the inspector's mouth graduallyopened wider and wider, until he appeared the very type and symbol ofastonishment. But its effect on Mrs. Haldean was much more remarkable.Rising from her chair, she leaned on the table and stared at Thorndykewith an expression of awe--even of terror; and as he finished she sankback into her chair, with her hands clasped, and turned to Mrs. Hanshaw."Jane!" she gasped, "it is Percy--my brother-in-law! He has describedhim exactly, even to his stick and his pocket-comb. But I thought he wasin Chicago.""If that is so," said Thorndyke, hastily repacking his case, "we hadbetter start at once.""We have the dogcart in the road," said Mrs. Hanshaw."Thank you," replied Thorndyke. "We will ride on our bicycles, and theinspector can borrow Willett's. We go out at the back by the cart-track,which joins the road farther on.""Then we will follow in the dogcart," said Mrs. Haldean. "Come, Jane."The two ladies departed down the path, while we made ready our bicyclesand lit our lamps."With your permission, inspector," said Thorndyke, "we will take the keywith us.""It's hardly legal, sir," objected the officer. "We have no authority.""It is quite illegal," answered Thorndyke; "but it is necessary; andnecessity--like your military J.P.--knows no law."The inspector grinned and went out, regarding me with a quivering eyelidas Thorndyke locked the door with his skeleton key. As we turned intothe road, I saw the light of the dogcart behind us, and we pushedforward at a swift pace, picking up the trail easily on the soft, moistroad."What beats me," said the inspector confidentially, as we rode along,"is how he knew the man was bald. Was it the footprints or thelatchkey? And that comb, too, that was a regular knock-out."These points were, by now, pretty clear to me. I had seen the hairs withtheir atrophied bulbs--such as one finds at the margin of a bald patch;and the comb was used, evidently, for the double purpose of keeping thebald patch covered and blackening the sulphur-charged hair. But theknobbed stick and the artificial limb puzzled me so completely that Ipresently overtook Thorndyke to demand an explanation."The stick," said he, "is perfectly simple. The ferrule of a knobbedstick wears evenly all round; that of a crooked stick wears on oneside--the side opposite the crook. The impressions showed that theferrule of this one was evenly convex; therefore it had no crook. Theother matter is more complicated. To begin with, an artificial footmakes a very characteristic impression, owing to its purely passiveelasticity, as I will show you to-morrow. But an artificial leg fittedbelow the knee is quite secure, whereas one fitted above the knee--thatis, with an artificial knee-joint worked by a spring--is much lessreliable. Now, this man had an artificial foot, and he evidentlydistrusted his knee-joint, as is shown by his steadying it with hisstick on the same side. If he had merely had a weak leg, he would haveused the stick with his right hand--with the natural swing of the arm,in fact--unless he had been very lame, which he evidently was not.Still, it was only a question of probability, though the probability wasvery great. Of course, you understand that those particles of woodyfibre and starch granules were disintegrated snuff-grains."This explanation, like the others, was quite simple when one had heardit, though it gave me material for much thought as we pedalled on alongthe dark road, with Thorndyke's light flickering in front, and thedogcart pattering in our wake. But there was ample time for reflection;for our pace rather precluded conversation, and we rode on, mile aftermile, until my legs ached with fatigue. On and on we went throughvillage after village, now losing the trail in some frequented street,but picking it up again unfailingly as we emerged on to the countryroad, until at last, in the paved High Street of the little town ofHorsefield, we lost it for good. We rode on through the town out on tothe country road; but although there were several tracks of motors,Thorndyke shook his head at them all. "I have been studying those tyresuntil I know them by heart," he said. "No; either he is in the town, orhe has left it by a side road."There was nothing for it but to put up the horse and the machines at thehotel, while we walked round to reconnoitre; and this we did, trampingup one street and down another, with eyes bent on the ground,fruitlessly searching for a trace of the missing car.Suddenly, at the door of a blacksmith's shop, Thorndyke halted. The shophad been kept open late for the shoeing of a carriage horse, which wasjust being led away, and the smith had come to the door for a breath ofair. Thorndyke accosted him genially."Good-evening. You are just the man I wanted to see. I have mislaid theaddress of a friend of mine, who, I think, called on you thisafternoon--a lame gentleman who walks with a stick. I expect he wantedyou to pick a lock or make him a key.""Oh, I remember him!" said the man. "Yes, he had lost his latchkey, andwanted the lock picked before he could get into his house. Had to leavehis motor-car outside while he came here. But I took some keys roundwith me, and fitted one to his latch."He then directed us to a house at the end of a street close by, and,having thanked him, we went off in high spirits."How did you know he had been there?" I asked."I didn't; but there was the mark of a stick and part of a left foot onthe soft earth inside the doorway, and the thing was inherentlyprobable, so I risked a false shot."The house stood alone at the far end of a straggling street, and wasenclosed by a high wall, in which, on the side facing the street, was adoor and a wide carriage-gate. Advancing to the former, Thorndyke tookfrom his pocket the purloined key, and tried it in the lock. It fittedperfectly, and when he had turned it and pushed open the door, weentered a small courtyard. Crossing this, we came to the front door ofthe house, the latch of which fortunately fitted the same key; and thishaving been opened by Thorndyke, we trooped into the hall. Immediatelywe heard the sound of an opening door above, and a reedy, nasal voicesang out:"Hello, there! Who's that below?"The voice was followed by the appearance of a head projecting over thebaluster rail."You are Mr. Percy Haldean, I think," said the inspector.At the mention of this name, the head was withdrawn, and a quick treadwas heard, accompanied by the tapping of a stick on the floor. Westarted to ascend the stairs, the inspector leading, as the authorizedofficial; but we had only gone up a few steps, when a fierce, wirylittle man danced out on to the landing, with a thick stick in onehand and a very large revolver in the other."Move another step, either of you," he shouted, pointing the weapon atthe inspector, "and I let fly; and mind you, when I shoot I hit."[Illustration: THE STRANGER IS RUN TO EARTH.]He looked as if he meant it, and we accordingly halted with remarkablesuddenness, while the inspector proceeded to parley."Now, what's the good of this, Mr. Haldean?" said he. "The game's up,and you know it.""You clear out of my house, and clear out sharp," was the inhospitablerejoinder, "or you'll give me the trouble of burying you in the garden."I looked round to consult with Thorndyke, when, to my amazement, I foundthat he had vanished--apparently through the open hall-door. I wasadmiring his discretion when the inspector endeavoured to reopennegotiations, but was cut short abruptly."I am going to count fifty," said Mr. Haldean, "and if you aren't gonethen, I shall shoot."He began to count deliberately, and the inspector looked round at me incomplete bewilderment. The flight of stairs was a long one, and welllighted by gas, so that to rush it was an impossibility. Suddenly myheart gave a bound and I held my breath, for out of an open door behindour quarry, a figure emerged slowly and noiselessly on to the landing.It was Thorndyke, shoeless, and in his shirt-sleeves.Slowly and with cat-like stealthiness, he crept across the landing untilhe was within a yard of the unconscious fugitive, and still the nasalvoice droned on, monotonously counting out the allotted seconds."Forty-one, forty-two, forty-three--"There was a lightning-like movement--a shout--a flash--a bang--a showerof falling plaster, and then the revolver came clattering down thestairs. The inspector and I rushed up, and in a moment the sharp clickof the handcuffs told Mr. Percy Haldean that the game was really up.       *       *       *       *       *Five minutes later Freddy-boy, half asleep, but wholly cheerful, wasborne on Thorndyke's shoulders into the private sitting-room of theBlack Horse Hotel. A shriek of joy saluted his entrance, and a shower ofmaternal kisses brought him to the verge of suffocation. Finally, theimpulsive Mrs. Haldean, turning suddenly to Thorndyke, seized both hishands, and for a moment I hoped that she was going to kiss him, too. Buthe was spared, and I have not yet recovered from the disappointment.IIITHE ANTHROPOLOGIST AT LARGEThorndyke was not a newspaper reader. He viewed with extreme disfavourall scrappy and miscellaneous forms of literature, which, by presentinga disorderly series of unrelated items of information, tended, as heconsidered, to destroy the habit of consecutive mental effort."It is most important," he once remarked to me, "habitually to pursue adefinite train of thought, and to pursue it to a finish, instead offlitting indolently from one uncompleted topic to another, as thenewspaper reader is so apt to do. Still, there is no harm in a dailypaper--so long as you don't read it."Accordingly, he patronized a morning paper, and his method of dealingwith it was characteristic. The paper was laid on the table afterbreakfast, together with a blue pencil and a pair of office shears. Apreliminary glance through the sheets enabled him to mark with thepencil those paragraphs that were to be read, and these were presentlycut out and looked through, after which they were either thrown away orset aside to be pasted in an indexed book.The whole proceeding occupied, on an average, a quarter of an hour.On the morning of which I am now speaking he was thus engaged. Thepencil had done its work, and the snick of the shears announced thefinal stage. Presently he paused with a newly-excised cutting betweenhis fingers, and, after glancing at it for a moment, he handed it to me."Another art robbery," he remarked. "Mysterious affairs, these--as tomotive, I mean. You can't melt down a picture or an ivory carving, andyou can't put them on the market as they stand. The very qualities thatgive them their value make them totally unnegotiable.""Yet I suppose," said I, "the really inveterate collector--the potteryor stamp maniac, for instance--will buy these contraband goods eventhough he dare not show them.""Probably. No doubt the _cupiditas habendi_, the mere desire to possess,is the motive force rather than any intelligent purpose--"The discussion was at this point interrupted by a knock at the door, anda moment later my colleague admitted two gentlemen. One of these Irecognized as a Mr. Marchmont, a solicitor, for whom we had occasionallyacted; the other was a stranger--a typical Hebrew of the blondetype--good-looking, faultlessly dressed, carrying a bandbox, andobviously in a state of the most extreme agitation."Good-morning to you, gentlemen," said Mr. Marchmont, shaking handscordially. "I have brought a client of mine to see you, and when I tellyou that his name is Solomon Loewe, it will be unnecessary for me to saywhat our business is.""Oddly enough," replied Thorndyke, "we were, at the very moment when youknocked, discussing the bearings of his case.""It is a horrible affair!" burst in Mr. Loewe. "I am distracted! I amruined! I am in despair!"He banged the bandbox down on the table, and flinging himself into achair, buried his face in his hands."Come, come," remonstrated Marchmont, "we must be brave, we must becomposed. Tell Dr. Thorndyke your story, and let us hear what he thinksof it."He leaned back in his chair, and looked at his client with that air ofpatient fortitude that comes to us all so easily when we contemplate themisfortunes of other people."You must help us, sir," exclaimed Loewe, starting up again--"you must,indeed, or I shall go mad. But I shall tell you what has happened, andthen you must act at once. Spare no effort and no expense. Money is noobject--at least, not in reason," he added, with native caution. He satdown once more, and in perfect English, though with a slight Germanaccent, proceeded volubly: "My brother Isaac is probably known to you byname."Thorndyke nodded."He is a great collector, and to some extent a dealer--that is to say,he makes his hobby a profitable hobby.""What does he collect?" asked Thorndyke."Everything," replied our visitor, flinging his hands apart with acomprehensive gesture--"everything that is precious andbeautiful--pictures, ivories, jewels, watches, objects of art and_vertu_--everything. He is a Jew, and he has that passion for thingsthat are rich and costly that has distinguished our race from the timeof my namesake Solomon onwards. His house in Howard Street, Piccadilly,is at once a museum and an art gallery. The rooms are filled with casesof gems, of antique jewellery, of coins and historic relics--some ofpriceless value--and the walls are covered with paintings, every one ofwhich is a masterpiece. There is a fine collection of ancient weaponsand armour, both European and Oriental; rare books, manuscripts, papyri,and valuable antiquities from Egypt, Assyria, Cyprus, and elsewhere. Yousee, his taste is quite catholic, and his knowledge of rare and curiousthings is probably greater than that of any other living man. He isnever mistaken. No forgery deceives him, and hence the great prices thathe obtains; for a work of art purchased from Isaac Loewe is a workcertified as genuine beyond all cavil."He paused to mop his face with a silk handkerchief, and then, with thesame plaintive volubility, continued:"My brother is unmarried. He lives for his collection, and he lives withit. The house is not a very large one, and the collection takes up mostof it; but he keeps a suite of rooms for his own occupation, and has twoservants--a man and wife--to look after him. The man, who is a retiredpolice sergeant, acts as caretaker and watchman; the woman ashousekeeper and cook, if required, but my brother lives largely at hisclub. And now I come to this present catastrophe."He ran his fingers through his hair, took a deep breath, and continued:"Yesterday morning Isaac started for Florence by way of Paris, but hisroute was not certain, and he intended to break his journey at variouspoints as circumstances determined. Before leaving, he put hiscollection in my charge, and it was arranged that I should occupy hisrooms in his absence. Accordingly, I sent my things round and tookpossession."Now, Dr. Thorndyke, I am closely connected with the drama, and it is mycustom to spend my evenings at my club, of which most of the members areactors. Consequently, I am rather late in my habits; but last night Iwas earlier than usual in leaving my club, for I started for mybrother's house before half-past twelve. I felt, as you may suppose, theresponsibility of the great charge I had undertaken; and you may,therefore, imagine my horror, my consternation, my despair, when, onletting myself in with my latchkey, I found a police-inspector, asergeant, and a constable in the hall. There had been a robbery, sir, inmy brief absence, and the account that the inspector gave of the affairwas briefly this:"While taking the round of his district, he had noticed an empty hansomproceeding in leisurely fashion along Howard Street. There was nothingremarkable in this, but when, about ten minutes later, he was returning,and met a hansom, which he believed to be the same, proceeding along thesame street in the same direction, and at the same easy pace, thecircumstance struck him as odd, and he made a note of the number of thecab in his pocket-book. It was 72,863, and the time was 11.35."At 11.45 a constable coming up Howard Street noticed a hansom standingopposite the door of my brother's house, and, while he was looking atit, a man came out of the house carrying something, which he put in thecab. On this the constable quickened his pace, and when the man returnedto the house and reappeared carrying what looked like a portmanteau, andclosing the door softly behind him, the policeman's suspicions werearoused, and he hurried forward, hailing the cabman to stop."The man put his burden into the cab, and sprang in himself. The cabmanlashed his horse, which started off at a gallop, and the policeman brokeinto a run, blowing his whistle and flashing his lantern on to the cab.He followed it round the two turnings into Albemarle Street, and wasjust in time to see it turn into Piccadilly, where, of course, it waslost. However, he managed to note the number of the cab, which was72,863, and he describes the man as short and thick-set, and thinks hewas not wearing any hat."As he was returning, he met the inspector and the sergeant, who hadheard the whistle, and on his report the three officers hurried to thehouse, where they knocked and rang for some minutes without any result.Being now more than suspicious, they went to the back of the house,through the mews, where, with great difficulty, they managed to force awindow and effect an entrance into the house."Here their suspicions were soon changed to certainty, for, on reachingthe first-floor, they heard strange muffled groans proceeding from oneof the rooms, the door of which was locked, though the key had not beenremoved. They opened the door, and found the caretaker and his wifesitting on the floor, with their backs against the wall. Both were boundhand and foot, and the head of each was enveloped in a green-baize bag;and when the bags were taken off, each was found to be lightly buteffectively gagged."Each told the same story. The caretaker, fancying he heard a noise,armed himself with a truncheon, and came downstairs to the first-floor,where he found the door of one of the rooms open, and a light burninginside. He stepped on tiptoe to the open door, and was peering in, whenhe was seized from behind, half suffocated by a pad held over his mouth,pinioned, gagged, and blindfolded with the bag."His assailant--whom he never saw--was amazingly strong and skilful, andhandled him with perfect ease, although he--the caretaker--is a powerfulman, and a good boxer and wrestler. The same thing happened to the wife,who had come down to look for her husband. She walked into the sametrap, and was gagged, pinioned, and blindfolded without ever having soonthe robber. So the only description that we have of this villain is thatfurnished by the constable.""And the caretaker had no chance of using his truncheon?" saidThorndyke."Well, he got in one backhanded blow over his right shoulder, which hethinks caught the burglar in the face; but the fellow caught him by theelbow, and gave his arm such a twist that he dropped the truncheon onthe floor.""Is the robbery a very extensive one?""Ah!" exclaimed Mr. Loewe, "that is just what we cannot say. But I fearit is. It seems that my brother had quite recently drawn out of his bankfour thousand pounds in notes and gold. These little transactions areoften carried out in cash rather than by cheque"--here I caught atwinkle in Thorndyke's eve--"and the caretaker says that a few days agoIsaac brought home several parcels, which were put away temporarily in astrong cupboard. He seemed to be very pleased with his new acquisitions,and gave the caretaker to understand that they were of extraordinaryrarity and value."Now, this cupboard has been cleared out. Not a vestige is left in itbut the wrappings of the parcels, so, although nothing else has beentouched, it is pretty clear that goods to the value of four thousandpounds have been taken; but when we consider what an excellent buyer mybrother is, it becomes highly probable that the actual value of thosethings is two or three times that amount, or even more. It is adreadful, dreadful business, and Isaac will hold me responsible for itall.""Is there no further clue?" asked Thorndyke. "What about the cab, forinstance?""Oh, the cab," groaned Loewe--"that clue failed. The police must havemistaken the number. They telephoned immediately to all the policestations, and a watch was set, with the result that number 72,863 wasstopped as it was going home for the night. But it then turned out thatthe cab had not been off the rank since eleven o'clock, and the driverhad been in the shelter all the time with several other men. But thereis a clue; I have it here."Mr. Loewe's face brightened for once as he reached out for the bandbox."The houses in Howard Street," he explained, as he untied the fastening,"have small balconies to the first-floor windows at the back. Now, thethief entered by one of these windows, having climbed up a rain-waterpipe to the balcony. It was a gusty night, as you will remember, andthis morning, as I was leaving the house, the butler next door called tome and gave me this; he had found it lying in the balcony of his house."He opened the bandbox with a flourish, and brought forth a rather shabbybillycock hat."I understand," said he, "that by examining a hat it is possible todeduce from it, not only the bodily characteristics of the wearer, butalso his mental and moral qualities, his state of health, his pecuniaryposition, his past history, and even his domestic relations and thepeculiarities of his place of abode. Am I right in this supposition?"The ghost of a smile flitted across Thorndyke's face as he laid the hatupon the remains of the newspaper. "We must not expect too much," heobserved. "Hats, as you know, have a way of changing owners. Your ownhat, for instance" (a very spruce, hard felt), "is a new one, I think.""Got it last week," said Mr. Loewe."Exactly. It is an expensive hat, by Lincoln and Bennett, and I see youhave judiciously written your name in indelible marking-ink on thelining. Now, a new hat suggests a discarded predecessor. What do you dowith your old hats?""My man has them, but they don't fit him. I suppose he sells them orgives them away.""Very well. Now, a good hat like yours has a long life, and remainsserviceable long after it has become shabby; and the probability is thatmany of your hats pass from owner to owner; from you to theshabby-genteel, and from them to the shabby ungenteel. And it is a fairassumption that there are, at this moment, an appreciable number oftramps and casuals wearing hats by Lincoln and Bennett, marked inindelible ink with the name S. Loewe; and anyone who should examine thosehats, as you suggest, might draw some very misleading deductions as tothe personal habits of S. Loewe."Mr. Marchmont chuckled audibly, and then, remembering the gravity ofthe occasion, suddenly became portentously solemn."So you think that the hat is of no use, after all?" said Mr. Loewe, in atone of deep disappointment."I won't say that," replied Thorndyke. "We may learn something from it.Leave it with me, at any rate; but you must let the police know that Ihave it. They will want to see it, of course.""And you will try to get those things, won't you?" pleaded Loewe."I will think over the case. But you understand, or Mr. Marchmont does,that this is hardly in my province. I am a medical jurist, and this isnot a medico-legal case.""Just what I told him," said Marchmont. "But you will do me a greatkindness if you will look into the matter. Make it a medico-legal case,"he added persuasively.Thorndyke repeated his promise, and the two men took their departure.For some time after they had left, my colleague remained silent,regarding the hat with a quizzical smile. "It is like a game offorfeits," he remarked at length, "and we have to find the owner of'this very pretty thing.'" He lifted it with a pair of forceps into abetter light, and began to look at it more closely."Perhaps," said he, "we have done Mr. Loewe an injustice, after all. Thisis certainly a very remarkable hat.""It is as round as a basin," I exclaimed. "Why, the fellow's head musthave been turned in a lathe!"Thorndyke laughed. "The point," said he, "is this. This is a hard hat,and so must have fitted fairly, or it could not have been worn; and itwas a cheap hat, and so was not made to measure. But a man with a headthat shape has got to come to a clear understanding with his hat. Noordinary hat would go on at all."Now, you see what he has done--no doubt on the advice of some friendlyhatter. He has bought a hat of a suitable size, and he has made ithot--probably steamed it. Then he has jammed it, while still hot andsoft, on to his head, and allowed it to cool and set before removing it.That is evident from the distortion of the brim. The important corollaryis, that this hat fits his head exactly--is, in fact, a perfect mould ofit; and this fact, together with the cheap quality of the hat, furnishesthe further corollary that it has probably only had a single owner."And now let us turn it over and look at the outside. You notice at oncethe absence of old dust. Allowing for the circumstance that it had beenout all night, it is decidedly clean. Its owner has been in the habit ofbrushing it, and is therefore presumably a decent, orderly man. But ifyou look at it in a good light, you see a kind of bloom on the felt, andthrough this lens you can make out particles of a fine white powderwhich has worked into the surface."He handed me his lens, through which I could distinctly see theparticles to which he referred."Then," he continued, "under the curl of the brim and in the folds ofthe hatband, where the brush has not been able to reach it, the powderhas collected quite thickly, and we can see that it is a very finepowder, and very white, like flour. What do you make of that?""I should say that it is connected with some industry. He may beengaged in some factory or works, or, at any rate, may live near afactory, and have to pass it frequently.""Yes; and I think we can distinguish between the two possibilities. For,if he only passes the factory, the dust will be on the outside of thehat only; the inside will be protected by his head. But if he is engagedin the works, the dust will be inside, too, as the hat will hang on apeg in the dust-laden atmosphere, and his head will also be powdered,and so convey the dust to the inside."He turned the hat over once more, and as I brought the powerful lens tobear upon the dark lining, I could clearly distinguish a number of whiteparticles in the interstices of the fabric."The powder is on the inside, too," I said.He took the lens from me, and, having verified my statement, proceededwith the examination. "You notice," he said, "that the leatherhead-lining is stained with grease, and this staining is more pronouncedat the sides and back. His hair, therefore, is naturally greasy, or hegreases it artificially; for if the staining were caused byperspiration, it would be most marked opposite the forehead."He peered anxiously into the interior of the hat, and eventually turneddown the head-lining; and immediately there broke out upon his face agleam of satisfaction."Ha!" he exclaimed. "This is a stroke of luck. I was afraid our neat andorderly friend had defeated us with his brush. Pass me the smalldissecting forceps, Jervis."I handed him the instrument, and he proceeded to pick out daintily fromthe space behind the head-lining some half a dozen short pieces ofhair, which he laid, with infinite tenderness, on a sheet of whitepaper."There are several more on the other side," I said, pointing them out tohim."Yes, but we must leave some for the police," he answered, with a smile."They must have the same chance as ourselves, you know.""But surely," I said, as I bent down over the paper, "these are piecesof horsehair!""I think not," he replied; "but the microscope will show. At any rate,this is the kind of hair I should expect to find with a head of thatshape.""Well, it is extraordinarily coarse," said I, "and two of the hairs arenearly white.""Yes; black hairs beginning to turn grey. And now, as our preliminarysurvey has given such encouraging results, we will proceed to more exactmethods; and we must waste no time, for we shall have the police herepresently to rob us of our treasure."He folded up carefully the paper containing the hairs, and taking thehat in both hands, as though it were some sacred vessel, ascended withme to the laboratory on the next floor."Now, Polton," he said to his laboratory assistant, "we have here aspecimen for examination, and time is precious. First of all, we wantyour patent dust-extractor."The little man bustled to a cupboard and brought forth a singularappliance, of his own manufacture, somewhat like a miniature vacuumcleaner. It had been made from a bicycle foot-pump, by reversing thepiston-valve, and was fitted with a glass nozzle and a small detachableglass receiver for collecting the dust, at the end of a flexible metaltube."We will sample the dust from the outside first," said Thorndyke, layingthe hat upon the work-bench. "Are you ready, Polton?"The assistant slipped his foot into the stirrup of the pump and workedthe handle vigorously, while Thorndyke drew the glass nozzle slowlyalong the hat-brim under the curled edge. And as the nozzle passedalong, the white coating vanished as if by magic, leaving the feltabsolutely clean and black, and simultaneously the glass receiver becameclouded over with a white deposit."We will leave the other side for the police," said Thorndyke, and asPolton ceased pumping he detached the receiver, and laid it on a sheetof paper, on which he wrote in pencil, "Outside," and covered it with asmall bell-glass. A fresh receiver having been fitted on, the nozzle wasnow drawn over the silk lining of the hat, and then through the spacebehind the leather head-lining on one side; and now the dust thatcollected in the receiver was much of the usual grey colour and fluffytexture, and included two more hairs."And now," said Thorndyke, when the second receiver had been detachedand set aside, "we want a mould of the inside of the hat, and we mustmake it by the quickest method; there is no time to make a paper mould.It is a most astonishing head," he added, reaching down from a nail apair of large callipers, which he applied to the inside of the hat; "sixinches and nine-tenths long by six and six-tenths broad, which givesus"--he made a rapid calculation on a scrap of paper--"theextraordinarily high cephalic index of 95.6."Polton now took possession of the hat, and, having stuck a band of wettissue-paper round the inside, mixed a small bowl of plaster-of-Paris,and very dexterously ran a stream of the thick liquid on to thetissue-paper, where it quickly solidified. A second and thirdapplication resulted in a broad ring of solid plaster an inch thick,forming a perfect mould of the inside of the hat, and in a few minutesthe slight contraction of the plaster in setting rendered the mouldsufficiently loose to allow of its being slipped out on to a board todry.We were none too soon, for even as Polton was removing the mould, theelectric bell, which I had switched on to the laboratory, announced avisitor, and when I went down I found a police-sergeant waiting with anote from Superintendent Miller, requesting the immediate transfer ofthe hat."The next thing to be done," said Thorndyke, when the sergeant haddeparted with the bandbox, "is to measure the thickness of the hairs,and make a transverse section of one, and examine the dust. The sectionwe will leave to Polton--as time is an object, Polton, you had betterimbed the hair in thick gum and freeze it hard on the microtome, and bevery careful to cut the section at right angles to the length of thehair--meanwhile, we will get to work with the microscope."The hairs proved on measurement to have the surprisingly large diameterof 1/135 of an inch--fully double that of ordinary hairs, although theywere unquestionably human. As to the white dust, it presented a problemthat even Thorndyke was unable to solve. The application of reagentsshowed it to be carbonate of lime, but its source for a time remained amystery."The larger particles," said Thorndyke, with his eye applied to themicroscope, "appear to be transparent, crystalline, and distinctlylaminated in structure. It is not chalk, it is not whiting, it is notany kind of cement. What can it be?""Could it be any kind of shell?" I suggested. "For instance--""Of course!" he exclaimed, starting up; "you have hit it, Jervis, as youalways do. It must be mother-of-pearl. Polton, give me a pearlshirt-button out of your oddments box."The button was duly produced by the thrifty Polton, dropped into anagate mortar, and speedily reduced to powder, a tiny pinch of whichThorndyke placed under the microscope."This powder," said he, "is, naturally, much coarser than our specimen,but the identity of character is unmistakable. Jervis, you are atreasure. Just look at it."I glanced down the microscope, and then pulled out my watch. "Yes," Isaid, "there is no doubt about it, I think; but I must be off. Ansteyurged me to be in court by 11.30 at the latest."With infinite reluctance I collected my notes and papers and departed,leaving Thorndyke diligently copying addresses out of the Post OfficeDirectory.My business at the court detained me the whole of the day, and it wasnear upon dinner-time when I reached our chambers. Thorndyke had not yetcome in, but he arrived half an hour later, tired and hungry, and notvery communicative."What have I done?" he repeated, in answer to my inquiries. "I havewalked miles of dirty pavement, and I have visited every pearl-shellcutter's in London, with one exception, and I have not found what Iwas looking for. The one mother-of-pearl factory that remains, however,is the most likely, and I propose to look in there to-morrow morning.Meanwhile, we have completed our data, with Polton's assistance. Here isa tracing of our friend's skull taken from the mould; you see it is anextreme type of brachycephalic skull, and markedly unsymmetrical. Hereis a transverse section of his hair, which is quite circular--unlikeyours or mine, which would be oval. We have the mother-of-pearl dustfrom the outside of the hat, and from the inside similar dust mixed withvarious fibres and a few granules of rice starch. Those are our data."[Illustration: TRANSVERSE SECTIONS OF HUMAN HAIR: _A_, OF A NEGRO; _B_,OF AN ENGLISHMAN; _C_, OF THE BURGLAR. ALL MAGNIFIED 600 DIAMETERS.]"Supposing the hat should not be that of the burglar after all?" Isuggested."That would be annoying. But I think it is his, and I think I can guessat the nature of the art treasures that were stolen.""And you don't intend to enlighten me?""My dear fellow," he replied, "you have all the data. Enlighten yourselfby the exercise of your own brilliant faculties. Don't give way tomental indolence."I endeavoured, from the facts in my possession, to construct thepersonality of the mysterious burglar, and failed utterly; nor was Imore successful in my endeavour to guess at the nature of the stolenproperty; and it was not until the following morning, when we had setout on our quest and were approaching Limehouse, that Thorndyke wouldrevert to the subject."We are now," he said, "going to the factory of Badcomb and Martin,shell importers and cutters, in the West India Dock Road. If I don'tfind my man there, I shall hand the facts over to the police, and wasteno more time over the case.""What is your man like?" I asked."I am looking for an elderly Japanese, wearing a new hat or, moreprobably, a cap, and having a bruise on his right cheek or temple. I amalso looking for a cab-yard; but here we are at the works, and as it isnow close on the dinner-hour, we will wait and see the hands come outbefore making any inquiries."We walked slowly past the tall, blank-faced building, and were justturning to re-pass it when a steam whistle sounded, a wicket opened inthe main gate, and a stream of workmen--each powdered with white, like amiller--emerged into the street. We halted to watch the men as they cameout, one by one, through the wicket, and turned to the right or lefttowards their homes or some adjacent coffee-shop; but none of themanswered to the description that my friend had given.The outcoming stream grew thinner, and at length ceased; the wicket wasshut with a bang, and once more Thorndyke's quest appeared to havefailed."Is that all of them, I wonder?" he said, with a shade of disappointmentin his tone; but even as he spoke the wicket opened again, and a legprotruded. The leg was followed by a back and a curious globular head,covered with iron-grey hair, and surmounted by a cloth cap, the wholeappertaining to a short, very thick-set man, who remained thus,evidently talking to someone inside.Suddenly he turned his head to look across the street; and immediately Irecognized, by the pallid yellow complexion and narrow eye-slits, thephysiognomy of a typical Japanese. The man remained talking for nearlyanother minute; then, drawing out his other leg, he turned towards us;and now I perceived that the right side of his face, over the prominentcheekbone, was discoloured as though by a severe bruise."Ha!" said Thorndyke, turning round sharply as the man approached,"either this is our man or it is an incredible coincidence." He walkedaway at a moderate pace, allowing the Japanese to overtake us slowly,and when the man had at length passed us, he increased his speedsomewhat, so as to maintain the distance.Our friend stepped along briskly, and presently turned up a side street,whither we followed at a respectful distance, Thorndyke holding open hispocket-book, and appearing to engage me in an earnest discussion, butkeeping a sharp eye on his quarry."There he goes!" said my colleague, as the man suddenlydisappeared--"the house with the green window-sashes. That will benumber thirteen."It was; and, having verified the fact, we passed on, and took the nextturning that would lead us back to the main road.Some twenty minutes later, as we were strolling past the door of acoffee-shop, a man came out, and began to fill his pipe with an air ofleisurely satisfaction. His hat and clothes were powdered with whitelike those of the workmen whom we had seen come out of the factory.Thorndyke accosted him."Is that a flour-mill up the road there?""No, sir; pearl-shell. I work there myself.""Pearl-shell, eh?" said Thorndyke. "I suppose that will be an industrythat will tend to attract the aliens. Do you find it so?""No, sir; not at all. The work's too hard. We've only got one foreignerin the place, and he ain't an alien--he's a Jap.""A Jap!" exclaimed Thorndyke. "Really. Now, I wonder if that wouldchance to be our old friend Kotei--you remember Kotei?" he added,turning to me."No, sir; this man's name is Futashima. There was another Jap in theworks, a chap named Itu, a pal of Futashima's, but he's left.""Ah! I don't know either of them. By the way, usen't there to be acab-yard just about here?""There's a yard up Rankin Street where they keep vans and one or twocabs. That chap Itu works there now. Taken to horseflesh. Drives a vansometimes. Queer start for a Jap.""Very." Thorndyke thanked the man for his information, and we saunteredon towards Rankin Street. The yard was at this time nearly deserted,being occupied only by an ancient and crazy four-wheeler and a veryshabby hansom."Curious old houses, these that back on to the yard," said Thorndyke,strolling into the enclosure. "That timber gable, now," pointing to ahouse, from a window of which a man was watching us suspiciously, "isquite an interesting survival.""What's your business, mister?" demanded the man in a gruff tone."We are just having a look at these quaint old houses," repliedThorndyke, edging towards the back of the hansom, and opening hispocket-book, as though to make a sketch."Well, you can see 'em from outside," said the man.[Illustration: THORNDYKE'S STRATEGY.]"So we can," said Thorndyke suavely, "but not so well, you know."At this moment the pocket-book slipped from his hand and fell,scattering a number of loose papers about the ground under the hansom,and our friend at the window laughed joyously."No hurry," murmured Thorndyke, as I stooped to help him to gather upthe papers--which he did in the most surprisingly slow and clumsymanner. "It is fortunate that the ground is dry." He stood up with therescued papers in his hand, and, having scribbled down a brief note,slipped the book in his pocket."Now you'd better mizzle," observed the man at the window."Thank you," replied Thorndyke, "I think we had;" and, with a pleasantnod at the custodian, he proceeded to adopt the hospitable suggestion.       *       *       *       *       *"Mr. Marchmont has been here, sir, with Inspector Badger and anothergentleman," said Polton, as we entered our chambers. "They said theywould call again about five.""Then," replied Thorndyke, "as it is now a quarter to five, there isjust time for us to have a wash while you get the tea ready. Theparticles that float in the atmosphere of Limehouse are not allmother-of-pearl."Our visitors arrived punctually, the third gentleman being, as we hadsupposed, Mr. Solomon Loewe. Inspector Badger I had not seen before, andhe now impressed me as showing a tendency to invert the significance ofhis own name by endeavouring to "draw" Thorndyke; in which, however, hewas not brilliantly successful."I hope you are not going to disappoint Mr. Loewe, sir," he commencedfacetiously. "You have had a good look at that hat--we saw your marks onit--and he expects that you will be able to point us out the man, nameand address all complete." He grinned patronizingly at our unfortunateclient, who was looking even more haggard and worn than he had been onthe previous morning."Have you--have you made any--discovery?" Mr Loewe asked with patheticeagerness."We examined the hat very carefully, and I think we have established afew facts of some interest.""Did your examination of the hat furnish any information as to thenature of the stolen property, sir?" inquired the humorous inspector.Thorndyke turned to the officer with a face as expressionless as awooden mask."We thought it possible," said he, "that it might consist of works ofJapanese art, such as netsukes, paintings, and such like."Mr. Loewe uttered an exclamation of delighted astonishment, and thefacetiousness faded rather suddenly from the inspector's countenance."I don't know how you can have found out," said he. "We have only knownit half an hour ourselves, and the wire came direct from Florence toScotland Yard.""Perhaps you can describe the thief to us," said Mr. Loewe, in the sameeager tone."I dare say the inspector can do that," replied Thorndyke."Yes, I think so," replied the officer. "He is a short strong man, witha dark complexion and hair turning grey. He has a very round head, andhe is probably a workman engaged at some whiting or cement works. Thatis all we know; if you can tell us any more, sir, we shall be very gladto hear it.""I can only offer a few suggestions," said Thorndyke, "but perhaps youmay find them useful. For instance, at 13, Birket Street, Limehouse,there is living a Japanese gentleman named Futashima, who works atBadcomb and Martin's mother-of-pearl factory. I think that if you wereto call on him, and let him try on the hat that you have, it wouldprobably fit him."The inspector scribbled ravenously in his notebook, and Mr.Marchmont--an old admirer of Thorndyke's--leaned back in his chair,chuckling softly and rubbing his hands."Then," continued my colleague, "there is in Rankin Street, Limehouse, acab-yard, where another Japanese gentleman named Itu is employed. Youmight find out where Itu was the night before last; and if you shouldchance to see a hansom cab there--number 22,481--have a good look at it.In the frame of the number-plate you will find six small holes. Thoseholes may have held brads, and the brads may have held a false numbercard. At any rate, you might ascertain where that cab was at 11.30 thenight before last. That is all I have to suggest."Mr. Loewe leaped from his chair. "Let us go--now--at once--there is notime to be lost. A thousand thanks to you, doctor--a thousand millionthanks. Come!"He seized the inspector by the arm and forcibly dragged him towards thedoor, and a few moments later we heard the footsteps of our visitorsclattering down the stairs."It was not worth while to enter into explanations with them," saidThorndyke, as the footsteps died away--"nor perhaps with you?""On the contrary," I replied, "I am waiting to be fully enlightened.""Well, then, my inferences in this case were perfectly simple ones,drawn from well-known anthropological facts. The human race, as youknow, is roughly divided into three groups--the black, the white, andthe yellow races. But apart from the variable quality of colour, theseraces have certain fixed characteristics associated especially with theshape of the skull, of the eye-sockets, and the hair."Thus in the black races the skull is long and narrow, the eye-socketsare long and narrow, and the hair is flat and ribbon-like, and usuallycoiled up like a watch-spring. In the white races the skull is oval, theeye-sockets are oval, and the hair is slightly flattened or oval insection, and tends to be wavy; while in the yellow or Mongol races, theskull is short and round, the eye-sockets are short and round, and thehair is straight and circular in section. So that we have, in the blackraces, long skull, long orbits, flat hair; in the white races, ovalskull, oval orbits, oval hair; and in the yellow races, round skull,round orbits, round hair."Now, in this case we had to deal with a very short round skull. But youcannot argue from races to individuals; there are many short-skulledEnglishmen. But when I found, associated with that skull, hairs whichwere circular in section, it became practically certain that theindividual was a Mongol of some kind. The mother-of-pearl dust and thegranules of rice starch from the inside of the hat favoured this view,for the pearl-shell industry is specially connected with China andJapan, while starch granules from the hat of an Englishman wouldprobably be wheat starch."Then as to the hair: it was, as I mentioned to you, circular insection, and of very large diameter. Now, I have examined many thousandsof hairs, and the thickest that I have ever seen came from the heads ofJapanese; but the hairs from this hat were as thick as any of them. Butthe hypothesis that the burglar was a Japanese received confirmation invarious ways. Thus, he was short, though strong and active, and theJapanese are the shortest of the Mongol races, and very strong andactive."Then his remarkable skill in handling the powerful caretaker--a retiredpolice-sergeant--suggested the Japanese art of ju-jitsu, while thenature of the robbery was consistent with the value set by the Japaneseon works of art. Finally, the fact that only a particular collection wastaken, suggested a special, and probably national, character in thethings stolen, while their portability--you will remember that goods ofthe value of from eight to twelve thousand pounds were taken away in twohand-packages--was much more consistent with Japanese than Chineseworks, of which the latter tend rather to be bulky and ponderous. Still,it was nothing but a bare hypothesis until we had seen Futashima--and,indeed, is no more now. I may, after all, be entirely mistaken."He was not, however; and at this moment there reposes in my drawing-rooman ancient netsuke, which came as a thank-offering from Mr. Isaac Loeweon the recovery of the booty from a back room in No. 13, Birket Street,Limehouse. The treasure, of course, was given in the first place toThorndyke, but transferred by him to my wife on the pretence that butfor my suggestion of shell-dust the robber would never have been traced.Which is, on the face of it, preposterous.IVTHE BLUE SEQUINThorndyke stood looking up and down the platform with anxiety thatincreased as the time drew near for the departure of the train."This is very unfortunate," he said, reluctantly stepping into an emptysmoking compartment as the guard executed a flourish with his greenflag. "I am afraid we have missed our friend." He closed the door, and,as the train began to move, thrust his head out of the window."Now I wonder if that will be he," he continued. "If so, he has caughtthe train by the skin of his teeth, and is now in one of the rearcompartments."The subject of Thorndyke's speculations was Mr. Edward Stopford, of thefirm of Stopford and Myers, of Portugal Street, solicitors, and hisconnection with us at present arose out of a telegram that had reachedour chambers on the preceding evening. It was reply-paid, and ran thus:     "Can you come here to-morrow to direct defence? Important case. All     costs undertaken by us.--STOPFORD AND MYERS."Thorndyke's reply had been in the affirmative, and early on this presentmorning a further telegram--evidently posted overnight--had beendelivered:     "Shall leave for Woldhurst by 8.25 from Charing Cross. Will call     for you if possible.--EDWARD STOPFORD."He had not called, however, and, since he was unknown personally to usboth, we could not judge whether or not he had been among the passengerson the platform."It is most unfortunate," Thorndyke repeated, "for it deprives us ofthat preliminary consideration of the case which is so invaluable." Hefilled his pipe thoughtfully, and, having made a fruitless inspection ofthe platform at London Bridge, took up the paper that he had bought atthe bookstall, and began to turn over the leaves, running his eyequickly down the columns, unmindful of the journalistic baits inparagraph or article."It is a great disadvantage," he observed, while still glancing throughthe paper, "to come plump into an inquiry without preparation--to beconfronted with the details before one has a chance of considering thecase in general terms. For instance--"He paused, leaving the sentence unfinished, and as I looked upinquiringly I saw that he had turned over another page, and was nowreading attentively."This looks like our case, Jervis," he said presently, handing me thepaper and indicating a paragraph at the top of the page. It was quitebrief, and was headed "Terrible Murder in Kent," the account being asfollows:"A shocking crime was discovered yesterday morning at the little town ofWoldhurst, which lies on the branch line from Halbury Junction. Thediscovery was made by a porter who was inspecting the carriages of thetrain which had just come in. On opening the door of a first-classcompartment, he was horrified to find the body of a fashionably-dressedwoman stretched upon the floor. Medical aid was immediately summoned,and on the arrival of the divisional surgeon, Dr. Morton, it wasascertained that the woman had not been dead more than a few minutes.[Illustration: THE DISCOVERY.]"The state of the corpse leaves no doubt that a murder of a most brutalkind has been perpetrated, the cause of death being a penetrating woundof the head, inflicted with some pointed implement, which must have beenused with terrible violence, since it has perforated the skull andentered the brain. That robbery was not the motive of the crime is madeclear by the fact that an expensively fitted dressing-bag was found onthe rack, and that the dead woman's jewellery, including severalvaluable diamond rings, was untouched. It is rumoured that an arrest hasbeen made by the local police.""A gruesome affair," I remarked, as I handed back the paper, "but thereport does not give us much information.""It does not," Thorndyke agreed, "and yet it gives us something toconsider. Here is a perforating wound of the skull, inflicted with somepointed implement--that is, assuming that it is not a bullet wound. Now,what kind of implement would be capable of inflicting such an injury?How would such an implement be used in the confined space of arailway-carriage, and what sort of person would be in possession of suchan implement? These are preliminary questions that are worthconsidering, and I commend them to you, together with the furtherproblems of the possible motive--excluding robbery--and anycircumstances other than murder which might account for the injury.""The choice of suitable implements is not very great," I observed."It is very limited, and most of them, such as a plasterer's pick or ageological hammer, are associated with certain definite occupations. Youhave a notebook?"I had, and, accepting the hint, I produced it and pursued my furtherreflections in silence, while my companion, with his notebook also onhis knee, gazed steadily out of the window. And thus he remained,wrapped in thought, jotting down an entry now and again in his book,until the train slowed down at Halbury Junction, where we had to changeon to a branch line.As we stepped out, I noticed a well-dressed man hurrying up the platformfrom the rear and eagerly scanning the faces of the few passengers whohad alighted. Soon he espied us, and, approaching quickly, asked, as helooked from one of us to the other:"Dr. Thorndyke?""Yes," replied my colleague, adding: "And you, I presume, are Mr. EdwardStopford?"The solicitor bowed. "This is a dreadful affair," he said, in anagitated manner. "I see you have the paper. A most shocking affair. I amimmensely relieved to find you here. Nearly missed the train, and fearedI should miss you.""There appears to have been an arrest," Thorndyke began."Yes--my brother. Terrible business. Let us walk up the platform; ourtrain won't start for a quarter of an hour yet."We deposited our joint Gladstone and Thorndyke's travelling-case in anempty first-class compartment, and then, with the solicitor between us,strolled up to the unfrequented end of the platform."My brother's position," said Mr. Stopford, "fills me with dismay--butlet me give you the facts in order, and you shall judge for yourself.This poor creature who has been murdered so brutally was a Miss EdithGrant. She was formerly an artist's model, and as such was a good dealemployed by my brother, who is a painter--Harold Stopford, you know,A.R.A. now--""I know his work very well, and charming work it is.""I think so, too. Well, in those days he was quite a youngster--abouttwenty--and he became very intimate with Miss Grant, in quite aninnocent way, though not very discreet; but she was a nice respectablegirl, as most English models are, and no one thought any harm. However,a good many letters passed between them, and some little presents,amongst which was a beaded chain carrying a locket, and in this he wasfool enough to put his portrait and the inscription, 'Edith, fromHarold.'"Later on Miss Grant, who had a rather good voice, went on the stage, inthe comic opera line, and, in consequence, her habits and associateschanged somewhat; and, as Harold had meanwhile become engaged, he wasnaturally anxious to get his letters back, and especially to exchangethe locket for some less compromising gift. The letters she eventuallysent him, but refused absolutely to part with the locket."Now, for the last month Harold has been staying at Halbury, makingsketching excursions into the surrounding country, and yesterdaymorning he took the train to Shinglehurst, the third station from here,and the one before Woldhurst."On the platform here he met Miss Grant, who had come down from London,and was going on to Worthing. They entered the branch train together,having a first-class compartment to themselves. It seems she was wearinghis locket at the time, and he made another appeal to her to make anexchange, which she refused, as before. The discussion appears to havebecome rather heated and angry on both sides, for the guard and a porterat Munsden both noticed that they seemed to be quarrelling; but theupshot of the affair was that the lady snapped the chain, and tossed ittogether with the locket to my brother, and they parted quite amiably atShinglehurst, where Harold got out. He was then carrying his fullsketching kit, including a large holland umbrella, the lower joint ofwhich is an ash staff fitted with a powerful steel spike for drivinginto the ground."It was about half-past ten when he got out at Shinglehurst; by elevenhe had reached his pitch and got to work, and he painted steadily forthree hours. Then he packed up his traps, and was just starting on hisway back to the station, when he was met by the police and arrested."And now, observe the accumulation of circumstantial evidence againsthim. He was the last person seen in company with the murdered woman--forno one seems to have seen her after they left Munsden; he appeared to bequarrelling with her when she was last seen alive, he had a reason forpossibly wishing for her death, he was provided with an implement--aspiked staff--capable of inflicting the injury which caused her death,and, when he was searched, there was found in his possession the locketand broken chain, apparently removed from her person with violence."Against all this is, of course, his known character--he is the gentlestand most amiable of men--and his subsequent conduct--imbecile to thelast degree if he had been guilty; but, as a lawyer, I can't help seeingthat appearances are almost hopelessly against him.""We won't say 'hopelessly,'" replied Thorndyke, as we took our places inthe carriage, "though I expect the police are pretty cocksure. When doesthe inquest open?""To-day at four. I have obtained an order from the coroner for you toexamine the body and be present at the _post-mortem_.""Do you happen to know the exact position of the wound?""Yes; it is a little above and behind the left ear--a horrible roundhole, with a ragged cut or tear running from it to the side of theforehead.""And how was the body lying?""Right along the floor, with the feet close to the off-side door.""Was the wound on the head the only one?""No; there was a long cut or bruise on the right cheek--a contused woundthe police surgeon called it, which he believes to have been inflictedwith a heavy and rather blunt weapon. I have not heard of any otherwounds or bruises.""Did anyone enter the train yesterday at Shinglehurst?" Thorndyke asked."No one entered the train after it left Halbury."Thorndyke considered these statements in silence, and presently fellinto a brown study, from which he roused only as the train moved out ofShinglehurst station."It would be about here that the murder was committed," said Mr.Stopford; "at least, between here and Woldhurst."Thorndyke nodded rather abstractedly, being engaged at the moment inobserving with great attention the objects that were visible from thewindows."I notice," he remarked presently, "a number of chips scattered aboutbetween the rails, and some of the chair-wedges look new. Have therebeen any platelayers at work lately?""Yes," answered Stopford, "they are on the line now, I believe--atleast, I saw a gang working near Woldhurst yesterday, and they are saidto have set a rick on fire; I saw it smoking when I came down.""Indeed; and this middle line of rails is, I suppose, a sort of siding?""Yes; they shunt the goods trains and empty trucks on to it. There arethe remains of the rick--still smouldering, you see."Thorndyke gazed absently at the blackened heap until an emptycattle-truck on the middle track hid it from view. This was succeeded bya line of goods-waggons, and these by a passenger coach, one compartmentof which--a first-class--was closed up and sealed. The train now beganto slow down rather suddenly, and a couple of minutes later we broughtup in Woldhurst station.It was evident that rumours of Thorndyke's advent had preceded us, forthe entire staff--two porters, an inspector, and thestation-master--were waiting expectantly on the platform, and the lattercame forward, regardless of his dignity, to help us with our luggage."Do you think I could see the carriage?" Thorndyke asked the solicitor."Not the inside, sir," said the station-master, on being appealed to."The police have sealed it up. You would have to ask the inspector.""Well, I can have a look at the outside, I suppose?" said Thorndyke, andto this the station-master readily agreed, and offered to accompany us."What other first-class passengers were there?" Thorndyke asked."None, sir. There was only one first-class coach, and the deceased wasthe only person in it. It has given us all a dreadful turn, this affairhas," he continued, as we set off up the line. "I was on the platformwhen the train came in. We were watching a rick that was burning up theline, and a rare blaze it made, too; and I was just saying that weshould have to move the cattle-truck that was on the mid-track, because,you see, sir, the smoke and sparks were blowing across, and I thought itwould frighten the poor beasts. And Mr. Felton he don't like his beastshandled roughly. He says it spoils the meat.""No doubt he is right," said Thorndyke. "But now, tell me, do you thinkit is possible for any person to board or leave the train on theoff-side unobserved? Could a man, for instance, enter a compartment onthe off-side at one station and drop off as the train was slowing downat the next, without being seen?""I doubt it," replied the station-master. "Still, I wouldn't say it isimpossible.""Thank you. Oh, and there's another question. You have a gang of men atwork on the line, I see. Now, do those men belong to the district?""No, sir; they are strangers, every one, and pretty rough diamonds someof 'em are. But I shouldn't say there was any real harm in 'em. If youwas suspecting any of 'em of being mixed up in this--""I am not," interrupted Thorndyke rather shortly. "I suspect nobody; butI wish to get all the facts of the case at the outset.""Naturally, sir," replied the abashed official; and we pursued our wayin silence."Do you remember, by the way," said Thorndyke, as we approached theempty coach, "whether the off-side door of the compartment was closedand locked when the body was discovered?""It was closed, sir, but not locked. Why, sir, did you think--?""Nothing, nothing. The sealed compartment is the one, of course?"Without waiting for a reply, he commenced his survey of the coach, whileI gently restrained our two companions from shadowing him, as they weredisposed to do. The off-side footboard occupied his attention specially,and when he had scrutinized minutely the part opposite the fatalcompartment, he walked slowly from end to end with his eyes but a fewinches from its surface, as though he was searching for something.Near what had been the rear end he stopped, and drew from his pocket apiece of paper; then, with a moistened finger-tip he picked up from thefootboard some evidently minute object, which he carefully transferredto the paper, folding the latter and placing it in his pocket-book.He next mounted the footboard, and, having peered in through the windowof the sealed compartment, produced from his pocket a small insufflatoror powder-blower, with which he blew a stream of impalpable smoke-likepowder on to the edges of the middle window, bestowing the closestattention on the irregular dusty patches in which it settled, and evenmeasuring one on the jamb of the window with a pocket-rule. At length hestepped down, and, having carefully looked over the near-side footboard,announced that he had finished for the present.As we were returning down the line, we passed a working man, who seemedto be viewing the chairs and sleepers with more than casual interest."That, I suppose, is one of the plate-layers?" Thorndyke suggested tothe station-master."Yes, the foreman of the gang," was the reply."I'll just step back and have a word with him, if you will walk onslowly." And my colleague turned back briskly and overtook the man, withwhom he remained in conversation for some minutes."I think I see the police inspector on the platform," remarkedThorndyke, as we approached the station."Yes, there he is," said our guide. "Come down to see what you areafter, sir, I expect." Which was doubtless the case, although theofficer professed to be there by the merest chance."You would like to see the weapon, sir, I suppose?" he remarked, when hehad introduced himself."The umbrella-spike," Thorndyke corrected. "Yes, if I may. We are goingto the mortuary now.""Then you'll pass the station on the way; so, if you care to look in, Iwill walk up with you."This proposition being agreed to, we all proceeded to thepolice-station, including the station-master, who was on the very tiptoeof curiosity."There you are, sir," said the inspector, unlocking his office, andushering us in. "Don't say we haven't given every facility to thedefence. There are all the effects of the accused, including the veryweapon the deed was done with.""Come, come," protested Thorndyke; "we mustn't be premature." He tookthe stout ash staff from the officer, and, having examined theformidable spike through a lens, drew from his pocket a steelcalliper-gauge, with which he carefully measured the diameter of thespike, and the staff to which it was fixed. "And now," he said, when hehad made a note of the measurements in his book, "we will look at thecolour-box and the sketch. Ha! a very orderly man, your brother. Mr.Stopford. Tubes all in their places, palette-knives wiped clean, palettecleaned off and rubbed bright, brushes wiped--they ought to be washedbefore they stiffen--all this is very significant." He unstrapped thesketch from the blank canvas to which it was pinned, and, standing it ona chair in a good light, stepped back to look at it."And you tell me that that is only three hours' work!" he exclaimed,looking at the lawyer. "It is really a marvellous achievement.""My brother is a very rapid worker," replied Stopford dejectedly."Yes, but this is not only amazingly rapid; it is in his very happiestvein--full of spirit and feeling. But we mustn't stay to look at itlonger." He replaced the canvas on its pins, and having glanced at thelocket and some other articles that lay in a drawer, thanked theinspector for his courtesy and withdrew."That sketch and the colour-box appear very suggestive to me," heremarked, as we walked up the street."To me also," said Stopford gloomily, "for they are under lock and key,like their owner, poor old fellow."He sighed heavily, and we walked on in silence.The mortuary-keeper had evidently heard of our arrival, for he waswaiting at the door with the key in his hand, and, on being shown thecoroner's order, unlocked the door, and we entered together; but, aftera momentary glance at the ghostly, shrouded figure lying upon the slatetable, Stopford turned pale and retreated, saying that he would wait forus outside with the mortuary-keeper.As soon as the door was closed and locked on the inside, Thorndykeglanced curiously round the bare, whitewashed building. A stream ofsunlight poured in through the skylight, and fell upon the silent formthat lay so still under its covering-sheet, and one stray beam glancedinto a corner by the door, where, on a row of pegs and a deal table, thedead woman's clothing was displayed."There is something unspeakably sad in these poor relics, Jervis," saidThorndyke, as we stood before them. "To me they are more tragic, morefull of pathetic suggestion, than the corpse itself. See the smart,jaunty hat, and the costly skirts hanging there, so desolate andforlorn; the dainty _lingerie_ on the table, neatly folded--by themortuary-man's wife, I hope--the little French shoes and open-work silkstockings. How pathetically eloquent they are of harmless, womanlyvanity, and the gay, careless life, snapped short in the twinkling of aneye. But we must not give way to sentiment. There is another lifethreatened, and it is in our keeping."He lifted the hat from its peg, and turned it over in his hand. It was,I think, what is called a "picture-hat"--a huge, flat, shapeless mass ofgauze and ribbon and feather, spangled over freely with dark-bluesequins. In one part of the brim was a ragged hole, and from this theglittering sequins dropped off in little showers when the hat was moved."This will have been worn tilted over on the left side," said Thorndyke,"judging by the general shape and the position of the hole.""Yes," I agreed. "Like that of the Duchess of Devonshire inGainsborough's portrait.""Exactly."He shook a few of the sequins into the palm of his hand, and, replacingthe hat on its peg, dropped the little discs into an envelope, on whichhe wrote, "From the hat," and slipped it into his pocket. Then, steppingover to the table, he drew back the sheet reverently and even tenderlyfrom the dead woman's face, and looked down at it with grave pity. Itwas a comely face, white as marble, serene and peaceful in expression,with half-closed eyes, and framed with a mass of brassy, yellow hair;but its beauty was marred by a long linear wound, half cut, half bruise,running down the right cheek from the eye to the chin."A handsome girl," Thorndyke commented--"a dark-haired blonde. What asin to have disfigured herself so with that horrible peroxide." Hesmoothed the hair back from her forehead, and added: "She seems to haveapplied the stuff last about ten days ago. There is about a quarter ofan inch of dark hair at the roots. What do you make of that wound on thecheek?""It looks as if she had struck some sharp angle in falling, though, asthe seats are padded in first-class carriages, I don't see what shecould have struck.""No. And now let us look at the other wound. Will you note down thedescription?" He handed me his notebook, and I wrote down as hedictated: "A clean-punched circular hole in skull, an inch behind andabove margin of left ear--diameter, an inch and seven-sixteenths;starred fracture of parietal bone; membranes perforated, and brainentered deeply; ragged scalp-wound, extending forward to margin of leftorbit; fragments of gauze and sequins in edges of wound. That will dofor the present. Dr. Morton will give us further details if we wantthem."He pocketed his callipers and rule, drew from the bruised scalp one ortwo loose hairs, which he placed in the envelope with the sequins, and,having looked over the body for other wounds or bruises (of which therewere none), replaced the sheet, and prepared to depart.As we walked away from the mortuary, Thorndyke was silent and deeplythoughtful, and I gathered that he was piecing together the facts thathe had acquired. At length Mr. Stopford, who had several times looked athim curiously, said:"The _post-mortem_ will take place at three, and it is now onlyhalf-past eleven. What would you like to do next?"Thorndyke, who, in spite of his mental preoccupation, had been lookingabout him in his usual keen, attentive way, halted suddenly."Your reference to the _post-mortem_," said he, "reminds me that Iforgot to put the ox-gall into my case.""Ox-gall!" I exclaimed, endeavouring vainly to connect this substancewith the technique of the pathologist. "What were you going to dowith--"But here I broke off, remembering my friend's dislike of any discussionof his methods before strangers."I suppose," he continued, "there would hardly be an artist's colourmanin a place of this size?""I should think not," said Stopford. "But couldn't you got the stufffrom a butcher? There's a shop just across the road.""So there is," agreed Thorndyke, who had already observed the shop. "Thegall ought, of course, to be prepared, but we can filter itourselves--that is, if the butcher has any. We will try him, at anyrate."He crossed the road towards the shop, over which the name "Felton"appeared in gilt lettering, and, addressing himself to the proprietor,who stood at the door, introduced himself and explained his wants."Ox-gall?" said the butcher. "No, sir, I haven't any just now; but I amhaving a beast killed this afternoon, and I can let you have some then.In fact," he added, after a pause, "as the matter is of importance, Ican have one killed at once if you wish it.""That is very kind of you," said Thorndyke, "and it would greatly obligeme. Is the beast perfectly healthy?""They're in splendid condition, sir. I picked them out of the herdmyself. But you shall see them--ay, and choose the one that you'd likekilled.""You are really very good," said Thorndyke warmly. "I will just run intothe chemist's next door, and get a suitable bottle, and then I willavail myself of your exceedingly kind offer."He hurried into the chemist's shop, from which he presently emerged,carrying a white paper parcel; and we then followed the butcher down anarrow lane by the side of his shop. It led to an enclosure containing asmall pen, in which were confined three handsome steers, whose glossy,black coats contrasted in a very striking manner with their long,greyish-white, nearly straight horns."These are certainly very fine beasts, Mr. Felton," said Thorndyke, aswe drew up beside the pen, "and in excellent condition, too."He leaned over the pen and examined the beasts critically, especially asto their eyes and horns; then, approaching the nearest one, he raisedhis stick and bestowed a smart tap on the under-side of the right horn,following it by a similar tap on the left one, a proceeding that thebeast viewed with stolid surprise."The state of the horns," explained Thorndyke, as he moved on to thenext steer, "enables one to judge, to some extent, of the beast'shealth.""Lord bless you, sir," laughed Mr. Felton, "they haven't got no feelingin their horns, else what good 'ud their horns be to 'em?"Apparently he was right, for the second steer was as indifferent to asounding rap on either horn as the first. Nevertheless, when Thorndykeapproached the third steer, I unconsciously drew nearer to watch; and Inoticed that, as the stick struck the horn, the beast drew back inevident alarm, and that when the blow was repeated, it became manifestlyuneasy."He don't seem to like that," said the butcher. "Seems as if--Hullo,that's queer!"Thorndyke had just brought his stick up against the left horn, andimmediately the beast had winced and started back, shaking his head andmoaning. There was not, however, room for him to back out of reach, andThorndyke, by leaning into the pen, was able to inspect the sensitivehorn, which he did with the closest attention, while the butcher lookedon with obvious perturbation."You don't think there's anything wrong with this beast, sir, I hope,"said he."I can't say without a further examination," replied Thorndyke. "It maybe the horn only that is affected. If you will have it sawn off close tothe head, and sent up to me at the hotel, I will look at it and tellyou. And, by way of preventing any mistakes, I will mark it and cover itup, to protect it from injury in the slaughter-house."He opened his parcel and produced from it a wide-mouthed bottle labelled"Ox-gall," a sheet of gutta-percha tissue, a roller bandage, and a stickof sealing-wax. Handing the bottle to Mr. Felton, he encased the distalhalf of the horn in a covering by means of the tissue and the bandage,which he fixed securely with the sealing-wax."I'll saw the horn off and bring it up to the hotel myself, with theox-gall," said Mr. Felton. "You shall have them in half an hour."He was as good as his word, for in half an hour Thorndyke was seated ata small table by the window of our private sitting-room in the BlackBull Hotel. The table was covered with newspaper, and on it lay the longgrey horn and Thorndyke's travelling-case, now open and displaying asmall microscope and its accessories. The butcher was seated solidly inan armchair waiting, with a half-suspicious eye on Thorndyke for thereport; and I was endeavouring by cheerful talk to keep Mr. Stopfordfrom sinking into utter despondency, though I, too, kept a furtivewatch on my colleague's rather mysterious proceedings.I saw him unwind the bandage and apply the horn to his ear, bending itslightly to and fro. I watched him, as he scanned the surface closelythrough a lens, and observed him as he scraped some substance from thepointed end on to a glass slide, and, having applied a drop of somereagent, began to tease out the scraping with a pair of mounted needles.Presently he placed the slide under the microscope, and, having observedit attentively for a minute or two, turned round sharply."Come and look at this, Jervis," said he.I wanted no second bidding, being on tenterhooks of curiosity, but cameover and applied my eye to the instrument."Well, what is it?" he asked."A multipolar nerve corpuscle--very shrivelled, but unmistakable.""And this?"He moved the slide to a fresh spot."Two pyramidal nerve corpuscles and some portions of fibres.""And what do you say the tissue is?""Cortical brain substance, I should say, without a doubt.""I entirely agree with you. And that being so," he added, turning to Mr.Stopford, "we may say that the case for the defence is practicallycomplete.""What, in Heaven's name, do you mean?" exclaimed Stopford, starting up."I mean that we can now prove when and where and how Miss Grant met herdeath. Come and sit down here, and I will explain. No, you needn't goaway, Mr. Felton. We shall have to subpoena you. Perhaps," hecontinued, "we had better go over the facts and see what they suggest.And first we note the position of the body, lying with the feet close tothe off-side door, showing that, when she fell, the deceased wassitting, or more probably standing, close to that door. Next there isthis." He drew from his pocket a folded paper, which he opened,displaying a tiny blue disc. "It is one of the sequins with which herhat was trimmed, and I have in this envelope several more which I tookfrom the hat itself."This single sequin I picked up on the rear end of the off sidefootboard, and its presence there makes it nearly certain that at sometime Miss Grant had put her head out of the window on that side."The next item of evidence I obtained by dusting the margins of theoff-side window with a light powder, which made visible a greasyimpression three and a quarter inches long on the sharp corner of theright-hand jamb (right-hand from the inside, I mean)."And now as to the evidence furnished by the body. The wound in theskull is behind and above the left ear, is roughly circular, andmeasures one inch and seven-sixteenths at most, and a ragged scalp-woundruns from it towards the left eye. On the right cheek is a linearcontused wound three and a quarter inches long. There are no otherinjuries."Our next facts are furnished by this." He took up the horn and tappedit with his finger, while the solicitor and Mr. Felton stared at him inspeechless wonder. "You notice it is a left horn, and you remember thatit was highly sensitive. If you put your ear to it while I strain it,you will hear the grating of a fracture in the bony core. Now look atthe pointed end, and you will see several deep scratches runninglengthwise, and where those scratches end the diameter of the horn is,as you see by this calliper-gauge, one inch and seven-sixteenths.Covering the scratches is a dry blood-stain, and at the extreme tip is asmall mass of a dried substance which Dr. Jervis and I have examinedwith the microscope and are satisfied is brain tissue.""Good God!" exclaimed Stopford eagerly. "Do you mean to say--""Let us finish with the facts, Mr. Stopford," Thorndyke interrupted."Now, if you look closely at that blood-stain, you will see a shortpiece of hair stuck to the horn, and through this lens you can make outthe root-bulb. It is a golden hair, you notice, but near the root it isblack, and our calliper-gauge shows us that the black portion isfourteen sixty-fourths of an inch long. Now, in this envelope are somehairs that I removed from the dead woman's head. They also are goldenhairs, black at the roots, and when I measure the black portion I findit to be fourteen sixty-fourths of an inch long. Then, finally, there isthis."He turned the horn over, and pointed to a small patch of dried blood.Embedded in it was a blue sequin.Mr. Stopford and the butcher both gazed at the horn in silent amazement;then the former drew a deep breath and looked up at Thorndyke."No doubt," said he, "you can explain this mystery, but for my part I amutterly bewildered, though you are filling me with hope.""And yet the matter is quite simple," returned Thorndyke, "even withthese few facts before us, which are only a selection from the body ofevidence in our possession. But I will state my theory, and you shalljudge." He rapidly sketched a rough plan on a sheet of paper, andcontinued: "These were the conditions when the train was approachingWoldhurst: Here was the passenger-coach, here was the burning rick, andhere was a cattle-truck. This steer was in that truck. Now my hypothesisis that at that time Miss Grant was standing with her head out of theoff-side window, watching the burning rick. Her wide hat, worn on theleft side, hid from her view the cattle-truck which she was approaching,and then this is what happened." He sketched another plan to a largerscale. "One of the steers--this one--had thrust its long horn outthrough the bars. The point of that horn struck the deceased's head,driving her face violently against the corner of the window, and then,in disengaging, ploughed its way through the scalp, and suffered afracture of its core from the violence of the wrench. This hypothesis isinherently probable, it fits all the facts, and those facts admit of noother explanation."The solicitor sat for a moment as though dazed; then he rose impulsivelyand seized Thorndyke's hands. "I don't know what to say to you," heexclaimed huskily, "except that you have saved my brother's life, andfor that may God reward you!"The butcher rose from his chair with a slow grin."It seems to me," said he, "as if that ox-gall was what you might call ablind, eh, sir?"And Thorndyke smiled an inscrutable smile.       *       *       *       *       *When we returned to town on the following day we were a party of four,which included Mr. Harold Stopford. The verdict of "Death bymisadventure," promptly returned by the coroner's jury, had beenshortly followed by his release from custody, and he now sat with hisbrother and me, listening with rapt attention to Thorndyke's analysis ofthe case."So, you see," the latter concluded, "I had six possible theories of thecause of death worked out before I reached Halbury, and it only remainedto select the one that fitted the facts. And when I had seen thecattle-truck, had picked up that sequin, had heard the description ofthe steers, and had seen the hat and the wounds, there was nothing leftto do but the filling in of details.""And you never doubted my innocence?" asked Harold Stopford.Thorndyke smiled at his quondam client."Not after I had seen your colour-box and your sketch," said he, "to saynothing of the spike."VTHE MOABITE CIPHERA large and motley crowd lined the pavements of Oxford Street asThorndyke and I made our way leisurely eastward. Floral decorations anddrooping bunting announced one of those functions inaugurated from timeto time by a benevolent Government for the entertainment of fashionableloungers and the relief of distressed pickpockets. For a Russian GrandDuke, who had torn himself away, amidst valedictory explosions, from aloving if too demonstrative people, was to pass anon on his way to theGuildhall; and a British Prince, heroically indiscreet, was expected tooccupy a seat in the ducal carriage.Near Rathbone Place Thorndyke halted and drew my attention to asmart-looking man who stood lounging in a doorway, cigarette in hand."Our old friend Inspector Badger," said Thorndyke. "He seems mightilyinterested in that gentleman in the light overcoat. How d'ye do,Badger?" for at this moment the detective caught his eye and bowed. "Whois your friend?""That's what I want to know, sir," replied the inspector. "I've beenshadowing him for the last half-hour, but I can't make him out, though Ibelieve I've seen him somewhere. He don't look like a foreigner, but hehas got something bulky in his pocket, so I must keep him in sight untilthe Duke is safely past. I wish," he added gloomily, "these beastlyRussians would stop at home. They give us no end of trouble.""Are you expecting any--occurrences, then?" asked Thorndyke."Bless you, sir," exclaimed Badger, "the whole route is lined withplain-clothes men. You see, it is known that several desperatecharacters followed the Duke to England, and there are a good manyexiles living here who would like to have a rap at him. Hallo! What's heup to now?"The man in the light overcoat had suddenly caught the inspector's tooinquiring eye, and forthwith dived into the crowd at the edge of thepavement. In his haste he trod heavily on the foot of a big,rough-looking man, by whom he was in a moment hustled out into the roadwith such violence that he fell sprawling face downwards. It was anunlucky moment. A mounted constable was just then backing in upon thecrowd, and before he could gather the meaning of the shout that arosefrom the bystanders, his horse had set down one hind-hoof firmly on theprostrate man's back.The inspector signalled to a constable, who forthwith made a way for usthrough the crowd; but even as we approached the injured man, he rosestiffly and looked round with a pale, vacant face."Are you hurt?" Thorndyke asked gently, with an earnest look into thefrightened, wondering eyes."No, sir," was the reply; "only I feel queer--sinking--just here."He laid a trembling hand on his chest, and Thorndyke, still eyeing himanxiously, said in a low voice to the inspector: "Cab or ambulance, asquickly as you can."A cab was led round from Newman Street, and the injured man put into it.Thorndyke, Badger, and I entered, and we drove off up Rathbone Place. Aswe proceeded, our patient's face grew more and more ashen, drawn, andanxious; his breathing was shallow and uneven, and his teeth chatteredslightly. The cab swung round into Goodge Street, and then--suddenly, inthe twinkling of an eye--there came a change. The eyelids and jawrelaxed, the eyes became filmy, and the whole form subsided into thecorner in a shrunken heap, with the strange gelatinous limpness of abody that is dead as a whole, while its tissues are still alive."God save us! The man's dead!" exclaimed the inspector in a shockedvoice--for even policemen have their feelings. He sat staring at thecorpse, as it nodded gently with the jolting of the cab, until we drewup inside the courtyard of the Middlesex Hospital, when he got outbriskly, with suddenly renewed cheerfulness, to help the porter to placethe body on the wheeled couch."We shall know who he is now, at any rate," said he, as we followed thecouch to the casualty-room. Thorndyke nodded unsympathetically. Themedical instinct in him was for the moment stronger than the legal.The house-surgeon leaned over the couch, and made a rapid examination ashe listened to our account of the accident. Then he straightened himselfup and looked at Thorndyke."Internal haemorrhage, I expect," said he. "At any rate, he's dead, poorbeggar!--as dead as Nebuchadnezzar. Ah! here comes a bobby; it's hisaffair now."A sergeant came into the room, breathing quickly, and looked in surprisefrom the corpse to the inspector. But the latter, without loss of time,proceeded to turn out the dead man's pockets, commencing with the bulkyobject that had first attracted his attention; which proved to be abrown-paper parcel tied up with red tape."Pork-pie, begad!" he exclaimed with a crestfallen air as he cut thetape and opened the package. "You had better go through his otherpockets, sergeant."The small heap of odds and ends that resulted from this process tended,with a single exception, to throw little light on the man's identity;the exception being a letter, sealed, but not stamped, addressed in anexceedingly illiterate hand to Mr. Adolf Schoenberg, 213, Greek Street,Soho."He was going to leave it by hand, I expect," observed the inspector,with a wistful glance at the sealed envelope. "I think I'll take itround myself, and you had better come with me, sergeant."He slipped the letter into his pocket, and, leaving the sergeant to takepossession of the other effects, made his way out of the building."I suppose, Doctor," said he, as we crossed into Berners Street, "youare not coming our way! Don't want to see Mr. Schoenberg, h'm?"Thorndyke reflected for a moment. "Well, it isn't very far, and we mayas well see the end of the incident. Yes; let us go together."No. 213, Greek Street, was one of those houses that irresistibly suggestto the observer the idea of a church organ, either jamb of the doorwaybeing adorned with a row of brass bell-handles corresponding to thestop-knobs.These the sergeant examined with the air of an expert musician, andhaving, as it were, gauged the capacity of the instrument, selected themiddle knob on the right-hand side and pulled it briskly; whereupon afirst-floor window was thrown up and a head protruded. But it affordedus a momentary glimpse only, for, having caught the sergeant's upturnedeye, it retired with surprising precipitancy, and before we had time tospeculate on the apparition, the street-door was opened and a manemerged. He was about to close the door after him when the inspectorinterposed."Does Mr. Adolf Schoenberg live here?"The new-comer, a very typical Jew of the red-haired type, surveyed usthoughtfully through his gold-rimmed spectacles as he repeated the name."Schoenberg--Schoenberg? Ah, yes! I know. He lives on the third-floor. Isaw him go up a short time ago. Third-floor back;" and indicating theopen door with a wave of the hand, he raised his hat and passed into thestreet."I suppose we had better go up," said the inspector, with a dubiousglance at the row of bell-pulls. He accordingly started up the stairs,and we all followed in his wake.There were two doors at the back on the third-floor, but as the one wasopen, displaying an unoccupied bedroom, the inspector rapped smartly onthe other. It flew open almost immediately, and a fierce-looking littleman confronted us with a hostile stare."Well?" said he."Mr. Adolf Schoenberg?" inquired the inspector."Well? What about him?" snapped our new acquaintance."I wished to have a few words with him," said Badger."Then what the deuce do you come banging at _my_ door for?" demanded theother."Why, doesn't he live here?""No. First-floor front," replied our friend, preparing to close thedoor."Pardon me," said Thorndyke, "but what is Mr. Schoenberg like? I mean--""Like?" interrupted the resident. "He's like a blooming Sheeny, with acarroty beard and gold gig-lamps!" and, having presented thisimpressionist sketch, he brought the interview to a definite close byslamming the door and turning the key.With a wrathful exclamation, the inspector turned towards the stairs,down which the sergeant was already clattering in hot haste, and madehis way back to the ground-floor, followed, as before, by Thorndyke andme. On the doorstep we found the sergeant breathlessly interrogating asmartly-dressed youth, whom I had seen alight from a hansom as weentered the house, and who now stood with a notebook tucked under hisarm, sharpening a pencil with deliberate care."Mr. James saw him come out, sir," said the sergeant. "He turned uptowards the Square.""Did he seem to hurry?" asked the inspector."Rather," replied the reporter. "As soon as you were inside, he went offlike a lamplighter. You won't catch him now.""We don't want to catch him," the detective rejoined gruffly; then,backing out of earshot of the eager pressman, he said in a lower tone:"That was Mr. Schoenberg, beyond a doubt, and it is clear that he hassome reason for making himself scarce; so I shall consider myselfjustified in opening that note."He suited the action to the word, and, having cut the envelope open withofficial neatness, drew out the enclosure."My hat!" he exclaimed, as his eye fell upon the contents. "What increation is this? It isn't shorthand, but what the deuce is it?"He handed the document to Thorndyke, who, having held it up to the lightand felt the paper critically, proceeded to examine it with keeninterest. It consisted of a single half-sheet of thin notepaper, bothsides of which were covered with strange, crabbed characters, writtenwith a brownish-black ink in continuous lines, without any spaces toindicate the divisions into words; and, but for the modern materialwhich bore the writing, it might have been a portion of some ancientmanuscript or forgotten codex."What do you make of it, Doctor?" inquired the inspector anxiously,after a pause, during which Thorndyke had scrutinized the strangewriting with knitted brows."Not a great deal," replied Thorndyke. "The character is the Moabite orPhoenician--primitive Semitic, in fact--and reads from right to left.The language I take to be Hebrew. At any rate, I can find no Greekwords, and I see here a group of letters which _may_ form one of the fewHebrew words that I know--the word _badim_, 'lies.' But you had betterget it deciphered by an expert.""If it is Hebrew," said Badger, "we can manage it all right. There areplenty of Jews at our disposal.""You had much better take the paper to the British Museum," saidThorndyke, "and submit it to the keeper of the Phoenician antiquitiesfor decipherment."Inspector Badger smiled a foxy smile as he deposited the paper in hispocket-book. "We'll see what we can make of it ourselves first," hesaid; "but many thanks for your advice, all the same, Doctor. No, Mr.James, I can't give you any information just at present; you had betterapply at the hospital.""I suspect," said Thorndyke, as we took our way homewards, "that Mr.James has collected enough material for his purpose already. He musthave followed us from the hospital, and I have no doubt that he has hisreport, with 'full details,' mentally arranged at this moment. And I amnot sure that he didn't get a peep at the mysterious paper, in spite ofthe inspector's precautions.""By the way," I said, "what do you make of the document?""A cipher, most probably," he replied. "It is written in the primitiveSemitic alphabet, which, as you know, is practically identical withprimitive Greek. It is written from right to left, like the Phoenician,Hebrew, and Moabite, as well as the earliest Greek, inscriptions. Thepaper is common cream-laid notepaper, and the ink is ordinary indelibleChinese ink, such as is used by draughtsmen. Those are the facts, andwithout further study of the document itself, they don't carry us veryfar.""Why do you think it is a cipher rather than a document instraightforward Hebrew?""Because it is obviously a secret message of some kind. Now, everyeducated Jew knows more or less Hebrew, and, although he is able to readand write only the modern square Hebrew character, it is so easy totranspose one alphabet into another that the mere language would affordno security. Therefore, I expect that, when the experts translate thisdocument, the translation or transliteration will be a mere farrago ofunintelligible nonsense. But we shall see, and meanwhile the facts thatwe have offer several interesting suggestions which are well worthconsideration.""As, for instance--?""Now, my dear Jervis," said Thorndyke, shaking an admonitory forefingerat me, "don't, I pray you, give way to mental indolence. You have thesefew facts that I have mentioned. Consider them separately andcollectively, and in their relation to the circumstances. Don't attemptto suck my brain when you have an excellent brain of your own to suck."On the following morning the papers fully justified my colleague'sopinion of Mr. James. All the events which had occurred, as well as anumber that had not, were given in the fullest and most vivid detail, alengthy reference being made to the paper "found on the person of thedead anarchist," and "written in a private shorthand or cryptogram."The report concluded with the gratifying--though untrue--statement that"in this intricate and important case, the police have wisely securedthe assistance of Dr. John Thorndyke, to whose acute intellect and vastexperience the portentous cryptogram will doubtless soon deliver up itssecret.""Very flattering," laughed Thorndyke, to whom I read the extract on hisreturn from the hospital, "but a little awkward if it should induce ourfriends to deposit a few trifling mementoes in the form ofnitro-compounds on our main staircase or in the cellars. By the way, Imet Superintendent Miller on London Bridge. The 'cryptogram,' as Mr.James calls it, has set Scotland Yard in a mighty ferment.""Naturally. What have they done in the matter?""They adopted my suggestion, after all, finding that they could makenothing of it themselves, and took it to the British Museum. The Museumpeople referred them to Professor Poppelbaum, the great palaeographer, towhom they accordingly submitted it.""Did he express any opinion about it?""Yes, provisionally. After a brief examination, he found it to consistof a number of Hebrew words sandwiched between apparently meaninglessgroups of letters. He furnished the Superintendent off-hand with atranslation of the words, and Miller forthwith struck off a number ofhectograph copies of it, which he has distributed among the seniorofficials of his department; so that at present"--here Thorndyke gavevent to a soft chuckle--"Scotland Yard is engaged in a sort of missingword--or, rather, missing sense--competition. Miller invited me to joinin the sport, and to that end presented me with one of the hectographcopies on which to exercise my wits, together with a photograph of thedocument.""And shall you?" I asked."Not I," he replied, laughing. "In the first place, I have not beenformally consulted, and consequently am a passive, though interested,spectator. In the second place, I have a theory of my own which I shalltest if the occasion arises. But if you would like to take part in thecompetition, I am authorized to show you the photograph and thetranslation. I will pass them on to you, and I wish you joy of them."He handed me the photograph and a sheet of paper that he had just takenfrom his pocket-book, and watched me with grim amusement as I read outthe first few lines.[Illustration: THE CIPHER.]"Woe, city, lies, robbery, prey, noise, whip, rattling, wheel, horse,chariot, day, darkness, gloominess, clouds, darkness, morning, mountain,people, strong, fire, them, flame.""It doesn't look very promising at first sight," I remarked. "What isthe Professor's theory?""His theory--provisionally, of course--is that the words form themessage, and the groups of letters represent mere filled-up spacesbetween the words.""But surely," I protested, "that would be a very transparent device."Thorndyke laughed. "There is a childlike simplicity about it," said he,"that is highly attractive--but discouraging. It is much more probablethat the words are dummies, and that the letters contain the message.Or, again, the solution may lie in an entirely different direction. Butlisten! Is that cab coming here?"It was. It drew up opposite our chambers, and a few moments later abrisk step ascending the stairs heralded a smart rat-tat at our door.Flinging open the latter, I found myself confronted by a well-dressedstranger, who, after a quick glance at me, peered inquisitively over myshoulder into the room."I am relieved, Dr. Jervis," said he, "to find you and Dr. Thorndyke athome, as I have come on somewhat urgent professional business. My name,"he continued, entering in response to my invitation, "is Barton, but youdon't know me, though I know you both by sight. I have come to ask youif one of you--or, better still, both--could come to-night and see mybrother.""That," said Thorndyke, "depends on the circumstances and on thewhereabouts of your brother.""The circumstances," said Mr. Barton, "are, in my opinion, highlysuspicious, and I will place them before you--of course, in strictconfidence."Thorndyke nodded and indicated a chair."My brother," continued Mr. Barton, taking the profferred seat, "hasrecently married for the second time. His age is fifty-five, and that ofhis wife twenty-six, and I may say that the marriage has been--well, byno means a success. Now, within the last fortnight, my brother has beenattacked by a mysterious and extremely painful affection of the stomach,to which his doctor seems unable to give a name. It has resisted alltreatment hitherto. Day by day the pain and distress increase, and Ifeel that, unless something decisive is done, the end cannot be faroff.""Is the pain worse after taking food?" inquired Thorndyke."That's just it!" exclaimed our visitor. "I see what is in your mind,and it has been in mine, too; so much so that I have tried repeatedly toobtain samples of the food that he is taking. And this morning Isucceeded." Here he took from his pocket a wide-mouthed bottle, which,disengaging from its paper wrappings, he laid on the table. "When Icalled, he was taking his breakfast of arrowroot, which he complainedhad a gritty taste, supposed by his wife to be due to the sugar. Now Ihad provided myself with this bottle, and, during the absence of hiswife, I managed unobserved to convey a portion of the arrowroot that hehad left into it, and I should be greatly obliged if you would examineit and tell me if this arrowroot contains anything that it should not."He pushed the bottle across to Thorndyke, who carried it to the window,and, extracting a small quantity of the contents with a glass rod,examined the pasty mass with the aid of a lens; then, lifting thebell-glass cover from the microscope, which stood on its table by thewindow, he smeared a small quantity of the suspected matter on to aglass slip, and placed it on the stage of the instrument."I observe a number of crystalline particles in this," he said, after abrief inspection, "which have the appearance of arsenious acid.""Ah!" ejaculated Mr. Barton, "just what I feared. But are you certain?""No," replied Thorndyke; "but the matter is easily tested."He pressed the button of the bell that communicated with the laboratory,a summons that brought the laboratory assistant from his lair withcharacteristic promptitude."Will you please prepare a Marsh's apparatus, Polton," said Thorndyke."I have a couple ready, sir," replied Polton."Then pour the acid into one and bring it to me, with a tile."As his familiar vanished silently, Thorndyke turned to Mr. Barton."Supposing we find arsenic in this arrowroot, as we probably shall, whatdo you want us to do?""I want you to come and see my brother," replied our client."Why not take a note from me to his doctor?""No, no; I want you to come--I should like you both to come--and put astop at once to this dreadful business. Consider! It's a matter of lifeand death. You won't refuse! I beg you not to refuse me your help inthese terrible circumstances.""Well," said Thorndyke, as his assistant reappeared, "let us first seewhat the test has to tell us."Polton advanced to the table, on which he deposited a small flask, thecontents of which were in a state of brisk effervescence, a bottlelabelled "calcium hypochlorite," and a white porcelain tile. The flaskwas fitted with a safety-funnel and a glass tube drawn out to a finejet, to which Polton cautiously applied a lighted match. Instantly theresprang from the jet a tiny, pale violet flame. Thorndyke now took thetile, and held it in the flame for a few seconds, when the appearance ofthe surface remained unchanged save for a small circle of condensedmoisture. His next proceeding was to thin the arrowroot with distilledwater until it was quite fluid, and then pour a small quantity into thefunnel. It ran slowly down the tube into the flask, with the bubblingcontents of which it became speedily mixed. Almost immediately a changebegan to appear in the character of the flame, which from a pale violetturned gradually to a sickly blue, while above it hung a faint cloud ofwhite smoke. Once more Thorndyke held the tile above the jet, but thistime, no sooner had the pallid flame touched the cold surface of theporcelain, than there appeared on the latter a glistening black stain."That is pretty conclusive," observed Thorndyke, lifting the stopper outof the reagent bottle, "but we will apply the final test." He dropped afew drops of the hypochlorite solution on to the tile, and immediatelythe black stain faded away and vanished. "We can now answer yourquestion, Mr. Barton," said he, replacing the stopper as he turned toour client. "The specimen that you brought us certainly containsarsenic, and in very considerable quantities.""Then," exclaimed Mr. Barton, starting from his chair, "you will comeand help me to rescue my brother from this dreadful peril. Don't refuseme, Dr. Thorndyke, for mercy's sake, don't refuse."Thorndyke reflected for a moment."Before we decide," said he, "we must see what engagements we have."With a quick, significant glance at me, he walked into the office,whither I followed in some bewilderment, for I knew that we had noengagements for the evening."Now, Jervis," said Thorndyke, as he closed the office door, "what arewe to do?""We must go, I suppose," I replied. "It seems a pretty urgent case.""It does," he agreed. "Of course, the man may be telling the truth,after all.""You don't think he is, then?""No. It is a plausible tale, but there is too much arsenic in thatarrowroot. Still, I think I ought to go. It is an ordinary professionalrisk. But there is no reason why you should put your head into thenoose.""Thank you," said I, somewhat huffily. "I don't see what risk there is,but if any exists I claim the right to share it.""Very well," he answered with a smile, "we will both go. I think we cantake care of ourselves."He re-entered the sitting-room, and announced his decision to Mr.Barton, whose relief and gratitude were quite pathetic."But," said Thorndyke, "you have not yet told us where your brotherlives.""Rexford," was the reply--"Rexford, in Essex. It is an out-of-the-wayplace, but if we catch the seven-fifteen train from Liverpool Street, weshall be there in an hour and a half.""And as to the return? You know the trains, I suppose?""Oh yes," replied our client; "I will see that you don't miss yourtrain back.""Then I will be with you in a minute," said Thorndyke; and, taking thestill-bubbling flask, he retired to the laboratory, whence he returnedin a few minutes carrying his hat and overcoat.The cab which had brought our client was still waiting, and we were soonrattling through the streets towards the station, where we arrived intime to furnish ourselves with dinner-baskets and select our compartmentat leisure.During the early part of the journey our companion was in excellentspirits. He despatched the cold fowl from the basket and quaffed therather indifferent claret with as much relish as if he had not had asingle relation in the world, and after dinner he became genial to theverge of hilarity. But, as time went on, there crept into his manner acertain anxious restlessness. He became silent and preoccupied, andseveral times furtively consulted his watch."The train is confoundedly late!" he exclaimed irritably. "Seven minutesbehind time already!""A few minutes more or less are not of much consequence," saidThorndyke."No, of course not; but still--Ah, thank Heaven, here we are!"He thrust his head out of the off-side window, and gazed eagerly downthe line; then, leaping to his feet, he bustled out on to the platformwhile the train was still moving.Even as we alighted a warning bell rang furiously on the up-platform,and as Mr. Barton hurried us through the empty booking-office to theoutside of the station, the rumble of the approaching train could beheard above the noise made by our own train moving off."My carriage doesn't seem to have arrived yet," exclaimed Mr. Barton,looking anxiously up the station approach. "If you will wait here amoment, I will go and make inquiries."He darted back into the booking-office and through it on to theplatform, just as the up-train roared into the station. Thorndykefollowed him with quick but stealthy steps, and, peering out of thebooking-office door, watched his proceedings; then he turned andbeckoned to me."There he goes," said he, pointing to an iron footbridge that spannedthe line; and, as I looked, I saw, clearly defined against the dim nightsky, a flying figure racing towards the "up" side.It was hardly two-thirds across when the guard's whistle sang out itsshrill warning."Quick, Jervis," exclaimed Thorndyke; "she's off!"He leaped down on to the line, whither I followed instantly, and,crossing the rails, we clambered up together on to the foot-boardopposite an empty first-class compartment. Thorndyke's magazine knife,containing, among other implements, a railway-key, was already in hishand. The door was speedily unlocked, and, as we entered, Thorndyke ranthrough and looked out on to the platform."Just in time!" he exclaimed. "He is in one of the forwardcompartments."He relocked the door, and, seating himself, proceeded to fill his pipe."And now," said I, as the train moved out of the station, "perhaps youwill explain this little comedy.""With pleasure," he replied, "if it needs any explanation. But you canhardly have forgotten Mr. James's flattering remarks in his report ofthe Greek Street incident, clearly giving the impression that themysterious document was in my possession. When I read that, I knew Imust look out for some attempt to recover it, though I hardly expectedsuch promptness. Still, when Mr. Barton called without credentials orappointment, I viewed him with some suspicion. That suspicion deepenedwhen he wanted us both to come. It deepened further when I found animpossible quantity of arsenic in his sample, and it gave place tocertainty when, having allowed him to select the trains by which we wereto travel, I went up to the laboratory and examined the time-table; forI then found that the last train for London left Rexford ten minutesafter we were due to arrive. Obviously this was a plan to get us bothsafely out of the way while he and some of his friends ransacked ourchambers for the missing document.""I see; and that accounts for his extraordinary anxiety at the latenessof the train. But why did you come, if you knew it was a 'plant'?""My dear fellow," said Thorndyke, "I never miss an interestingexperience if I can help it. There are possibilities in this, too, don'tyou see?""But supposing his friends have broken into our chambers already?""That contingency has been provided for; but I think they will wait forMr. Barton--and us."Our train, being the last one up, stopped at every station, and crawledslothfully in the intervals, so that it was past eleven o'clock when wereached Liverpool Street. Here we got out cautiously, and, mingling withthe crowd, followed the unconscious Barton up the platform, through thebarrier, and out into the street. He seemed in no special hurry, for,after pausing to light a cigar, he set off at an easy pace up New BroadStreet.Thorndyke hailed a hansom, and, motioning me to enter, directed thecabman to drive to Clifford's Inn Passage."Sit well back," said he, as we rattled away up New Broad Street. "Weshall be passing our gay deceiver presently--in fact, there he is, aliving, walking illustration of the folly of underrating theintelligence of one's adversary."At Clifford's Inn Passage we dismissed the cab, and, retiring into theshadow of the dark, narrow alley, kept an eye on the gate of InnerTemple Lane. In about twenty minutes we observed our friend approachingon the south side of Fleet Street. He halted at the gate, plied theknocker, and after a brief parley with the night-porter vanished throughthe wicket. We waited yet five minutes more, and then, having given himtime to get clear of the entrance, we crossed the road.The porter looked at us with some surprise."There's a gentleman just gone down to your chambers, sir," said he. "Hetold me you were expecting him.""Quite right," said Thorndyke, with a dry smile, "I was. Good-night."We slunk down the lane, past the church, and through the gloomycloisters, giving a wide berth to all lamps and lighted entries, until,emerging into Paper Buildings, we crossed at the darkest part to King'sBench Walk, where Thorndyke made straight for the chambers of our friendAnstey, which were two doors above our own."Why are we coming here?" I asked, as we ascended the stairs.But the question needed no answer when we reached the landing, forthrough the open door of our friend's chambers I could see in thedarkened room Anstey himself with two uniformed constables and a coupleof plain-clothes men."There has been no signal yet, sir," said one of the latter, whom Irecognized as a detective-sergeant of our division."No," said Thorndyke, "but the M.C. has arrived. He came in five minutesbefore us.""Then," exclaimed Anstey, "the ball will open shortly, ladies and gents.The boards are waxed, the fiddlers are tuning up, and--""Not quite so loud, if you please, sir," said the sergeant. "I thinkthere is somebody coming up Crown Office Row."The ball had, in fact, opened. As we peered cautiously out of the openwindow, keeping well back in the darkened room, a stealthy figure creptout of the shadow, crossed the road, and stole noiselessly into theentry of Thorndyke's chambers. It was quickly followed by a secondfigure, and then by a third, in which I recognized our elusive client."Now listen for the signal," said Thorndyke. "They won't waste time.Confound that clock!"The soft-voiced bell of the Inner Temple clock, mingling with theharsher tones of St. Dunstan's and the Law Courts, slowly told out thehour of midnight; and as the last reverberations were dying away, somemetallic object, apparently a coin, dropped with a sharp clink on to thepavement under our window.At the sound the watchers simultaneously sprang to their feet."You two go first," said the sergeant, addressing the uniformed men, whothereupon stole noiselessly, in their rubber-soled boots, down the stonestairs and along the pavement. The rest of us followed, with lessattention to silence, and as we ran up to Thorndyke's chambers, we wereaware of quick but stealthy footsteps on the stairs above."They've been at work, you see," whispered one of the constables,flashing his lantern on to the iron-bound outer door of oursitting-room, on which the marks of a large jemmy were plainly visible.The sergeant nodded grimly, and, bidding the constables to remain on thelanding, led the way upwards.As we ascended, faint rustlings continued to be audible from above, andon the second-floor landing we met a man descending briskly, but withouthurry, from the third. It was Mr. Barton, and I could not but admire thecomposure with which he passed the two detectives. But suddenly hisglance fell on Thorndyke, and his composure vanished. With a wild stareof incredulous horror, he halted as if petrified; then he broke away andraced furiously down the stairs, and a moment later a muffled shout andthe sound of a scuffle told us that he had received a check. On the nextflight we met two more men, who, more hurried and less self-possessed,endeavoured to push past; but the sergeant barred the way."Why, bless me!" exclaimed the latter, "it's Moakey; and isn't that TomHarris?""It's all right, sergeant," said Moakey plaintively, striving to escapefrom the officer's grip. "We've come to the wrong house, that's all."The sergeant smiled indulgently. "I know," he replied. "But you'realways coming to the wrong house, Moakey; and now you're just comingalong with me to the right house."He slipped his hand inside his captive's coat, and adroitly fished out alarge, folding jemmy; whereupon the discomforted burglar abandoned allfurther protest.On our return to the first-floor, we found Mr. Barton sulkily awaitingus, handcuffed to one of the constables, and watched by Polton withpensive disapproval."I needn't trouble you to-night, Doctor," said the sergeant, as hemarshalled his little troop of captors and captives. "You'll hear fromus in the morning. Good-night, sir."The melancholy procession moved off down the stairs, and we retired intoour chambers with Anstey to smoke a last pipe."A capable man, that Barton," observed Thorndyke--"ready, plausible, andingenious, but spoilt by prolonged contact with fools. I wonder if thepolice will perceive the significance of this little affair.""They will be more acute than I am if they do," said I."Naturally," interposed Anstey, who loved to "cheek" his revered senior,"because there isn't any. It's only Thorndyke's bounce. He is really ina deuce of a fog himself."However this may have been, the police were a good deal puzzled by theincident, for, on the following morning, we received a visit from noless a person than Superintendent Miller, of Scotland Yard."This is a queer business," said he, coming to the point at once--"thisburglary, I mean. Why should they want to crack your place, right herein the Temple, too? You've got nothing of value here, have you? No'hard stuff,' as they call it, for instance?""Not so much as a silver teaspoon," replied Thorndyke, who had aconscientious objection to plate of all kinds."It's odd," said the superintendent, "deuced odd. When we got your note,we thought these anarchist idiots had mixed you up with the case--yousaw the papers, I suppose--and wanted to go through your rooms for somereason. We thought we had our hands on the gang, instead of which wefind a party of common crooks that we're sick of the sight of. I tellyou, sir, it's annoying when you think you've hooked a salmon, to bringup a blooming eel.""It must be a great disappointment," Thorndyke agreed, suppressing asmile."It is," said the detective. "Not but what we're glad enough to getthese beggars, especially Halkett, or Barton, as he calls himself--amighty slippery customer is Halkett, and mischievous, too--but we're notwanting any disappointments just now. There was that big jewel job inPiccadilly, Taplin and Horne's; I don't mind telling you that we've notgot the ghost of a clue. Then there's this anarchist affair. We're allin the dark there, too.""But what about the cipher?" asked Thorndyke."Oh, hang the cipher!" exclaimed the detective irritably. "ThisProfessor Poppelbaum may be a very learned man, but he doesn't help _us_much. He says the document is in Hebrew, and he has translated it intoDouble Dutch. Just listen to this!" He dragged out of his pocket abundle of papers, and, dabbing down a photograph of the document beforeThorndyke, commenced to read the Professor's report. "'The document iswritten in the characters of the well-known inscription of Mesha, Kingof Moab' (who the devil's he? Never heard of him. Well known, indeed!)'The language is Hebrew, and the words are separated by groups ofletters, which are meaningless, and obviously introduced to mislead andconfuse the reader. The words themselves are not strictly consecutive,but, by the interpellation of certain other words, a series ofintelligible sentences is obtained, the meaning of which is not veryclear, but is no doubt allegorical. The method of decipherment is shownin the accompanying tables, and the full rendering suggested on theenclosed sheet. It is to be noted that the writer of this document wasapparently quite unacquainted with the Hebrew language, as appears fromthe absence of any grammatical construction.' That's the Professor'sreport, Doctor, and here are the tables showing how he worked it out. Itmakes my head spin to look at 'em."He handed to Thorndyke a bundle of ruled sheets, which my colleagueexamined attentively for a while, and then passed on to me."This is very systematic and thorough," said he. "But now let us see thefinal result at which he arrives.""It may be all very systematic," growled the superintendent, sorting outhis papers, "but I tell you, sir, it's all BOSH!" The latter word hejerked out viciously, as he slapped down on the table the final productof the Professor's labours. "There," he continued, "that's what he callsthe 'full rendering,' and I reckon it'll make your hair curl. It mightbe a message from Bedlam."Thorndyke took up the first sheet, and as he compared the constructedrenderings with the literal translation, the ghost of a smile stoleacross his usually immovable countenance."The meaning is certainly a little obscure," he observed, "though thereconstruction is highly ingenious; and, moreover, I think the Professoris probably right. That is to say, the words which he has supplied areprobably the omitted parts of the passages from which the words of thecryptogram were taken. What do you think, Jervis?"[Illustration: THE PROFESSOR'S ANALYSIS.Handwritten: Analysis of the cipher with translation into modern squareHebrew characters + a translation into English. N.B. The cipher readsfrom right to left.]He handed me the two papers, of which one gave the actual words of thecryptogram, and the other a suggested reconstruction, with omitted wordssupplied. The first read:     "Woe     city     lies     robbery     prey     noise     whip     rattling     wheel     horse      chariot     day     darkness     gloominess     cloud     darkness     morning     mountain     people     strong     fire     them     flame."Turning to the second paper, I read out the suggested rendering:"'Woe _to the bloody_ city! _It is full of_ lies _and_ robbery; _the_prey _departeth not_. _The_ noise _of a_ whip, _and the noise of the_rattling _of the_ wheel_s_, _and of the prancing_ horse_s_, _and of thejumping_ chariot_s_."'_A_ day _of_ darkness _and of_ gloominess, _a day of_ cloud_s_, _andof thick_ darkness, _as the_ morning _spread upon the_ mountain_s_, _agreat_ people _and a_ strong."'_A_ fire _devoureth before_ them, _and behind them a_ flame_burneth_.'"Here the first sheet ended, and, as I laid it down, Thorndyke looked atme inquiringly."There is a good deal of reconstruction in proportion to the originalmatter," I objected. "The Professor has 'supplied' more thanthree-quarters of the final rendering.""Exactly," burst in the superintendent; "it's all Professor and nocryptogram.""Still, I think the reading is correct," said Thorndyke. "As far as itgoes, that is.""Good Lord!" exclaimed the dismayed detective. "Do you mean to tell me,sir, that that balderdash is the real meaning of the thing?""I don't say that," replied Thorndyke. "I say it is correct as far as itgoes; but I doubt its being the solution of the cryptogram.""Have you been studying that photograph that I gave you?" demandedMiller, with sudden eagerness."I have looked at it," said Thorndyke evasively, "but I should like toexamine the original if you have it with you.""I have," said the detective. "Professor Poppelbaum sent it back withthe solution. You can have a look at it, though I can't leave it withyou without special authority."He drew the document from his pocket-book and handed it to Thorndyke,who took it over to the window and scrutinized it closely. From thewindow he drifted into the adjacent office, closing the door after him;and presently the sound of a faint explosion told me that he had lightedthe gas-fire."Of course," said Miller, taking up the translation again, "thisgibberish is the sort of stuff you might expect from a parcel ofcrack-brained anarchists; but it doesn't seem to mean anything.""Not to us," I agreed; "but the phrases may have some pre-arrangedsignificance. And then there are the letters between the words. It ispossible that they may really form a cipher.""I suggested that to the Professor," said Miller, "but he wouldn't hearof it. He is sure they are only dummies.""I think he is probably mistaken, and so, I fancy, does my colleague.But we shall hear what he has to say presently.""Oh, I know what he will say," growled Miller. "He will put the thingunder the microscope, and tell us who made the paper, and what the inkis composed of, and then we shall be just where we were." Thesuperintendent was evidently deeply depressed.We sat for some time pondering in silence on the vague sentences of theProfessor's translation, until, at length, Thorndyke reappeared, holdingthe document in his hand. He laid it quietly on the table by theofficer, and then inquired:"Is this an official consultation?""Certainly," replied Miller. "I was authorized to consult you respectingthe translation, but nothing was said about the original. Still, if youwant it for further study, I will get it for you.""No, thank you," said Thorndyke. "I have finished with it. My theoryturned out to be correct.""Your theory!" exclaimed the superintendent, eagerly. "Do you mean tosay--?""And, as you are consulting me officially, I may as well give you this."He held out a sheet of paper, which the detective took from him andbegan to read."What is this?" he asked, looking up at Thorndyke with a puzzled frown."Where did it come from?""It is the solution of the cryptogram," replied Thorndyke.The detective re-read the contents of the paper, and, with the frown ofperplexity deepening, once more gazed at my colleague."This is a joke, sir; you are fooling me," he said sulkily."Nothing of the kind," answered Thorndyke. "That is the genuinesolution.""But it's impossible!" exclaimed Miller. "Just look at it, Dr. Jervis."I took the paper from his hand, and, as I glanced at it, I had nodifficulty in understanding his surprise. It bore a short inscription inprinted Roman capitals, thus:"THE PICKERDILLEY STUF IS UP THE CHIMBLY 416 WARDOUR ST 2ND FLOUR BACKIT WAS HID BECOS OF OLD MOAKEYS JOOD MOAKEY IS A BLITER.""Then that fellow wasn't an anarchist at all?" I exclaimed."No," said Miller. "He was one of Moakey's gang. We suspected Moakey ofbeing mixed up with that job, but we couldn't fix it on him. By Jove!"he added, slapping his thigh, "if this is right, and I can lay my handson the loot! Can you lend me a bag, doctor? I'm off to Wardour Streetthis very moment."We furnished him with an empty suit-case, and, from the window, watchedhim making for Mitre Court at a smart double."I wonder if he will find the booty," said Thorndyke. "It just dependson whether the hiding-place was known to more than one of the gang.Well, it has been a quaint case, and instructive, too. I suspect ourfriend Barton and the evasive Schoenberg were the collaborators whoproduced that curiosity of literature.""May I ask how you deciphered the thing?" I said. "It didn't appear totake long.""It didn't. It was merely a matter of testing a hypothesis; and youought not to have to ask that question," he added, with mock severity,"seeing that you had what turn out to have been all the necessary facts,two days ago. But I will prepare a document and demonstrate to youto-morrow morning."       *       *       *       *       *"So Miller was successful in his quest," said Thorndyke, as we smokedour morning pipes after breakfast. "The 'entire swag,' as he calls it,was 'up the chimbly,' undisturbed."He handed me a note which had been left, with the empty suit-case, by amessenger, shortly before, and I was about to read it when an agitatedknock was heard at our door. The visitor, whom I admitted, was a ratherhaggard and dishevelled elderly gentleman, who, as he entered, peeredinquisitively through his concave spectacles from one of us to theother."Allow me to introduce myself, gentlemen," said he. "I am ProfessorPoppelbaum."Thorndyke bowed and offered a chair."I called yesterday afternoon," our visitor continued, "at ScotlandYard, where I heard of your remarkable decipherment and of theconvincing proof of its correctness. Thereupon I borrowed thecryptogram, and have spent the entire night in studying it, but I cannotconnect your solution with any of the characters. I wonder if you woulddo me the great favour of enlightening me as to your method ofdecipherment, and so save me further sleepless nights? You may rely onmy discretion.""Have you the document with you?" asked Thorndyke.The Professor produced it from his pocket-book, and passed it to mycolleague."You observe, Professor," said the latter, "that this is a laid paper,and has no water-mark?""Yes, I noticed that.""And that the writing is in indelible Chinese ink?""Yes, yes," said the savant impatiently; "but it is the inscription thatinterests me, not the paper and ink.""Precisely," said Thorndyke. "Now, it was the ink that interested mewhen I caught a glimpse of the document three days ago. 'Why,' I askedmyself, 'should anyone use this troublesome medium'--for this appears tobe stick ink--'when good writing ink is to be had?' What advantages hasChinese ink over writing ink? It has several advantages as a drawingink, but for writing purposes it has only one: it is quite unaffectedby wet. The obvious inference, then, was that this document was, forsome reason, likely to be exposed to wet. But this inference instantlysuggested another, which I was yesterday able to put to the test--thus."He filled a tumbler with water, and, rolling up the document, dropped itin. Immediately there began to appear on it a new set of characters of acurious grey colour. In a few seconds Thorndyke lifted out the wetpaper, and held it up to the light, and now there was plainly visible aninscription in transparent lettering, like a very distinct water-mark.It was in printed Roman capitals, written across the other writing, andread:"THE PICKERDILLEY STUF IS UP THE CHIMBLY 416 WARDOUR ST 2ND FLOUR BACKIT WAS HID BECOS OF OLD MOAKEYS JOOD MOAKEY IS A BLITER."The Professor regarded the inscription with profound disfavour."How do you suppose this was done?" he asked gloomily."I will show you," said Thorndyke. "I have prepared a piece of paper todemonstrate the process to Dr. Jervis. It is exceedingly simple."He fetched from the office a small plate of glass, and a photographicdish in which a piece of thin notepaper was soaking in water."This paper," said Thorndyke, lifting it out and laying it on the glass,"has been soaking all night, and is now quite pulpy."He spread a dry sheet of paper over the wet one, and on the former wroteheavily with a hard pencil, "Moakey is a bliter." On lifting the uppersheet, the writing was seen to be transferred in a deep grey to the wetpaper, and when the latter was held up to the light the inscriptionstood out clear and transparent as if written with oil."When this dries," said Thorndyke, "the writing will completelydisappear, but it will reappear whenever the paper is again wetted."The Professor nodded."Very ingenious," said he--"a sort of artificial palimpsest, in fact.But I do not understand how that illiterate man could have written inthe difficult Moabite script.""He did not," said Thorndyke. "The 'cryptogram' was probably written byone of the leaders of the gang, who, no doubt, supplied copies to theother members to use instead of blank paper for secret communications.The object of the Moabite writing was evidently to divert attention fromthe paper itself, in case the communication fell into the wrong hands,and I must say it seems to have answered its purpose very well."The Professor started, stung by the sudden recollection of his labours."Yes," he snorted; "but I am a scholar, sir, not a policeman. Every manto his trade."He snatched up his hat, and with a curt "Good-morning," flung out of theroom in dudgeon.Thorndyke laughed softly."Poor Professor!" he murmured. "Our playful friend Barton has much toanswer for."VITHE MANDARIN'S PEARLMr. Brodribb stretched out his toes on the kerb before the blazing firewith the air of a man who is by no means insensible to physical comfort."You are really an extraordinarily polite fellow, Thorndyke," said he.He was an elderly man, rosy-gilled, portly, and convivial, to whom amass of bushy, white hair, an expansive double chin, and a certain primsumptuousness of dress imparted an air of old-world distinction. Indeed,as he dipped an amethystine nose into his wine-glass, and gazedthoughtfully at the glowing end of his cigar, he looked the very type ofthe well-to-do lawyer of an older generation."You are really an extraordinarily polite fellow, Thorndyke," said Mr.Brodribb."I know," replied Thorndyke. "But why this reference to an admittedfact?""The truth has just dawned on me," said the solicitor. "Here am I,dropping in on you, uninvited and unannounced, sitting in your ownarmchair before your fire, smoking your cigars, drinking yourBurgundy--and deuced good Burgundy, too, let me add--and you have notdropped a single hint of curiosity as to what has brought me here.""I take the gifts of the gods, you see, and ask no questions," saidThorndyke."Devilish handsome of you, Thorndyke--unsociable beggar like you, too,"rejoined Mr. Brodribb, a fan of wrinkles spreading out genially from thecorners of his eyes; "but the fact is I have come, in a sense, onbusiness--always glad of a pretext to look you up, as you know--but Iwant to take your opinion on a rather queer case. It is about youngCalverley. You remember Horace Calverley? Well, this is his son. Horaceand I were schoolmates, you know, and after his death the boy, Fred,hung on to me rather. We're near neighbours down at Weybridge, and verygood friends. I like Fred. He's a good fellow, though cranky, like allhis people.""What has happened to Fred Calverley?" Thorndyke asked, as the solicitorpaused."Why, the fact is," said Mr. Brodribb, "just lately he seems to be goinga bit queer--not mad, mind you--at least, I think not--but undoubtedlyqueer. Now, there is a good deal of property, and a good many highlyinterested relatives, and, as a natural consequence, there is some talkof getting him certified. They're afraid he may do something involvingthe estate or develop homicidal tendencies, and they talk of possiblesuicide--you remember his father's death--but I say that's all bunkum.The fellow is just a bit cranky, and nothing more.""What are his symptoms?" asked Thorndyke."Oh, he thinks he is being followed about and watched, and he hasdelusions; sees himself in the glass with the wrong face, and that sortof thing, you know.""You are not highly circumstantial," Thorndyke remarked.Mr. Brodribb looked at me with a genial smile."What a glutton for facts this fellow is, Jervis. But you're right,Thorndyke; I'm vague. However, Fred will be here presently. We traveldown together, and I took the liberty of asking him to call for me.We'll get him to tell you about his delusions, if you don't mind. He'snot shy about them. And meanwhile I'll give you a few preliminary facts.The trouble began about a year ago. He was in a railway accident, andthat knocked him all to pieces. Then he went for a voyage to recruit,and the ship broke her propeller-shaft in a storm and became helpless.That didn't improve the state of his nerves. Then he went down theMediterranean, and after a month or two, back he came, no better thanwhen he started. But here he is, I expect."He went over to the door and admitted a tall, frail young man whomThorndyke welcomed with quiet geniality, and settled in a chair by thefire. I looked curiously at our visitor. He was a typicalneurotic--slender, fragile, eager. Wide-open blue eyes with broadpupils, in which I could plainly see the characteristic "hippus"--thatincessant change of size that marks the unstable nervousequilibrium--parted lips, and wandering taper fingers, were as thestigmata of his disorder. He was of the stuff out of which prophets anddevotees, martyrs, reformers, and third-rate poets are made."I have been telling Dr. Thorndyke about these nervous troubles ofyours," said Mr. Brodribb presently. "I hope you don't mind. He is anold friend, you know, and he is very much interested.""It is very good of him," said Calverley. Then he flushed deeply, andadded: "But they are not really nervous, you know. They can't be merelysubjective.""You think they can't be?" said Thorndyke."No, I am sure they are not." He flushed again like a girl, and lookedearnestly at Thorndyke with his big, dreamy eyes. "But you doctors," hesaid, "are so dreadfully sceptical of all spiritual phenomena. You aresuch materialists.""Yes," said Mr. Brodribb; "the doctors are not hot on the supernatural,and that's the fact.""Supposing you tell us about your experiences," said Thorndykepersuasively. "Give us a chance to believe, if we can't explain away."Calverley reflected for a few moments; then, looking earnestly atThorndyke, he said:"Very well; if it won't bore you, I will. It is a curious story.""I have told Dr. Thorndyke about your voyage and your trip down theMediterranean," said Mr. Brodribb."Then," said Calverley, "I will begin with the events that are actuallyconnected with these strange visitations. The first of these occurred inMarseilles. I was in a curio-shop there, looking over some Algerian andMoorish tilings, when my attention was attracted by a sort of charm orpendant that hung in a glass case. It was not particularly beautiful,but its appearance was quaint and curious, and took my fancy. Itconsisted of an oblong block of ebony in which was set a singlepear-shaped pearl more than three-quarters of an inch long. The sides ofthe ebony block were lacquered--probably to conceal a joint--and bore anumber of Chinese characters, and at the top was a little gold imagewith a hole through it, presumably for a string to suspend it by.Excepting for the pearl, the whole thing was uncommonly like one ofthose ornamental tablets of Chinese ink."Now, I had taken a fancy to the thing, and I can afford to indulge myfancies in moderation. The man wanted five pounds for it; he assured methat the pearl was a genuine one of fine quality, and obviously did notbelieve it himself. To me, however, it looked like a real pearl, and Idetermined to take the risk; so I paid the money, and he bowed me outwith a smile--I may almost say a grin--of satisfaction. He would nothave been so well pleased if he had followed me to a jeweller's to whomI took it for an expert opinion; for the jeweller pronounced the pearlto be undoubtedly genuine, and worth anything up to a thousand pounds."A day or two later, I happened to show my new purchase to some men whomI knew, who had dropped in at Marseilles in their yacht. They werehighly amused at my having bought the thing, and when I told them what Ihad paid for it, they positively howled with derision."'Why, you silly guffin,' said one of them, a man named Halliwell, 'Icould have had it ten days ago for half a sovereign, or probably fiveshillings. I wish now I had bought it; then I could have sold it toyou.'"It seemed that a sailor had been hawking the pendant round the harbour,and had been on board the yacht with it."'Deuced anxious the beggar was to get rid of it, too,' said Halliwell,grinning at the recollection. 'Swore it was a genuine pearl of pricelessvalue, and was willing to deprive himself of it for the trifling sum ofhalf a jimmy. But we'd heard that sort of thing before. However, thecurio-man seems to have speculated on the chance of meeting with agreenhorn, and he seems to have pulled it off. Lucky curio man!'"I listened patiently to their gibes, and when they had talkedthemselves out I told them about the jeweller. They were mostfrightfully sick; and when we had taken the pendant to a dealer in gemswho happened to be staying in the town, and he had offered me fivehundred pounds for it, their language wasn't fit for a divinitystudents' debating club. Naturally the story got noised abroad, and whenI left, it was the talk of the place. The general opinion was that thesailor, who was traced to a tea-ship that had put into the harbour, hadstolen it from some Chinese passenger; and no less than seventeendifferent Chinamen came forward to claim it as their stolen property."Soon after this I returned to England, and, as my nerves were still ina very shaky state, I came to live with my cousin Alfred, who has alarge house at Weybridge. At this time he had a friend staying with him,a certain Captain Raggerton, and the two men appeared to be on veryintimate terms. I did not take to Raggerton at all. He was agood-looking man, pleasant in his manners, and remarkably plausible. Butthe fact is--I am speaking in strict confidence, of course--he was a badegg. He had been in the Guards, and I don't quite know why he left; butI do know that he played bridge and baccarat pretty heavily at severalclubs, and that he had a reputation for being a rather uncomfortablylucky player. He did a good deal at the race-meetings, too, and was ingeneral such an obvious undesirable that I could never understand mycousin's intimacy with him, though I must say that Alfred's habits hadchanged somewhat for the worse since I had left England."The fame of my purchase seems to have preceded me, for when, one day, Iproduced the pendant to show them, I found that they knew all about it.Raggerton had heard the story from a naval man, and I gathered vaguelythat he had heard something that I had not, and that he did not care totell me; for when my cousin and he talked about the pearl, which theydid pretty often, certain significant looks passed between them, andcertain veiled references were made which I could not fail to notice."One day I happened to be telling them of a curious incident thatoccurred on my way home. I had travelled to England on one of Holt's bigChina boats, not liking the crowd and bustle of the regularpassenger-lines. Now, one afternoon, when we had been at sea a couple ofdays, I took a book down to my berth, intending to have a quiet readtill tea-time. Soon, however, I dropped off into a doze, and must haveremained asleep for over an hour. I awoke suddenly, and as I opened myeyes, I perceived that the door of the state-room was half-open, and awell-dressed Chinaman, in native costume, was looking in at me. Heclosed the door immediately, and I remained for a few moments paralyzedby the start that he had given me. Then I leaped from my bunk, openedthe door, and looked out. But the alley-way was empty. The Chinaman hadvanished as if by magic."This little occurrence made me quite nervous for a day or two, whichwas very foolish of me; but my nerves were all on edge--and I am afraidthey are still.""Yes," said Thorndyke. "There was nothing mysterious about the affair.These boats carry a Chinese crew, and the man you saw was probably aSerang, or whatever they call the gang-captains on these vessels. Or hemay have been a native passenger who had strayed into the wrong part ofthe ship.""Exactly," agreed our client. "But to return to Raggerton. He listenedwith quite extraordinary interest as I was telling this story, and whenI had finished he looked very queerly at my cousin."'A deuced odd thing, this, Calverley,' said he. 'Of course, it may beonly a coincidence, but it really does look as if there was something,after all, in that--'"'Shut up, Raggerton,' said my cousin. 'We don't want any of that rot.'"'What is he talking about?" I asked."'Oh, it's only a rotten, silly yarn that he has picked up somewhere.You're not to tell him, Raggerton.'"'I don't see why I am not to be told,' I said, rather sulkily. 'I'm nota baby.'"'No,' said Alfred, 'but you're an invalid. You don't want any horrors.'"In effect, he refused to go into the matter any further, and I was lefton tenter-hooks of curiosity."However, the very next day I got Raggerton alone in the smoking-room,and had a little talk with him. He had just dropped a hundred pounds ona double event that hadn't come off, and I expected to find him pliable.Nor was I disappointed, for, when we had negotiated a little loan, hewas entirely at my service, and willing to tell me everything, on mypromising not to give him away to Alfred."'Now, you understand,' he said, 'that this yarn about your pearl isnothing but a damn silly fable that's been going the round inMarseilles. I don't know where it came from, or what sort of dementedrotter invented it; I had it from a Johnnie in the MediterraneanSquadron, and you can have a copy of his letter if you want it.'"I said that I did want it. Accordingly, that same evening he handed mea copy of the narrative extracted from his friend's letter, thesubstance of which was this:"About four months ago there was lying in Canton Harbour a large Englishbarque. Her name is not mentioned, but that is not material to thestory. She had got her cargo stowed and her crew signed on, and was onlywaiting for certain official formalities to be completed before puttingto sea on her homeward voyage. Just ahead of her, at the same quay, wasa Danish ship that had been in collision outside, and was now laid uppending the decision of the Admiralty Court. She had been unloaded, andher crew paid off, with the exception of one elderly man, who remainedon board as ship-keeper. Now, a considerable part of the cargo of theEnglish barque was the property of a certain wealthy mandarin, and thisperson had been about the vessel a good deal while she was taking in herlading."One day, when the mandarin was on board the barque, it happened thatthree of the seamen were sitting in the galley smoking and chatting withthe cook--an elderly Chinaman named Wo-li--and the latter, pointing outthe mandarin to the sailors, expatiated on his enormous wealth, assuringthem that he was commonly believed to carry on his person articles ofsufficient value to buy up the entire lading of a ship."Now, unfortunately for the mandarin, it chanced that these threesailors were about the greatest rascals on board; which is saying a gooddeal when one considers the ordinary moral standard that prevails in theforecastle of a sailing-ship. Nor was Wo-li himself an angel; in fact,he was a consummate villain, and seems to have been the actualoriginator of the plot which was presently devised to rob the mandarin."This plot was as remarkable for its simplicity as for its cold-bloodedbarbarity. On the evening before the barque sailed, the three seamen,Nilsson, Foucault, and Parratt, proceeded to the Danish ship with asupply of whisky, made the ship-keeper royally drunk, and locked him upin an empty berth. Meanwhile Wo-li made a secret communication to themandarin to the effect that certain stolen property, believed to be his,had been secreted in the hold of the empty ship. Thereupon the mandarincame down hot-foot to the quay-side, and was received on board by thethree seamen, who had got the covers off the after-hatch in readiness.Parratt now ran down the iron ladder to show the way, and the mandarinfollowed; but when they reached the lower deck, and looked down thehatch into the black darkness of the lower hold, he seems to have takenfright, and begun to climb up again. Meanwhile Nilsson had made arunning bowline in the end of a loose halyard that was rove through ablock aloft, and had been used for hoisting out the cargo. As themandarin came up, he leaned over the coaming of the hatch, dropped thenoose over the Chinaman's head, jerked it tight, and then he andFoucault hove on the fall of the rope. The unfortunate Chinaman wasdragged from the ladder, and, as he swung clear, the two rascals let gothe rope, allowing him to drop through the hatches into the lower hold.Then they belayed the rope, and went down below. Parratt had alreadylighted a slush-lamp, by the glimmer of which they could see themandarin swinging to and fro like a pendulum within a few feet of theballast, and still quivering and twitching in his death-throes. Theywere now joined by Wo-li, who had watched the proceedings from the quay,and the four villains proceeded, without loss of time, to rifle the bodyas it hung. To their surprise and disgust, they found nothing of valueexcepting an ebony pendant set with a single large pearl; but Wo-li,though evidently disappointed at the nature of the booty, assured hiscomrades that this alone was well worth the hazard, pointing out thegreat size and exceptional beauty of the pearl. As to this, the seamenknow nothing about pearls, but the thing was done, and had to be madethe best of; so they made the rope fast to the lower deck-beams, cut offthe remainder and unrove it from the block, and went back to their ship."It was twenty-four hours before the ship-keeper was sufficiently soberto break out of the berth in which he had been locked, by which time thebarque was well out to sea; and it was another three days before thebody of the mandarin was found. An active search was then made for themurderers, but as they were strangers to the ship-keeper, no clues totheir whereabouts could be discovered."Meanwhile, the four murderers were a good deal exercised as to thedisposal of the booty. Since it could not be divided, it was evidentthat it must be entrusted to the keeping of one of them. The choice inthe first place fell upon Wo-li, in whose chest the pendant wasdeposited as soon as the party came on board, it being arranged that theChinaman should produce the jewel for inspection by his confederateswhenever called upon."For six weeks nothing out of the common occurred; but then a verysingular event befell. The four conspirators were sitting outside thegalley one evening, when suddenly the cook uttered a cry of amazementand horror. The other three turned to see what it was that had sodisturbed their comrade, and then they, too, were struck dumb withconsternation; for, standing at the door of the companion-hatch--thebarque was a flush-decked vessel--was the mandarin whom they had leftfor dead. He stood quietly regarding them for fully a minute, while theystared at him transfixed with terror. Then he beckoned to them, and wentbelow."So petrified were they with astonishment and mortal fear that theyremained for a long time motionless and dumb. At last they plucked upcourage, and began to make furtive inquiries among the crew; but noone--not even the steward--knew anything of any passengers, or, indeed,of any Chinaman, on board the ship, excepting Wo-li."At day-break the next morning, when the cook's mate went to the galleyto fill the coppers, he found Wo-li hanging from a hook in the ceiling.The cook's body was stiff and cold, and had evidently been hangingseveral hours. The report of the tragedy quickly spread through theship, and the three conspirators hurried off to remove the pearl fromthe dead man's chest before the officers should come to examine it. Thecheap lock was easily picked with a bent wire, and the jewelabstracted; but now the question arose as to who should take charge ofit. The eagerness to be the actual custodian of the precious bauble,which had been at first displayed, now gave place to equally strongreluctance. But someone had to take charge of it, and after a long andangry discussion Nilsson was prevailed upon to stow it in his chest."A fortnight passed. The three conspirators went about their dutiessoberly, like men burdened with some secret anxiety, and in theirleisure moments they would sit and talk with bated breath of theapparition at the companion-hatch, and the mysterious death of theirlate comrade."At last the blow fell."It was at the end of the second dog-watch that the hands were gatheredon the forecastle, preparing to make sail after a spell of bad weather.Suddenly Nilsson gave a husky shout, and rushed at Parratt, holding outthe key of his chest."'Here you, Parratt,' he exclaimed, 'go below and take that accursedthing out of my chest.'"'What for?' demanded Parratt; and then he and Foucault, who wasstanding close by, looked aft to see what Nilsson was staring at."Instantly they both turned white as ghosts, and fell trembling so thatthey could hardly stand; for there was the mandarin, standing calmly bythe companion, returning with a steady, impassive gaze their looks ofhorror. And even as they looked he beckoned and went below."'D'ye hear, Parratt?' gasped Nilsson; 'take my key and do what I say,or else--'"But at this moment the order was given to go aloft and set all plainsail; the three men went off to their respective posts, Nilsson goingup the fore-topmast rigging, and the other two to the main-top. Havingfinished their work aloft, Foucault and Parratt who were both in theport watch, came down on deck, and then, it being their watch below,they went and turned in."When they turned out with their watch at midnight, they looked aboutfor Nilsson, who was in the starboard watch, but he was nowhere to beseen. Thinking he might have slipped below unobserved, they made noremark, though they were very uneasy about him; but when the starboardwatch came on deck at four o'clock, and Nilsson did not appear with hismates, the two men became alarmed, and made inquiries about him. It wasnow discovered that no one had seen him since eight o'clock on theprevious evening, and, this being reported to the officer of the watch,the latter ordered all hands to be called. But still Nilsson did notappear. A thorough search was now instituted, both below and aloft, andas there was still no sign of the missing man, it was concluded that hehad fallen overboard."But at eight o'clock two men were sent aloft to shake out thefore-royal. They reached the yard almost simultaneously, and were juststepping on to the foot-ropes when one of them gave a shout; then thepair came sliding down a backstay, with faces as white as tallow. Assoon as they reached the deck, they took the officer of the watchforward, and, standing on the heel of the bowsprit, pointed aloft.Several of the hands, including Foucault and Parratt, had followed, andall looked up; and there they saw the body of Nilsson, hanging on thefront of the fore-topgallant sail. He was dangling at the end of agasket, and bouncing up and down on the taut belly of the sail as theship rose and fell to the send of the sea."The two survivors were now in some doubt about having anything furtherto do with the pearl. But the great value of the jewel, and theconsideration that it was now to be divided between two instead of four,tempted them. They abstracted it from Nilsson's chest, and then, as theycould not come to an agreement in any other way, they decided to settlewho should take charge of it by tossing a coin. The coin was accordinglyspun, and the pearl went to Foucault's chest."From this moment Foucault lived in a state of continual apprehension.When on deck, his eyes were for ever wandering towards the companionhatch, and during his watch below, when not asleep, he would sit moodilyon his chest, lost in gloomy reflection. But a fortnight passed, thenthree weeks, and still nothing happened. Land was sighted, the Straitsof Gibraltar passed, and the end of the voyage was but a matter of days.And still the dreaded mandarin made no sign."At length the ship was within twenty-four hours of Marseilles, to whichport a large part of the cargo was consigned. Active preparations werebeing made for entering the port, and among other things the shoretackle was being overhauled. A share in this latter work fell toFoucault and Parratt, and about the middle of the seconddog-watch--seven o'clock in the evening--they were sitting on the deckworking an eye-splice in the end of a large rope. Suddenly Foucault, whowas facing forward, saw his companion turn pale and stare aft with anexpression of terror. He immediately turned and looked over his shoulderto see what Parratt was staring at. It was the mandarin, standing bythe companion, gravely watching them; and as Foucault turned and met hisgaze, the Chinaman beckoned and went below."For the rest of that day Parratt kept close to his terrified comrade,and during their watch below he endeavoured to remain awake, that hemight keep his friend in view. Nothing happened through the night, andthe following morning, when they came on deck for the forenoon watch,their port was well in sight. The two men now separated for the firsttime, Parratt going aft to take his trick at the wheel, and Foucaultbeing set to help in getting ready the ground tackle."Half an hour later Parratt saw the mate stand on the rail and leanoutboard, holding on to the mizzen-shrouds while he stared along theship's side. Then he jumped on to the deck and shouted angrily:'Forward, there! What the deuce is that man up to under the starboardcat-head?'"The men on the forecastle rushed to the side and looked over; two ofthem leaned over the rail with the bight of a rope between them, and athird came running aft to the mate. 'It's Foucault, sir,' Parratt heardhim say. 'He's hanged hisself from the cat-head.'"As soon as he was off duty, Parratt made his way to his dead comrade'schest, and, opening it with his pick-lock, took out the pearl. It wasnow his sole property, and, as the ship was within an hour or two of herdestination, he thought he had little to fear from its murdered owner.As soon as the vessel was alongside the wharf, he would slip ashore andget rid of the jewel, even if he sold it at a comparatively low price.The thing looked perfectly simple."In actual practice, however, it turned out quite otherwise. He beganby accosting a well-dressed stranger and offering the pendant for fiftypounds; but the only reply that he got was a knowing smile and a shakeof the head. When this experience had been repeated a dozen times ormore, and he had been followed up and down the streets for nearly anhour by a suspicious gendarme, he began to grow anxious. He visitedquite a number of ships and yachts in the harbour, and at each refusalthe price of his treasure came down, until he was eager to sell it for afew francs. But still no one would have it. Everyone took it for grantedthat the pearl was a sham, and most of the persons whom he accostedassumed that it had been stolen. The position was getting desperate.Evening was approaching--the time of the dreaded dog-watches--and stillthe pearl was in his possession. Gladly would he now have given it awayfor nothing, but he dared not try, for this would lay him open to thestrongest suspicion."At last, in a by-street, he came upon the shop of a curio-dealer.Putting on a careless and cheerful manner, he entered and offered thependant for ten francs. The dealer looked at it, shook his head, andhanded it back."'What will you give me for it?' demanded Parratt, breaking out into acold sweat at the prospect of a final refusal."The dealer felt in his pocket, drew out a couple of francs, and heldthem out."'Very well,' said Parratt. He took the money as calmly as he could, andmarched out of the shop, with a gasp of relief, leaving the pendant inthe dealer's hand."The jewel was hung up in a glass case, and nothing more was thoughtabout it until some ten days later, when an English tourist, who cameinto the shop, noticed it and took a liking to it. Thereupon the dealeroffered it to him for five pounds, assuring him that it was a genuinepearl, a statement that, to his amazement, the stranger evidentlybelieved. He was then deeply afflicted at not having asked a higherprice, but the bargain had been struck, and the Englishman went off withhis purchase."This was the story told by Captain Raggerton's friend, and I have givenit to you in full detail, having read the manuscript over many timessince it was given to me. No doubt you will regard it as a meretraveller's tale, and consider me a superstitious idiot for giving anycredence to it.""It certainly seems more remarkable for picturesqueness than forcredibility," Thorndyke agreed. "May I ask," he continued, "whetherCaptain Raggerton's friend gave any explanation as to how this singularstory came to his knowledge, or to that of anybody else?""Oh yes," replied Calverley; "I forgot to mention that the seaman,Parratt, very shortly after he had sold the pearl, fell down the hatchinto the hold as the ship was unloading, and was very badly injured. Hewas taken to the hospital, where he died on the following day; and itwas while he was lying there in a dying condition that he confessed tothe murder, and gave this circumstantial account of it.""I see," said Thorndyke; "and I understand that you accept the story asliterally true?""Undoubtedly." Calverley flushed defiantly as he returned Thorndyke'slook, and continued: "You see, I am not a man of science: therefore mybeliefs are not limited to things that can be weighed and measured.There are things, Dr. Thorndyke, which are outside the range of our punyintellects; things that science, with its arrogant materialism, putsaside and ignores with close-shut eyes. I prefer to believe in thingswhich obviously exist, even though I cannot explain them. It is thehumbler and, I think, the wiser attitude.""But, my dear Fred," protested Mr. Brodribb, "this is a rankfairy-tale."Calverley turned upon the solicitor. "If you had seen what I have seen,you would not only believe: you would _know_.""Tell us what you have seen, then," said Mr. Brodribb."I will, if you wish to hear it," said Calverley. "I will continue thestrange history of the Mandarin's Pearl."He lit a fresh cigarette and continued:"The night I came to Beech-hurst--that is my cousin's house, you know--arather absurd thing happened, which I mention on account of itsconnection with what has followed. I had gone to my room early, and satfor some time writing letters before getting ready for bed. When I hadfinished my letters, I started on a tour of inspection of my room. I wasthen, you must remember, in a very nervous state, and it had become myhabit to examine the room in which I was to sleep before undressing,looking under the bed, and in any cupboards and closets that therehappened to be. Now, on looking round my new room, I perceived thatthere was a second door, and I at once proceeded to open it to see whereit led to. As soon as I opened the door, I got a terrible start. Ifound myself looking into a narrow closet or passage, lined with pegs,on which the servant had hung some of my clothes; at the farther end wasanother door, and, as I stood looking into the closet, I observed, withstartled amazement, a man standing holding the door half-open, andsilently regarding me. I stood for a moment staring at him, with myheart thumping and my limbs all of a tremble; then I slammed the doorand ran off to look for my cousin."He was in the billiard-room with Raggerton, and the pair looked upsharply as I entered."'Alfred,' I said, 'where does that passage lead to out of my room?'"'Lead to?' said he. 'Why, it doesn't lead anywhere. It used to openinto a cross corridor, but when the house was altered, the corridor wasdone away with, and this passage closed up. It is only a cupboard now.'"'Well, there's a man in it--or there was just now.'"'Nonsense!' he exclaimed; 'impossible! Let us go and look at theplace.'"He and Raggerton rose, and we went together to my room. As we flungopen the door of the closet and looked in, we all three burst into alaugh. There were three men now looking at us from the open door at theother end, and the mystery was solved. A large mirror had been placed atthe end of the closet to cover the partition which cut it off from thecross corridor."This incident naturally exposed me to a good deal of chaff from mycousin and Captain Raggerton; but I often wished that the mirror had notbeen placed there, for it happened over and over again that, going tothe cupboard hurriedly, and not thinking of the mirror, I got quite abad shock on being confronted by a figure apparently coming straight atme through an open door. In fact, it annoyed me so much, in my nervousstate, that I even thought of asking my cousin to give me a differentroom; but, happening to refer to the matter when talking to Raggerton, Ifound the Captain so scornful of my cowardice that my pride was touched,and I let the affair drop.[Illustration: THE APPARITION IN THE MIRROR]"And now I come to a very strange occurrence, which I shall relate quitefrankly, although I know beforehand that you will set me down as a liaror a lunatic. I had been away from home for a fortnight, and as Ireturned rather late at night, I went straight to my room. Having partlyundressed, I took my clothes in one hand and a candle in the other, andopened the cupboard door. I stood for a moment looking nervously at mydouble, standing, candle in hand, looking at me through the open door atthe other end of the passage; then I entered, and, setting the candle ona shelf, proceeded to hang up my clothes. I had hung them up, and hadjust reached up for the candle, when my eye was caught by somethingstrange in the mirror. It no longer reflected the candle in my hand, butinstead of it, a large coloured paper lantern. I stood petrified withastonishment, and gazed into the mirror; and then I saw that my ownreflection was changed, too; that, in place of my own figure, was thatof an elderly Chinaman, who stood regarding me with stony calm."I must have stood for near upon a minute, unable to move and scarceable to breathe, face to face with that awful figure. At length I turnedto escape, and, as I turned, he turned also, and I could see him, overmy shoulder, hurrying away. As I reached the door, I halted for amoment, looking back with the door in my hand, holding the candle abovemy head; and even so _he_ halted, looking back at me, with his hand uponthe door and his lantern held above his head."I was so much upset that I could not go to bed for some hours, butcontinued to pace the room, in spite of my fatigue. Now and again I wasimpelled, irresistibly, to peer into the cupboard, but nothing was to beseen in the mirror save my own figure, candle in hand, peeping in at methrough the half-open door. And each time that I looked into my ownwhite, horror-stricken face, I shut the door hastily and turned awaywith a shudder; for the pegs, with the clothes hanging on them, seemedto call to me. I went to bed at last, and before I fell asleep I formedthe resolution that, if I was spared until the next day, I would writeto the British Consul at Canton, and offer to restore the pearl to therelatives of the murdered mandarin."On the following day I wrote and despatched the letter, after which Ifelt more composed, though I was haunted continually by the recollectionof that stony, impassive figure; and from time to time I felt anirresistible impulse to go and look in at the door of the closet, at themirror and the pegs with the clothes hanging from them. I told my cousinof the visitation that I had received, but he merely laughed, and wasfrankly incredulous; while the Captain bluntly advised me not to be asuperstitious donkey."For some days after this I was left in peace, and began to hope that myletter had appeased the spirit of the murdered man; but on the fifthday, about six o'clock in the evening, happening to want some papersthat I had left in the pocket of a coat which was hanging in thecloset, I went in to get them. I took in no candle, as it was not yetdark, but left the door wide open to light me. The coat that I wantedwas near the end of the closet, not more than four paces from themirror, and as I went towards it I watched my reflection rathernervously as it advanced to meet me. I found my coat, and as I felt forthe papers, I still kept a suspicious eye on my double. And, even as Ilooked, a most strange phenomenon appeared: the mirror seemed for aninstant to darken or cloud over, and then, as it cleared again, I saw,standing dark against the light of the open door behind him, the figureof the mandarin. After a single glance, I ran out of the closet, shakingwith agitation; but as I turned to shut the door, I noticed that it wasmy own figure that was reflected in the glass. The Chinaman had vanishedin an instant."It now became evident that my letter had not served its purpose, and Iwas plunged in despair; the more so since, on this day, I felt again thedreadful impulse to go and look at the pegs on the walls of the closet.There was no mistaking the meaning of that impulse, and each time that Iwent, I dragged myself away reluctantly, though shivering with horror.One circumstance, indeed, encouraged me a little; the mandarin had not,on either occasion, beckoned to me as he had done to the sailors, sothat perhaps some way of escape yet lay open to me."During the next few days I considered very earnestly what measures Icould take to avert the doom that seemed to be hanging over me. Thesimplest plan, that of passing the pearl on to some other person, wasout of the question; it would be nothing short of murder. On the otherhand, I could not wait for an answer to my letter; for even if Iremained alive, I felt that my reason would have given way long beforethe reply reached me. But while I was debating what I should do, themandarin appeared to me again; and then, after an interval of only twodays, he came to me once more. That was last night. I remained gazing athim, fascinated, with my flesh creeping, as he stood, lantern in hand,looking steadily in my face. At last he held out his hand to me, as ifasking me to give him the pearl; then the mirror darkened, and hevanished in a flash; and in the place where he had stood there was myown reflection looking at me out of the glass."That last visitation decided me. When I left home this morning thepearl was in my pocket, and as I came over Waterloo Bridge, I leanedover the parapet and flung the thing into the water. After that I feltquite relieved for a time; I had shaken the accursed thing off withoutinvolving anyone in the curse that it carried. But presently I began tofeel fresh misgivings, and the conviction has been growing upon me allday that I have done the wrong thing. I have only placed it for everbeyond the reach of its owner, whereas I ought to have burnt it, afterthe Chinese fashion, so that its non-material essence could have joinedthe spiritual body of him to whom it had belonged when both were clothedwith material substance."But it can't be altered now. For good or for evil, the thing is done,and God alone knows what the end of it will be."As he concluded, Calverley uttered a deep sigh, and covered his facewith his slender, delicate hands. For a space we were all silent and, Ithink, deeply moved; for, grotesquely unreal as the whole thing was,there was a pathos, and even a tragedy, in it that we all felt to bevery real indeed.Suddenly Mr. Brodribb started and looked at his watch."Good gracious, Calverley, we shall lose our train."The young man pulled himself together and stood up. "We shall just do itif we go at once," said he. "Good-bye," he added, shaking Thorndyke'shand and mine. "You have been very patient, and I have been ratherprosy, I am afraid. Come along, Mr. Brodribb."Thorndyke and I followed them out on to the landing, and I heard mycolleague say to the solicitor in a low tone, but very earnestly: "Gethim away from that house, Brodribb, and don't let him out of your sightfor a moment."I did not catch the solicitor's reply, if he made any, but when we wereback in our room I noticed that Thorndyke was more agitated than I hadever seen him."I ought not to have let them go," he exclaimed. "Confound me! If I hadhad a grain of wit, I should have made them lose their train."He lit his pipe and fell to pacing the room with long strides, his eyesbent on the floor with an expression sternly reflective. At last,finding him hopelessly taciturn, I knocked out my pipe and went to bed.       *       *       *       *       *As I was dressing on the following morning, Thorndyke entered my room.His face was grave even to sternness, and he held a telegram in hishand."I am going to Weybridge this morning," he said shortly, holding the"flimsy" out to me. "Shall you come?"I took the paper from him, and read:     "Come, for God's sake! F. C. is dead. You will     understand.--BRODRIBB."I handed him back the telegram, too much shocked for a moment to speak.The whole dreadful tragedy summed up in that curt message rose before mein an instant, and a wave of deep pity swept over me at this miserableend to the sad, empty life."What an awful thing, Thorndyke!" I exclaimed at length. "To be killedby a mere grotesque delusion.""Do you think so?" he asked dryly. "Well, we shall see; but you willcome?""Yes," I replied; and as he retired, I proceeded hurriedly to finishdressing.Half an hour later, as we rose from a rapid breakfast, Polton came intothe room, carrying a small roll-up case of tools and a bunch of skeletonkeys."Will you have them in a bag, sir?" he asked."No," replied Thorndyke; "in my overcoat pocket. Oh, and here is a note,Polton, which I want you to take round to Scotland Yard. It is to theAssistant Commissioner, and you are to make sure that it is in the righthands before you leave. And here is a telegram to Mr. Brodribb."He dropped the keys and the tool-case into his pocket, and we went downtogether to the waiting hansom.At Weybridge Station we found Mr. Brodribb pacing the platform in astate of extreme dejection. He brightened up somewhat when he saw us,and wrung our hands with emotional heartiness."It was very good of you both to come at a moment's notice," he saidwarmly, "and I feel your kindness very much. You understood, of course,Thorndyke?""Yes," Thorndyke replied. "I suppose the mandarin beckoned to him."Mr. Brodribb turned with a look of surprise. "How did you guess that?"he asked; and then, without waiting for a reply, he took from his pocketa note, which he handed to my colleague. "The poor old fellow left thisfor me," he said. "The servant found it on his dressing-table."Thorndyke glanced through the note and passed it to me. It consisted ofbut a few words, hurriedly written in a tremulous hand.     "He has beckoned to me, and I must go. Good-bye, dear old friend.""How does his cousin take the matter?" asked Thorndyke."He doesn't know of it yet," replied the lawyer. "Alfred and Raggertonwent out after an early breakfast, to cycle over to Guildford on somebusiness or other, and they have not returned yet. The catastrophe wasdiscovered soon after they left. The maid went to his room with a cup oftea, and was astonished to find that his bed had not been slept in. Sheran down in alarm and reported to the butler, who went up at once andsearched the room; but he could find no trace of the missing one, exceptmy note, until it occurred to him to look in the cupboard. As he openedthe door he got rather a start from his own reflection in the mirror;and then he saw poor Fred hanging from one of the pegs near the end ofthe closet, close to the glass. It's a melancholy affair--but here isthe house, and here is the butler waiting for us. Mr. Alfred is not backyet, then, Stevens?""No, sir." The white-faced, frightened-looking man had evidently beenwaiting at the gate from distaste of the house, and he now walked backwith manifest relief at our arrival. When we entered the house, heushered us without remark up on to the first-floor, and, preceding usalong a corridor, halted near the end. "That's the room, sir," said he;and without another word he turned and went down the stairs.We entered the room, and Mr. Brodribb followed on tiptoe, looking abouthim fearfully, and casting awe-struck glances at the shrouded form onthe bed. To the latter Thorndyke advanced, and gently drew back thesheet."You'd better not look, Brodribb," said he, as he bent over the corpse.He felt the limbs and examined the cord, which still remained round theneck, its raggedly-severed end testifying to the terror of the servantswho had cut down the body. Then he replaced the sheet and looked at hiswatch. "It happened at about three o'clock in the morning," said he. "Hemust have struggled with the impulse for some time, poor fellow! Now letus look at the cupboard."We went together to a door in the corner of the room, and, as we openedit, we were confronted by three figures, apparently looking in at usthrough an open door at the other end."It is really rather startling," said the lawyer, in a subdued voice,looking almost apprehensively at the three figures that advanced to meetus. "The poor lad ought never to have been here."It was certainly an eerie place, and I could not but feel, as we walkeddown the dark, narrow passage, with those other three dimly-seen figuressilently coming towards us, and mimicking our every gesture, that it wasno place for a nervous, superstitious man like poor Fred Calverley.Close to the end of the long row of pegs was one from which hung an endof stout box-cord, and to this Mr. Brodribb pointed with an awe-struckgesture. But Thorndyke gave it only a brief glance, and then walked upto the mirror, which he proceeded to examine minutely. It was a verylarge glass, nearly seven feet high, extending the full width of thecloset, and reaching to within a foot of the floor; and it seemed tohave been let into the partition from behind, for, both above and below,the woodwork was in front of it. While I was making these observations,I watched Thorndyke with no little curiosity. First he rapped hisknuckles on the glass; then he lighted a wax match, and, holding itclose to the mirror, carefully watched the reflection of the flame.Finally, laying his cheek on the glass, he held the match at arm'slength, still close to the mirror, and looked at the reflection alongthe surface. Then he blew out the match and walked back into the room,shutting the cupboard door as we emerged."I think," said he, "that as we shall all undoubtedly be subpoenaed bythe coroner, it would be well to put together a few notes of the facts.I see there is a writing-table by the window, and I would propose thatyou, Brodribb, just jot down a _precis_ of the statement that you heardlast night, while Jervis notes down the exact condition of the body.While you are doing this, I will take a look round.""We might find a more cheerful place to write in," grumbled Mr.Brodribb; "however--"Without finishing the sentence, he sat down at the table, and, havingfound some sermon paper, dipped a pen in the ink by way of encouraginghis thoughts. At this moment Thorndyke quietly slipped out of the room,and I proceeded to make a detailed examination of the body: in whichoccupation I was interrupted at intervals by requests from the lawyerthat I should refresh his memory.We had been occupied thus for about a quarter of an hour, when a quickstep was heard outside, the door was opened abruptly, and a man burstinto the room. Brodribb rose and held out his hand."This is a sad home-coming for you, Alfred," said he."Yes, my God!" the newcomer exclaimed. "It's awful."He looked askance at the corpse on the bed, and wiped his forehead withhis handkerchief. Alfred Calverley was not extremely prepossessing. Likehis cousin, he was obviously neurotic, but there were signs ofdissipation in his face, which, just now, was pale and ghastly, and worean expression of abject fear. Moreover, his entrance was accompanied bythat of a perceptible odour of brandy.He had walked over, without noticing me, to the writing-table, and as hestood there, talking in subdued tones with the lawyer, I suddenly foundThorndyke at my side. He had stolen in noiselessly through the door thatCalverley had left open."Show him Brodribb's note," he whispered, "and then make him go in andlook at the peg."With this mysterious request, he slipped out of the room as silently ashe had come, unperceived either by Calverley or the lawyer."Has Captain Raggerton returned with you?" Brodribb was inquiring."No, he has gone into the town," was the reply; "but he won't be long.This will be a frightful shock to him."At this point I stepped forward. "Have you shown Mr. Calverley theextraordinary letter that the deceased left for you?" I asked."What letter was that?" demanded Calverley, with a start.Mr. Brodribb drew forth the note and handed it to him. As he read itthrough, Calverley turned white to the lips, and the paper trembled inhis hand."'He has beckoned to me, and I must go,'" he read. Then, with a furtiveglance at the lawyer: "Who had beckoned? What did he mean?"Mr. Brodribb briefly explained the meaning of the allusion, adding: "Ithought you knew all about it.""Yes, yes," said Calverley, with some confusion; "I remember the matternow you mention it. But it's all so dreadful and bewildering."At this point I again interposed. "There is a question," I said, "thatmay be of some importance. It refers to the cord with which the poorfellow hanged himself. Can you identify that cord, Mr. Calverley?""I!" he exclaimed, staring at me, and wiping the sweat from his whiteface; "how should I? Where is the cord?""Part of it is still hanging from the peg in the closet. Would you mindlooking at it?""If you would very kindly fetch it--you know I--er--naturally--have a--""It must not be disturbed before the inquest," said I; "but surely youare not afraid--""I didn't say I was afraid," he retorted angrily. "Why should I be?"With a strange, tremulous swagger, he strode across to the closet, flungopen the door, and plunged in.A moment later we heard a shout of horror, and he rushed out, livid andgasping."What is it, Calverley?" exclaimed Mr. Brodribb, starting up in alarm.But Calverley was incapable of speech. Dropping limply into a chair, hegazed at us for a while in silent terror; then he fell back uttering awild shriek of laughter.Mr. Brodribb looked at him in amazement. "What is it, Calverley?" heasked again.As no answer was forthcoming, he stepped across to the open door of thecloset and entered, peering curiously before him. Then he, too, uttereda startled exclamation, and backed out hurriedly, looking pale andflurried."Bless my soul!" he ejaculated. "Is the place bewitched?"He sat down heavily and stared at Calverley, who was still shaking withhysteric laughter; while I, now consumed with curiosity, walked over tothe closet to discover the cause of their singular behaviour. As I flungopen the door, which the lawyer had closed, I must confess to being veryconsiderably startled; for though the reflection of the open door wasplain enough in the mirror, my own reflection was replaced by that of aChinaman. After a momentary pause of astonishment, I entered the closetand walked towards the mirror; and simultaneously the figure of theChinaman entered and walked towards me. I had advanced more than halfwaydown the closet when suddenly the mirror darkened; there was a whirlingflash, the Chinaman vanished in an instant, and, as I reached the glass,my own reflection faced me.I turned back into the room pretty completely enlightened, and looked atCalverley with a new-born distaste. He still sat facing the bewilderedlawyer, one moment sobbing convulsively, the next yelping with hystericlaughter. He was not an agreeable spectacle, and when, a few momentslater, Thorndyke entered the room, and halted by the door with a stareof disgust, I was moved to join him. But at this juncture a man pushedpast Thorndyke, and, striding up to Calverley, shook him roughly by thearm."Stop that row!" he exclaimed furiously. "Do you hear? Stop it!""I can't help it, Raggerton," gasped Calverley. "He gave me such aturn--the mandarin, you know.""What!" ejaculated Raggerton.He dashed across to the closet, looked in, and turned upon Calverleywith a snarl. Then he walked out of the room."Brodribb," said Thorndyke, "I should like to have a word with you andJervis outside." Then, as we followed him out on to the landing, hecontinued: "I have something rather interesting to show you. It is inhere."He softly opened an adjoining door, and we looked into a smallunfurnished room. A projecting closet occupied one side of it, and atthe door of the closet stood Captain Raggerton, with his hand upon thekey. He turned upon us fiercely, though with a look of alarm, anddemanded:"What is the meaning of this intrusion? and who the deuce are you? Doyou know that this is my private room?""I suspected that it was," Thorndyke replied quietly. "Those will beyour properties in the closet, then?"Raggerton turned pale, but continued to bluster. "Do I understand thatyou have dared to break into my private closet?" he demanded."I have inspected it," replied Thorndyke, "and I may remark that it isuseless to wrench at that key, because I have hampered the lock.""The devil you have!" shouted Raggerton."Yes; you see, I am expecting a police-officer with a search warrant, soI wished to keep everything intact."Raggerton turned livid with mingled fear and rage. He stalked up toThorndyke with a threatening air, but, suddenly altering his mind,exclaimed, "I must see to this!" and flung out of the room.Thorndyke took a key from his pocket, and, having locked the door,turned to the closet. Having taken out the key to unhamper the lock witha stout wire, he reinserted it and unlocked the door. As we entered, wefound ourselves in a narrow closet, similar to the one in the otherroom, but darker, owing to the absence of a mirror. A few clothes hungfrom the pegs, and when Thorndyke had lit a candle that stood on ashelf, we could see more of the details."Here are some of the properties," said Thorndyke. He pointed to a pegfrom which hung a long, blue silk gown of Chinese make, a mandarin'scap, with a pigtail attached to it, and a beautifully-made papier-machemask. "Observe," said Thorndyke, taking the latter down and exhibiting alabel on the inside, marked "Renouard a Paris," "no trouble has beenspared."He took off his coat, slipped on the gown, the mask, and the cap, andwas, in a moment, in that dim light, transformed into the perfectsemblance of a Chinaman."By taking a little more time," he remarked, pointing to a pair ofChinese shoes and a large paper lantern, "the make-up could be renderedmore complete; but this seems to have answered for our friend Alfred.""But," said Mr. Brodribb, as Thorndyke shed the disguise, "still, Idon't understand--""I will make it clear to you in a moment," said Thorndyke. He walked tothe end of the closet, and, tapping the right-hand wall, said: "This isthe back of the mirror. You see that it is hung on massive well-oiledhinges, and is supported on this large, rubber-tyred castor, whichevidently has ball bearings. You observe three black cords running alongthe wall, and passing through those pulleys above. Now, when I pull thiscord, notice what happens."He pulled one cord firmly, and immediately the mirror swung noiselesslyinwards on its great castor, until it stood diagonally across thecloset, where it was stopped by a rubber buffer."Bless my soul!" exclaimed Mr. Brodribb. "What an extraordinary thing!"The effect was certainly very strange, for, the mirror being now exactlydiagonal to the two closets they appeared to be a single, continuouspassage, with a door at either end. On going up to the mirror, we foundthat the opening which it had occupied was filled by a sheet of plainglass, evidently placed there as a precaution to prevent any person fromwalking through from one closet into the other, and so discovering thetrick."It's all very puzzling," said Mr. Brodribb; "I don't clearly understandit now.""Let us finish here," replied Thorndyke, "and then I will explain.Notice this black curtain. When I pull the second cord, it slides acrossthe closet and cuts off the light. The mirror now reflects nothing intothe other closet; it simply appears dark. And now I pull the thirdcord."He did so, and the mirror swung noiselessly back into its place."There is only one other thing to observe before we go out," saidThorndyke, "and that is this other mirror standing with its face to thewall. This, of course, is the one that Fred Calverley originally saw atthe end of the closet; it has since been removed, and the largerswinging glass put in its place. And now," he continued, when we cameout into the room, "let me explain the mechanism in detail. It wasobvious to me, when I heard poor Fred Calverley's story, that the mirrorwas 'faked,' and I drew a diagram of the probable arrangement, whichturns out to be correct. Here it is." He took a sheet of paper from hispocket and handed it to the lawyer. "There are two sketches. Sketch 1shows the mirror in its ordinary position, closing the end of thecloset. A person standing at A, of course, sees his reflection facinghim at, apparently, A 1. Sketch 2 shows the mirror swung across. Now aperson standing at A does not see his own reflection at all; but if someother person is standing in the other closet at B, A sees the reflectionof B apparently at B 1--that is, in the identical position that his ownreflection occupied when the mirror was straight across.""I see now," said Brodribb; "but who set up this apparatus, and why wasit done?""Let me ask you a question," said Thorndyke. "Is Alfred Calverley thenext-of-kin?""No; there is Fred's younger brother. But I may say that Fred has madea will quite recently very much in Alfred's favour.""There is the explanation, then," said Thorndyke. "These two scoundrelshave conspired to drive the poor fellow to suicide, and Raggerton wasclearly the leading spirit. He was evidently concocting some story withwhich to work on poor Fred's superstitions when the mention of theChinaman on the steamer gave him his cue. He then invented the verypicturesque story of the murdered mandarin and the stolen pearl. Youremember that these 'visitations' did not begin until after that storyhad been told, and Fred had been absent from the house on a visit.Evidently, during his absence, Raggerton took down the original mirror,and substituted this swinging arrangement; and at the same time procuredthe Chinaman's dress and mask from the theatrical property dealers. Nodoubt he reckoned on being able quietly to remove the swinging glass andother properties and replace the original mirror before the inquest.""By God!" exclaimed Mr. Brodribb, "it's the most infamous, cowardly plotI have ever heard of. They shall go to gaol for it, the villains, assure as I am alive."But in this Mr. Brodribb was mistaken; for immediately on findingthemselves detected, the two conspirators had left the house, and bynightfall were safely across the Channel; and the only satisfaction thatthe lawyer obtained was the setting aside of the will on facts disclosedat the inquest.As to Thorndyke, he has never to this day forgiven himself for havingallowed Fred Calverley to go home to his death.VIITHE ALUMINIUM DAGGERThe "urgent call"--the instant, peremptory summons to professionalduty--is an experience that appertains to the medical rather than thelegal practitioner, and I had supposed, when I abandoned the clinicalside of my profession in favour of the forensic, that henceforth Ishould know it no more; that the interrupted meal, the broken leisure,and the jangle of the night-bell, were things of the past; but inpractice it was otherwise. The medical jurist is, so to speak, on theborderland of the two professions, and exposed to the vicissitudes ofeach calling, and so it happened from time to time that the professionalservices of my colleague or myself were demanded at a moment's notice.And thus it was in the case that I am about to relate.The sacred rite of the "tub" had been duly performed, and thefreshly-dried person of the present narrator was about to be insinuatedinto the first instalment of clothing, when a hurried step was heardupon the stair, and the voice of our laboratory assistant, Polton, aroseat my colleague's door."There's a gentleman downstairs, sir, who says he must see you instantlyon most urgent business. He seems to be in a rare twitter, sir--"Polton was proceeding to descriptive particulars, when a second andmore hurried step became audible, and a strange voice addressedThorndyke."I have come to beg your immediate assistance, sir; a most dreadfulthing has happened. A horrible murder has been committed. Can you comewith me now?""I will be with you almost immediately," said Thorndyke. "Is the victimquite dead?""Quite. Cold and stiff. The police think--""Do the police know that you have come for me?" interrupted Thorndyke."Yes. Nothing is to be done until you arrive.""Very well. I will be ready in a few minutes.""And if you would wait downstairs, sir," Polton added persuasively, "Icould help the doctor to get ready."With this crafty appeal, he lured the intruder back to the sitting-room,and shortly after stole softly up the stairs with a small breakfasttray, the contents of which he deposited firmly in our respective rooms,with a few timely words on the folly of "undertaking murders on an emptystomach." Thorndyke and I had meanwhile clothed ourselves with acelerity known only to medical practitioners and quick-change artists,and in a few minutes descended the stairs together, calling in at thelaboratory for a few appliances that Thorndyke usually took with him ona visit of investigation.As we entered the sitting-room, our visitor, who was feverishly pacingup and down, seized his hat with a gasp of relief. "You are ready tocome?" he asked. "My carriage is at the door;" and, without waiting foran answer, he hurried out, and rapidly preceded us down the stairs.The carriage was a roomy brougham, which fortunately accommodated thethree of us, and as soon as we had entered and shut the door, thecoachman whipped up his horse and drove off at a smart trot."I had better give you some account of the circumstances, as we go,"said our agitated friend. "In the first place, my name is Curtis, HenryCurtis; here is my card. Ah! and here is another card, which I shouldhave given you before. My solicitor, Mr. Marchmont, was with me when Imade this dreadful discovery, and he sent me to you. He remained in therooms to see that nothing is disturbed until you arrive.""That was wise of him," said Thorndyke. "But now tell us exactly whathas occurred.""I will," said Mr. Curtis. "The murdered man was my brother-in-law,Alfred Hartridge, and I am sorry to say he was--well, he was a bad man.It grieves me to speak of him thus--_de mortuis_, you know--but, still,we must deal with the facts, even though they be painful.""Undoubtedly," agreed Thorndyke."I have had a great deal of very unpleasant correspondence withhim--Marchmont will tell you about that--and yesterday I left a note forhim, asking for an interview, to settle the business, naming eighto'clock this morning as the hour, because I had to leave town beforenoon. He replied, in a very singular letter, that he would see me atthat hour, and Mr. Marchmont very kindly consented to accompany me.Accordingly, we went to his chambers together this morning, arrivingpunctually at eight o'clock. We rang the bell several times, and knockedloudly at the door, but as there was no response, we went down andspoke to the hall-porter. This man, it seems, had already noticed, fromthe courtyard, that the electric lights were full on in Mr. Hartridge'ssitting-room, as they had been all night, according to the statement ofthe night-porter; so now, suspecting that something was wrong, he cameup with us, and rang the bell and battered at the door. Then, as therewas still no sign of life within, he inserted his duplicate key andtried to open the door--unsuccessfully, however, as it proved to bebolted on the inside. Thereupon the porter fetched a constable, and,after a consultation, we decided that we were justified in breaking openthe door; the porter produced a crowbar, and by our unified efforts thedoor was eventually burst open. We entered, and--my God! Dr. Thorndyke,what a terrible sight it was that met our eyes! My brother-in-law waslying dead on the floor of the sitting-room. He had beenstabbed--stabbed to death; and the dagger had not even been withdrawn.It was still sticking out of his back."He mopped his face with his handkerchief, and was about to continue hisaccount of the catastrophe when the carriage entered a quiet side-streetbetween Westminster and Victoria, and drew up before a block of tall,new, red-brick buildings. A flurried hall-porter ran out to open thedoor, and we alighted opposite the main entrance."My brother-in-law's chambers are on the second-floor," said Mr. Curtis."We can go up in the lift."The porter had hurried before us, and already stood with his hand uponthe rope. We entered the lift, and in a few seconds were discharged onto the second floor, the porter, with furtive curiosity, following usdown the corridor. At the end of the passage was a half-open door,considerably battered and bruised. Above the door, painted in whitelettering, was the inscription, "Mr. Hartridge"; and through the doorwayprotruded the rather foxy countenance of Inspector Badger."I am glad you have come, sir," said he, as he recognized my colleague."Mr. Marchmont is sitting inside like a watch-dog, and he growls if anyof us even walks across the room."The words formed a complaint, but there was a certain geniality in thespeaker's manner which made me suspect that Inspector Badger was alreadynavigating his craft on a lee shore.We entered a small lobby or hall, and from thence passed into thesitting-room, where we found Mr. Marchmont keeping his vigil, in companywith a constable and a uniformed inspector. The three rose softly as weentered, and greeted us in a whisper; and then, with one accord, we alllooked towards the other end of the room, and so remained for a timewithout speaking.There was, in the entire aspect of the room, something very grim anddreadful. An atmosphere of tragic mystery enveloped the most commonplaceobjects; and sinister suggestions lurked in the most familiarappearances. Especially impressive was the air of suspense--of ordinary,every-day life suddenly arrested--cut short in the twinkling of an eye.The electric lamps, still burning dim and red, though the summersunshine streamed in through the windows; the half-emptied tumbler andopen book by the empty chair, had each its whispered message of swiftand sudden disaster, as had the hushed voices and stealthy movements ofthe waiting men, and, above all, an awesome shape that was but a fewhours since a living man, and that now sprawled, prone and motionless,on the floor."This is a mysterious affair," observed Inspector Badger, breaking thesilence at length, "though it is clear enough up to a certain point. Thebody tells its own story."We stepped across and looked down at the corpse. It was that of asomewhat elderly man, and lay, on an open space of floor before thefireplace, face downwards, with the arms extended. The slender hilt of adagger projected from the back below the left shoulder, and, with theexception of a trace of blood upon the lips, this was the onlyindication of the mode of death. A little way from the body a clock-keylay on the carpet, and, glancing up at the clock on the mantelpiece, Iperceived that the glass front was open."You see," pursued the inspector, noting my glance, "he was standing infront of the fireplace, winding the clock. Then the murderer stole upbehind him--the noise of the turning key must have covered hismovements--and stabbed him. And you see, from the position of the daggeron the left side of the back, that the murderer must have beenleft-handed. That is all clear enough. What is not clear is how he gotin, and how he got out again.""The body has not been moved, I suppose," said Thorndyke."No. We sent for Dr. Egerton, the police-surgeon, and he certified thatthe man was dead. He will be back presently to see you and arrange aboutthe post-mortem.""Then," said Thorndyke, "we will not disturb the body till he comes,except to take the temperature and dust the dagger-hilt."He took from his bag a long, registering chemical thermometer and aninsufflator or powder-blower. The former he introduced under the deadman's clothing against the abdomen, and with the latter blew a stream offine yellow powder on to the black leather handle of the dagger.Inspector Badger stooped eagerly to examine the handle, as Thorndykeblew away the powder that had settled evenly on the surface."No finger-prints," said he, in a disappointed tone. "He must have worngloves. But that inscription gives a pretty broad hint."He pointed, as he spoke, to the metal guard of the dagger, on which wasengraved, in clumsy lettering, the single word, "TRADITORE.""That's the Italian for 'traitor,'" continued the inspector, "and I gotsome information from the porter that fits in with that suggestion.We'll have him in presently, and you shall hear.""Meanwhile," said Thorndyke, "as the position of the body may be ofimportance in the inquiry, I will take one or two photographs and make arough plan to scale. Nothing has been moved, you say? Who opened thewindows?""They were open when we came in," said Mr. Marchmont. "Last night wasvery hot, you remember. Nothing whatever has been moved."Thorndyke produced from his bag a small folding camera, a telescopictripod, a surveyor's measuring-tape, a boxwood scale, and asketch-block. He set up the camera in a corner, and exposed a plate,taking a general view of the room, and including the corpse. Then hemoved to the door and made a second exposure."Will you stand in front of the clock, Jervis," he said, "and raiseyour hand as if winding it? Thanks; keep like that while I expose aplate."I remained thus, in the position that the dead man was assumed to haveoccupied at the moment of the murder, while the plate was exposed, andthen, before I moved, Thorndyke marked the position of my feet with ablackboard chalk. He next set up the tripod over the chalk marks, andtook two photographs from that position, and finally photographed thebody itself.The photographic operations being concluded, he next proceeded, withremarkable skill and rapidity, to lay out on the sketch-block aground-plan of the room, showing the exact position of the variousobjects, on a scale of a quarter of an inch to the foot--a process thatthe inspector was inclined to view with some impatience."You don't spare trouble, Doctor," he remarked; "nor time either," headded, with a significant glance at his watch."No," answered Thorndyke, as he detached the finished sketch from theblock; "I try to collect all the facts that may bear on a case. They mayprove worthless, or they may turn out of vital importance; one neverknows beforehand, so I collect them all. But here, I think, is Dr.Egerton."The police-surgeon greeted Thorndyke with respectful cordiality, and weproceeded at once to the examination of the body. Drawing out thethermometer, my colleague noted the reading, and passed the instrumentto Dr. Egerton."Dead about ten hours," remarked the latter, after a glance at it. "Thiswas a very determined and mysterious murder.""Very," said Thorndyke. "Feel that dagger, Jervis."I touched the hilt, and felt the characteristic grating of bone."It is through the edge of a rib!" I exclaimed."Yes; it must have been used with extraordinary force. And you noticethat the clothing is screwed up slightly, as if the blade had beenrotated as it was driven in. That is a very peculiar feature, especiallywhen taken together with the violence of the blow.""It is singular, certainly," said Dr. Egerton, "though I don't know thatit helps us much. Shall we withdraw the dagger before moving the body?""Certainly," replied Thorndyke, "or the movement may produce freshinjuries. But wait." He took a piece of string from his pocket, and,having drawn the dagger out a couple of inches, stretched the string ina line parallel to the flat of the blade. Then, giving me the ends tohold, he drew the weapon out completely. As the blade emerged, the twistin the clothing disappeared. "Observe," said he, "that the string givesthe direction of the wound, and that the cut in the clothing no longercoincides with it. There is quite a considerable angle, which is themeasure of the rotation of the blade.""Yes, it is odd," said Dr. Egerton, "though, as I said, I doubt that ithelps us.""At present," Thorndyke rejoined dryly, "we are noting the facts.""Quite so," agreed the other, reddening slightly; "and perhaps we hadbetter move the body to the bedroom, and make a preliminary inspectionof the wound."We carried the corpse into the bedroom, and, having examined the woundwithout eliciting anything new, covered the remains with a sheet, andreturned to the sitting-room."Well, gentlemen," said the inspector, "you have examined the body andthe wound, and you have measured the floor and the furniture, and takenphotographs, and made a plan, but we don't seem much more forward.Here's a man murdered in his rooms. There is only one entrance to theflat, and that was bolted on the inside at the time of the murder. Thewindows are some forty feet from the ground; there is no rain-pipe nearany of them; they are set flush in the wall, and there isn't a footholdfor a fly on any part of that wall. The grates are modern, and thereisn't room for a good-sized cat to crawl up any of the chimneys. Now,the question is, How did the murderer get in, and how did he get outagain?""Still," said Mr. Marchmont, "the fact is that he did get in, and thathe is not here now; and therefore he must have got out; and therefore itmust have been possible for him to get out. And, further, it must bepossible to discover how he got out."The inspector smiled sourly, but made no reply."The circumstances," said Thorndyke, "appear to have been these: Thedeceased seems to have been alone; there is no trace of a secondoccupant of the room, and only one half-emptied tumbler on the table. Hewas sitting reading when apparently he noticed that the clock hadstopped--at ten minutes to twelve; he laid his book, face downwards, onthe table, and rose to wind the clock, and as he was winding it he methis death.""By a stab dealt by a left-handed man, who crept up behind him ontiptoe," added the inspector.Thorndyke nodded. "That would seem to be so," he said. "But now let uscall in the porter, and hear what he has to tell us."The custodian was not difficult to find, being, in fact, engaged at thatmoment in a survey of the premises through the slit of the letter-box."Do you know what persons visited these rooms last night?" Thorndykeasked him, when he entered looking somewhat sheepish."A good many were in and out of the building," was the answer, "but Ican't say if any of them came to this flat. I saw Miss Curtis pass inabout nine.""My daughter!" exclaimed Mr. Curtis, with a start. "I didn't know that.""She left about nine-thirty," the porter added."Do you know what she came about?" asked the inspector."I can guess," replied Mr. Curtis."Then don't say," interrupted Mr. Marchmont. "Answer no questions.""You're very close, Mr. Marchmont," said the inspector; "we are notsuspecting the young lady. We don't ask, for instance, if she isleft-handed."He glanced craftily at Mr. Curtis as he made this remark, and I noticedthat our client suddenly turned deathly pale, whereupon the inspectorlooked away again quickly, as though he had not observed the change."Tell us about those Italians again," he said, addressing the porter."When did the first of them come here?""About a week ago," was the reply. "He was a common-looking man--lookedlike an organ-grinder--and he brought a note to my lodge. It was in adirty envelope, and was addressed 'Mr. Hartridge, Esq., BrackenhurstMansions,' in a very bad handwriting. The man gave me the note and askedme to give it to Mr. Hartridge; then he went away, and I took the noteup and dropped it into the letter-box.""What happened next?""Why, the very next day an old hag of an Italian woman--one of themfortune-telling swines with a cage of birds on a stand--came and set upjust by the main doorway. I soon sent her packing, but, bless you! shewas back again in ten minutes, birds and all. I sent her off again--Ikept on sending her off, and she kept on coming back, until I wasreg'lar wore to a thread.""You seem to have picked up a bit since then," remarked the inspectorwith a grin and a glance at the sufferer's very pronounced bow-window."Perhaps I have," the custodian replied haughtily. "Well, the next daythere was a ice-cream man--a reg'lar waster, _he_ was. Stuck outside asif he was froze to the pavement. Kept giving the errand-boys tasters,and when I tried to move him on, he told me not to obstruct hisbusiness. Business, indeed! Well, there them boys stuck, one after theother, wiping their tongues round the bottoms of them glasses, until Iwas fit to bust with aggravation. And _he_ kept me going all day."Then, the day after that there was a barrel-organ, with a mangy-lookingmonkey on it. He was the worst of all. Profane, too, _he_ was. Keptmixing up sacred tunes and comic songs: 'Rock of Ages,' 'Bill Bailey,''Cujus Animal,' and 'Over the Garden Wall.' And when I tried to move himon, that little blighter of a monkey made a run at my leg; and then theman grinned and started playing, 'Wait till the Clouds roll by.' I tellyou, it was fair sickening."He wiped his brow at the recollection, and the inspector smiledappreciatively."And that was the last of them?" said the latter; and as the porternodded sulkily, he asked: "Should you recognize the note that theItalian gave you?""I should," answered the porter with frosty dignity.The inspector bustled out of the room, and returned a minute later witha letter-case in his hand."This was in his breast-pocket," said he, laying the bulging case on thetable, and drawing up a chair. "Now, here are three letters tiedtogether. Ah! this will be the one." He untied the tape, and held out adirty envelope addressed in a sprawling, illiterate hand to "Mr.Hartridge, Esq." "Is that the note the Italian gave you?"The porter examined it critically. "Yes," said he; "that is the one."The inspector drew the letter out of the envelope, and, as he opened it,his eyebrows went up."What do you make of that, Doctor?" he said, handing the sheet toThorndyke.Thorndyke regarded it for a while in silence, with deep attention. Thenhe carried it to the window, and, taking his lens from his pocket,examined the paper closely, first with the low power, and then with thehighly magnifying Coddington attachment."I should have thought you could see that with the naked eye," said theinspector, with a sly grin at me. "It's a pretty bold design.""Yes," replied Thorndyke; "a very interesting production. What do yousay, Mr. Marchmont?"The solicitor took the note, and I looked over his shoulder. It wascertainly a curious production. Written in red ink, on the commonestnotepaper, and in the same sprawling hand as the address, was thefollowing message: "You are given six days to do what is just. By thesign above, know what to expect if you fail." The sign referred to was askull and crossbones, very neatly, but rather unskilfully, drawn at thetop of the paper."This," said Mr. Marchmont, handing the document to Mr. Curtis,"explains the singular letter that he wrote yesterday. You have it withyou, I think?""Yes," replied Mr. Curtis; "here it is."He produced a letter from his pocket, and read aloud:     "'Yes: come if you like, though it is an ungodly hour. Your     threatening letters have caused me great amusement. They are worthy     of Sadler's Wells in its prime.     "'ALFRED HARTRIDGE.'""Was Mr. Hartridge ever in Italy?" asked Inspector Badger."Oh yes," replied Mr. Curtis. "He stayed at Capri nearly the whole oflast year.""Why, then, that gives us our clue. Look here. Here are these two otherletters; E.C. postmark--Saffron Hill is E.C. And just look at that!"He spread out the last of the mysterious letters, and we saw that,besides the _memento mori_, it contained only three words: "Beware!Remember Capri!""If you have finished, Doctor, I'll be off and have a look round LittleItaly. Those four Italians oughtn't to be difficult to find, and we'vegot the porter here to identify them.""Before you go," said Thorndyke, "there are two little matters that Ishould like to settle. One is the dagger: it is in your pocket, I think.May I have a look at it?"The inspector rather reluctantly produced the dagger and handed it to mycolleague."A very singular weapon, this," said Thorndyke, regarding the daggerthoughtfully, and turning it about to view its different parts."Singular both in shape and material. I have never seen an aluminiumhilt before, and bookbinder's morocco is a little unusual.""The aluminium was for lightness," explained the inspector, "and it wasmade narrow to carry up the sleeve, I expect.""Perhaps so," said Thorndyke.He continued his examination, and presently, to the inspector's delight,brought forth his pocket lens."I never saw such a man!" exclaimed the jocose detective. "His mottoought to be, 'We magnify thee.' I suppose he'll measure it next."The inspector was not mistaken. Having made a rough sketch of the weaponon his block, Thorndyke produced from his bag a folding rule and adelicate calliper-gauge. With these instruments he proceeded, withextraordinary care and precision, to take the dimensions of the variousparts of the dagger, entering each measurement in its place on thesketch, with a few brief, descriptive details."The other matter," said he at length, handing the dagger back to theinspector, "refers to the houses opposite."He walked to the window, and looked out at the backs of a row of tallbuildings similar to the one we were in. They were about thirty yardsdistant, and were separated from us by a piece of ground, planted withshrubs and intersected by gravel paths."If any of those rooms were occupied last night," continued Thorndyke,"we might obtain an actual eyewitness of the crime. This room wasbrilliantly lighted, and all the blinds were up, so that an observer atany of those windows could see right into the room, and very distinctly,too. It might be worth inquiring into.""Yes, that's true," said the inspector; "though I expect, if any of themhave seen anything, they will come forward quick enough when they readthe report in the papers. But I must be off now, and I shall have tolock you out of the rooms."As we went down the stairs, Mr. Marchmont announced his intention ofcalling on us in the evening, "unless," he added, "you want anyinformation from me now.""I do," said Thorndyke. "I want to know who is interested in this man'sdeath.""That," replied Marchmont, "is rather a queer story. Let us take a turnin that garden that we saw from the window. We shall be quite privatethere."He beckoned to Mr. Curtis, and, when the inspector had departed with thepolice-surgeon, we induced the porter to let us into the garden."The question that you asked," Mr. Marchmont began, looking up curiouslyat the tall houses opposite, "is very simply answered. The only personimmediately interested in the death of Alfred Hartridge is his executorand sole legatee, a man named Leonard Wolfe. He is no relation of thedeceased, merely a friend, but he inherits the entire estate--abouttwenty thousand pounds. The circumstances are these: Alfred Hartridgewas the elder of two brothers, of whom the younger, Charles, died beforehis father, leaving a widow and three children. Fifteen years ago thefather died, leaving the whole of his property to Alfred, with theunderstanding that he should support his brother's family and make thechildren his heirs.""Was there no will?" asked Thorndyke."Under great pressure from the friends of his son's widow, the old manmade a will shortly before he died; but he was then very old and ratherchildish, so the will was contested by Alfred, on the grounds of undueinfluence, and was ultimately set aside. Since then Alfred Hartridge hasnot paid a penny towards the support of his brother's family. If it hadnot been for my client, Mr. Curtis, they might have starved; the wholeburden of the support of the widow and the education of the children hasfallen upon him."Well, just lately the matter has assumed an acute form, for tworeasons. The first is that Charles's eldest son, Edmund, has come ofage. Mr. Curtis had him articled to a solicitor, and, as he is now fullyqualified, and a most advantageous proposal for a partnership has beenmade, we have been putting pressure on Alfred to supply the necessarycapital in accordance with his father's wishes. This he had refused todo, and it was with reference to this matter that we were calling on himthis morning. The second reason involves a curious and disgracefulstory. There is a certain Leonard Wolfe, who has been an intimate friendof the deceased. He is, I may say, a man of bad character, and theirassociation has been of a kind creditable to neither. There is also acertain woman named Hester Greene, who had certain claims upon thedeceased, which we need not go into at present. Now, Leonard Wolfe andthe deceased, Alfred Hartridge, entered into an agreement, the terms ofwhich were these: (1) Wolfe was to marry Hester Greene, and inconsideration of this service (2) Alfred Hartridge was to assign toWolfe the whole of his property, absolutely, the actual transfer to takeplace on the death of Hartridge.""And has this transaction been completed?" asked Thorndyke."Yes, it has, unfortunately. But we wished to see if anything could bedone for the widow and the children during Hartridge's lifetime. Nodoubt, my client's daughter, Miss Curtis, called last night on a similarmission--very indiscreetly, since the matter was in our hands; but, youknow, she is engaged to Edmund Hartridge--and I expect the interview wasa pretty stormy one."Thorndyke remained silent for a while, pacing slowly along the gravelpath, with his eyes bent on the ground: not abstractedly, however, butwith a searching, attentive glance that roved amongst the shrubs andbushes, as though he were looking for something."What sort of man," he asked presently, "is this Leonard Wolfe?Obviously he is a low scoundrel, but what is he like in other respects?Is he a fool, for instance?""Not at all, I should say," said Mr. Curtis. "He was formerly anengineer, and, I believe, a very capable mechanician. Latterly he haslived on some property that came to him, and has spent both his time andhis money in gambling and dissipation. Consequently, I expect he ispretty short of funds at present.""And in appearance?""I only saw him once," replied Mr. Curtis, "and all I can remember ofhim is that he is rather short, fair, thin, and clean-shaven, and thathe has lost the middle finger of his left hand.""And he lives at?""Eltham, in Kent. Morton Grange, Eltham," said Mr. Marchmont. "And now,if you have all the information that you require, I must really be off,and so must Mr. Curtis."The two men shook our hands and hurried away, leaving Thorndyke gazingmeditatively at the dingy flower-beds."A strange and interesting case, this, Jervis," said he, stooping topeer under a laurel-bush. "The inspector is on a hot scent--a mostpalpable red herring on a most obvious string; but that is his business.Ah, here comes the porter, intent, no doubt, on pumping us, whereas--"He smiled genially at the approaching custodian, and asked: "Where didyou say those houses fronted?""Cotman Street, sir," answered the porter. "They are nearly alloffices.""And the numbers? That open second-floor window, for instance?""That is number six; but the house opposite Mr. Hartridge's rooms isnumber eight.""Thank you."Thorndyke was moving away, but suddenly turned again to the porter."By the way," said he, "I dropped something out of the window justnow--a small flat piece of metal, like this." He made on the back of hisvisiting card a neat sketch of a circular disc, with a hexagonal holethrough it, and handed the card to the porter. "I can't say where itfell," he continued; "these flat things scale about so; but you mightask the gardener to look for it. I will give him a sovereign if hebrings it to my chambers, for, although it is of no value to anyoneelse, it is of considerable value to me."The porter touched his hat briskly, and as we turned out at the gate, Ilooked back and saw him already wading among the shrubs.The object of the porter's quest gave me considerable mental occupation.I had not seen Thorndyke drop any thing, and it was not his way tofinger carelessly any object of value. I was about to question him onthe subject, when, turning sharply round into Cotman Street, he drew upat the doorway of number six, and began attentively to read the names ofthe occupants."'Third-floor,'" he read out, "'Mr. Thomas Barlow, Commission Agent.'Hum! I think we will look in on Mr. Barlow."He stepped quickly up the stone stairs, and I followed, until wearrived, somewhat out of breath, on the third-floor. Outside theCommission Agent's door he paused for a moment, and we both listenedcuriously to an irregular sound of shuffling feet from within. Then hesoftly opened the door and looked into the room. After remaining thusfor nearly a minute, he looked round at me with a broad smile, andnoiselessly set the door wide open. Inside, a lanky youth of fourteenwas practising, with no mean skill, the manipulation of an applianceknown by the appropriate name of diabolo; and so absorbed was he in hisoccupation that we entered and shut the door without being observed. Atlength the shuttle missed the string and flew into a large waste-paperbasket; the boy turned and confronted us, and was instantly coveredwith confusion."Allow me," said Thorndyke, rooting rather unnecessarily in thewaste-paper basket, and handing the toy to its owner. "I need not ask ifMr. Barlow is in," he added, "nor if he is likely to return shortly.""He won't be back to-day," said the boy, perspiring with embarrassment;"he left before I came. I was rather late.""I see," said Thorndyke. "The early bird catches the worm, but the latebird catches the diabolo. How did you know he would not be back?""He left a note. Here it is."He exhibited the document, which was neatly written in red ink.Thorndyke examined it attentively, and then asked:"Did you break the inkstand yesterday?"The boy stared at him in amazement. "Yes, I did," he answered. "How didyou know?""I didn't, or I should not have asked. But I see that he has used hisstylo to write this note."The boy regarded Thorndyke distrustfully, as he continued:"I really called to see if your Mr. Barlow was a gentleman whom I usedto know; but I expect you can tell me. My friend was tall and thin,dark, and clean-shaved.""This ain't him, then," said the boy. "He's thin, but he ain't tall ordark. He's got a sandy beard, and he wears spectacles and a wig. I knowa wig when I see one," he added cunningly, "'cause my father wears one.He puts it on a peg to comb it, and he swears at me when I larf.""My friend had injured his left hand," pursued Thorndyke."I dunno about that," said the youth. "Mr. Barlow nearly always wearsgloves; he always wears one on his left hand, anyhow.""Ah well! I'll just write him a note on the chance, if you will give mea piece of notepaper. Have you any ink?""There's some in the bottle. I'll dip the pen in for you."He produced, from the cupboard, an opened packet of cheap notepaper anda packet of similar envelopes, and, having dipped the pen to the bottomof the ink-bottle, handed it to Thorndyke, who sat down and hastilyscribbled a short note. He had folded the paper, and was about toaddress the envelope, when he appeared suddenly to alter his mind."I don't think I will leave it, after all," he said, slipping the foldedpaper into his pocket. "No. Tell him I called--Mr. Horace Budge--and sayI will look in again in a day or two."The youth watched our exit with an air of perplexity, and he even cameout on to the landing, the better to observe us over the balusters;until, unexpectedly catching Thorndyke's eye, he withdrew his head withremarkable suddenness, and retired in disorder.To tell the truth, I was now little less perplexed than the office-boyby Thorndyke's proceedings; in which I could discover no relevancy tothe investigation that I presumed he was engaged upon: and the laststraw was laid upon the burden of my curiosity when he stopped at astaircase window, drew the note out of his pocket, examined it with hislens, held it up to the light, and chuckled aloud."Luck," he observed, "though no substitute for care and intelligence, isa very pleasant addition. Really, my learned brother, we are doinguncommonly well."When we reached the hall, Thorndyke stopped at the housekeeper's box,and looked in with a genial nod."I have just been up to see Mr. Barlow," said he. "He seems to have leftquite early.""Yes, sir," the man replied. "He went away about half-past eight.""That was very early; and presumably he came earlier still?""I suppose so," the man assented, with a grin; "but I had only just comeon when he left.""Had he any luggage with him?""Yes, sir. There was two cases, a square one and a long, narrow one,about five foot long. I helped him to carry them down to the cab.""Which was a four-wheeler, I suppose?""Yes, sir.""Mr. Barlow hasn't been here very long, has he?" Thorndyke inquired."No. He only came in last quarter-day--about six weeks ago.""Ah well! I must call another day. Good-morning;" and Thorndyke strodeout of the building, and made directly for the cab-rank in the adjoiningstreet. Here he stopped for a minute or two to parley with the driver ofa four-wheeled cab, whom he finally commissioned to convey us to a shopin New Oxford Street. Having dismissed the cabman with his blessing anda half-sovereign, he vanished into the shop, leaving me to gaze at thelathes, drills, and bars of metal displayed in the window. Presently heemerged with a small parcel, and explained, in answer to my inquiringlook: "A strip of tool steel and a block of metal for Polton."His next purchase was rather more eccentric. We were proceeding alongHolborn when his attention was suddenly arrested by the window of afurniture shop, in which was displayed a collection of obsolete Frenchsmall-arms--relics of the tragedy of 1870--which were being sold fordecorative purposes. After a brief inspection, he entered the shop, andshortly reappeared carrying a long sword-bayonet and an old Chassepotrifle."What may be the meaning of this martial display?" I asked, as we turneddown Fetter Lane."House protection," he replied promptly. "You will agree that adischarge of musketry, followed by a bayonet charge, would disconcertthe boldest of burglars."I laughed at the absurd picture thus drawn of the strenuoushouse-protector, but nevertheless continued to speculate on the meaningof my friend's eccentric proceedings, which I felt sure were in some wayrelated to the murder in Brackenhurst Chambers, though I could not tracethe connection.After a late lunch, I hurried out to transact such of my business as hadbeen interrupted by the stirring events of the morning, leavingThorndyke busy with a drawing-board, squares, scale, and compasses,making accurate, scaled drawings from his rough sketches; while Polton,with the brown-paper parcel in his hand, looked on at him with an air ofanxious expectation.As I was returning homeward in the evening by way of Mitre Court, Iovertook Mr. Marchmont, who was also bound for our chambers, and wewalked on together."I had a note from Thorndyke," he explained, "asking for a specimen ofhandwriting, so I thought I would bring it along myself, and hear if hehas any news."When we entered the chambers, we found Thorndyke in earnest consultationwith Polton, and on the table before them I observed, to my greatsurprise, the dagger with which the murder had been committed.[Illustration: THE ALUMINIUM DAGGER.]"I have got you the specimen that you asked for," said Marchmont. "Ididn't think I should be able to, but, by a lucky chance, Curtis keptthe only letter he ever received from the party in question."He drew the letter from his wallet, and handed it to Thorndyke, wholooked at it attentively and with evident satisfaction."By the way," said Marchmont, taking up the dagger, "I thought theinspector took this away with him.""He took the original," replied Thorndyke. "This is a duplicate, whichPolton has made, for experimental purposes, from my drawings.""Really!" exclaimed Marchmont, with a glance of respectful admiration atPolton; "it is a perfect replica--and you have made it so quickly, too.""It was quite easy to make," said Polton, "to a man accustomed to workin metal.""Which," added Thorndyke, "is a fact of some evidential value."At this moment a hansom drew up outside. A moment later flying footstepswere heard on the stairs. There was a furious battering at the door,and, as Polton threw it open, Mr. Curtis burst wildly into the room."Here is a frightful thing, Marchmont!" he gasped. "Edith--mydaughter--arrested for the murder. Inspector Badger came to our houseand took her. My God! I shall go mad!"Thorndyke laid his hand on the excited man's shoulder. "Don't distressyourself, Mr. Curtis," said he. "There is no occasion, I assure you. Isuppose," he added, "your daughter is left-handed?""Yes, she is, by a most disastrous coincidence. But what are we to do?Good God! Dr. Thorndyke, they have taken her to prison--to prison--thinkof it! My poor Edith!""We'll soon have her out," said Thorndyke. "But listen; there is someoneat the door."A brisk rat-tat confirmed his statement; and when I rose to open thedoor, I found myself confronted by Inspector Badger. There was a momentof extreme awkwardness, and then both the detective and Mr. Curtisproposed to retire in favour of the other."Don't go, inspector," said Thorndyke; "I want to have a word with you.Perhaps Mr. Curtis would look in again, say, in an hour. Will you? Weshall have news for you by then, I hope."Mr. Curtis agreed hastily, and dashed out of the room with hischaracteristic impetuosity. When he had gone, Thorndyke turned to thedetective, and remarked dryly:"You seem to have been busy, inspector?""Yes," replied Badger; "I haven't let the grass grow under my feet; andI've got a pretty strong case against Miss Curtis already. You see, shewas the last person seen in the company of the deceased; she had agrievance against him; she is left-handed, and you remember that themurder was committed by a left-handed person.""Anything else?""Yes. I have seen those Italians, and the whole thing was a put-up job.A woman, in a widow's dress and veil, paid them to go and play the fooloutside the building, and she gave them the letter that was left withthe porter. They haven't identified her yet, but she seems to agree insize with Miss Curtis.""And how did she get out of the chambers, with the door bolted on theinside?""Ah, there you are! That's a mystery at present--unless you can give usan explanation." The inspector made this qualification with a faintgrin, and added: "As there was no one in the place when we broke intoit, the murderer must have got out somehow. You can't deny that.""I do deny it, nevertheless," said Thorndyke. "You look surprised," hecontinued (which was undoubtedly true), "but yet the whole thing isexceedingly obvious. The explanation struck me directly I looked at thebody. There was evidently no practicable exit from the flat, and therewas certainly no one in it when you entered. Clearly, then, _themurderer had never been in the place at all_.""I don't follow you in the least," said the inspector."Well," said Thorndyke, "as I have finished with the case, and amhanding it over to you, I will put the evidence before you _seriatim_.Now, I think we are agreed that, at the moment when the blow was struck,the deceased was standing before the fireplace, winding the clock. Thedagger entered obliquely from the left, and, if you recall its position,you will remember that its hilt pointed directly towards an openwindow.""Which was forty feet from the ground.""Yes. And now we will consider the very peculiar character of the weaponwith which the crime was committed."He had placed his hand upon the knob of a drawer, when we wereinterrupted by a knock at the door. I sprang up, and, opening it,admitted no less a person than the porter of Brackenhurst Chambers. Theman looked somewhat surprised on recognizing our visitors, but advancedto Thorndyke, drawing a folded paper from his pocket."I've found the article you were looking for, sir," said he, "and a rarehunt I had for it. It had stuck in the leaves of one of them shrubs."Thorndyke opened the packet, and, having glanced inside, laid it on thetable."Thank you," said he, pushing a sovereign across to the gratifiedofficial. "The inspector has your name, I think?""He have, sir," replied the porter; and, pocketing his fee, he departed,beaming."To return to the dagger," said Thorndyke, opening the drawer. "It was avery peculiar one, as I have said, and as you will see from this model,which is an exact duplicate." Here he exhibited Polton's production tothe astonished detective. "You see that it is extraordinarily slender,and free from projections, and of unusual materials. You also see thatit was obviously not made by an ordinary dagger-maker; that, in spite ofthe Italian word scrawled on it, there is plainly written all over it'British mechanic.' The blade is made from a strip of commonthree-quarter-inch tool steel; the hilt is turned from an aluminium rod;and there is not a line of engraving on it that could not be produced ina lathe by any engineer's apprentice. Even the boss at the top ismechanical, for it is just like an ordinary hexagon nut. Then, noticethe dimensions, as shown on my drawing. The parts A and B, which justproject beyond the blade, are exactly similar in diameter--and suchexactness could hardly be accidental. They are each parts of a circlehaving a diameter of 10.9 millimetres--a dimension which happens, by asingular coincidence, to be exactly the calibre of the old Chassepotrifle, specimens of which are now on sale at several shops in London.Here is one, for instance."He fetched the rifle that he had bought, from the corner in which it wasstanding, and, lifting the dagger by its point, slipped the hilt intothe muzzle. When he let go, the dagger slid quietly down the barrel,until its hilt appeared in the open breech."Good God!" exclaimed Marchmont. "You don't suggest that the dagger wasshot from a gun?""I do, indeed; and you now see the reason for the aluminium hilt--todiminish the weight of the already heavy projectile--and also for thishexagonal boss on the end?""No, I do not," said the inspector; "but I say that you are suggestingan impossibility.""Then," replied Thorndyke, "I must explain and demonstrate. To beginwith, this projectile had to travel point foremost; therefore it had tobe made to spin--and it certainly was spinning when it entered the body,as the clothing and the wound showed us. Now, to make it spin, it had tobe fired from a rifled barrel; but as the hilt would not engage in therifling, it had to be fitted with something that would. That somethingwas evidently a soft metal washer, which fitted on to this hexagon, andwhich would be pressed into the grooves of the rifling, and so spin thedagger, but would drop off as soon as the weapon left the barrel. Hereis such a washer, which Polton has made for us."He laid on the table a metal disc, with a hexagonal hole through it."This is all very ingenious," said the inspector, "but I say it isimpossible and fantastic.""It certainly sounds rather improbable," Marchmont agreed."We will see," said Thorndyke. "Here is a makeshift cartridge ofPolton's manufacture, containing an eighth charge of smokeless powderfor a 20-bore gun."He fitted the washer on to the boss of the dagger in the open breech ofthe rifle, pushed it into the barrel, inserted the cartridge, and closedthe breech. Then, opening the office-door, he displayed a target ofpadded strawboard against the wall."The length of the two rooms," said he, "gives us a distance ofthirty-two feet. Will you shut the windows, Jervis?"I complied, and he then pointed the rifle at the target. There was adull report--much less loud than I had expected--and when we looked atthe target, we saw the dagger driven in up to its hilt at the margin ofthe bull's-eye."You see," said Thorndyke, laying down the rifle, "that the thing ispracticable. Now for the evidence as to the actual occurrence. First, onthe original dagger there are linear scratches which exactly correspondwith the grooves of the rifling. Then there is the fact that the daggerwas certainly spinning from left to right--in the direction of therifling, that is--when it entered the body. And then there is this,which, as you heard, the porter found in the garden."He opened the paper packet. In it lay a metal disc, perforated by ahexagonal hole. Stepping into the office, he picked up from the floorthe washer that he had put on the dagger, and laid it on the paperbeside the other. The two discs were identical in size, and the marginof each was indented with identical markings, corresponding to therifling of the barrel.The inspector gazed at the two discs in silence for a while; then,looking up at Thorndyke, he said:"I give in, Doctor. You're right, beyond all doubt; but how you came tothink of it beats me into fits. The only question now is, Who fired thegun, and why wasn't the report heard?""As to the latter," said Thorndyke, "it is probable that he used acompressed-air attachment, not only to diminish the noise, but also toprevent any traces of the explosive from being left on the dagger. As tothe former, I think I can give you the murderer's name; but we hadbetter take the evidence in order. You may remember," he continued,"that when Dr. Jervis stood as if winding the clock, I chalked a mark onthe floor where he stood. Now, standing on that marked spot, and lookingout of the open window, I could see two of the windows of a house nearlyopposite. They were the second- and third-floor windows of No. 6,Cotman Street. The second-floor is occupied by a firm of architects; thethird-floor by a commission agent named Thomas Barlow. I called on Mr.Barlow, but before describing my visit, I will refer to another matter.You haven't those threatening letters about you, I suppose?""Yes, I have," said the inspector; and he drew forth a wallet from hisbreast-pocket."Lot us take the first one, then," said Thorndyke. "You see that thepaper and envelope are of the very commonest, and the writingilliterate. But the ink does not agree with this. Illiterate peopleusually buy their ink in penny bottles. Now, this envelope is addressedwith Draper's dichroic ink--a superior office ink, sold only in largebottles--and the red ink in which the note is written is an unfixed,scarlet ink, such as is used by draughtsmen, and has been used, as youcan see, in a stylographic pen. But the most interesting thing aboutthis letter is the design drawn at the top. In an artistic sense, theman could not draw, and the anatomical details of the skull areridiculous. Yet the drawing is very neat. It has the clean, wiry line ofa machine drawing, and is done with a steady, practised hand. It is alsoperfectly symmetrical; the skull, for instance, is exactly in thecentre, and, when we examine it through a lens, we see why it is so, forwe discover traces of a pencilled centre-line and ruled cross-lines.Moreover, the lens reveals a tiny particle of draughtsman's soft, red,rubber, with which the pencil lines were taken out; and all these facts,taken together, suggest that the drawing was made by someone accustomedto making accurate mechanical drawings. And now we will return to Mr.Barlow. He was out when I called, but I took the liberty of glancinground the office, and this is what I saw. On the mantelshelf was atwelve-inch flat boxwood rule, such as engineers use, a piece of soft,red rubber, and a stone bottle of Draper's dichroic ink. I obtained, bya simple ruse, a specimen of the office notepaper and the ink. We willexamine it presently. I found that Mr. Barlow is a new tenant, that heis rather short, wears a wig and spectacles, and always wears a glove onhis left hand. He left the office at 8.30 this morning, and no one sawhim arrive. He had with him a square case, and a narrow, oblong oneabout five feet in length; and he took a cab to Victoria, and apparentlycaught the 8.51 train to Chatham.""Ah!" exclaimed the inspector."But," continued Thorndyke, "now examine those three letters, andcompare them with this note that I wrote in Mr. Barlow's office. You seethat the paper is of the same make, with the same water-mark, but thatis of no great significance. What is of crucial importance is this: Yousee, in each of these letters, two tiny indentations near the bottomcorner. Somebody has used compasses or drawing-pins over the packet ofnotepaper, and the points have made little indentations, which havemarked several of the sheets. Now, notepaper is cut to its size after itis folded, and if you stick a pin into the top sheet of a section, theindentations on all the underlying sheets will be at exactly similardistances from the edges and corners of the sheet. But you see thatthese little dents are all at the same distance from the edges and thecorner." He demonstrated the fact with a pair of compasses. "And nowlook at this sheet, which I obtained at Mr. Barlow's office. There aretwo little indentations--rather faint, but quite visible--near thebottom corner, and when we measure them with the compasses, we find thatthey are exactly the same distance apart as the others, and the samedistance from the edges and the bottom corner. The irresistibleconclusion is that these four sheets came from the same packet."The inspector started up from his chair, and faced Thorndyke. "Who isthis Mr. Barlow?" he asked."That," replied Thorndyke, "is for you to determine; but I can give youa useful hint. There is only one person who benefits by the death ofAlfred Hartridge, but he benefits to the extent of twenty thousandpounds. His name is Leonard Wolfe, and I learn from Mr. Marchmont thathe is a man of indifferent character--a gambler and a spendthrift. Byprofession he is an engineer, and he is a capable mechanician. Inappearance he is thin, short, fair, and clean-shaven, and he has lostthe middle finger of his left hand. Mr. Barlow is also short, thin, andfair, but wears a wig, a beard, and spectacles, and always wears a gloveon his left hand. I have seen the handwriting of both these gentlemen,and should say that it would be difficult to distinguish one from theother.""That's good enough for me," said the inspector. "Give me his address,and I'll have Miss Curtis released at once."       *       *       *       *       *The same night Leonard Wolfe was arrested at Eltham, in the very act ofburying in his garden a large and powerful compressed-air rifle. He wasnever brought to trial, however, for he had in his pocket a moreportable weapon--a large-bore Derringer pistol--with which he managedto terminate an exceedingly ill-spent life."And, after all," was Thorndyke's comment, when he heard of the event,"he had his uses. He has relieved society of two very bad men, and hehas given us a most instructive case. He has shown us how a clever andingenious criminal may take endless pains to mislead and delude thepolice, and yet, by inattention to trivial details, may scatter cluesbroadcast. We can only say to the criminal class generally, in bothrespects, 'Go thou and do likewise.'"VIIIA MESSAGE FROM THE DEEP SEAThe Whitechapel Road, though redeemed by scattered relics of a morepicturesque past from the utter desolation of its neighbour theCommercial Road, is hardly a gay thoroughfare. Especially at its easternend, where its sordid modernity seems to reflect the colourless lives ofits inhabitants, does its grey and dreary length depress the spirits ofthe wayfarer. But the longest and dullest road can be made delightful bysprightly discourse seasoned with wit and wisdom, and so it was that, asI walked westward by the side of my friend John Thorndyke, the long,monotonous road seemed all too short.We had been to the London Hospital to see a remarkable case ofacromegaly, and, as we returned, we discussed this curious affection,and the allied condition of gigantism, in all their bearings, from theorigin of the "Gibson chin" to the physique of Og, King of Bashan."It would have been interesting," Thorndyke remarked as we passed upAldgate High Street, "to have put one's finger into His Majesty'spituitary fossa--after his decease, of course. By the way, here isHarrow Alley; you remember Defoe's description of the dead-cart waitingout here, and the ghastly procession coming down the alley." He took myarm and led me up the narrow thoroughfare as far as the sharp turn bythe "Star and Still" public-house, where we turned to look back."I never pass this place," he said musingly, "but I seem to hear theclang of the bell and the dismal cry of the carter--"He broke off abruptly. Two figures had suddenly appeared framed in thearchway, and now advanced at headlong speed. One, who led, was a stout,middle-aged Jewess, very breathless and dishevelled; the other was awell-dressed young man, hardly less agitated than his companion. As theyapproached, the young man suddenly recognized my colleague, and accostedhim in agitated tones."I've just been sent for to a case of murder or suicide. Would you mindlooking at it for me, sir? It's my first case, and I feel rathernervous."Here the woman darted back, and plucked the young doctor by the arm."Hurry! hurry!" she exclaimed, "don't stop to talk." Her face was aswhite as lard, and shiny with sweat; her lips twitched, her hands shook,and she stared with the eyes of a frightened child."Of course I will come, Hart," said Thorndyke; and, turning back, wefollowed the woman as she elbowed her way frantically among thefoot-passengers."Have you started in practice here?" Thorndyke asked as we hurriedalong."No, sir," replied Dr. Hart; "I am an assistant. My principal is thepolice-surgeon, but he is out just now. It's very good of you to comewith me, sir.""Tut, tut," rejoined Thorndyke. "I am just coming to see that you docredit to my teaching. That looks like the house."We had followed our guide into a side street, halfway down which wecould see a knot of people clustered round a doorway. They watched us aswe approached, and drew aside to let us enter. The woman whom we werefollowing rushed into the passage with the same headlong haste withwhich she had traversed the streets, and so up the stairs. But as sheneared the top of the flight she slowed down suddenly, and began tocreep up on tiptoe with noiseless and hesitating steps. On the landingshe turned to face us, and pointing a shaking forefinger at the door ofthe back room, whispered almost inaudibly, "She's in there," and thensank half-fainting on the bottom stair of the next flight.I laid my hand on the knob of the door, and looked back at Thorndyke. Hewas coming slowly up the stairs, closely scrutinizing floor, walls, andhandrail as he came. When he reached the landing, I turned the handle,and we entered the room together, closing the door after us. The blindwas still down, and in the dim, uncertain light nothing out of thecommon was, at first, to be seen. The shabby little room looked trim andorderly enough, save for a heap of cast-off feminine clothing piled upona chair. The bed appeared undisturbed except by the half-seen shape ofits occupant, and the quiet face, dimly visible in its shadowy corner,might have been that of a sleeper but for its utter stillness and for adark stain on the pillow by its side.Dr. Hart stole on tiptoe to the bedside, while Thorndyke drew up theblind; and as the garish daylight poured into the room, the youngsurgeon fell back with a gasp of horror."Good God!" he exclaimed; "poor creature! But this is a frightful thing,sir!"The light streamed down upon the white face of a handsome girl oftwenty-five, a face peaceful, placid, and beautiful with the austere andalmost unearthly beauty of the youthful dead. The lips were slightlyparted, the eyes half closed and drowsy, shaded with sweeping lashes;and a wealth of dark hair in massive plaits served as a foil to thetranslucent skin.Our friend had drawn back the bedclothes a few inches, and now there wasrevealed, beneath the comely face, so serene and inscrutable, and yet sodreadful in its fixity and waxen pallor, a horrible, yawning wound thatalmost divided the shapely neck.Thorndyke looked down with stern pity at the plump white face."It was savagely done," said he, "and yet mercifully, by reason of itsvery savagery. She must have died without waking.""The brute!" exclaimed Hart, clenching his fists and turning crimsonwith wrath. "The infernal cowardly beast! He shall hang! By God, heshall hang!" In his fury the young fellow shook his fists in the air,even as the moisture welled up into his eyes.Thorndyke touched him on the shoulder. "That is what we are here for,Hart," said he. "Get out your notebook;" and with this he bent down overthe dead girl.At the friendly reproof the young surgeon pulled himself together, and,with open notebook, commenced his investigation, while I, at Thorndyke'srequest, occupied myself in making a plan of the room, with adescription of its contents and their arrangements. But this occupationdid not prevent me from keeping an eye on Thorndyke's movements, andpresently I suspended my labours to watch him as, with hispocket-knife, he scraped together some objects that he had found on thepillow."What do you make of this?" he asked, as I stepped over to his side. Hepointed with the blade to a tiny heap of what looked like silver sand,and, as I looked more closely, I saw that similar particles weresprinkled on other parts of the pillow."Silver sand!" I exclaimed. "I don't understand at all how it can havegot there. Do you?"Thorndyke shook his head. "We will consider the explanation later," washis reply. He had produced from his pocket a small metal box which healways carried, and which contained such requisites as cover-slips,capillary tubes, moulding wax, and other "diagnostic materials." He nowtook from it a seed-envelope, into which he neatly shovelled the littlepinch of sand with his knife. He had closed the envelope, and waswriting a pencilled description on the outside, when we were startled bya cry from Hart."Good God, sir! Look at this! It was done by a woman!"He had drawn back the bedclothes, and was staring aghast at the deadgirl's left hand. It held a thin tress of long, red hair.Thorndyke hastily pocketed his specimen, and, stepping round the littlebedside table, bent over the hand with knitted brows. It was closed,though not tightly clenched, and when an attempt was made gently toseparate the fingers, they were found to be as rigid as the fingers of awooden hand. Thorndyke stooped yet more closely, and, taking out hislens, scrutinized the wisp of hair throughout its entire length."There is more here than meets the eye at the first glance," heremarked. "What say you, Hart?" He held out his lens to his quondampupil, who was about to take it from him when the door opened, and threemen entered. One was a police-inspector, the second appeared to be aplain-clothes officer, while the third was evidently the divisionalsurgeon."Friends of yours, Hart?" inquired the latter, regarding us with somedisfavour.Thorndyke gave a brief explanation of our presence to which the newcomerrejoined:"Well, sir, your _locus standi_ here is a matter for the inspector. Myassistant was not authorized to call in outsiders. You needn't wait,Hart."With this he proceeded to his inspection, while Thorndyke withdrew thepocket-thermometer that he had slipped under the body, and took thereading.The inspector, however, was not disposed to exercise the prerogative atwhich the surgeon had hinted; for an expert has his uses."How long should you say she'd been dead, sir?" he asked affably."About ten hours," replied Thorndyke.The inspector and the detective simultaneously looked at their watches."That fixes it at two o'clock this morning," said the former. "What'sthat, sir?"The surgeon was pointing to the wisp of hair in the dead girl's hand."My word!" exclaimed the inspector. "A woman, eh? She must be a toughcustomer. This looks like a soft job for you, sergeant.""Yes," said the detective. "That accounts for that box with the hassockon it at the head of the bed. She had to stand on them to reach over.But she couldn't have been very tall.""She must have been mighty strong, though," said the inspector; "why,she has nearly cut the poor wench's head off." He moved round to thehead of the bed, and, stooping over, peered down at the gaping wound.Suddenly he began to draw his hand over the pillow, and then rub hisfingers together. "Why," he exclaimed, "there's sand on thepillow--silver sand! Now, how can that have come there?"The surgeon and the detective both came round to verify this discovery,and an earnest consultation took place as to its meaning."Did you notice it, sir?" the inspector asked Thorndyke."Yes," replied the latter; "it's an unaccountable thing, isn't it?""I don't know that it is, either," said the detective, he ran over tothe washstand, and then uttered a grunt of satisfaction. "It's quite asimple matter, after all, you see," he said, glancing complacently at mycolleague. "There's a ball of sand-soap on the washstand, and the basinis full of blood-stained water. You see, she must have washed the bloodoff her hands, and off the knife, too--a pretty cool customer she mustbe--and she used the sand-soap. Then, while she was drying her hands,she must have stood over the head of the bed, and let the sand fall onto the pillow. I think that's clear enough.""Admirably clear," said Thorndyke; "and what do you suppose was thesequence of events?"The gratified detective glanced round the room. "I take it," said he,"that the deceased read herself to sleep. There is a book on the tableby the bed, and a candlestick with nothing in it but a bit of burnt wickat the bottom of the socket. I imagine that the woman came in quietly,lit the gas, put the box and the hassock at the bedhead, stood on them,and cut her victim's throat. Deceased must have waked up and clutchedthe murderess's hair--though there doesn't seem to have been much of astruggle; but no doubt she died almost at once. Then the murderesswashed her hands, cleaned the knife, tidied up the bed a bit, and wentaway. That's about how things happened, I think, but how she got inwithout anyone hearing, and how she got out, and where she went to, arethe things that we've got to find out.""Perhaps," said the surgeon, drawing the bedclothes over the corpse, "wehad better have the landlady in and make a few inquiries." He glancedsignificantly at Thorndyke, and the inspector coughed behind his hand.My colleague, however, chose to be obtuse to these hints: opening thedoor, he turned the key backwards and forwards several times, drew itout, examined it narrowly, and replaced it."The landlady is outside on the landing," he remarked, holding the dooropen.Thereupon the inspector went out, and we all followed to hear the resultof his inquiries."Now, Mrs. Goldstein," said the officer, opening his notebook, "I wantyou to tell us all that you know about this affair, and about the girlherself. What was her name?"The landlady, who had been joined by a white-faced, tremulous man, wipedher eyes, and replied in a shaky voice: "Her name, poor child, was MinnaAdler. She was a German. She came from Bremen about two years ago. Shehad no friends in England--no relatives, I mean. She was a waitress at arestaurant in Fenchurch Street, and a good, quiet, hard-working girl.""When did you discover what had happened?""About eleven o'clock. I thought she had gone to work as usual, but myhusband noticed from the back yard that her blind was still down. So Iwent up and knocked, and when I got no answer, I opened the door andwent in, and then I saw--" Here the poor soul, overcome by the dreadfulrecollection, burst into hysterical sobs."Her door was unlocked, then; did she usually lock it?""I think so," sobbed Mrs. Goldstein. "The key was always inside.""And the street door; was that secure when you came down this morning?""It was shut. We don't bolt it because some of the lodgers come homerather late.""And now tell us, had she any enemies? Was there anyone who had a grudgeagainst her?""No, no, poor child! Why should anyone have a grudge against her? No,she had no quarrel--no real quarrel--with anyone; not even with Miriam.""Miriam!" inquired the inspector. "Who is she?""That was nothing," interposed the man hastily. "That was not aquarrel.""Just a little unpleasantness, I suppose, Mr. Goldstein?" suggested theinspector."Just a little foolishness about a young man," said Mr. Goldstein. "Thatwas all. Miriam was a little jealous. But it was nothing.""No, no. Of course. We all know that young women are apt to--"A soft footstep had been for some time audible, slowly descending thestair above, and at this moment a turn of the staircase brought thenewcomer into view. And at that vision the inspector stopped short as ifpetrified, and a tense, startled silence fell upon us all. Down theremaining stairs there advanced towards us a young woman, powerfulthough short, wild-eyed, dishevelled, horror-stricken, and of a ghastlypallor: and her hair was a fiery red.Stock still and speechless we all stood as this apparition came slowlytowards us; but suddenly the detective slipped back into the room,closing the door after him, to reappear a few moments later holding asmall paper packet, which, after a quick glance at the inspector, heplaced in his breast pocket."This is my daughter Miriam that we spoke about, gentlemen," said Mr.Goldstein. "Miriam, those are the doctors and the police."The girl looked at us from one to the other. "You have seen her, then,"she said in a strange, muffled voice, and added: "She isn't dead, isshe? Not really dead?" The question was asked in a tone at once coaxingand despairing, such as a distracted mother might use over the corpse ofher child. It filled me with vague discomfort, and, unconsciously, Ilooked round towards Thorndyke.To my surprise he had vanished.Noiselessly backing towards the head of the stairs, where I couldcommand a view of the hall, or passage, I looked down, and saw him inthe act of reaching up to a shelf behind the street door. He caught myeye, and beckoned, whereupon I crept away unnoticed by the party on thelanding. When I reached the hall, he was wrapping up three smallobjects, each in a separate cigarette-paper; and I noticed that hehandled them with more than ordinary tenderness."We didn't want to see that poor devil of a girl arrested," said he, ashe deposited the three little packets gingerly in his pocket-box. "Letus be off." He opened the door noiselessly, and stood for a moment,turning the latch backwards and forwards, and closely examining itsbolt.I glanced up at the shelf behind the door. On it were two flat chinacandlesticks, in one of which I had happened to notice, as we came in, ashort end of candle lying in the tray, and I now looked to see if thatwas what Thorndyke had annexed; but it was still there.I followed my colleague out into the street, and for some time we walkedon without speaking. "You guessed what the sergeant had in that paper,of course," said Thorndyke at length."Yes. It was the hair from the dead woman's hand; and I thought that hehad much better have left it there.""Undoubtedly. But that is the way in which well-meaning policemendestroy valuable evidence. Not that it matters much in this particularinstance; but it might have been a fatal mistake.""Do you intend to take any active part in this case?" I asked."That depends on circumstances. I have collected some evidence, but whatit is worth I don't yet know. Neither do I know whether the police haveobserved the same set of facts; but I need not say that I shall doanything that seems necessary to assist the authorities. That is amatter of common citizenship."The inroads made upon our time by the morning's adventures made itnecessary that we should go each about his respective business withoutdelay; so, after a perfunctory lunch at a tea-shop, we separated, and Idid not see my colleague again until the day's work was finished, and Iturned into our chambers just before dinner-time.Here I found Thorndyke seated at the table, and evidently full ofbusiness. A microscope stood close by, with a condenser throwing a spotof light on to a pinch of powder that had been sprinkled on to theslide; his collecting-box lay open before him, and he was engaged,rather mysteriously, in squeezing a thick white cement from a tube on tothree little pieces of moulding-wax."Useful stuff, this Fortafix," he remarked; "it makes excellent casts,and saves the trouble and mess of mixing plaster, which is aconsideration for small work like this. By the way, if you want to knowwhat was on that poor girl's pillow, just take a peep through themicroscope. It is rather a pretty specimen."I stepped across, and applied my eye to the instrument. The specimenwas, indeed, pretty in more than a technical sense. Mingled withcrystalline grains of quartz, glassy spicules, and water-worn fragmentsof coral, were a number of lovely little shells, some of the texture offine porcelain, others like blown Venetian glass.[Illustration: THE SAND FROM THE MURDERED WOMAN'S PILLOW, MAGNIFIED 25DIAMETERS.]"These are Foraminifera!" I exclaimed."Yes.""Then it is not silver sand, after all?""Certainly not.""But what is it, then?"Thorndyke smiled. "It is a message to us from the deep sea, Jervis;from the floor of the Eastern Mediterranean.""And can you read the message?""I think I can," he replied, "but I shall know soon, I hope."I looked down the microscope again, and wondered what message these tinyshells had conveyed to my friend. Deep-sea sand on a dead woman'spillow! What could be more incongruous? What possible connection couldthere be between this sordid crime in the east of London and the deepbed of the "tideless sea"?Meanwhile Thorndyke squeezed out more cement on to the three littlepieces of moulding-wax (which I suspected to be the objects that I hadseen him wrapping up with such care in the hall of the Goldsteins'house); then, laying one of them down on a glass slide, with itscemented side uppermost, he stood the other two upright on either sideof it. Finally he squeezed out a fresh load of the thick cement,apparently to bind the three objects together, and carried the slidevery carefully to a cupboard, where he deposited it, together with theenvelope containing the sand and the slide from the stage of themicroscope.He was just locking the cupboard when a sharp rat-tat on our knockersent him hurriedly to the door. A messenger-boy, standing on thethreshold, held out a dirty envelope."Mr. Goldstein kept me a awful long time, sir," said he; "I haven't beena-loitering."Thorndyke took the envelope over to the gas-light, and, opening it, drewforth a sheet of paper, which he scanned quickly and almost eagerly;and, though his face remained as inscrutable as a mask of stone, I felta conviction that the paper had told him something that he wished toknow.The boy having been sent on his way rejoicing, Thorndyke turned to thebookshelves, along which he ran his eye thoughtfully until it alightedon a shabbily-bound volume near one end. This he reached down, and as helaid it open on the table, I glanced at it, and was surprised to observethat it was a bi-lingual work, the opposite pages being apparently inRussian and Hebrew."The Old Testament in Russian and Yiddish," he remarked, noting mysurprise. "I am going to get Polton to photograph a couple of specimenpages--is that the postman or a visitor?"It turned out to be the postman, and as Thorndyke extracted from theletter-box a blue official envelope, he glanced significantly at me."This answers your question, I think, Jervis," said he. "Yes; coroner'ssubpoena and a very civil letter: 'sorry to trouble you, but I had nochoice under the circumstances'--of course he hadn't--'Dr. Davidson hasarranged to make the autopsy to-morrow at 4 p.m., and I should be gladif you could be present. The mortuary is in Barker Street, next to theschool.' Well, we must go, I suppose, though Davidson will probablyresent it." He took up the Testament, and went off with it to thelaboratory.We lunched at our chambers on the following day, and, after the meal,drew up our chairs to the fire and lit our pipes. Thorndyke wasevidently preoccupied, for he laid his open notebook on his knee, and,gazing meditatively into the fire, made occasional entries with hispencil as though he were arranging the points of an argument. Assumingthat the Aldgate murder was the subject of his cogitations, I venturedto ask:"Have you any material evidence to offer the coroner?"He closed his notebook and put it away. "The evidence that I have," hesaid, "is material and important; but it is disjointed and ratherinconclusive. If I can join it up into a coherent whole, as I hope to dobefore I reach the court, it will be very important indeed--but here ismy invaluable familiar, with the instruments of research." He turnedwith a smile towards Polton, who had just entered the room, and masterand man exchanged a friendly glance of mutual appreciation. Therelations of Thorndyke and his assistant were a constant delight to me:on the one side, service, loyal and whole-hearted; on the other, frankand full recognition."I should think those will do, sir," said Polton, handing his principala small cardboard box such as playing-cards are carried in. Thorndykepulled off the lid, and I then saw that the box was fitted internallywith grooves for plates, and contained two mounted photographs. Thelatter were very singular productions indeed; they were copies each of apage of the Testament, one Russian and the other Yiddish; but thelettering appeared white on a black ground, of which it occupied onlyquite a small space in the middle, leaving a broad black margin. Eachphotograph was mounted on a stiff card, and each card had a duplicatephotograph pasted on the back.Thorndyke exhibited them to me with a provoking smile, holding themdaintily by their edges, before he slid them back into the grooves oftheir box."We are making a little digression into philology, you see," heremarked, as he pocketed the box. "But we must be off now, or we shallkeep Davidson waiting. Thank you, Polton."The District Railway carried us swiftly eastward, and we emerged fromAldgate Station a full half-hour before we were due. Nevertheless,Thorndyke stepped out briskly, but instead of making directly for themortuary, he strayed off unaccountably into Mansell Street, scanning thenumbers of the houses as he went. A row of old houses, picturesque butgrimy, on our right seemed specially to attract him, and he slowed downas we approached them."There is a quaint survival, Jervis," he remarked, pointing to a crudelypainted, wooden effigy of an Indian standing on a bracket at the door ofa small old-fashioned tobacconist's shop. We halted to look at thelittle image, and at that moment the side door opened, and a woman cameout on to the doorstop, where she stood gazing up and down the street.Thorndyke immediately crossed the pavement, and addressed her,apparently with some question, for I heard her answer presently: "Aquarter-past six is his time, sir, and he is generally punctual to theminute.""Thank you," said Thorndyke; "I'll bear that in mind;" and, lifting hishat, he walked on briskly, turning presently up a side-street whichbrought us out into Aldgate. It was now but five minutes to four, so westrode off quickly to keep our tryst at the mortuary; but although wearrived at the gate as the hour was striking, when we entered thebuilding we found Dr. Davidson hanging up his apron and preparing todepart."Sorry I couldn't wait for you," he said, with no great show ofsincerity, "but a _post-mortem_ is a mere farce in a case like this; youhave seen all that there was to see. However, there is the body; Harthasn't closed it up yet."With this and a curt "good-afternoon" he departed."I must apologize for Dr. Davidson, sir," said Hart, looking up with avexed face from the desk at which he was writing out his notes."You needn't," said Thorndyke; "you didn't supply him with manners; anddon't let me disturb you. I only want to verify one or two points."Accepting the hint, Hart and I remained at the desk, while Thorndyke,removing his hat, advanced to the long slate table, and bent over itsburden of pitiful tragedy. For some time he remained motionless, runninghis eye gravely over the corpse, in search, no doubt, of bruises andindications of a struggle. Then he stooped and narrowly examined thewound, especially at its commencement and end. Suddenly he drew nearer,peering intently as if something had attracted his attention, and havingtaken out his lens, fetched a small sponge, with which he dried anexposed process of the spine. Holding his lens before the dried spot, heagain scrutinized it closely, and then, with a scalpel and forceps,detached some object, which he carefully washed, and then once moreexamined through his lens as it lay in the palm of his hand. Finally, asI expected, he brought forth his "collecting-box," took from it aseed-envelope, into which he dropped the object--evidently somethingquite small--closed up the envelope, wrote on the outside of it, andreplaced it in the box."I think I have seen all that I wanted to see," he said, as he pocketedthe box and took up his hat. "We shall meet to-morrow morning at theinquest." He shook hands with Hart, and we went out into the relativelypure air.On one pretext or another, Thorndyke lingered about the neighbourhood ofAldgate until a church bell struck six, when he bent his steps towardsHarrow Alley. Through the narrow, winding passage he walked, slowly andwith a thoughtful mien, along Little Somerset Street and out intoMansell Street, until just on the stroke of a quarter-past we foundourselves opposite the little tobacconist's shop.Thorndyke glanced at his watch and halted, looking keenly up the street.A moment later he hastily took from his pocket the cardboard box, fromwhich he extracted the two mounted photographs which had puzzled me somuch. They now seemed to puzzle Thorndyke equally, to judge by hisexpression, for he held them close to his eyes, scrutinizing them withan anxious frown, and backing by degrees into the doorway at the side ofthe tobacconist's. At this moment I became aware of a man who, as heapproached, seemed to eye my friend with some curiosity and moredisfavour; a very short, burly young man, apparently a foreign Jew,whose face, naturally sinister and unprepossessing, was furtherdisfigured by the marks of smallpox."Excuse me," he said brusquely, pushing past Thorndyke; "I live here.""I am sorry," responded Thorndyke. He moved aside, and then suddenlyasked: "By the way, I suppose you do not by any chance understandYiddish?""Why do you ask?" the newcomer demanded gruffly."Because I have just had these two photographs of lettering given tome. One is in Greek, I think, and one in Yiddish, but I have forgottenwhich is which." He held out the two cards to the stranger, who tookthem from him, and looked at them with scowling curiosity."This one is Yiddish," said he, raising his right hand, "and this otheris Russian, not Greek." He held out the two cards to Thorndyke, who tookthem from him, holding them carefully by the edges as before."I am greatly obliged to you for your kind assistance," said Thorndyke;but before he had time to finish his thanks, the man had entered, bymeans of his latchkey, and slammed the door.Thorndyke carefully slid the photographs back into their grooves,replaced the box in his pocket, and made an entry in his notebook."That," said he, "finishes my labours, with the exception of a smallexperiment which I can perform at home. By the way, I picked up a morselof evidence that Davidson had overlooked. He will be annoyed, and I amnot very fond of scoring off a colleague; but he is too uncivil for meto communicate with."       *       *       *       *       *The coroner's subpoena had named ten o'clock as the hour at whichThorndyke was to attend to give evidence, but a consultation with awell-known solicitor so far interfered with his plans that we were aquarter of an hour late in starting from the Temple. My friend wasevidently in excellent spirits, though silent and preoccupied, fromwhich I inferred that he was satisfied with the results of his labours;but, as I sat by his side in the hansom, I forbore to question him, notfrom mere unselfishness, but rather from the desire to hear hisevidence for the first time in conjunction with that of the otherwitnesses.The room in which the inquest was held formed part of a school adjoiningthe mortuary. Its vacant bareness was on this occasion enlivened by along, baize-covered table, at the head of which sat the coroner, whileone side was occupied by the jury; and I was glad to observe that thelatter consisted, for the most part, of genuine working men, instead ofthe stolid-faced, truculent "professional jurymen" who so often gracethese tribunals.A row of chairs accommodated the witnesses, a corner of the table wasallotted to the accused woman's solicitor, a smart dapper gentleman ingold pince-nez, a portion of one side to the reporters, and severalranks of benches were occupied by a miscellaneous assembly representingthe public.There were one or two persons present whom I was somewhat surprised tosee. There was, for instance, our pock-marked acquaintance of MansellStreet, who greeted us with a stare of hostile surprise; and there wasSuperintendent Miller of Scotland Yard, in whose manner I seemed todetect some kind of private understanding with Thorndyke. But I hadlittle time to look about me, for when we arrived, the proceedings hadalready commenced. Mrs. Goldstein, the first witness, was finishing herrecital of the circumstances under which the crime was discovered, and,as she retired, weeping hysterically, she was followed by looks ofcommiseration from the sympathetic jurymen.The next witness was a young woman named Kate Silver. As she steppedforward to be sworn she flung a glance of hatred and defiance at MiriamGoldstein, who, white-faced and wild of aspect, with her red hairstreaming in dishevelled masses on to her shoulders, stood apart incustody of two policemen, staring about her as if in a dream."You were intimately acquainted with the deceased, I believe?" said thecoroner."I was. We worked at the same place for a long time--the EmpireRestaurant in Fenchurch Street--and we lived in the same house. She wasmy most intimate friend.""Had she, as far as you know, any friends or relations in England?""No. She came to England from Bremen about three years ago. It was thenthat I made her acquaintance. All her relations were in Germany, but shehad many friends here, because she was a very lively, amiable girl.""Had she, as far as you know, any enemies--any persons, I mean, who boreany grudge against her and were likely to do her an injury?""Yes. Miriam Goldstein was her enemy. She hated her.""You say Miriam Goldstein hated the deceased. How do you know that?""She made no secret of it. They had had a violent quarrel about a youngman named Moses Cohen. He was formerly Miriam's sweetheart, and I thinkthey were very fond of one another until Minna Adler came to lodge atthe Goldsteins' house about three months ago. Then Moses took a fancy toMinna, and she encouraged him, although she had a sweetheart of her own,a young man named Paul Petrofsky, who also lodged in the Goldsteins'house. At last Moses broke off with Miriam, and engaged himself toMinna. Then Miriam was furious, and complained to Minna about what shecalled her perfidious conduct; but Minna only laughed, and told her shecould have Petrofsky instead.""And what did Minna say to that?" asked the coroner."She was still more angry, because Moses Cohen is a smart, good-lookingyoung man, while Petrofsky is not much to look at. Besides, Miriam didnot like Petrofsky; he had been rude to her, and she had made her fathersend him away from the house. So they were not friends, and it was justafter that that the trouble came.""The trouble?""I mean about Moses Cohen. Miriam is a very passionate girl, and she wasfuriously jealous of Minna, so when Petrofsky annoyed her by tauntingher about Moses Cohen and Minna, she lost her temper, and said dreadfulthings about both of them.""As, for instance--?""She said that she would kill them both, and that she would like to cutMinna's throat.""When was this?""It was the day before the murder.""Who heard her say these things besides you?""Another lodger named Edith Bryant and Petrofsky. We were all standingin the hall at the time.""But I thought you said Petrofsky had been turned away from the house.""So he had, a week before; but he had left a box in his room, and onthis day he had come to fetch it. That was what started the trouble.Miriam had taken his room for her bedroom, and turned her old one into aworkroom. She said he should not go to her room to fetch his box.""And did he?""I think so. Miriam and Edith and I went out, leaving him in the hall.When we came back the box was gone, and, as Mrs. Goldstein was in thekitchen and there was nobody else in the house, he must have taken it.""You spoke of Miriam's workroom. What work did she do?""She cut stencils for a firm of decorators."Here the coroner took a peculiarly shaped knife from the table beforehim, and handed it to the witness."Have you ever seen that knife before?" he asked."Yes. It belongs to Miriam Goldstein. It is a stencil-knife that sheused in her work."This concluded the evidence of Kate Silver, and when the name of thenext witness, Paul Petrofsky, was called, our Mansell Street friend cameforward to be sworn. His evidence was quite brief, and merelycorroborative of that of Kate Silver, as was that of the next witness,Edith Bryant. When these had been disposed of, the coroner announced:"Before taking the medical evidence, gentlemen, I propose to hear thatof the police-officers, and first we will call Detective-sergeant AlfredBates."The sergeant stepped forward briskly, and proceeded to give his evidencewith official readiness and precision."I was called by Constable Simmonds at eleven-forty-nine, and reachedthe house at two minutes to twelve in company with Inspector Harris andDivisional Surgeon Davidson. When I arrived Dr. Hart, Dr. Thorndyke, andDr. Jervis were already in the room. I found the deceased woman, MinnaAdler, lying in bed with her throat cut. She was dead and cold. Therewere no signs of a struggle, and the bed did not appear to have beendisturbed. There was a table by the bedside on which was a book and anempty candlestick. The candle had apparently burnt out, for there wasonly a piece of charred wick at the bottom of the socket. A box had beenplaced on the floor at the head of the bed and a hassock stood on it.Apparently the murderer had stood on the hassock and leaned over thehead of the bed to commit the murder. This was rendered necessary by theposition of the table, which could not have been moved without makingsome noise and perhaps disturbing the deceased. I infer from thepresence of the box and hassock that the murderer is a short person.""Was there anything else that seemed to fix the identity of themurderer?""Yes. A tress of a woman's red hair was grasped in the left hand of thedeceased."As the detective uttered this statement, a simultaneous shriek of horrorburst from the accused woman and her mother. Mrs. Goldstein sankhalf-fainting on to a bench, while Miriam, pale as death, stood as onepetrified, fixing the detective with a stare of terror, as he drew fromhis pocket two small paper packets, which he opened and handed to thecoroner."The hair in the packet marked _A_," said he, "is that which was foundin the hand of the deceased; that in the packet marked _B_ is the hairof Miriam Goldstein."Here the accused woman's solicitor rose. "Where did you obtain the hairin the packet marked _B_?" he demanded."I took it from a bag of combings that hung on the wall of MiriamGoldstein's bedroom," answered the detective."I object to this," said the solicitor. "There is no evidence that thehair from that bag was the hair of Miriam Goldstein at all."Thorndyke chuckled softly. "The lawyer is as dense as the policeman," heremarked to me in an undertone. "Neither of them seems to see thesignificance of that bag in the least.""Did you know about the bag, then?" I asked in surprise."No. I thought it was the hair-brush."I gazed at my colleague in amazement, and was about to ask for someelucidation of this cryptic reply, when he held up his finger and turnedagain to listen."Very well, Mr. Horwitz," the coroner was saying, "I will make a note ofyour objection, but I shall allow the sergeant to continue hisevidence."The solicitor sat down, and the detective resumed his statement."I have examined and compared the two samples of hair, and it is myopinion that they are from the head of the same person. The only otherobservation that I made in the room was that there was a small quantityof silver sand sprinkled on the pillow around the deceased woman'shead.""Silver sand!" exclaimed the coroner. "Surely that is a very singularmaterial to find on a woman's pillow?""I think it is easily explained," replied the sergeant. "The wash-handbasin was full of bloodstained water, showing that the murderer hadwashed his--or her--hands, and probably the knife, too, after the crime.On the washstand was a ball of sand-soap, and I imagine that themurderer used this to cleanse his--or her--hands, and, while dryingthem, must have stood over the head of the bed and let the sandsprinkle down on to the pillow.""A simple but highly ingenious explanation," commented the coronerapprovingly, and the jurymen exchanged admiring nods and nudges."I searched the rooms occupied by the accused woman, Miriam Goldstein,and found there a knife of the kind used by stencil cutters, but largerthan usual. There were stains of blood on it which the accused explainedby saying that she cut her finger some days ago. She admitted that theknife was hers."This concluded the sergeant's evidence, and he was about to sit downwhen the solicitor rose."I should like to ask this witness one or two questions," said he, andthe coroner having nodded assent, he proceeded: "Has the finger of theaccused been examined since her arrest?""I believe not," replied the sergeant. "Not to my knowledge, at anyrate."The solicitor noted the reply, and then asked: "With reference to thesilver sand, did you find any at the bottom of the wash-hand basin?"The sergeant's face reddened. "I did not examine the wash-hand basin,"he answered."Did anybody examine it?""I think not.""Thank you." Mr. Horwitz sat down, and the triumphant squeak of hisquill pen was heard above the muttered disapproval of the jury."We shall now take the evidence of the doctors, gentlemen," said thecoroner, "and we will begin with that of the divisional surgeon. You sawthe deceased, I believe, Doctor," he continued, when Dr. Davidson hadbeen sworn, "soon after the discovery of the murder, and you have sincethen made an examination of the body?""Yes. I found the body of the deceased lying in her bed, which hadapparently not been disturbed. She had been dead about ten hours, andrigidity was complete in the limbs but not in the trunk. The cause ofdeath was a deep wound extending right across the throat and dividingall the structures down to the spine. It had been inflicted with asingle sweep of a knife while deceased was lying down, and was evidentlyhomicidal. It was not possible for the deceased to have inflicted thewound herself. It was made with a single-edged knife, drawn from left toright; the assailant stood on a hassock placed on a box at the head ofthe bed and leaned over to strike the blow. The murderer is probablyquite a short person, very muscular, and right-handed. There was no signof a struggle, and, judging by the nature of the injuries, I should saythat death was almost instantaneous. In the left hand of the deceasedwas a small tress of a woman's red hair. I have compared that hair withthat of the accused, and am of opinion that it is her hair.""You were shown a knife belonging to the accused?""Yes; a stencil-knife. There were stains of dried blood on it which Ihave examined and find to be mammalian blood. It is probably humanblood, but I cannot say with certainty that it is.""Could the wound have been inflicted with this knife?""Yes, though it is a small knife to produce so deep a wound. Still, itis quite possible."The coroner glanced at Mr. Horwitz. "Do you wish to ask this witness anyquestions?" he inquired."If you please, sir," was the reply. The solicitor rose, and, havingglanced through his notes, commenced: "You have described certainblood-stains on this knife. But we have heard that there wasblood-stained water in the wash-hand basin, and it is suggested, mostreasonably, that the murderer washed his hands and the knife. But if theknife was washed, how do you account for the bloodstains on it?""Apparently the knife was not washed, only the hands.""But is not that highly improbable?""No, I think not.""You say that there was no struggle, and that death was practicallyinstantaneous, but yet the deceased had torn out a lock of themurderess's hair. Are not those two statements inconsistent with oneanother?""No. The hair was probably grasped convulsively at the moment of death.At any rate, the hair was undoubtedly in the dead woman's hand.""Is it possible to identify positively the hair of any individual?""No. Not with certainty. But this is very peculiar hair."The solicitor sat down, and, Dr. Hart having been called, and havingbriefly confirmed the evidence of his principal, the coroner announced:"The next witness, gentleman, is Dr. Thorndyke, who was present almostaccidentally, but was actually the first on the scene of the murder. Hehas since made an examination of the body, and will, no doubt, be ableto throw some further light on this horrible crime."Thorndyke stood up, and, having been sworn, laid on the table a smallbox with a leather handle. Then, in answer to the coroner's questions,he described himself as the lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence at St.Margaret's Hospital, and briefly explained his connection with thecase. At this point the foreman of the jury interrupted to ask that hisopinion might be taken on the hair and the knife, as these were mattersof contention, and the objects in question were accordingly handed tohim."Is the hair in the packet marked _A_ in your opinion from the sameperson as that in the packet marked _B_?" the coroner asked."I have no doubt that they are from the same person," was the reply."Will you examine this knife and tell us if the wound on the deceasedmight have been inflicted with it?"Thorndyke examined the blade attentively, and then handed the knife backto the coroner."The wound might have been inflicted with this knife," said he, "but Iam quite sure it was not.""Can you give us your reasons for that very definite opinion?""I think," said Thorndyke, "that it will save time if I give you thefacts in a connected order." The coroner bowed assent, and he proceeded:"I will not waste your time by reiterating facts already stated.Sergeant Bates has fully described the state of the room, and I havenothing to add on that subject. Dr. Davidson's description of the bodycovers all the facts: the woman had been dead about ten hours, the woundwas unquestionably homicidal, and was inflicted in the manner that hehas described. Death was apparently instantaneous, and I should say thatthe deceased never awakened from her sleep.""But," objected the coroner, "the deceased held a lock of hair in herhand.""That hair," replied Thorndyke, "was not the hair of the murderer. Itwas placed in the hand of the corpse for an obvious purpose; and thefact that the murderer had brought it with him shows that the crime waspremeditated, and that it was committed by someone who had had access tothe house and was acquainted with its inmates."As Thorndyke made this statement, coroner, jurymen, and spectators alikegazed at him in open-mouthed amazement. There was an interval of intensesilence, broken by a wild, hysteric laugh from Mrs. Goldstein, and thenthe coroner asked:"How did you know that the hair in the hand of the corpse was not thatof the murderer?""The inference was very obvious. At the first glance the peculiar andconspicuous colour of the hair struck me as suspicious. But there werethree facts, each of which was in itself sufficient to prove that thehair was probably not that of the murderer."In the first place there was the condition of the hand. When a person,at the moment of death, grasps any object firmly, there is set up acondition known as cadaveric spasm. The muscular contraction passesimmediately into _rigor mortis_, or death-stiffening, and the objectremains grasped by the dead hand until the rigidity passes off. In thiscase the hand was perfectly rigid, but it did not grasp the hair at all.The little tress lay in the palm quite loosely and the hand was onlypartially closed. Obviously the hair had been placed in it after death.The other two facts had reference to the condition of the hair itself.Now, when a lock of hair is torn from the head, it is evident that allthe roots will be found at the same end of the lock. But in the presentinstance this was not the case; the lock of hair which lay in the deadwoman's hand had roots at both ends, and so could not have been tornfrom the head of the murderer. But the third fact that I observed wasstill more conclusive. The hairs of which that little tress was composedhad not been pulled out at all. They had fallen out spontaneously. Theywere, in fact, shed hairs--probably combings. Let me explain thedifference. When a hair is shed naturally, it drops out of the littletube in the skin called the root sheath, having been pushed out by theyoung hair growing up underneath; the root end of such a shed hair showsnothing but a small bulbous enlargement--the root bulb. But when a hairis forcibly pulled out, its root drags out the root sheath with it, andthis can be plainly seen as a glistening mass on the end of the hair. IfMiriam Goldstein will pull out a hair and pass it to me, I will show youthe great difference between hair which is pulled out and hair which isshed."[Illustration: _A_, SHED HAIRS SHOWING THE NAKED BULB, MAGNIFIED 32DIAMETERS._B_, HAIRS PLUCKED FROM SCALP, SHOWING THE ADHERENT ROOT-SHEATHS,MAGNIFIED 20 DIAMETERS.]The unfortunate Miriam needed no pressing. In a twinkling she hadtweaked out a dozen hairs, which a constable handed across to Thorndyke,by whom they were at once fixed in a paper-clip. A second clip beingproduced from the box, half a dozen hairs taken from the tress which hadbeen found in the dead woman's hand were fixed in it. Then Thorndykehanded the two clips, together with a lens, to the coroner."Remarkable!" exclaimed the latter, "and most conclusive." He passed theobjects on to the foreman, and there was an interval of silence whilethe jury examined them with breathless interest and much facialcontortion."The next question," resumed Thorndyke, "was, Whence did the murdererobtain these hairs? I assumed that they had been taken from MiriamGoldstein's hair-brush; but the sergeant's evidence makes it prettyclear that they were obtained from the very bag of combings from whichhe took a sample for comparison.""I think, Doctor," remarked the coroner, "you have disposed of the hairclue pretty completely. May I ask if you found anything that might throwany light on the identity of the murderer?""Yes," replied Thorndyke, "I observed certain things which determine theidentity of the murderer quite conclusively." He turned a significantglance on Superintendent Miller, who immediately rose, stepped quietlyto the door, and then returned, putting something into his pocket. "WhenI entered the hall," Thorndyke continued, "I noted the following facts:Behind the door was a shelf on which were two china candlesticks. Eachwas fitted with a candle, and in one was a short candle-end, about aninch long, lying in the tray. On the floor, close to the mat, was a spotof candle-wax and some faint marks of muddy feet. The oil-cloth on thestairs also bore faint footmarks, made by wet goloshes. They wereascending the stairs, and grew fainter towards the top. There were twomore spots of candle-wax on the stairs, and one on the handrail; a burntend of a wax match halfway up the stairs, and another on the landing.There were no descending footmarks, but one of the spots of wax close tothe balusters had been trodden on while warm and soft, and bore the markof the front of the heel of a golosh descending the stairs. The lock ofthe street door had been recently oiled, as had also that of the bedroomdoor, and the latter had been unlocked from outside with a bent wire,which had made a mark on the key. Inside the room I made two furtherobservations. One was that the dead woman's pillow was lightly sprinkledwith sand, somewhat like silver sand, but greyer and less gritty. Ishall return to this presently."The other was that the candlestick on the bedside table was empty. Itwas a peculiar candlestick, having a skeleton socket formed of eightflat strips of metal. The charred wick of a burnt-out candle was at thebottom of the socket, but a little fragment of wax on the top edgeshowed that another candle had been stuck in it and had been taken out,for otherwise that fragment would have been melted. I at once thought ofthe candle-end in the hall, and when I went down again I took that endfrom the tray and examined it. On it I found eight distinct markscorresponding to the eight bars of the candlestick in the bedroom. Ithad been carried in the right hand of some person, for the warm, softwax had taken beautifully clear impressions of a right thumb andforefinger. I took three moulds of the candle-end in moulding wax, andfrom these moulds have made this cement cast, which shows both thefingerprints and the marks of the candlestick." He took from his box asmall white object, which he handed to the coroner."And what do you gather from these facts?" asked the coroner."I gather that at about a quarter to two on the morning of the crime, aman (who had, on the previous day visited the house to obtain the tressof hair and oil the locks) entered the house by means of a latchkey. Wecan fix the time by the fact that it rained on that morning fromhalf-past one to a quarter to two, this being the only rain that hasfallen for a fortnight, and the murder was committed at about twoo'clock. The man lit a wax match in the hall and another halfway up thestairs. He found the bedroom door locked, and turned the key fromoutside with a bent wire. He entered, lit the candle, placed the box andhassock, murdered his victim, washed his hands and knife, took thecandle-end from the socket and went downstairs, where he blew out thecandle and dropped it into the tray."The next clue is furnished by the sand on the pillow. I took a littleof it, and examined it under the microscope, when it turned out to bedeep-sea sand from the Eastern Mediterranean. It was full of the minuteshells called 'Foraminifera,' and as one of these happened to belong toa species which is found only in the Levant, I was able to fix thelocality.""But this is very remarkable," said the coroner. "How on earth coulddeep-sea sand have got on to this woman's pillow?""The explanation," replied Thorndyke, "is really quite simple. Sand ofthis kind is contained in considerable quantities in Turkey sponges. Thewarehouses in which the sponges are unpacked are often strewn with itankle deep; the men who unpack the cases become dusted over with it,their clothes saturated and their pockets filled with it. If such aperson, with his clothes and pockets full of sand, had committed thismurder, it is pretty certain that in leaning over the head of the bed ina partly inverted position he would have let fall a certain quantity ofthe sand from his pockets and the interstices of his clothing. Now, assoon as I had examined this sand and ascertained its nature, I sent amessage to Mr. Goldstein asking him for a list of the persons who wereacquainted with the deceased, with their addresses and occupations. Hesent me the list by return, and among the persons mentioned was a manwho was engaged as a packer in a wholesale sponge warehouse in theMinories. I further ascertained that the new season's crop of Turkeysponges had arrived a few days before the murder."The question that now arose was, whether this sponge-packer was theperson whose fingerprints I had found on the candle-end. To settle thispoint, I prepared two mounted photographs, and having contrived to meetthe man at his door on his return from work, I induced him to look atthem and compare them. He took them from me, holding each one between aforefinger and thumb. When he returned them to me, I took them home andcarefully dusted each on both sides with a certain surgicaldusting-powder. The powder adhered to the places where his fingers andthumbs had pressed against the photographs, showing the fingerprintsvery distinctly. Those of the right hand were identical with the printson the candle, as you will see if you compare them with the cast." Heproduced from the box the photograph of the Yiddish lettering, on theblack margin of which there now stood out with startling distinctness ayellowish-white print of a thumb.Thorndyke had just handed the card to the coroner when a very singulardisturbance arose. While my friend had been giving the latter part ofhis evidence, I had observed the man Petrofsky rise from his seat andwalk stealthily across to the door. He turned the handle softly andpulled, at first gently, and then with more force. But the door waslocked. As he realized this, Petrofsky seized the handle with bothhands and tore at it furiously, shaking it to and fro with the violenceof a madman, and his shaking limbs, his starting eyes, glaring insanelyat the astonished spectators, his ugly face, dead white, running withsweat and hideous with terror, made a picture that was truly shocking.Suddenly he let go the handle, and with a horrible cry thrust his handunder the skirt of his coat and rushed at Thorndyke. But thesuperintendent was ready for this. There was a shout and a scuffle, andthen Petrofsky was born down, kicking and biting like a maniac, whileMiller hung on to his right hand and the formidable knife that itgrasped.[Illustration: SUPERINTENDENT MILLER RISES TO THE OCCASION.]"I will ask you to hand that knife to the coroner," said Thorndyke, whenPetrofsky had been secured and handcuffed, and the superintendent hadreadjusted his collar. "Will you kindly examine it, sir," he continued,"and tell me if there is a notch in the edge, near to the point--atriangular notch about an eighth of an inch long?"The coroner looked at the knife, and then said in a tone of surprise:"Yes, there is. You have seen this knife before, then?""No, I have not," replied Thorndyke. "But perhaps I had better continuemy statement. There is no need for me to tell you that the fingerprintson the card and on the candle are those of Paul Petrofsky; I willproceed to the evidence furnished by the body."In accordance with your order, I went to the mortuary and examined thecorpse of the deceased. The wound has been fully and accuratelydescribed by Dr. Davidson, but I observed one fact which I presume hehad overlooked. Embedded in the bone of the spine--in the lefttransverse process of the fourth vertebra--I discovered a small particleof steel, which I carefully extracted."He drew his collecting-box from his pocket, and taking from it aseed-envelope, handed the latter to the coroner. "That fragment of steelis in this envelope," he said, "and it is possible that it maycorrespond to the notch in the knife-blade."Amidst an intense silence the coroner opened the little envelope, andlet the fragment of steel drop on to a sheet of paper. Laying the knifeon the paper, he gently pushed the fragment towards the notch. Then helooked up at Thorndyke."It fits exactly," said he.There was a heavy thud at the other end of the room and we all lookedround.Petrofsky had fallen on to the floor insensible.       *       *       *       *       *"An instructive case, Jervis," remarked Thorndyke, as we walkedhomewards--"a case that reiterates the lesson that the authorities stillrefuse to learn.""What is that?" I asked."It is this. When it is discovered that a murder has been committed, thescene of that murder should instantly become as the Palace of theSleeping Beauty. Not a grain of dust should be moved, not a soul shouldbe allowed to approach it, until the scientific observer has seeneverything _in situ_ and absolutely undisturbed. No tramplings ofexcited constables, no rummaging by detectives, no scrambling to and froof bloodhounds. Consider what would have happened in this case if we hadarrived a few hours later. The corpse would have been in the mortuary,the hair in the sergeant's pocket, the bed rummaged and the sandscattered abroad, the candle probably removed, and the stairs coveredwith fresh tracks."There would not have been the vestige of a clue.""And," I added, "the deep sea would have uttered its message in vain."THE END.End of Project Gutenberg's John Thorndyke's Cases, by R.

Down the Rabbit-HoleAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on thebank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into thebook her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations init, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures orconversations?'So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for thehot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasureof making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up andpicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ranclose by her.There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it soVERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, itoccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the timeit all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCHOUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she hadnever before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watchto take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the fieldafter it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a largerabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering howin the world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and thendipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to thinkabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deepwell.Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she hadplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what wasgoing to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out whatshe was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then shelooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled withcupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictureshung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves asshe passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her greatdisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fearof killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards asshe fell past it.'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shallthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me athome! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the topof the house!' (Which was very likely true.)Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder howmany miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be gettingsomewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be fourthousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt severalthings of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though thiswas not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as therewas no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)'--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitudeor Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, orLongitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH theearth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk withtheir heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather gladthere WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all theright word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the countryis, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (andshe tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're fallingthrough the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what anignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do toask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon begantalking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk attea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are nomice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's verylike a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alicebegan to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamysort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Dobats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozingoff, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand withDinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upona heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was anotherlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, andwas just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my earsand whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when sheturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she foundherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hangingfrom the roof.There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and whenAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying everydoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever toget out again.Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solidglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice'sfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the secondtime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, andbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried thelittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, notmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passageinto the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out ofthat dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers andthose cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through thedoorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'itwould be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I couldshut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.'For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were reallyimpossible.There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she wentback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or atany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: thistime she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not herebefore,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paperlabel, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in largeletters.It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice wasnot going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'andsee whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nicelittle histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wildbeasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not rememberthe simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hotpoker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut yourfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had neverforgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it isalmost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to tasteit, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavourof cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hotbuttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.  *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  *    *    *    *    *    *    *'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like atelescope.'And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her facebrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for goingthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, shewaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' saidAlice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonderwhat I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of acandle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not rememberever having seen such a thing.After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on goinginto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to thedoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when shewent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reachit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried herbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thingsat down and cried.'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself,rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generallygave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears intoher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for havingcheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' saidAlice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if itmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'llget into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Whichway?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it wasgrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the samesize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alicehad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-waythings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go onin the common way.So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.  *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  *    *    *    *    *    *    *CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, thatfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'mopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out ofsight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonderwho will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure_I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to troublemyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must bekind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I wantto go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They mustgo by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sendingpresents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!     ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.       HEARTHRUG,         NEAR THE FENDER,           (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she wasnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little goldenkey and hurried off to the garden door.Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, tolook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was morehopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl likeyou,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! Stop thismoment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons oftears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inchesdeep and reaching half down the hall.After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, andshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the WhiteRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves inone hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a greathurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt sodesperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbitcame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--'The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, shekept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! Howqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I thesame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling alittle different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Whoin the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began thinkingover all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, tosee if she could have been changed for any of them.'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such longringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can'tbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such avery little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzlingit all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let mesee: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, andfour times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, andRome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed forMabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' and she crossed herhands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come thesame as they used to do:--     'How doth the little crocodile      Improve his shining tail,     And pour the waters of the Nile      On every golden scale!     'How cheerfully he seems to grin,      How neatly spread his claws,     And welcome little fishes in      With gently smiling jaws!''I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyesfilled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, andI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next tono toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I'vemade up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be nouse their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" Ishall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down heretill I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burstof tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tiredof being all alone here!'As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to seethat she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves whileshe was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I mustbe growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measureherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was nowabout two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon foundout that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she droppedit hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at thesudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'andnow for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key waslying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that shehad somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back byrailway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once inher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you goto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in thesea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a rowof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soonmade out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when shewas nine feet high.'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, tryingto find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, bybeing drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!However, everything is queer to-day.'Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little wayoff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thoughtit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how smallshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that hadslipped in like herself.'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think verylikely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So shebegan: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tiredof swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the rightway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, butshe remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--ofa mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her ratherinquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,but it said nothing.'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it'sa French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with allher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long agoanything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' whichwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave asudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurtthe poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.''Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'WouldYOU like cats if you were me?''Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angryabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'dtake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quietthing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in thepool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws andwashing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she'ssuch a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' criedAlice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and shefelt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her anymore if you'd rather not.''We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of histail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATEDcats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!''I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject ofconversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did notanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog nearour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, youknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things whenyou throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sortsof things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! Hesays it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowfultone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimmingaway from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion inthe pool as it went.So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and wewon't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When theMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: itsface was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a lowtrembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you myhistory, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with thebirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led theway, and the whole party swam to the shore.CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long TaleThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--thebirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging closeto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had aconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite naturalto Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she hadknown them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with theLory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older thanyou, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow withoutknowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell itsage, there was no more to be said.At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make youdry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mousein the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she feltsure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? Thisis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! "Williamthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submittedto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late muchaccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls ofMercia and Northumbria--"''Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Didyou speak?''Not I!' said the Lory hastily.'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. "Edwin and Morcar,the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--"''Found WHAT?' said the Duck.'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what"it" means.''I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said theDuck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did thearchbishop find?'The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '"--foundit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him thecrown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of hisNormans--" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turningto Alice as it spoke.'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem todry me at all.''In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I movethat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energeticremedies--''Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of halfthose long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' Andthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birdstittered audibly.'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, thatthe best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.''What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, asyou might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tellyou how the Dodo managed it.)First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exactshape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placedalong the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, andaway,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when theyliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowdedround it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the picturesof him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.''But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confusedway, 'Prizes! Prizes!'Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in herpocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water hadnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly onea-piece all round.'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got inyour pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnlypresented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegantthimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so gravethat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anythingto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as shecould.The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise andconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not tastetheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, andbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and whyit is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that itwould be offended again.'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, andsighing.'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder atthe Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzlingabout it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale wassomething like this:--         'Fury said to a         mouse, That he        met in the       house,     "Let us      both go to       law: I will        prosecute         YOU.--Come,           I'll take no           denial; We          must have a        trial: For      really this     morning I've    nothing    to do."     Said the      mouse to the       cur, "Such        a trial,         dear Sir,            With          no jury        or judge,       would be      wasting      our      breath."       "I'll be        judge, I'll         be jury,"            Said         cunning          old Fury:          "I'll          try the            whole            cause,              and           condemn           you          to           death."''You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely. 'What are youthinking of?''I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifthbend, I think?''I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and lookinganxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me help to undo it!''I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up and walkingaway. 'You insult me by talking such nonsense!''I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. 'But you're so easily offended,you know!'The Mouse only growled in reply.'Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after it; and theothers all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shookits head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quiteout of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to herdaughter 'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to loseYOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the young Crab, a littlesnappishly. 'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!''I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressingnobody in particular. 'She'd soon fetch it back!''And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' said theLory.Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:'Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice youcan't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of thebirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up verycarefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-airdoesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice toits children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!'On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholytone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the bestcat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see youany more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt verylonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again hearda little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked upeagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was comingback to finish his story.CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little BillIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and lookinganxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heardit muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Ohmy fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets areferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in amoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they werenowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim inthe pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,had vanished completely.Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, andcalled out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doingout here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at oncein the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake ithad made.'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'Howsurprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take himhis fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, shecame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brassplate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in withoutknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet thereal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found thefan and gloves.'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages fora rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And shebegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice! Comehere directly, and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a minute,nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don'tthink,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if itbegan ordering people about like that!'By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a tablein the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairsof tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a littlebottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this timewith the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put itto her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she saidto herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see whatthis bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for reallyI'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she haddrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily putdown the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan'tgrow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn'tdrunk quite so much!'Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute therewas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down withone elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm outof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now Ican do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as thereseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the roomagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn'talways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice andrabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--andyet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder whatCAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied thatkind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when Igrow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowfultone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.''But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I amnow? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--butthen--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!''Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learnlessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at allfor any lesson-books!'And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and makingquite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she hearda voice outside, and stopped to listen.'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!'Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it wasthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook thehouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as largeas the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, asthe door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'llgo round and get in at the window.''THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fanciedshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out herhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into acucumber-frame, or something of the sort.Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' Andthen a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Diggingfor apples, yer honour!''Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come andhelp me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?''Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the wholewindow!''Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.''Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispersnow and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, atall!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out herhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there wereTWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number ofcucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll donext! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'msure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came arumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voicesall talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the otherladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'emtogether first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'lldo well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of thisrope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's comingdown! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, Ifancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That Iwon't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're togo down the chimney!''Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice toherself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be inBill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; butI THINK I can kick a little!'She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waitedtill she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited tosee what would happen next.The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!'then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' thensilence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandynow--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tellus all about it!'Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thoughtAlice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'ma deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at melike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!''So you did, old fellow!' said the others.'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice calledout as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!'There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'Iwonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take theroof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, andAlice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.''A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at thewindow, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,'she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!'which produced another dead silence.Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning intolittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into herhead. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to makeSOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it mustmake me smaller, I suppose.'So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that shebegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get throughthe door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of littleanimals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, wasin the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving itsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment sheappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herselfsafe in a thick wood.'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wanderedabout in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the secondthing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will bethe best plan.'It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simplyarranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest ideahow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously amongthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in agreat hurry.An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, andfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; butshe was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might behungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite ofall her coaxing.Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, andheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air offall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on theother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled headover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it wasvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting everymoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; thenthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a verylittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarselyall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, withits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so sheset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, andtill the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leantagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of theleaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'donly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten thatI've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? Isuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the greatquestion is, what?'The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her atthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything thatlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height asherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, andbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see whatwas on the top of it.She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of themushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a longhookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.CHAPTER V. Advice from a CaterpillarThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressedher in a languid, sleepy voice.'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I knowwho I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have beenchanged several times since then.''What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explainyourself!''I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm notmyself, you see.''I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so manydifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.''It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when youhave to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and thenafter that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a littlequeer, won't you?''Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I knowis, it would feel very queer to ME.''You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERYshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.''Why?' said the Caterpillar.Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of anygood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasantstate of mind, she turned away.'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something importantto say!'This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as shecould.'No,' said the Caterpillar.Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, andperhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For someminutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded itsarms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you thinkyou're changed, do you?''I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as Iused--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!''Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.'Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it all camedifferent!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.'Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.Alice folded her hands, and began:--   'You are old, Father William,' the young man said,    'And your hair has become very white;   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--    Do you think, at your age, it is right?'   'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,    'I feared it might injure the brain;   But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,    Why, I do it again and again.'   'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,    And have grown most uncommonly fat;   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--    Pray, what is the reason of that?'   'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,    'I kept all my limbs very supple   By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--    Allow me to sell you a couple?'   'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak    For anything tougher than suet;   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--    Pray how did you manage to do it?'   'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law,    And argued each case with my wife;   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,    Has lasted the rest of my life.'   'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose    That your eye was as steady as ever;   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--    What made you so awfully clever?'   'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'    Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs!   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?    Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!''That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the wordshave got altered.''It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, andthere was silence for some minutes.The Caterpillar was the first to speak.'What size do you want to be?' it asked.'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only onedoesn't like changing so often, you know.''I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her lifebefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.''It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearingitself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. Andshe thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easilyoffended!''You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put thehookah into its mouth and began smoking again.This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. Ina minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouthand yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off themushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make yougrow shorter.''One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself.'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked italoud; and in another moment it was out of sight.Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, tryingto make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectlyround, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last shestretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bitof the edge with each hand.'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little ofthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violentblow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she feltthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so sheset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressedso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open hermouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of thelefthand bit.  *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  *    *    *    *    *    *    *'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, whichchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulderswere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, wasan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of asea of green leaves that lay far below her.'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE myshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?'She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, shetried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that herneck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She hadjust succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was goingto dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the topsof the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss madeher draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, andwas beating her violently with its wings.'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!''Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seemsto suit them!''I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've triedhedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but thoseserpents! There's no pleasing them!'Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use insaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon;'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, Ihaven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!''I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning tosee its meaning.'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued thePigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking Ishould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down fromthe sky! Ugh, Serpent!''But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--''Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying toinvent something!''I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she rememberedthe number of changes she had gone through that day.'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepestcontempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONEwith such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no usedenying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted anegg!''I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthfulchild; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, youknow.''I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they'rea kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for aminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You'relooking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to mewhether you're a little girl or a serpent?''It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not lookingfor eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don'tlike them raw.''Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settleddown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well asshe could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, andevery now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while sheremembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, andshe set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at theother, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she hadsucceeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that itfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan donenow! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm goingto be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my rightsize: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS thatto be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an openplace, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever livesthere,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at therighthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till shehad brought herself down to nine inches high.CHAPTER VI. Pig and PepperFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering whatto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of thewood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him afish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was openedby another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like afrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled allover their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queento play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. Aninvitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into thewood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out theFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near thedoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that fortwo reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as youare; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one couldpossibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noisegoing on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and thena great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?''There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went onwithout attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance,if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and thisAlice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' shesaid to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' sherepeated, aloud.'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate cameskimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.'--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactlyas if nothing had happened.'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the firstquestion, you know.'It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's reallydreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.It's enough to drive one crazy!'The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating hisremark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, fordays and days.''But what am I to do?' said Alice.'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he'sperfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke fromone end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool inthe middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirringa large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,as well as she could for sneezing.There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchesssneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howlingalternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchenthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting onthe hearth and grinning from ear to ear.'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she wasnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'whyyour cat grins like that?''It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quitejumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't knowthat cats COULD grin.''They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.''I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quitepleased to have got into a conversation.'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it wouldbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While shewas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off thefire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach atthe Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed ashower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice ofthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down inan agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusuallylarge saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarsegrowl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.''Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to getan opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think ofwhat work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takestwenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--''Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to takethe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not tobe listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or isit twelve? I--''Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort oflullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end ofevery line:   'Speak roughly to your little boy,    And beat him when he sneezes:   He only does it to annoy,    Because he knows it teases.'         CHORUS. (In which the cook and the baby joined):--       'Wow! wow! wow!'While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossingthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,that Alice could hardly hear the words:--   'I speak severely to my boy,    I beat him when he sneezes;   For he can thoroughly enjoy    The pepper when he pleases!'         CHORUS.       'Wow! wow! wow!''Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice,flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to playcroquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threwa frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shapedlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'justlike a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snortinglike a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up andstraightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minuteor two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was totwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its rightear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carriedit out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it bemurder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and thelittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressingyourself.'The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face tosee what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it hada VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also itseyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did notlike the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,'she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were anytears.No, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mindnow!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossibleto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do withthis creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently,that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there couldbe NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and shefelt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to seeit trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she saidto herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makesrather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over otherchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just sayingto herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when shewas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of atree a few yards off.The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, shethought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so shefelt that it ought to be treated with respect.'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all knowwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would youtell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?''That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.'I don't much care where--' said Alice.'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk longenough.'Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.'What sort of people live about here?''In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'livesa Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a MarchHare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.''But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.You're mad.''How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And howdo you know that you're mad?''To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?''I suppose so,' said Alice.'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, andwag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.''I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with theQueen to-day?''I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invitedyet.''You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queerthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,it suddenly appeared again.'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearlyforgotten to ask.''It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come backin a natural way.'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did notappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction inwhich the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' shesaid to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, andperhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad asit was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Catagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing andvanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.''All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, whichremained some time after the rest of it had gone.'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grinwithout a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the houseof the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because thechimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. Itwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she hadnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself toabout two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almostwish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!'CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-PartyThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and theMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sittingbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as acushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Veryuncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, Isuppose it doesn't mind.'The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together atone corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alicecoming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she satdown in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' saidthe March Hare.'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a greatmany more than three.''Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alicefor some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with someseverity; 'it's very rude.'The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAIDwas, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?''Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they'vebegun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said theMarch Hare.'Exactly so,' said Alice.'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what Isay--that's the same thing, you know.''Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well saythat "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!''You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what Iget" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!''You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to betalking in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thingas "I sleep when I breathe"!''It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here theconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alicethought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,which wasn't much.The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the monthis it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of hispocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,and holding it to his ear.Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.''Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suitthe works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dippedit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think ofnothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,you know.'Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What afunny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn'ttell what o'clock it is!''Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you whatyear it is?''Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because itstays the same year for such a long time together.''Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have nosort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quiteunderstand you,' she said, as politely as she could.'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a littlehot tea upon its nose.The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening itseyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.''Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Aliceagain.'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?''I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.'Nor I,' said the March Hare.Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with thetime,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.''If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talkabout wasting IT. It's HIM.''I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!''Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat timewhen I learn music.''Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating.Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anythingyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock inthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper ahint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,time for dinner!'('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--Ishouldn't be hungry for it, you know.''Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it tohalf-past one as long as you liked.''Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'Wequarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointingwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concertgiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing     "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!     How I wonder what you're at!"You know the song, perhaps?''I've heard something like it,' said Alice.'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--     "Up above the world you fly,     Like a tea-tray in the sky.         Twinkle, twinkle--"'Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle,twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinchit to make it stop.'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when theQueen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the time! Off with hishead!"''How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won'tdo a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so manytea-things are put out here?' she asked.'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time,and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.''Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.''But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice venturedto ask.'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.''I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at theproposal.'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' Andthey pinched it on both sides at once.The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in ahoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.''Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep againbefore it's done.''Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse beganin a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; andthey lived at the bottom of a well--''What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest inquestions of eating and drinking.'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute ortwo.'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'dhave been ill.''So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways ofliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'Butwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?''Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can'ttake more.''You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to takeMORE than nothing.''Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herselfto some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, andrepeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and thensaid, 'It was a treacle-well.''There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but theHatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkilyremarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story foryourself.''No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. Idare say there may be ONE.''One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented togo on. 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,you know--''What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one placeon.'He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Haremoved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly tookthe place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got anyadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off thanbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began verycautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treaclefrom?''You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I shouldthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?''But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing tonotice this last remark.'Of course they were', said the Dormouse; '--well in.'This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on forsome time without interrupting it.'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbingits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner ofthings--everything that begins with an M--''Why with an M?' said Alice.'Why not?' said the March Hare.Alice was silent.The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off intoa doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again witha little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such asmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you saythings are "much of a muchness"--did you ever see such a thing as adrawing of a muchness?''Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don'tthink--''Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up ingreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, andneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though shelooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse intothe teapot.'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked herway through the wood. 'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in allmy life!'Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a doorleading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'Buteverything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And inshe went.Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the littleglass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door thatled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (shehad kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself atlast in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the coolfountains.CHAPTER VIII. The Queen's Croquet-GroundA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the rosesgrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busilypainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she wentnearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one ofthem say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me likethat!''I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged myelbow.'On which Seven looked up and said, 'That's right, Five! Always lay theblame on others!''YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. 'I heard the Queen say onlyyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!''What for?' said the one who had spoken first.'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was forbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjustthings--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watchingthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, andall of them bowed low.'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are paintingthose roses?'Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a lowvoice, 'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been aRED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queenwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At thismoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, calledout 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threwthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped likethe three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at thecorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over withdiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these camethe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears camejumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamentedwith hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and amongthem Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurriednervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by withoutnoticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King'scrown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grandprocession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her facelike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heardof such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the use ofa procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon theirfaces, so that they couldn't see it?' So she stood still where she was,and waited.When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and lookedat her, and the Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to theKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning toAlice, she went on, 'What's your name, child?''My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely;but she added, to herself, 'Why, they're only a pack of cards, afterall. I needn't be afraid of them!''And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners whowere lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on theirfaces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of thepack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, orcourtiers, or three of her own children.'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 'It's nobusiness of MINE.'The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for amoment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--''Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen wassilent.The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, mydear: she is only a child!'The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn themover!'The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the threegardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,the royal children, and everybody else.'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then,turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?''May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, goingdown on one knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--''I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of thesoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ranto Alice for protection.'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a largeflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for aminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after theothers.'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shoutedin reply.'That's right!' shouted the Queen. 'Can you play croquet?'The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question wasevidently meant for her.'Yes!' shouted Alice.'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,wondering very much what would happen next.'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She waswalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?''Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He lookedanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upontiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's undersentence of execution.''What for?' said Alice.'Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said"What for?"''She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a littlescream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightenedtone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and theQueen said--''Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, andpeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against eachother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the gamebegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground inher life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselvesup and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, underher arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had gotits neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog ablow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting outlaughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to beginagain, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolleditself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there wasgenerally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send thehedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting upand walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to theconclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrellingall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very shorttime the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, andshouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in aminute.Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had anydispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfullyfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any oneleft alive!'She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether shecould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearancein the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching ita minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.''How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouthenough for it to speak with.Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no usespeaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least oneof them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice putdown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very gladshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there wasenough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather acomplaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hearoneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea howconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's thearch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of theground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, onlyit ran away when it saw mine coming!''How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticedthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,'--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'The Queen smiled and passed on.'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and lookingat the Cat's head with great curiosity.'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me tointroduce it.''I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it maykiss my hand if it likes.''I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'He got behind Alice as he spoke.'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book,but I don't remember where.''Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he calledthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you wouldhave this cat removed!'The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and hehurried off.Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was goingon, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming withpassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to beexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the lookof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knewwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemedto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with theother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to theother side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helplesssort of way to fly up into a tree.By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fightwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn'tmatter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this sideof the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might notescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with herfriend.When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite alarge crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on betweenthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settlethe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as theyall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactlywhat they said.The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unlessthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such athing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could bebeheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in lessthan no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this lastremark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)Alice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess:you'd better ask HER about it.''She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.'And the executioner went off like an arrow. The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirelydisappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and downlooking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle's Story'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!'said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, andthey walked off together.Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thoughtto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her sosavage when they met in the kitchen.'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tonethough), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does verywell without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,'she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind ofrule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makesthem bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make childrensweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be sostingy about it, you know--'She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a littlestartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinkingabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can'ttell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it ina bit.''Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if onlyyou can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side asshe spoke.Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because theDuchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly theright height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was anuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so shebore it as well as she could.'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping upthe conversation a little.''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love,'tis love, that makes the world go round!"''Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody mindingtheir own business!''Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging hersharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moralof THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care ofthemselves."''How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to herself.'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,'the Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful aboutthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?''HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious tohave the experiment tried.'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. Andthe moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock together."''Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have ofputting things!''It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree toeverything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. Andthe moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the less there is ofyours."''Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.''I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of thatis--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put moresimply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it mightappear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwisethan what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise."''I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'ifI had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.''That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, ina pleased tone.'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' saidAlice.'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 'I make you a presentof everything I've said as yet.''A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't givebirthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to say it outloud.'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharplittle chin.'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning tofeel a little worried.'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; andthe m--'But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, evenin the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linkedinto hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queenin front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on theground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that inabout half no time! Take your choice!'The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice wastoo much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to thecroquet-ground.The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and wereresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurriedback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay wouldcost them their lives.All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling withthe other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with herhead!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that bythe end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all theplayers, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody andunder sentence of execution.Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Haveyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?''No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.''It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a goodthing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at thenumber of executions the Queen had ordered.They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.(IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazything!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the MockTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after someexecutions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone withthe Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but onthe whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to goafter that savage Queen: so she waited.The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen tillshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,half to itself, half to Alice.'What IS the fun?' said Alice.'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they neverexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!''Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowlyafter it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they camenearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. Shepitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and theGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all hisfancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyesfull of tears, but said nothing.'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know yourhistory, she do.''I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sitdown, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought toherself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' Butshe waited patiently.'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a realTurtle.'These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by anoccasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constantheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up andsaying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she couldnot help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and saidnothing.'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in thesea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--''Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtleangrily: 'really you are very dull!''You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poorAlice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon saidto the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'and he went on in these words:'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--''I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.The Mock Turtle went on.'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--''I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proudas all that.''With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.''And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle ina tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,"French, music, AND WASHING--extra."''You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom ofthe sea.''I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'Ionly took the regular course.''What was that?' inquired Alice.'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtlereplied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.''I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard ofuglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?''Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.''Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,you ARE a simpleton.'Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so sheturned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?''Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting offthe subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, withSeaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, andFainting in Coils.''What was THAT like?' said Alice.'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm toostiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.''Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.He was an old crab, HE was.''I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taughtLaughing and Grief, they used to say.''So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and bothcreatures hid their faces in their paws.'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry tochange the subject.'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and soon.''What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked:'because they lessen from day to day.'This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a littlebefore she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been aholiday?''Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decidedtone: 'tell her something about the games now.'CHAPTER X. The Lobster QuadrilleThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper acrosshis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute ortwo sobs choked his voice. 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,'said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him inthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tearsrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:--'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' saidAlice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'(Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, andsaid 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing aLobster Quadrille is!''No, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?''Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along thesea-shore--''Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--''THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.'--you advance twice--''Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--''--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--''The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.'--as far out to sea as you can--''Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildlyabout.'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the MockTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had beenjumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadlyand quietly, and looked at Alice.'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.'Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.'Very much indeed,' said Alice.'Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.'We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?''Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. 'I've forgotten the words.'So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now andthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving theirforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowlyand sadly:-- '"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail. "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance? "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!" But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance-- Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance. '"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied. "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side. The further off from England the nearer is to France-- Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"''Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feelingvery glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious songabout the whiting!''Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, 'they--you've seen them,of course?''Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she checked herselfhastily.'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, 'but if you'veseen them so often, of course you know what they're like.''I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. 'They have their tails intheir mouths--and they're all over crumbs.''You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would allwash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and thereason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell herabout the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobstersto the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a longway. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't getthem out again. That's all.''Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so muchabout a whiting before.''I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do youknow why it's called a whiting?''I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?''IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeatedin a wondering tone.'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, whatmakes them so shiny?'Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave heranswer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.''Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,'are done with a whiting. Now you know.''And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:'any shrimp could have told you that.''If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still runningon the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please: wedon't want YOU with us!"''They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'nowise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.''Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, andtold me he was going a journey, I should say "With what porpoise?"''Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. Andthe Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.''I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' saidAlice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday,because I was a different person then.''Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:'explanations take such a dreadful time.'So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she firstsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and openedtheir eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she wenton. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part abouther repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and thewords all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,and said 'That's very curious.''It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'Ishould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her tobegin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind ofauthority over Alice.'Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said theGryphon.'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, shegot up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the LobsterQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words camevery queer indeed:--  ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,  "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."  As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'       [later editions continued as follows  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]'That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' said theGryphon.'Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; 'but it soundsuncommon nonsense.'Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the nextverse.''But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. 'How COULD he turn themout with his nose, you know?''It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfullypuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'itbegins "I passed by his garden."'Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all comewrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--  'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'    [later editions continued as follows  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,  And concluded the banquet--]'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtleinterrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the mostconfusing thing I ever heard!''Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice wasonly too glad to do so.'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon wenton. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?''Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alicereplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,'Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her "Turtle Soup," will you, oldfellow?'The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes chokedwith sobs, to sing this:--   'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,   Waiting in a hot tureen!   Who for such dainties would not stoop?   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!   'Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,   Game, or any other dish?   Who would not give all else for two   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,     Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!''Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begunto repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in thedistance.'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurriedoff, without waiting for the end of the song.'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon onlyanswered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintlycame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--   'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when theyarrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of littlebirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave wasstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guardhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the courtwas a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get thetrial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But thereseemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything abouther, to pass away the time.Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had readabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knewthe name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said toherself, 'because of his great wig.'The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over thewig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he didnot look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'(she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them wereanimals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She saidthis last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud ofit: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of herage knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have donejust as well.The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are theydoing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to putdown yet, before the trial's begun.''They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'forfear they should forget them before the end of the trial.''Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stoppedhastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and theKing put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out whowas talking.Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nicemuddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alicecould not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, andvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quicklythat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make outat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he wasobliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this wasof very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and thenunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--   'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,      All on a summer day:    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,      And took them quite away!''Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a greatdeal to come before that!''Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew threeblasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in onehand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, yourMajesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finishedmy tea when I was sent for.''You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into thecourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think itwas,' he said.'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerlywrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, andreduced the answer to shillings and pence.'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made amemorandum of the fact.'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none ofmy own. I'm a hatter.'Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,who turned pale and fidgeted.'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll haveyou executed on the spot.'This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shiftingfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and inhis confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of thebread-and-butter.Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzledher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning togrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leavethe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was aslong as there was room for her.'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sittingnext to her. 'I can hardly breathe.''I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.''You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growingtoo.''Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in thatridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to theother side of the court.All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officersof the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' onwhich the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have youexecuted, whether you're nervous or not.''I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,'--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with thebread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--''The twinkling of the what?' said the King.'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do youtake me for a dunce? Go on!''I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled afterthat--only the March Hare said--''I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.'You did!' said the Hatter.'I deny it!' said the March Hare.'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.''Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, lookinganxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse deniednothing, being fast asleep.'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--''But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and wentdown on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed bythe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will justexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tiedup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,head first, and then sat upon it.)'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often readin the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attemptsat applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of thecourt," and I never understood what it meant till now.''If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued theKing.'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.''Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall geton better.''I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at theQueen, who was reading the list of singers.'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,without even waiting to put his shoes on.'--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of theofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could getto the door.'Call the next witness!' said the King.The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box inher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into thecourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.'Give your evidence,' said the King.'Shan't,' said the cook.The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.''Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes werenearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?''Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse!Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with hiswhiskers!'For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouseturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook haddisappeared.'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. 'Call the nextwitness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear,YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my foreheadache!'Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling verycurious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven'tgot much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, whenthe White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, thename 'Alice!'CHAPTER XII. Alice's Evidence'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment howlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in sucha hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and therethey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfishshe had accidentally upset the week before.'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, andbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident ofthe goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of ideathat they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, orthey would die.'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'untilall the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated withgreat emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had putthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving itstail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon gotit out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she saidto herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trialone way up as the other.'As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of beingupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back tothem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of theaccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to doanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of thecourt.'What do you know about this business?' the King said to Alice.'Nothing,' said Alice.'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They werejust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbitinterrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in avery respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went onto himself in an undertone,'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were tryingwhich word sounded best.Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing inhis note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'RuleForty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'Everybody looked at Alice.'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.'You are,' said the King.'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not aregular rule: you invented it just now.''It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider yourverdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the WhiteRabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been pickedup.''What's in it?' said the Queen.'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be aletter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.''It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written tonobody, which isn't usual, you know.''Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there'snothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, andadded 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.''Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen.'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thingabout it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The juryall brightened up again.)'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and theycan't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.''If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matterworse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed yourname like an honest man.'There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first reallyclever thing the King had said that day.'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even knowwhat they're about!''Read them,' said the King.The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, pleaseyour Majesty?' he asked.'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till youcome to the end: then stop.'These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--   'They told me you had been to her,    And mentioned me to him:   She gave me a good character,    But said I could not swim.   He sent them word I had not gone    (We know it to be true):   If she should push the matter on,    What would become of you?   I gave her one, they gave him two,    You gave us three or more;   They all returned from him to you,    Though they were mine before.   If I or she should chance to be    Involved in this affair,   He trusts to you to set them free,    Exactly as we were.   My notion was that you had been    (Before she had this fit)   An obstacle that came between    Him, and ourselves, and it.   Don't let him know she liked them best,    For this must ever be   A secret, kept from all the rest,    Between yourself and me.''That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said theKing, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--''If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so largein the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interruptinghim,) 'I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom ofmeaning in it.'The jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's anatom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world oftrouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at themwith one eye; 'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "--SAIDI COULD NOT SWIM--" you can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to theKnave.The Knave shook his head sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which hecertainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering overthe verses to himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, ofcourse--"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, that must be what hedid with the tarts, you know--''But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.'Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tartson the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHEHAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to theQueen.'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizardas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on hisslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastilybegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long asit lasted.)'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the courtwith a smile. There was a dead silence.'It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about thetwentieth time that day.'No, no!' said the Queen. 'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.''Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. 'The idea of having thesentence first!''Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.'I won't!' said Alice.'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobodymoved.'Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by thistime.) 'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down uponher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, andtried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with herhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some deadleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.'Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you'vehad!''Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told hersister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventuresof hers that you have just been reading about; and when she hadfinished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream,dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' SoAlice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,what a wonderful dream it had been.But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on herhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all herwonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, andthis was her dream:--First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tinyhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were lookingup into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see thatqueer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair thatWOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed tolisten, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creaturesof her little sister's dream.The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--thefrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--shecould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friendsshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queenordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-babywas sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashedaround it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of theLizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable MockTurtle.So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself inWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and allwould change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in thewind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattlingteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrillcries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, theshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (sheknew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowingof the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle'sheavy sobs.Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of herswould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she wouldkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of herchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, andmake THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps evenwith the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel withall their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

Yes, and beyond the mere list of casualties by fighting there areother matters to be considered. Food is scarce and of a poor quality, inHungary as elsewhere. The armies we can yet feed, but the home-staying menand the women and children are a growing difficulty. It becomes more andmore impossible to provide them with sufficient nourishment._The Emperor_. It is strange, but in Austria the conditions are said to beeven worse._Tisza_. You are right, Sire, they are worse, much worse._The Emperor_. Well, we must lose no time then. We must buy great stocks offood. More money must be spent._Tisza_. More money? But where is it to come from? Not from Hungary, wherewe are within a narrow margin of financial collapse, and not in Austria,where there is already to all intents and purposes a state of bankruptcy.More money is not to be got, for we have none ourselves and nobody willlend us any._The Emperor_. You paint the situation in dark colours, my friend TISZA._Tisza_. I paint it as it is, Sire, at any rate as I see it. It is not thepart of a Royal Counsellor to act otherwise._The Emperor_. Yes, but there might be others who would take a differentview, and support their belief with equally good reasons._Tisza_. Not if they know the facts and are faithful to their duty asMinisters of the State. Here and there, no doubt, might be found foolishand ambitious men who would be willing to deceive, first themselves andthen their Emperor, as to the true condition of affairs. But, if yourMajesty trusted them and allowed them to guide you, you would learn toolate how ill they had understood their duty. I myself, though determined todo everything in my power to promote the welfare of Hungary and its King,would willingly stand aside if you think that others would give you greaterstrength._The Emperor_. I have every reason to trust you most fully. Have you anyplan for extricating us from this dreadful morass of failure and difficultyinto which we are plunged?_Tisza_. Your Majesty, there is only one way. We must have peace, and musthave it as soon as possible._The Emperor._ I too think we must have peace, but how shall we obtain itwhen we have a friend and ally who watches us with the closest care, andwould not allow us even to hint at any steps that would really lead topeace?_Tisza_. Sire, you are a young man, but you are a scion of a great andancient House, which was powerful and illustrious when the Hohenzollernswere but mean and petty barbarian princelings. Withdraw yourself, while theopportunity is still with you, from the fatal domination of this vain andinflated upstart who endeavours to serve only his own selfish designs. Ourenemies will make peace with you, and thus he too will be forced to abandonthe War. With him and with the deeds that have outraged the world they willnot initiate any movement that tends to peace. He must go through hispunishment, as indeed we all must, but his, I think, will be heavier thanours._The Emperor_. Then you want me to make peace?_Tisza_.

She isfull of curiosity about--she calls it interest in--other people's affairs.When I told her I was going out to buy a birthday present she looked ratherstern. Said she:--"The giving of unnecessary presents has become a luxury which few of usnowadays think it right to afford."I didn't answer her because at the moment I could think of no reallyadequate reason why Bobbie _should_ have a present, except that I so verymuch wanted to give him one. Bobbie is tall and young and red-haired and,of course, khaki clad. We are going to be married "when the War is over."I pondered Sister Baynes' words until I reached Oxford Street, and thenforgot them in the interest of choosing the present. For a while Ihesitated between cigarettes and chocolates, and finally decided on thelatter. Bobbie is a perfect pig about sweets. I bought acomfortable-looking box, ornamented with a St. George, improbably attiredin khaki, slaying a delightful German dragon clad in blue and a Uhlanhelmet. St. George had red hair and a distinct look of Bobbie, which wasone reason why I got him.[Illustration: THE COMBINATION SCOOTER AND CARPET SWEEPER.BUY YOUR SERVANT ONE AND ADD A ZEST TO HER WORK.]This business accomplished, I thought I would call on a friend who livesnear by. She is middle-aged and rather sad, and spends her time pushingtrolleys about a munition works. Just now, however, I knew she had a coldand couldn't go out. I found her on the floor wrestling with brown paper,preparing a parcel for her soldier on Salisbury Plain. She adopted himthrough a League, and spends all her spare time and pocket-money in socksand cigarettes for him. She smiled at me wanly, with a piece of stringbetween her teeth, and I felt I simply must do something to cheer her up."I've brought you some chocolates for your cold," I said. "Eat one andforget the War and the weather," and I handed her Bobbie's box. Hernecessity, as someone says somewhere, seemed at the moment so much greaterthan his."You extravagant child!" she said, but her face lightened for an instant.She admired St. George almost as much as I had done, but, though shefingered the orange-coloured bow, she did not untie it, so I concluded shemeant to have an orgy by herself later on. We talked for a while, and thenI looked at the clock and fled for the hospital. She thanked me again forthe chocolates as I went; she really seemed quite pleased with them.Two days later Matron collared me in the passage and gave me a handful ofletters and things to distribute. There was a fat parcel for Martha, theward-maid. I found her in the closet where she keeps her brooms, and gaveit her. Her eyes simply danced as she took it, first carefully wiping herhand on her apron."It's from my bruvver," she explained. "'Im on Salisbury Plain. Very goodto me 'e always is." She stripped off the paper and gave a sigh of rapture."Lor, Nurse, ain't it beautiful?"It was a chocolate box, a comfortable-looking chocolate box, ornamentedwith a red-headed St. George, a large blue dragon and a vivid orange bow."It does seem nice," I agreed."Fancy 'im spending all that on me," said Martha."You'll be able to have quite a feast," said I, smiling at my old friendSt. George.Martha looked suddenly shy."I'm not going to keep it," she confided. She came closer to me. "Do youremember young Renshaw, what used to be in your ward, Nurse?"I nodded; I remembered him well, a cheery boy with a smashed leg, now in aConvalescent Home by the sea."'Im and me's engaged," said Martha in a hoarse whisper. "I liked 'im andhe liked me, and one day I was doing the windows 'e asked me. 'E says thefood down there is that monopolous, so I'll send him this 'ere just tocheer 'im up like."It seemed an excellent idea to me. I beamed upon Martha. I helped her tore-wrap St. George, and lent her my fountain-pen to write the address whichwas to send my Knight once more upon his travels. It appeared to me that heand his dragon were seeing a lot of life.Bobbie had arranged to call for me on his birthday, so when my off dutycame I simply flung on my things and raced for the hall. As I passedMatron's door she called me in. I entered trembling; it was always atoss-up with Matron whether you were to be smiled upon or strafed.To-day she was lamb-like. She sat at a desk piled high with papers. Amongthem lay a vivid coloured object."I've just had a letter from that young Renshaw," she said. "Such acharming letter, thanking us for all our kindness and enclosing a presentto show his appreciation." She smiled. She seemed hugely pleased aboutsomething. "He addresses it to me," she went on; "but, though I am gratefulfor the kind thought, I do not myself eat chocolates."She picked up the box, a comfortable-looking box ornamented with an orangesatin bow."I think these are more in your line than mine," she said, "and Renshaw wasin your ward. You have really the best right to them."She handed me the box of chocolates. I gazed at my travelled Saint and hegazed back. I could almost have sworn he winked.Clutching him and his dragon, I departed and danced down the corridor intothe hall. There waited Bobbie, red-haired and khaki-clad, more like St.George than the gallant knight himself."How do you do?" I greeted him. "Many happy returns, dear old thing!" As heheld out his hand I put something into it. "A box of chocolates," Iexplained; "I bought them for your birthday!"       *       *       *       *       *"Wanted, for Low Comedian, really Funny Sons."--_The Stage_.As a change, we suppose, from the eternal mother-in-law.       *       *       *       *       *[Illustration: _Inveterate Golfer_ (_stung by the leading article_).

A big white long-hairedbilly-goat he was, the same."I'll not be afther lavin him at the daypo," says Herself; "'tis no placefor a domestic animal at all, the language them little drummer-boys uses,the dear knows," says she.So me bowld mascot he stops up at the Castle and makes free with theflower-beds and the hall and the drawin'-room and the domestic maids theway he'd be the Lord-Lieutenant o' the land, and not jist a plain humanAngory goat. A proud arrygent crature it is, be the powers! Steppin' aboutas disdainy as a Dublin gerrl in Ballydehob, and if, mebbe, you'd addresshim for to get off your flower-beds with the colour of anger in your mouthhe'd let a roar out of him like a Sligo piper with poteen taken, and fetchyou a skelp with his horns that would lay you out for dead.And sorra the use is it of complainin' to Herself."Ah, Delaney, 'tis the marshal sperit widin him," she'd say; "we must bepatient with him for the sake of the owld rigiment;" and with that she'dstart hand-feedin' him with warmed-up sponge-cake and playin' with his longsilky hair."Far be it from me," I says to Mikeen, the herd, "to question the workingso' Providence, but were I the Colonel of a rigiment, which I am not, and_had_ to have a mascot, it's not a raparee billy I'd be afther havin', buta nanny, or mebbe a cow, that would step along dacently with the rigimentand bring ye luck, and mebbe a dropeen o' milk for the orficers' tea aswell. If it's such cratures that bring ye fortune may I die a peacefuldeath in a poor-house," says I."I'm wid ye," says Mikeen, groanin', he bein' spotted like a leopard withbruises by rason of him havin' to comb the mascot's silky hair twice daily,and the quick temper of the baste at the tangles.The long of a summer the billy stops up at the Castle, archin' his neck atthe wurrld and growin' prouder and prouder by dint of the standin' he hadwith the owld rigiment and the high-feedin' he had from Herself. Faith,'tis a great delight we servints had of him I'm tellin' ye! It was as muchas your life's blood was worth to cross his path in the garden, and if thedomestic maids would be meetin' him in the house they'd let him eat thedresses off them before they dare say a word.In the autumn me bowld mascot gets a wee trifle powerful by dint o' thehigh-feedin' and the natural nature of the crature. Herself, wid heriligant lady's nose, is afther noticin' it, and she sends wan o' the gerrlsto tell meself and Mikeen to wash the baste."There will be murdher done this day," says I to the lad, "but 'tis theorders--go get the cart-rope and the chain off the bull-dog, and we'll doit. Faith, it isn't all the bravery that's at the Front," says I."That's the true wurrd," says he, rubbin' the lumps on his shins, the poorboy."Oh, Delaney," says the domestic gerrl, drawin' a bottle from her apronpocket, "Herself says will ye plaze be so obligin' to sprinkle the mascotwid a dropeen of this ody-koloney scent--mebbe it will quench hispowerfulness, she says."I put the bottle in me pocket. We tripped up me brave goat with the rope,got the bull's collar and chain, and dragged him away towards the pond, himbuckin' and ragin' between us like a Tyrone Street lady in the arms of thepoliss. To hear the roars he let out of him would turn your hearts cowld aslead, but we held on.The Saints were wid us; in half-an-hour we had him as wet as an eel, andbroke the bottle of ody-koloney over his back.He was clane mad. "God save us all when he gets that chain off him!" Isays. "God save us it is!" says Mikeen, looking around for a tree to shin.Just at the minut we heard a great screechin' o' dogs, and through thefence comes the harrier pack that the Reserve orficers kept in the campbeyond. ("Harriers" they called them, but, begob! there wasn't anythin'they wouldn't hunt from a fox to a turkey, those ones.)"What are they afther chasin'?" says Mikeen."'Tis a stag to-day, be the newspapers," I says, "but the dear knowsthey'll not cotch him this month, he must be gone by this half-hour, andthe breath is from them, their tongues is hangin' out a yard," I says.'Twas at that moment the Blessed Saints gave me wisdom."Mikeen," I says, "drag the mascot out before them; we'll see sport thisday.""Herself--" he begins."Hoult your whisht," says I, "and come on." With that we dragged me bowldgoat out before the dogs and let go the chain.The dogs sniffed up the strong blast of ody-koloney and let a yowl out ofthem like all the banshees in the nation of Ireland, and the billy leggedit for his life--small blame to him!Meself and Mikeen climbed a double to see the sport."They have him," says Mikeen. "They have not," says I; "the crature howldsthem by two lengths.""He has doubled on them," says Mikeen; "he is as sly as a Jew.""He is forninst the rabbit holes now," I says. "I thank the howly Saints hecannot burrow.""He has tripped up--they have him bayed," says Mikeen.And that was the mortal truth, the dogs had him.Oh, but it was a bowld billy! He went in among those hounds like a lad to afair, you could hear his horns lambastin' their ribs a mile away. But theywere too many for him and bit the grand silky hair off him by the mouthful.The way it flew you'd think it was a snowstorm."They have him desthroyed," says Mikeen."They have," says I, "God be praised!"At the moment the huntsman leps his harse up on the double beside us; hewas phlastered with muck from his hair to his boots."What have they out there?" says he, blinkin' through the mud and notknowin' rightly what his hounds were coursin' out before him, whether itwould be a stag or a Bengal tiger."'Tis her ladyship's Rile Imperial Mascot Goat," says I; "an' God save yourhonour for she'll have your blood in a bottle for this day's worrk."The huntsman lets a curse out of his stummick and rides afther them, flaton his saddle, both spurs tearin'. In the wink of an eye he is down amongthe dogs, larruppin' them with his whip and drawin' down curses on themthat would wither ye to hear him--he had great eddication, that orficer."Come now," says I to Mikeen, the poor lad, "let you and me bear the cowldcorpse of the diseased back to Herself; mebbe she'll have a shillin' handyin her hand, the way she'd reward us for saving the body from the dogs,"says I.But was me bowld mascot dead? He was not. He was alive and well, thethickness of his wool had saved him. For all that he had not a hair of itleft to him, and when he stood up before you you wouldn't know him; he wasthat ordinary without his fleece, he was no more than a common poor man'sgoat, he was no more to look at than a skinned rabbit, and that's thetruth.He walked home with meself and Mikeen as meek as a young gerrl.Herself came runnin' out, all fluttery, to look at him."Ah, but that's not _my_ mascot," says she."It is, Marm," says I; and I swore to it by the whole Calendar--Mikeen too."Bah! how disgustin'. Take it to the cow-house," says she, and steppedindoors without another word.We led the billy away, him hangin' his head for shame at his nakedness."Ye'll do no more mascottin' avic," says I to him. "Sorra luck you wouldbring to a blind beggar-man the way you are now--you'll never step alongagain with the drums and tambourines."And that was the true word, for though Herself had Mikeen rubbing him dailywith bear's-grease and hair-lotion he never grew the same grand fleeceagain, and he'd stand about in the back-field, brooding for hours together,the divilment clane gone out of his system; and if, mebbe, you'd draw thestroke of an ash-plant across his ribs to hearten him, he'd only just lookat you sad-like and pass no remarks.       *       *       *       *       *TOP-O'-THE-MORNING.  Top-o'-the-Morning's shoes are off;    He runs in the orchard, rough, all day;  Chasing the hens for a turn at the trough,    Fighting the cows for a place at the hay;  With a coat where the Wiltshire mud has dried,    With brambles caught in his mane and tail--  Top-o'-the-Morning, pearl and pride    Of the foremost flight of the White Horse Vale!  The master he carried is Somewhere in France    Leading a cavalry troop to-day,  Ready, if Fortune but give him the chance,    Ready as ever to show them the way,  Riding as straight to his new desire    As ever he rode to the line of old,  Facing his fences of blood and fire  With a brow of flint and a heart of gold.  Do the hoofs of his horses wake a dream    Of a trampling crowd at the covert-side,  Of a lead on the grass and a glinting stream    And Top-o'-the-Morning shortening stride?  Does the triumph leap to his shining eyes    As the wind of the vale on his cheek blows cold,  And the buffeting big brown shoulders rise    To his light heel's touch and his light hand's hold?  When the swords are sheathed and the strife is done,    And the cry of hounds is a call to men;  When  the  straight-necked Wiltshire foxes run    And the first flight rides on the grass again;  May Top-o'-the-Morning, sleek of hide,    Shod, and tidy of mane and tail,  Light, and fit for a man to ride,    Lead them once more in the White Horse Vale!W.H.O.       *       *       *       *       *Polygamy in Workington."Supper was served by some of the wives of some of themembers."--_Workington News_.       *       *       *       *       *TRAGEDY OF A DUTIFUL WIFE.[Illustration: "I SAY, THAT MRS.

We are like theAllied Ministers who meet at Paris; we always "arrive at a completeunderstanding" in all matters of policy. When strict economy was enjoinedupon us I moved my desk into the dining-room to save a fire. She made asummer hat out of a bit of my old Panama, encased in the remnants of anevening gown. All was well.I should be giving you a wrong impression altogether if I were to suggestthat there was the slightest difference of opinion between us. I mostsolemnly declare that I am as good a patriot as she is. Still, as time goeson, I do feel a certain uneasiness, a suggestion of a new domestic elementthat needs watching.We are both in it, but the initiative rests with her. She asks me to taketwo Belgian refugees and the housemaid and the dog and the laundry-hamperalong with me in the two-seater to the station, to save petrol. Well, I amwilling. She fills the herbaceous border with alternating potatoes andcarnations. Well, I am more than willing. She bottles peas and beans. And Isay to you that I am proud and happy that she should think of these things.Above all she gets at the very root of the food problem. I should say thathere she has advantages over some, as I belong to the class of husbandknown as Easily Fed. She has got hold of a whole sheaf of leaflets from theWar Office or somewhere--"When is a pie not a pie?" "Leave out the egg;""How to make something out of something else," etc., etc.; and we feed onthose chiefly. She knows I don't like rabbits, and yet I am well aware thatrabbits are repeatedly insinuated in such forms as not to leave a singleclue. I cannot tell you how I admire and approve. Still it makes methoughtful sometimes.No doubt you will believe that we are being drawn together by sharing thesehardships. Well, yes. In a way. And yet I don't feel easy about it. We arequite in sympathy, but there is a difference in our point of view. Mine, Iaffirm, is the nobler. I economize, although I loathe it; while she, I amconvinced, is beginning to like it. I don't mean to say that she does it onpurpose, but that phrase may give you an idea what I mean. I sometimeswonder wistfully if the hand that put that ugly new steel contraption atthe back of the fire to save the coal is really the hand that I wooed andwon ten years ago. I see in her the steady growth of an implacableconscience. In moments of depression I have a horrid feeling that shealways wanted to do this sort of thing and never got a real chance tillnow.We were extraordinarily happy before the War. We were not at all hard upand we had no compunctions about spending money. But now--I wonder howlong the War will last? What I am afraid of is the formation of habits. Iam already guarding against it by talking about all the things that we aregoing to do after the War. She quite agrees with me about them, but sheisn't enthusiastic. I put my claims pretty high. The garden is to bereconstructed, and I am adding a wing to the house. We are going to travelfirst, and I am not sure that we shan't have a new cook. And we are to havean Airedale and an Axminster, and a Stilton and a new Panama.As a matter of fact that is all bluff on my part. I only want to havesomething in hand to bargain with. If I can ever get back to the _statusquo ante_ I will not ask for annexations.Well, that is how it is. Most eagerly do I fall in with her latestsuggestion that I should let her clean my flannel suit with benzine (Idon't like the smell of it) instead of getting a new one. Only I live in agrowing fear that the day when peace is signed in Europe will be the signalfor an outbreak of a new form of warfare in our happy home.       *       *       *       *       *[Illustration: _Mistress_ (_from upper window_).

ASQUITH DO?A famous story tells how a heckler once broke up a Liberal meeting byasking with raucous iteration, "What did Mr. GLADSTONE say in 1878?" orwhatever year it was. Nobody knew, and neither did the inquirer himself,but uproar followed and his end was achieved. Now had the question run,"What did Mr. GLADSTONE do?" how different a result! For Mr. GLADSTONE,apart from any trifles of statesmanship or legislation, did two pricelessthings, as I will show.Although, writes the Returned Traveller who in our last number was sounhappy about the deterioration that has come upon taxi-drivers, I leftEngland only in October last, I find it a changed place; but no change, noteven the iniquitous prices demanded by London's restaurateurs, or theincreased darkness, or the queer division of _hors d'oeuvres_ intohalf-courses and whole-courses (providing an answer at last to the patheticquery, "What is a sardine?" "A whole course, of course")--no change is sostriking as the fact that when a paper now refers to the PRIME MINISTER orthe PREMIER, it means no longer HERBERT HENRY but DAVID. In a world of fluxand mutability I had come to think of Mr. ASQUITH as a rock, a pyramid, apole-star. But, alas! even he was subject to alteration.Thinking earnestly upon his career I have realised bow sad it is that hehas bequeathed us no ASQUITH legend. Always reserved and intent, hediscouraged Press gossip to such a degree as actually to have turned thekey on the Tenth Muse. Everybody else might lunch at the hospitable boardin Downing Street, but interviewers had no chance. In vain did the Quexesof this frivolous city hope for even a crumb--there was nothing for them.Mr. ASQUITH came into office, held it, and left it without a singleconcession to Demos's love of personalia. He did not even wear comiccollars or white hats or a single eyeglass or any other grotesquelysignificant thing; and how much poorer are we in consequence and how muchpoorer will posterity be!Contrast the case of Mr. GLADSTONE, from whom anyone could draw a postcardand most people a chip of some recently-felled tree, and who is in my mindwonderful and supreme by reason of two inventions which, though no onewould ever guess them to be the result of a Prime Minister's cogitations,deserve the widest fame. Of these one was the product of his unaidedgenius; the other the result of the collaboration with his wife.Let us begin with the individual triumph.Everyone who has ever stayed under anyone else's roof, from adine-and-sleep at Windsor Castle to a week in lovely Lucerne, has beenconfronted, when packing-up time arrived, with the problem of the sponge.No matter how muscular the fingers that wring this article, no matter howthick and costly the rubbered receptacle that holds it, there is always thechance of dampness communicating itself to other things in the bag. Isn'tthere?How so to squeeze the sponge as to drive out the last drop of moisture wasthe problem before the massive intellect of the Grand Old Man. Need I saythat he solved it? His method, as he himself in his unselfish way, told oneof the diarists, possibly Sir M.E. GRANT-DUFF, possibly Mr. G.W.E.RUSSELL--I forget whom--was to wrap up the sponge in a bath-towel and jumpon it. Here, for the historical painter, is a theme indeed--something worthall the ordinary dull occasions which provoke his talented if somewhatstaid brush: the great Liberal statesman, the promoter of Home Rule, theauthor of _The Impregnable Rock of Holy Scripture_, leaping upon thebath-towel that held his sponge. But no historical painter could do justiceto such a scene. It needs the movies.Those of us then who dry our sponges in this way--and I am a ferventdevotee--owe the inventor a meed of praise. And equally those of us who putinto our hot water bottles at night hot tea instead of hot water (as Inever have done and never mean to do), so that, waking in the small hours,we may yet not be without refreshment, owe a meed of praise to the sameinspired innovator, for, if the chroniclers are correct, it was Mrs.GLADSTONE'S habit to retire to rest with a bottle thus nutritiously filled,which would be ready for her great man on his return from the House wearyand athirst.Here we see the difference between Liberal Premiers. For what has Mr.ASQUITH done towards the solution of domestic problems? Who can name athing? Has he devised a collar stud that cannot be lost? Has he hit upon away instantly to stop a shaving cut from bleeding? Has he contrived a taxiwindow that will open when shut or shut when open? No. In all these yearshe has spared no time for any inventions.No wonder then that he was found wanting and forced to resign.       *       *       *       *       *    A Scot among the Cynics.

(_By our Military Expert_.)The Macedonian Army has recently undergone an entire reconstruction at thehands of KING PHILIP. It is now organised on a national and territorialbasis and is divided into infantry and cavalry. The cavalry predominatesand is therefore the stronger arm. The unit of cavalry is the squadron, ofinfantry the battalion. (It is of the utmost interest to note that thereare two battalions in a regiment, each about fifteen hundred strong).KING PHILIP, it will be remembered, received his military education in theschool of EPAMINONDAS, who, as is well known, revolutionised the HigherThought of every Higher Command by the discovery and application of asingle tactical fact--namely, that the chances of A being able to give B astronger push than B can give him are _in direct ratio to the numericalsuperiority of A over B_. It follows, then, that, faced with a sufficientsuperiority, B _must_ retire, and _the initiative then rests with the sidethat possesses it_.In pursuance of this tactical ideal EPAMINONDAS argued that the old methodof winning battles, which was that A should exercise superior force againstevery point of B's line (or body), required that A should be bigger than B,buskin for buskin and brisket for brisket. But since it is sufficient,while "refusing" the rest of one's own body (or line), to bring anoverwhelming force to bear on the point of a person's jaw, in order todiscomfit him, so in a battle a numerically inferior A, by concentrating ona vital point of numerically superior B, can gain a local numericalsuperiority which will enable him to rout B utterly. (This is alwayssupposing that B is not doing the same thing himself on the other wing, inwhich case each army would miss the other altogether--a condition of thingsinto which the military art does not care to follow them).Hence the phalanx or "preponderating mass formation." The Macedoniandevelopment of this depends (to reduce the matter to the simple algebraicalformula to which all military problems are susceptible) on the fact that if_x_ equals the greatest efficiency of an army, and the rooted square ofstability to the _n_th rank equals the phalanx, then the rooted square ofstability to the _n_th rank equals _x_ minus the tangential curve ofvelocity of mobility. This should be plain even to the amateur student oftactics. Blending almost a military expert's appreciation of this cardinaldoctrine with his natural selfishness as a leader of cavalry, PHILIP hasgiven to this, the mobile arm, much of the striking power of the originalphalanx. This is now placed in the centre, its business being mainly toforce a salient in the enemy's line, the two resultant enclaves of whichcan then be shattered (at their re-entrants) by the cavalry squadrons,hurled forward on both phalanks. It should be noted, as a brilliant exampleof PHILIP'S staff work, that in the Macedonian Army, for the avoidance ofconfusion in the field, "phalanks" is now spelt "flanks."To the intelligent student who has followed me thus far in these articlesit should not be necessary to explain again the terms "enclave," "salient,"and "re-entrant." "Tactical" is a term used when one is not using the term"strategical," and _vice versa_.       *       *       *       *       *    "In the words of Bacon, it should be 'read, marked, learned and    inwardly digested.'"--_Financial Paper_.Our gay contemporary does not tell us whether it was before or aftercompleting the works usually attributed to SHAKSPEARE that BACON compiledthe Book of Common Prayer.       *       *       *       *       *THE FLAPPER.[Dr. ARTHUR SHADWELL, in the January _Nineteenth Century_, in his articleon "Ordeal by Fire," after denouncing idlers and loafers and shirkers,falls foul "above all" of the young girls called flappers, "with highheels, skirts up to their knees and blouses open to the diaphragm, painted,powdered, self-conscious, ogling: 'Allus adallacked and dizened oot and a'unting arter the men.'"]  Good Dr. ARTHUR SHADWELL, who lends lustre to a name  Which DRYDEN in his satires oft endeavoured to defame,  Has lately been discussing in a high-class magazine  The trials that confront us in the year Nineteen Seventeen.  He is not a smooth-tongued prophet; no, he takes a serious view;  We must make tremendous efforts if we're going to win through;  And though he's not unhopeful of the issue of the fray  He finds abundant causes for misgiving and dismay.  Our optimistic journals his exasperation fire,  And the idlers and the loafers stimulate his righteous ire;  But it is the flapper chiefly that in his gizzard sticks,  And he's down upon her failings like a waggon-load of bricks.  She's ubiquitous in theatres, in rail and 'bus and tram,  She wears her "blouses open down to the diaphragm,"  And, instead of realising what our men are fighting for,  She's an orgiastic nuisance who in fact _enjoys_ the War.  It's a strenuous indictment of our petticoated youth  And contains a large substratum of unpalatable truth;  Our women have been splendid, but the Sun himself has specks,  And the flapper can't be reckoned as a credit to her sex.  Still it needs to be remembered, to extenuate her crimes,  That these flappers have not always had the very best of times;  And the life that now she's leading, with no Mentors to restrain,  Is decidedly unhinging to an undeveloped brain.  Then again we only see her when she's out for play or meals,  And distresses the fastidious by her gestures and her squeals,  But she is not always idle or a decorative drone,  And if she wastes her wages, well, she wastes what is her own.  Still to say that she's heroic, as some scribes of late have said,  Is unkind as well as foolish, for it only swells her head;  She oughtn't to be flattered, she requires to be repressed,  Or she'll grow into a portent and a peril and a pest.  Dr. SHADWELL to the PREMIER makes an eloquent appeal  In firm and drastic fashion with this element to deal;  And 'twould be a real feather in our gifted Cambrian's cap  If he taught the peccant flapper less flamboyantly to flap.  But, in _Punch's_ way of thinking, 'tis for women, kind and wise,  These neglected scattered units to enrol and mobilize,  Their vagabond activities to curb and concentrate,  And turn the skittish hoyden to a servant of the State.  She's young; her eyes are dazzled by the glamour of the streets;  She has to learn that life is not all cinemas and sweets;  But given wholesome guidance she may rise to self-control  And earn the right of entry on the Nation's golden Roll.       *       *       *       *       *THE ONLY STEGGLES.Steggles is my groom, and my crowning mercy. But for his deafness I am surehe would long since have left the humble rank of gunner far beneath him,and the Staff might have gained a brilliant strategist. In addition todulness of hearing, Steggles is endowed--I should indeed be ungrateful touse the word afflicted--with a vacuity of expression which puts rivals orantagonists off their guard, and doubles his value during the vicissitudesof active service. What would be handicaps to ordinary men Steggles turnsto the advantage of himself, Sapphira my mare, and me.When on the march the Battery arrives at the morass allotted to it forhorse lines, I know that all will be well with the mud-bespatteredSapphira. Steggles leaps from the waggon whereon, in company with one ofthe cooks, he tours the pleasant land of France, and receives the mare.With his toes strangely pointed out, he leads her away from the scene oflabour and language, disappearing amidst the hovels of the adjacentvillage. Often I never see him or obtain news of him till next morning,when he produces Sapphira polished like a silk hat and every scrap of metalabout her sparkling. Occasionally I have tracked him to the shelter wherehe secretes and waits upon Sapphira, always to find that he has discoveredand occupied the best stable in the village. The grooms of mybrother-officers never learn that Steggles' vacuous expression is thedisguise of an intellect subtle, discriminating and alert, so they nevertrouble to endeavour to forestall him. To find Sapphira is to findSteggles, as he always likes to spread his blanket where she could tread onhim if she wanted anything during the night.From time to time he chooses the occasion of a night's halt on the march toindulge in a bilious attack; but he has no other vice except an inveteratereluctance to leave off polishing my boots when I mount. No matter howSapphira may prance and back and sidle, he follows her round and round witha remnant of a shirt, rubbing mud-spots off my boots in the stirrup. It isquite useless to bellow, "That will do, Steggles!"--his ideal is theunattainable perfection, and he persists. I have to escape by givingSapphira the spur at the risk of knocking Steggles into the mud, or be latein turning out.He never gives anything, even his own performances, unqualified praise; infact it is extremely hard to win from him any encomium higher than "It'snot too bad." Perhaps there is Scotch blood in his veins.I very much want to recommend him for some decoration, but the organizationlikely to appreciate the most gallant of his deeds has not yet beenformed--the S.P.G.P., or Society for the Preservation of GovernmentProperty.Steggles was once riding behind me down a valley liberally dimpled withshell-holes, further dimples being in process of formation as we rode. Iwas returning from an O Pip, or Observation Post, and Steggles was carryinga pair of my boots with a rolled puttee stuffed into each. Suddenly I wasaware that he had wheeled his horse about, and was trotting back towardsthe most dimply area of the valley. Out of regard for his family, Icantered after him. He broke into a gallop. When, after a thrilling ride, Icaught him and had a little talk amongst the dimples, it appeared that hehad dropped one of the puttees, and wished to return and look for it. Thisincident will, I think, demonstrate the exceptional character of the man,who did not appear to regard himself as a hero, or to pose as a desperate_farceur_, or to aspire to the post of Q.M.S., though, incredible as it mayseem, the puttee in question was of the variety G.S.       *       *       *       *       *[Illustration: _Orderly Officer_.

ALLEN AND UNWIN, _Battles and Bivouacs_, by JACQUES ROUJON, and_The Diary of a French Private_, by GASTON RIOU. M. ROUJON, infantryman ofthe line, was in private life a journalist on _Le Figaro_; M. RIOU, RedCross orderly, a liberal lay-theologian and writer of European reputation.The former's transliterator ("Munitions are distributed around," writes heundismayed; and has also discovered a territory known as "OrientalPrussia") obtrudes a little between author and reader. M. RIOU faresbetter; but both contrive to give a really vivid impression of the horrorsand anxieties of the early days of the War before the tide turned at theMarne, of the flying rumours so far from the actual truth, of the finespirit of _camaraderie_ in common danger, of the intimate relations betweenofficers and men, details, terrible or trivial, of campaigning, and,because our spirited brothers-in-arms are not ashamed to express theirinnermost feelings, of the deeper emotions at work under the surfacegaieties. M. RIOU'S narrative is mainly the record of his year's captivityin a Bavarian fort. On his way he faced the fanatical hatred and cruelty ofthe German civilians, of the women especially, with a cynical fortitude.The commandant of his prison, Baron von STENGEL, was, however, a gentlemanand a brick, and did everything in his power to make the difficult lifebearable. An episode pleasant to recall is the reception of the Russianprisoners (intended by their captors to cause dissensions) by their Frenchcomrades in misfortune. The whole record gives an impression of finecourage and resourcefulness.       *       *       *       *       *Very probably you are already acquainted with that restful and admirablebook, _Father Payne_ (SMITH, ELDER), of which a new edition has just nowbeen published. The point of this new edition is that, in its specialPreface, the genesis and authorship of the book are assigned, for the firsttime on this side the Atlantic, to Mr. A.C. BENSON. And the point of thenew preface is that it entirely gives away the original edition (alsoprinted here), in which the secret was elaborately concealed. My wonder is,reading the book with this added knowledge, that anyone can have at anytime failed to detect in it the gently persuasive hand of the Master ofMagdalene, Cambridge. You remember, no doubt, how _Father Payne_ (acourtesy title), having had a small estate left to him, proceeded to turnit into the home of a secular community for young men desirous of pursuingthe literary gift, and how he financed, encouraged and generally supervisedthem. Leisure, an exquisite setting, and the society of enthusiastic andpersonally-selected youth--one might call the book perhaps a Tutor's Dreamof the Millennium. Anyhow, _Father Payne_, as shown in this volume, whichis practically a record of his table-talk upon a great variety of themes,is exactly the gentle, shrewd and idealistic philosopher whom (knowing hisparentage) one would expect. Bensonians (of the A.C. pattern) willcertainly be glad to have what must surely have been their suspicionsconfirmed, and to admit _Father Payne_ to the shelves of authenticity.       *       *       *       *       *Miss DOROTHEA CONYERS has long ere this established herself as a specialistof repute in Irish sporting tales. You will need but one look at thepicture wrapper of _The Financing of Fiona_ (ALLEN) to see that arepetition of the same agreeable mixture awaits you within. _Fiona_ was acharming young woman (Irish, of course) with a rich uncle and a poor, veryunattractive cousin, who loved her for her expectations. As _Fiona_ had noconception about money beyond the spending of it, the uncle made a will,whose object was that she should have plenty. The suitor, however, knowingof this, and being a naughty, rather improbable person, destroyed part ofit, with the result that _Fiona_ was apparently left only the ancestralhome and no cash to keep it up. So she was forced to take in gentlemanboarders for the hunting, and (for propriety's sake) to invent a mythicalchaperon, who lived above stairs. And, after all, she needn't have done anysuch thing, because the rich uncle, in leaving her all the contents of themansion, had foolishly forgotten to mention a secret drawer full ofCanadian securities. As for the villain, I really hardly dare tell you theimpossibly silly way in which he allowed himself to be caught out. But ofcourse all this melodrama is not what matters. The important thing aboutMiss CONYERS' people is that (whatever their private worries) a-huntingthey will go; and _Fiona_, financed by her paying guests, shows in thisrespect as capital sport as any of her predecessors. For the rest, I canhardly say with honesty that the story is equal to its author's best form.       *       *       *       *       *What I like particularly about Mr. FREDERICK NIVEN is the friendly way inwhich he contrives to make his readers and himself into a family party. "Wemust," he writes at the beginning of a chapter in _Cinderella of SkookumGreek_ (NASH), "get a move on with the story, in case you become more tiredof Archer's compound fracture than he was himself." This is by no means theonly occasion on which he shows his thoughtfulness for us, and I think itvery kind and nice of him. At the same time I will ungraciously admit thatthe weak point of his story is that it does not move quite fast enough.Admirable artist in psychology and atmosphere, his plot, if you can call ita plot, is very slight. _Cyrus Archer_, the young American of the compoundfracture (who had my sympathy from the start because he could neverremember dates), goes out into the back of beyond for a spell beforesettling down to married life and a place in his father's business, and atSkookum Creek, where he grows tomatoes and studies Indians, he meets his_Cinderella_, with the result that his life has to be completelyrearranged. A commonplace tale, but there is a rare and distinct flavourabout the telling of it. Mr. NIVEN'S manner has indeed a very particularcharm, over which one would take an even keener pleasure in lingering ifonly he himself lingered a little less over his story.       *       *       *       *       *I hardly think that Madame ALBANESI has chosen quite the most appropriatename for the story that she calls _Hearts and Sweethearts_ (HUTCHINSON).Personally, I fancy that _Suits and Lawsuits_ would have come nearer themark; because, though there is a certain proportion of love-making in thetale, there is considerably more about going to law. One difficulty withwhich I fancy the writer had to contend is due to the fact that her heroand heroine are (in a sense) the opposing protagonists in a case ofdisputed succession; _Jemima Frant_ being engaged in the attempt to turnout _Sir John Norminster_ from his estates and establish the claim to themof her dead sister's child. Naturally, therefore, till this is settledtheir opportunities for the tender passion are, to put it very gently,restricted. But of course--well, a novel with such a title is hardly likelyto leave anybody of importance unmarried at the final page. Before this isturned, you have some pleasant comedy of London in war-time, and meet anumber of agreeably sketched persons, whose conversation may amuse you, or,on the other hand, may cause you to wish them a little less discursive.Madame ALBANESI indeed impressed me as having occasionally turned hersubordinate characters loose into a chapter, with instructions to fill itup anyhow, while she herself thought out the next move. But the law wasalways leisurely, so this characteristic might perhaps be expected in astory so much concerned with it.       *       *       *       *       *[Illustration: _The Mother_ (_overhauling little Tommy's wardrobe_).
